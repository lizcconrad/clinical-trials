  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are no data available regarding the effect of vorapaxar on clot generation
      kinetics or TIP-FCS when added to standard of care antiplatelet regimens. Potential reduction
      of TIP-FCS and clot generation kinetics by vorapaxar may assist in our understanding of the
      mechanism of action and in personalizing therapy in high risk patients to effectively reduce
      recurrent thrombotic event occurrences. The objective of this study is to determine onset-,
      maintenance-, and offset-effect of vorapaxar on platelet-fibrin clot generation kinetics by
      thrombelastography (R, TIP-FCS, TG) and thrombin generation kinetics (Lag time, peak thrombin
      production, time to peak thrombin generation, and endogenous thrombin potential) in
      antiplatelet na√Øve patients and patients on mono and dual antiplatelet therapy. This is a
      phase IV, prospective cohort (4 groups), non-randomized, open label, pharmacodynamics, and
      safety investigation.
