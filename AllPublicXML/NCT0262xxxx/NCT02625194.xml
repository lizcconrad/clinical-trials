      This study investigate the utility of continuous oxygen insufflation during fiberoptic
      bronchoscope-guided intubation.

      One group receives oxygen via suction channel of fiberoptic bronchoscope during intubation.

      The other group does not receive oxygen during fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided intubation.

      Then, the velocity of deoxygenation difference of PaO2(baseline

      Fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided intubation is a gold standard for intubation of a patient with
      anticipating difficult airway. This technique takes several minutes without oxygen supply,
      which results in hypoxia when it prolonged. If continuous supply of oxygen during procedure
      improve the oxygenation, we can reduce the risk of hypoxemia and increase the safety margin
      during procedure.

    <time_frame>from mask removal to 1st manual ventilation after intubation, up to 5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>After administration of anesthetic agents and manual ventilation of 5 minutes, arterial blood sampling is collected. Then bronchoscope-guided intubation performed and arterial blood sample is collected immediately after the intubation completed. Time for intubation (between 1st and 2nd blood sample) is recorded. The difference of PaO2(before &amp; after intubation) is divided by the time taking for intubation.</description>
