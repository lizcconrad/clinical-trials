      The purpose of the study is to study the combination of Sofosbuvir in Combination With
      Daclatasvir or Simeprevir for 12 Weeks in Non-cirrhotic Subjects Infected With Chronic
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 1.

    <textblock>
      In this open-label, single-center, head-to-head non-inferiority trial, treatment-naive or
      pegylated interferon treatment-experienced patients with GT1 infection were randomized to
      receive once-daily SOF 400 mg plus DCV 60 mg or SIM 150 mg for 12 weeks.
