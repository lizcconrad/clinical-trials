  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 trial consisting of 24 patients receiving the combination of dabrafenib +
      trametinib + pembrolizumab in 3 different dosing schemes and 8 patients receiving
      pembrolizumab standard monotherapy. All patients start with pembrolizumab standard therapy
      for 6 weeks and will then be randomized to continue pembrolizumab monotherapy or to receive
      additional intermitted/short-term dabrafenib + trametinib.

      Stratification will be baseline LDH level and baseline PD-L1 expression.
