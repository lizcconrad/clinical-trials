    <textblock>
      Our overall hypothesis is that a sudden ambulatory load reduction (caused by HTO) leads to
      changes in cartilage biology that delay or reverse osteoarthritic processes determining the
      clinical outcome and representing an in vivo model for assessing cartilage
      mechanosensitivity.

      Although osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease and despite
      international research efforts, to date the factors involved in the initiation and
      progression of this debilitating disease are poorly understood, diagnostic markers are
      lacking and there is no cure. High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a well-accepted therapy for
      patients with knee OA and varus alignment aimed at re-establishing a more even distribution
      of ambulatory load between the affected medial knee compartment and the lateral knee
      compartment. However, the survival rate of HTO is only around 75% after 5 years. There is
      some evidence that the change in ambulatory load after HTO may be more relevant than the
      post-operative static alignment although this relationship has not yet been investigated.
      Because of the large changes in ambulatory load with HTO, the investigators propose that HTO
      may serve as a valuable model for studying the effect of changes in ambulatory load on in
      vivo cartilage mechanobiology in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Our previous work has
      shown that serum biomarkers for cartilage increase after a 30-minute walking exercise (termed
      'walking stress test') and indicated that these changes may be associated with the
      accumulated ambulatory load during the test.

      Patients with medial compartment knee OA and varus alignment will be clinically assessed
      (including mechanical axis measurement from radiographs) and complete questionnaires on
      physical function prior to medial opening wedge HTO. Patients will complete a walking stress
      test with blood sampling to assess load-induced changes in serum biomarker concentrations,
      and undergo gait analysis to assess the external knee adduction moment. Once full load
      bearing is achieved, the mechanical axis will be measured from radiographs. Patients will
      complete the questionnaires and a second walking stress test with blood sampling and undergo
      gait analysis 6 months after HTO. At the 12-month follow-up, subjects will complete the
      questionnaires.
