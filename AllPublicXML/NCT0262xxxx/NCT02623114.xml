  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to identify genetic, brain morphologic, and environmental
      biomarkers that contribute to the pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators planned to recruit ADHD and healthy controls from the age of 6 to 17.

      Genetic data including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, neurotropic factors,
      glutamate-related genes will be genotyped.

      Environmental disruptors including phthalate and cotinine will be analyzed. Brain MRI data
      including T1, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) will be
      obtained.

      Neuropsychological tests including continuous performance test, Stroop test, Children's color
      trail test, Wisconsin card sorting test will be conducted.

      The investigators plan to identify biomarkers of ADHD using an integrative approach of
      genetic, environmental, neuroimaging and clinical data.

    <description>Changes in the Parent rated ADHD-Rating Scale - IV (ADHD-RS), which is an 18 item scale, with 9 items assessing inattention and 9 items assessing hyperactivity/impulsivity. It is the most widely used scale to measure symptom severity of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</description>

    <measure>Treatment response measured by CGI-I score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) scale is a clinician rated scale used to measure improvement in symptoms. It ranges from 1 to 7, with 1 meaning very much improved, and 7 meaning very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Treatment response measured by changes in CPT score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The continuous performance test (CPT) is an objective measurement of ADHD symptom severity. It is a computerized test and the results are presented in 4 variables : omission errors, commission errors, response time, response time variability.</description>
