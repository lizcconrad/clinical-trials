    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial compares two systemic treatments for HER2-positive breast
      cancer. The treatments are given either prior to breast surgery (as neoadjuvant treatment) or
      after breast surgery (as adjuvant treatment). In the investigational group (Group A) the
      study participants will receive a combination of two drugs directed at HER2 (two anti-HER2
      antibodies) plus a chemotherapy agent (docetaxel) for a brief duration, and the patients
      allocated to the comparator group (Group B) will be treated with chemotherapy plus one
      anti-HER2 treatment (trastuzumab) for one year.

      In this study, patients who have been diagnosed with HER2-positive early breast cancer will
      be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either three 3-weekly cycles of trastuzumab,
      pertuzumab and docetaxel (TPD) for a total duration of 9 weeks, followed by three further
      cycles of chemotherapy (Group A) or three 3-weekly cycles of trastuzumab and docetaxel (TD)
      followed by three further cycles of chemotherapy and single-agent anti-HER2 antibody
      treatment to complete one year of anti-HER2 treatment (Group B). These systemic treatments
      may be administered either prior to breast surgery (as neoadjuvant treatment) or after breast
      surgery (as adjuvant treatment). The study participants are required to have histologically
      verified breast cancer with a moderate to high risk for breast cancer recurrence despite
      macroscopically complete surgery for the breast tumor. The moderate/high risk of breast
      cancer recurrence is defined by presence of cancer in the axillary lymph nodes, or if the
      axillary lymph nodes do not contain cancer, by presence of a tumor larger than one centimeter
      in the breast. The study patients are followed up during the study treatments and after their
      completion with physical examination, blood tests, cardiac tests and, whenever indicated,
      with imaging. Approximately 700 patients will be randomly allocated to each of the two
      groups. The study hypothesis is that the regimen containing TPD may be more effective than
      the Group B treatment despite its brief duration.
