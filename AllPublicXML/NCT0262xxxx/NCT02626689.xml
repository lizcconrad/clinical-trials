  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, prospective, observational study implemented in β-thalassemia treatment
      centers from 5 countries (Italy, Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, and Thailand). Approximately one to
      two study sites will be identified per country and approximately 20 β-thalassemia subjects
      will be enrolled per country (10 transfusion dependent (TD) and 10 Non-transfusion dependent
      (NTD) with a total of approximately 100 subjects. This study will not interfere with or
      influence the routine clinical management of β-thalassemia patients. Outcomes of interest
      will be collected prospectively for up to 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Physical component score (PSC) over the study period versus the country specific population norms using the 36-item Short Form (SF-36) Quality of Life instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the total scores over the study period using the The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-An questionaire is used to assess leath-related quality of life (HRQol). It measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning. The overall score range for the FACT-An is 0-188. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL. In addition to general HRQoL, the FACT-An measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning. Patients with higher hemoglobin levels and better performance status reported significantly higher scores on these instruments (including the newly created subscales) than did those with lower hemoglobin levels and poorer performance status</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the total scores over the study period using the Tran-QOL questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Tran Qol is a new disease specific QOL measure for adults with B-Thalassemia with a score ranging from 0-100. It measures the quality of life issues of patients with B-Thalassemia by assessing physical health, emotional health, family functioning and school/career functioning. Higher scores indicate better health related quality of life (HRQOL). A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement in overall HRQol.</description>

    <measure>Change in the total scores over the study period using the Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaire in non-transfusion dependent (NTD) subjects</measure>
