  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two arms (arm I and arm II). In arm I, participants diagnosed
      with ADD/ADHD. In arm II, healthy participants.

      The status of the participants will be evaluated with questionnaires computerized test and
      EEG characteristics will be collected for all study participants. .
