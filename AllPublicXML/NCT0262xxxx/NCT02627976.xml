  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common complication of breast conserving therapy is breast edema, which may lead to chronic
      pain, but also reduced quality of life (QoL) and poor cosmetic outcome. When pain is present
      most patients are currently treated with physical therapy, but evidence of its effectiveness
      is still low and a gold standard does not yet exist. A downside of physical therapy is that
      patients have to undergo the therapy regularly and treatment might even has to continue for
      years after symptoms and treatment started. Another treatment option is a compression vest
      with the potential, apart from reducing symptoms, to improve self-efficacy in patients
      because they decide when to wear it without the need to visit therapists. However
      effectiveness of the compression vest has not yet been objectified in studies.

      The aim of this pilot study is to study if there is an effect on pain, QoL and the amount of
      breast edema of wearing a compression vest, in order to determine whether a large randomized
      study is feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, a maximum of 40 patients with symptomatic breast edema after surgery
      and/or radiotherapy for breast cancer are offered treatment with a compression vest. These
      patients will be followed for 6 months. Recruitment will continue until 20 active vest users
      are participating.

      Primary endpoint is the course of patient reported pain over a 6 month period. Secondary
      endpoints are the course of degree of breast edema and quality of life over a 6 month period.

      Patients who are wearing the vest may experience relief of breast edema related symptoms. In
      terms of burden, they might experience a tight feeling on the skin while wearing the vest,
      which could also be the case when treated with compression therapy and taping by a physical
      therapist. This tight feeling can be overcome by changing the vest to a larger size. All
      patients will fill out questionnaires upon inclusion, at 2 weeks, and 1, 3 and 6 months. This
      will take approximately 10-15 minutes per follow-up moment. Patients will have to visit the
      hospital at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months after they started wearing the vest (i.e. 25
      minute consult with physical examination, photo documentation of the breast and short basic
      follow-up questions), and it is expected that additional measurements for fitting a new
      compression vest will need to be taken 2-5 times during participation in the study. Those
      fitting measurements will be performed at a location as desired by the patient (e.g. UMC
      Utrecht or at patients' home).
