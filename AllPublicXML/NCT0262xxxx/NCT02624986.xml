  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, mutlicenter, non-randomized, study to evaluate the safety, efficacy,
      and pharmacokinetics of idasanutlin in combination with obinutuzumab in participants with R/R
      FL and rituximab in combination with idasanutlin in R/R DLBCL. The study will include an
      initial dose-escalation phase followed by an expansion phase. The dose-escalation phase is
      designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for idasanutlin in combination with
      obinutuzumab for FL and in combination with rituximab for DLBCL. The expansion phase is
      designed to further assess the safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with
      idasanutlin at the RP2D with the selected regimen in participants with R/R FL and of
      rituximab in combination with idasanutlin at the RP2D in participants with R/R DLBCL.
