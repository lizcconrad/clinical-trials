    <textblock>
      This is a 4-week, five-arm, randomized, controlled trial to compare a standard wellness
      incentive program for physical activity to four other designs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits including lower risk
      of cardiovascular disease. However, many individuals do not achieve physical activity goals.
      Vitality is a wellness program in South Africa that uses a program called &quot;Active Rewards&quot; to
      incentives achievement of weekly physical activity goals. In this study, the investigators
      will compare the standard active rewards program to doubling the magnitude or adding lottery
      designs with and without broadcasting the # of winners.
