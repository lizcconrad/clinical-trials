      Periodontal Diseases are considered the sixth complication of Diabetes Mellitus (DM). This
      close relationship between both diseases is characterized by mutual influence. The presence
      of DM might impair prognosis of diverse dental treatments due to its inflammatory nature,
      negative influence on wound healing, on bone biology, and the establishment of infections.
      Consequently, knowledge of new dental therapies and the biology of dental treatments for
      chronic periodontitis in diabetic patients can enhance quality of life and make these
      treatments more adequate for this common profile of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a global epidemic. Its complications can have a significant
      impact on quality of life, longevity, and costs in public health. The World Health
      Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2030, 439 million people will suffer from diabetes,
      around 10% of the world adult population (WHO, 2011). Periodontal Diseases are considered the
      sixth complication of DM. This close relationship between both diseases is characterized by
      mutual influence. Thus, an appropriate control of periodontal disease may facilitate the DM
      control, improving quality of life on diabetes patients. Besides that, the presence of DM
      might impair prognosis of diverse dental treatments due to its inflammatory nature, negative
      influence on wound healing, on bone biology, and the establishment of infections.
      Consequently, knowledge of new dental therapies and the biology of dental treatments for
      chronic periodontitis in diabetic patients can enhance quality of life and make these
      treatments more adequate for this common profile of patients. Therefore, the aim of the
      present study is to investigate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy as
      adjunct to full-mouth debridement for the treatment of periodontitis in type 2 diabetic
      patients through a split-mouth randomized triple-blind clinical trial.

    <description>After ultrasonic debridement, one randomly selected periodontal pocket received an additional aPDT performed by a trained operator (NMRBA). One pocket with probing depth ≥ 5mm in each patient was randomly selected to aPDT. After washing the pocket with saline solution, the photosensitizer (methylene blue 10mg/ml) was applied to the bottom of the pocket in a coronal direction. Following this, the pocket was exposed to a diode laser light with a fibre optic application for 1 min (Thera Lase DMC - Brazil), with wavelength of 660nm, power of 60mW and fluency of 129J/cm2.</description>
