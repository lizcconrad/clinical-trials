  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigator' s study designed to investigate effect of general and regional anesthesia on
      fracture healing.The 40 age and older ASAI-III patients who will operate due to femur
      fracture (except femur neck fracture) will be enrolled in this study after informed consent
      approval.

      Subjects will be divided into two groups by a computerized randomization method. 40 patients
      will be enrolled in this study. General anesthesia will perform for 20 patients. Regional
      anesthesia will perform for 20 patients. Preoperative, 4. week and 12. weeks laboratory test
      which include blood and urine β-C terminal telopeptid (β-CTX), blood alkaline phosphatase and
      osteocalcin will test for all patients. All patients will not use nonsteroid
      anti-inflammatory drugs during study neither perioperative nor postoperative periods.
      fracture healing will be asses with clinical evaluation and laboratory tests.

      Investigator' s study designed to investigate effect of general and regional anesthesia on
      fracture healing.The 40 age and older ASAI-III patients who will operate due to femur
      fracture (except femur neck fracture) will be enrolled in this study after informed consent
      approval.

      Subjects will be divided into two groups by a computerized randomization method. 40 patients
      will be enrolled in this study. Each group will have 20 patients. However a pilot study will
      perform for each groups with 10 patients. In Group G, all patients will be applied general
      anesthesia and 2 mg/kg propofol and 0,6 mg/kg rocuronium will administer to patients for
      induction of anesthesia. Maintenance of anesthesia will be made with %50-%50 O2/N2O and %2
      sevoflurane. 0,1 mg/kg morphine will be held on last 10 minutes of operation for
      postoperative analgesia. Also, patient controlled analgesia with morphine(1 mg bolus and 20
      min lockout time) will apply for postoperative analgesia. If it is necessary additional
      analgesic will provide with 100 mg peroral and intravenous tramadol. Regional anesthesia will
      perform for 20 patients which named Group R. In Group R combined epidural-spinal anesthesia
      will perform. Spinal %5 bupivacain 15 mg and 20µg fentanyl will apply and analgesia will
      provide with epidural bupivacain. Preoperative, 4. week and 12. weeks laboratory test which
      include blood and urine β-C terminal telopeptid (β-CTX), blood alkaline phosphatase and
      osteocalcin will all patients. All patients will not use nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs
      during study neither perioperative nor postoperative periods. Fracture healing will be asses
      with clinical evaluation and laboratory tests. All measurements will be assessed with
      statistically.

    <description>General Anesthesia: Effect of general anesthesia will compare with regional anesthesia without use of nonsteroid antiinflammatory drug usage. Propofol 2mg/kg and rocuronium will be administered to patients for anesthesia induction. Anesthesia maintenance will ensure with sevoflurane %2 and N2O/O2 %50/50 mixture.</description>
