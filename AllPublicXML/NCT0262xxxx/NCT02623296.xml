  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 period cross-over,
      drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of GLPG1205 or
      placebo (daily from Day 1 to Day 12) on a single dose pharmacokinetic profile of a cocktail
      of CYP450 substrates administered to healthy male subjects. The cocktail of CYP450 substrates
      will consist of 10 mg warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), 20 mg omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) and
      100 mg caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate).

      Fourteen healthy male subjects will receive during two treatment periods from Day 1 to Day 12
      a daily dose of GLPG1205 or placebo. On Day 13, a single dose of the cocktail of CYP450
      substrates will be co-administered either with GLPG1205 or with placebo. The two treatment
      periods will be separated by a wash-out period of at least 28 days.

      Also, the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of GLPG1205 administered with or
      without a cocktail of CYP450 substrates in healthy male subjects will be evaluated.
