  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By 2015 half of the people living with HIV infection in the U.S. are estimated be over the
      age of 50, and this cohort of patients with well-controlled plasma viremia is aging at a more
      rapid pace than their non-HIV peers. Long-term chronic inflammation plays a critical role in
      premature aging in HIV-infected adults. Markers associated with chronic inflammation,
      including IL-6, CRP, sCD14 and d-dimer, have not only been shown to be present at higher
      levels in HIV-infected adults, but are also correlated to a wide variety of morbidities and
      mortality. The goal of this project is to determine the impact of two different interventions
      -- Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Health Enhancement Program (HEP) -- on
      reducing biological markers associated with chronic inflammation in HIV-infected adults with
      an undetectable HIV viral load. In order to achieve this goal, a pilot RCT with 120 subjects
      over 50 years old who are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will be conducted with the
      following specific aims: 1) to assess the effect of MBSR and/or HEP on biomarkers of chronic
      inflammation (IL-6, CRP, sCD14, d-dimer), and, 2) to explore whether changes in psychological
      well-being (anxiety, depression, fatigue, cognitive functioning) mediate the impact on
      chronic inflammation. Subjects will be randomized to participation in a group MBSR course or
      to the HEP group both of which consist of 8 weekly sessions followed by 6 monthly booster
      sessions. Three time points will be measured: baseline, 8 weeks (immediately after completion
      of weekly intervention), and 6-months post-completion of weekly intervention. Mixed linear
      and structural equation model will be used to test the study hypotheses. The proposed study
      is innovative in that it is the first to explore the impact of a complementary mind-body
      intervention on chronic inflammation in HIV-infected adults. Given that the consequences of
      early aging in this cohort will be a burden on the health care system as well as a medical,
      social and psychological burden on those living with HIV, the study has the potential to have
      a major public health impact.

    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be the first to examine any form of alternative or complementary
      holistic therapy in older long-term HIV-infected persons with well-controlled plasma viremia.
      It will also be the first mind-body study of HIV-infected adults to be conducted using the
      most rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. From a translational medicine
      perspective, this study is innovative in that it examines a comprehensive set of biological
      markers specifically associated with chronic inflammation. No previous mind-body study has
      specifically targeted a set of biological markers that not only have been proven to be
      elevated in adults with HIV, but also been described as predictors of morbidity and overall
      mortality. This would be the first study to explore whether improvements in markers of
      psychosocial stress mediate the impact of the proposed interventions on chronic inflammation.

      This study is innovative in its effort to move HIV care beyond the current focus on virologic
      control, optimization of comorbid conditions, and encouragement of healthy lifestyle to
      include active interventions that can address the state of chronic inflammation and immune
      dysfunction underlying the early and accelerated aging process. Most bio-behavioral research
      in HIV to date has understandably focused on patients with poor adherence to HIV medication
      and treatment. This study is novel in its focus on highly adherent patients and the
      significant changes in profiles of biological markers associated with chronic inflammation
      documented in this cohort. The complementary medicine approach being studied has the
      potential to be integrated into the existing healthcare paradigm for HIV-positive persons.

      Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: To assess the effect of MBSR and HEP on biomarkers of chronic inflammation (IL-6, CRP,
      sCD14, d-dimer), in HIV-infected adults with well-controlled plasma viremia.

      Aim 2: To explore whether changes in markers of psychosocial well-being (anxiety, depression,
      fatigue, cognitive functioning) mediate the impact of these mind-body interventions on
      chronic inflammation.

      General Study Design: The proposed study is a prospective, randomized, clinical trial with
      attention control under the direction of the dual PIs, a behavioral scientist and a
      virologist. The study team is also made up of investigators from infectious diseases,
      mind-body medicine, geriatrics, and biostatistics. Subjects will be randomized to
      participation in an 8-week group MBSR course or to the Health Enhancement Program (HEP). The
      study population will consist of 120 individuals, 50 years old or older, long-term (5 years
      on ART or longer) HIV-infected adults with well-controlled plasma viremia and baseline IL-6
      level of 1.17 pg/mL or greater. Randomization will be stratified to achieve balanced
      distribution between the groups based on gender and study site. One cohort group will
      participate in the 8-week MBSR course followed by six, once-per-month booster sessions, and
      separate cohort group will participate in HEP, with additional monthly educational meetings
      for six months. Both groups will be evaluated using two sets of measures: biological markers
      associated with chronic inflammation (IL-6, CRP, sCD14, d-dimer) and measures of psychosocial
      stress (anxiety, depression, fatigue, and mindfulness). Subjects will be assessed at three
      time points: baseline, 8 weeks (immediately after completion of weekly interventions), and
      6-months post weekly courses (immediately after completion of booster sessions). The
      investigators will use mixed linear and structural equation model to test study hypotheses.

Informal Mindfulness Meditation Practices (mindfulness in everyday life) include: 1) awareness of pleasant and unpleasant events, and, 2) deliberate awareness of routine activities and events such as eating, weather, walking, and interpersonal communication. Daily home assignments include a minimum of 30 minutes daily formal mindfulness practices and 5-15 minutes informal practice, 6 days per week for the entire duration of the course. Course sessions will consist of discussions oriented around weekly homework assignments, including an exploration of obstacles, and development of self-regulatory skills and capacities.</description>

    <description>HEP is an active control that matches MBSR in non-specific factors, such as the amount of time participants interact, but does not include mindfulness practice as an active component. HEP instructors will be selected from experts in the areas covered: music, nutrition education, and, functional movement. The study's RC will coordinate HEP sessions and monitor attendance. Following the 8-week HEP protocol, subjects will meet monthly in 1.5-hour educational sessions to match the booster sessions of MBSR participants.</description>
