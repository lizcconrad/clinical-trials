      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given
      together with rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide (R-ICE) and to see how well they
      work in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has returned after a period
      of improvement and that has not responded to previous treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and lenalidomide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving lenalidomide with R-ICE may be a better
      treatment for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the addition of lenalidomide to
      the R-ICE chemoimmunotherapy regimen (lenalidomide-rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide
      [R2ICE]) for the treatment of primary-refractory/first-relapse B-cell lymphoma. (Phase I) II.
      To determine if the addition of lenalidomide (based on dose determination from phase I) to
      the R-ICE chemoimmunotherapy regimen (R2-ICE) would lead to clinically meaningful improvement
      in the overall response rates (ORR) for patients with first-relapse/refractory diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of the addition of lenalidomide to RICE on the number (percentage)
      of patients proceeding to stem cell transplant (SCT).

      II. To evaluate the effect of the addition of lenalidomide to RICE on other surrogate outcome
      measures including complete metabolic response (CMR) rate and overall survival.

      III. To describe the toxicities associated with the addition of lenalidomide to the R-ICE
      chemoimmunotherapy regimen (R2ICE).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate ORR based on germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) versus non-GCB subtypes.

      II. To evaluate ORR based on percent standardized uptake value (SUV) reduction and percent
      anatomic size reduction on interim positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
      (CT) scans.

      III. To evaluate ORR based on minimal residual disease (MRD) detection (positive versus [vs.]
      negative) and quantification after 2 cycles of treatment.

      IV. Future tissue and blood based studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-14, rituximab intravenously (IV) on
      day 1, ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 2, carboplatin IV over 1-2 hours on day 2, and
      etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving CMR, partial
      metabolic response (PMR), or no metabolic response (NMR) may receive 2 more courses per
      physician discretion. After completion of 2 cycles of R2ICE treatment, patients achieving
      objective status of CMR, PMR or NMR may proceed to SCT during the event monitoring phase.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.

             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: patients known to be
             HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are
             eligible for this trial; patients with HIV on antiretroviral therapy other than
             zidovudine (AZT) and/or stavudine and without prior acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
             (AIDS) defining conditions and adequate CD4 count (&gt; 400) are eligible

          -  History of myocardial infarction =&lt; 180 days prior to registration or congestive heart
             failure requiring use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular
             arrhythmias

          -  Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for
             the primary neoplasm; patients must be &gt;= 2 weeks from prior anti-lymphoma therapy;
             the use of steroids and/or rituximab up to 1 week prior to registration for management
             of symptoms is allowed

          -  Other active malignancy =&lt; 3 years prior to registration; EXCEPTIONS: non-melanotic
             skin cancer, carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix, or any cancer that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, has been treated with curative intent and will not interfere with
             the study treatment plan and response assessment; NOTE: if there is a history of prior
             malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment such as radiation,
             chemotherapy, or immunotherapy for their cancer

          -  Unable or unwilling to take any prophylaxis; patients with history of or new/active
             deep vein thrombosis/embolism/thrombophilia are allowed to participate if they are on
             appropriate therapeutic anticoagulation during the treatment on the trial; these
             patients would not need the aspirin with the lenalidomide unless clinically indicated;
             therefore, patients must be able and willing to receive anticoagulation (prophylaxis
             versus therapeutic as clinically indicated)

          -  History of radiation therapy to &gt;= 25% of the bone marrow for other diseases

          -  Receiving erythroid stimulating agents (epoetin alfa [EPO]: Procrit, Aranesp)

          -  Patients with active or prior central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or cerebrospinal
             fluid involvement with malignant lymphoma cells; NOTE: these patients are usually
             treated with CNS directed therapy; screening for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/CNS
             involvement is NOT required but can be performed per treating medical doctor (MD)
             discretion

          -  Active hepatitis B as defined by seropositivity for hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg); subjects with positive hepatitis B core antibody titers and normal liver
             transaminases are allowed provided that antiviral prophylaxis is administered per
             institutional guidelines; NOTE: subjects with hepatitis C antibody will be eligible
             provided that they do not have elevated liver transaminases or other evidence of
             active hepatitis
