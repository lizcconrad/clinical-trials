  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called eribulin combined with standard treatment as a
      possible preoperative treatment for HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied..

      Eribulin works by interfering with cancer cell division, growth, and spread.

      The goal of this research study is to evaluate inflammatory breast cancer's response to
      treatment with eribulin followed by AC chemotherapy when given as a preoperative chemotherapy
      treatment for participants with HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Participants must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer. All histologic
        subtypes are eligible.

        -- Patients must NOT have HER2 positive status based on ASCO/CAP guidelines defined as: IHC
        3+ based on circumferential membrane staining that is complete, intense and/or

        FISH positive based on one of the three following criteria:

        Single-probe average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals/cell; OR Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio
        &lt;2.0 with an average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals/cell; OR Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio
        ≥2.0

          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of eribulin in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this
             study

          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥70%, see Appendix A)

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal creatinine ≤1.5 ×
                  institutional upper limit of normal

                  --- OR

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          -  Patients must have the clinical diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer as evidenced
             by the onset of signs and symptoms noted below within a 6 month time-period:

               -  Erythema of the breast

               -  Edema of the skin of the breast

               -  Enlargement of the breast

          -  Patients must be without evidence of visceral or bone involvement with metastatic
             cancer on physical exam or any diagnostic study. Extensive nodal involvement is
             allowed.

          -  LVEF &gt; 50% calculated by echocardiogram (ECHO)

          -  Patients may have bilateral breast cancer so long as one breast meets criteria for
             inflammatory breast cancer, and neither breast cancer has received prior therapy.

          -  The effects of eribulin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of eribulin administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Because
             breast cancer predominantly affects females, it is anticipated that male enrollment
             will be &lt; 5% of the overall study population.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Patients with evidence of metastatic disease involvement in viscera or bone.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to eribulin or other agents used in study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because eribulin is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with eribulin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with eribulin. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this
             study.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with eribulin. In addition, these
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  A baseline corrected QT interval of &gt; 470 ms.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Patients may not have received paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or cyclophosphamide as
             anti-neoplastic therapy.
