      The investigators will retrospectively examine all patients with out-of-hospital
      resuscitation by the emergency medical Team (EMT) from the Kantonsspital Winterthur in the
      year 2013 with a one year follow-up and a structured interview about Quality of life.
      Furthermore, the costs generated by the local health system are analysed.

      The Primary objective of this study is to evaluate the Quality of out-of-Hospital
      resuscitation by the ambulance Service from the Kantonsspital Winterthur including a 1-year
      follow-up of the survivors. In this follow-up we evaluate the Quality of life by a validated
      questionnaire.

      The following endpoints will be retrospectively analysed:

      time-to-Response Interval; Initial cardiac rhythm; medications given; number of
      Defibrillations; return of spontaneous circulation, Overall costs for the local health System

      Furthermore length of hospital-stay, survival until Hospital discharge, one-year survival,
      Quality of life one year after resuscitation and total costs will be analysed.
