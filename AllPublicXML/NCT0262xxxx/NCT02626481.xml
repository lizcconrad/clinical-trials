  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Multicentre, Open-label, Phase II study of Daratumumab and Dexamethasone in
      MM patients. Eligible patients must have a symptomatic RRMM with a measurable disease,
      resistant or refractory to Bortezomib and Lenalidomide and Pomalidomide.

      There is no dose escalation phase, as the MAxiamal Tolerated Dose (MTD) and drug scheduling
      have already been determined in previous phase 1-2 dose escalation studies. There is no
      randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common haematological malignancy (after
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), representing 1% of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. Despite
      the increased efficacy of first-line agents, the majority of patients will eventually relapse
      and become resistant to all classes of available therapies. With over 15,000 deaths from MM
      expected in 2014 in the United states of America (USA) alone, there remains a need for novel
      therapies for the treatment of refractory MM that can improve outcome Daratumumab is an IgG1ĸ
      human mAb that specifically recognizes the CD38 epitope. Daratumumab binds to the C-terminus
      of CD38. It is produced in a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. Standard
      mammalian cell culture and purification technologies are employed in the manufacture of
      Daratumumab. Daratumumab targets directly the tumour cells by selectively binding to CD38
      receptors, present in high levels on malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma. While
      binding of Daratumumab antibody to CD38 in vitro has some effect on enzyme activity
      (inhibiting cyclase and stimulating hydrolase activity), the main effect of Daratumumab
      antibody binding to CD38+ myeloma cell lines is lysis and cell death through complement
      dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), through antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or
      antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP), or by direct apoptosis following crosslinking of
      the antibody molecules. These mechanisms are likely to be involved in Daratumumab activity in
      vivo, although the primary mechanism of action in patients is not fully elucidated.
      Importantly, Daratumumab-induced ADCC and CDC was not affected by the presence of bone marrow
      stromal cells, indicating that Daratumumab can effectively kill MM tumour cells in a
      tumour-preserving bone marrow microenvironment. In vivo, Daratumumab was highly active and
      interrupted xenograft tumour growth at low dosing. Daratumumab has demonstrated activity in
      myeloma as a single agent in small phase I/II studies and in combination with Lenalidomide
      and Dexamethasone where it enhanced the potency of other MM drugs such as Lenalidomide
      offering an interesting alternative to chemotherapy in myeloma.

             sterilization, ovulation inhibitory progesterone only pills, or sexual intercourse
             with a vasectomized male partner (vasectomy must be confirmed by 2 negative semen
             analyses). Or women will commit to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed to her
             physician on a monthly basis. Childbearing potential*. Contraception will start during
             therapy including dose interruptions, for 4 months after discontinuation of
             Daratumumab.

               -  Criteria for women of childbearing potential :

        This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who:

          1. has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or

          2. has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not
             rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had
             menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) 12. A woman of childbearing
             potential must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy tests at Screening, first
             within 28 days prior to dosing and the second within 48 hours prior to dosing, and
             remain on a highly effective method of birth control. The two methods of reliable
             contraception must include one highly effective method and one additional effective
             (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive
             methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional
             effective methods of contraception:

               -  Highly effective methods:

                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

                    -  Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants)

                    -  Tubal ligation

                    -  Partner's vasectomy

               -  Additional effective methods:

                    -  Male condom

                    -  Diaphragm

                    -  Cervical Cap 13. Serum (urine in the case where serum is not possible in a
                       timely manner) pregnancy test to be performed for all women of childbearing
                       potential regularly during the study,. In addition, a pregnancy test may be
                       done at any time during the study at the discretion of the investigator if a
                       subject misses a period or has unusual menstrual bleeding.

                       14. A woman of childbearing potential must remain on a highly effective
                       method of birth control. Contraception must begin 4 weeks before initiating
                       treatment with Daratumumab, during therapy, during dose interruptions and
                       continuing for 4 months following discontinuation of Daratumumab. Reliable
                       contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of
                       infertility, unless due to hysterectomy.

                       15. A man who has not had a vasectomy and who is sexually active with a
                       woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of birth
                       control eg, condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all
                       men must also not donate sperm during the study, for 4 months following
                       discontinuation of Daratumumab. The exception to this restriction is that if
                       the subject's female partner is surgically sterile, a second method of birth
                       control is not required.
