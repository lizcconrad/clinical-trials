  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective observational study of SNIPPV use in preterm infants of less than 32weeks of
      gestation from January 2012 to December 2015. Previous respiratory status is analyzed as well
      as respiratory outcomes and possible secondary side effects.

      SNIPPV is used to prevent Intubation in Infants in which nCPAP has already failed (Infants
      that met intubation criteria) and also is used electively for extubation when nCPAP
      extubation has previously failed or infants with Prolonged mechanical ventilation (more than
      15 days) with high respiratory parameters (PMAP &gt; 10 cmH2O and FiO2&gt;35%).

        Prospective observational study of SNIPPV use in preterm infants of less than 32 weeks of
        gestation from January 2012 to December of 2014.

        SNIPPV is used for:

          -  nCPAP failure: Preterm infants supported with nCPAP that meet intubation criteria
             (FiO2&gt;50%; apnea spells more than 4/h or more than 1 that needs PPV) if they are in a
             stable situation. SAP (systemic arterial pressure)&gt; P10 with preserved respiratory
             drive (no more than 6 apneas episodes per hour or more than 2 requiring PPI).

          -  Electively For extubation:

               -  Preterm infants in which nCPAP extubation has previously failed or Prolonged
                  mechanical ventilation (more than 15 days) with high respiratory parameters (PMAP
                  &gt; 10 cmH2O and FiO2&gt;35%).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Preterm Infants of less than 32 weeks of GA in which SNIPPV is applied for nCPAP
             failure.

          -  Preterm Infants of less than 32 weeks of GA in which SNIPPV is applied electively for
             extubation.
