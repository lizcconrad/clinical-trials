  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the influence of increased sedentary time on long-term measures
      of muscle protein synthesis and metabolic health. The investigators will test the hypothesis
      that increased time spent in sedentary behaviours will lead to a reduction in long-term
      measures of muscle protein synthesis and compromised metabolic health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass with age, is thought to be accelerated by an inactive,
      sedentary lifestyle. Increased sedentary time has consistently been associated with lower
      muscle mass and compromised metabolic health. However, there is currently a lack of direct
      evidence to support these associations.

      Therefore, this study will investigate whether increased sedentary time (reduced step count
      and exercise cessation) directly influences long-term measures of muscle protein synthesis
      and metabolic health in young, active adults. Following a 7 day period of normal habitual
      physical activity, participants will undertake a 7 day period of step reduction and exercise
      cessation. It is hypothesised that 7 days of increased sedentary time will result in a
      reduction in long-term rates of muscle protein synthesis and a worsening of metabolic health.
