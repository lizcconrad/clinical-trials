      Conduct human trials in the endoscopy suite of our continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      ventilator approach using an FDA approved ventilator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study procedures will be performed in adult patients following informed consent at the
      endoscopy suite of the University of Utah Health Sciences Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. A
      ventilation mask will be placed on the patient's face and connected to the ventilator.
      Supplemental oxygen will be delivered by the ventilator through the mask; the concentration
      of oxygen delivered will be left to the clinician's discretion. A modified mask with multiple
      small leaks will be used with a standard elastomeric H-strap to secure it to the patient's
      face.

      The endoscopy suite nurse and technicians will attach all clinically necessary standard
      sensors and connect them to the patient and monitoring system. Height, weight, and neck
      circumference will be measured and recorded digitally on an encrypted laptop. In addition to
      the standard of care monitors, the investigators will collect data from additional
      non-invasive modalities and save the data to a laptop using custom software for later
      analysis.

      Pressure and flow sensors included in the ventilator will be used to monitor the patients'
      tidal volumes and respiratory rate during the procedure. The data that will be collected and
      recorded on the laptop will include: RIP data, mask pressure, flow, and breath rate. An
      additional flow sensor will be placed in line with the ventilator.

      The objective of this study is threefold: Demonstrate in patients undergoing procedural
      sedation (e.g., for colonoscopy) that obstructive apnea can successfully be avoided by
      stenting the airway open using CPAP, demonstrate that we can successfully detect periods of
      zero ventilation, and demonstrate the functionality of the modified standard mask.
