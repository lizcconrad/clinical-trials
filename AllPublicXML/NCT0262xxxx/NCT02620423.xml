  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1b study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of
      REOLYSIN® in combination with chemotherapy and pembrolizumab is effective and safe in the
      treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reovirus Serotype 3 - Dearing Strain (REOLYSIN®) is a naturally occurring, ubiquitous,
      non-enveloped human reovirus. It's primary mode of activity is to infect and selectively
      target tumors with activating Ras pathway mutations. Up to 70% of pancreatic cancers have
      activating Ras pathway mutations and/ or over-expressions.

      This is an open label, Phase 1b study of REOLYSIN® and chemotherapy in combination with
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) histologically confirmed
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma that progressed after (or did not tolerate) first-line therapy. It
      is thought that Reovirus when combined with chemotherapy would lead to increased viral
      replication and oncolysis preferentially in RAS activated tumors, with resulting immunogenic
      response than can be further enhanced by checkpoint inhibition using pembrolizumab. The study
      is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN® given intravenously in
      combination with one of the three chemotherapy backbone regimens, Gemcitabine, Irinotecan or
      Leucovorin/ 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and pembrolizumab, the treatment cycle of which will be
      repeated every 3 weeks. It will follow a 3+3 design with no dose escalations. 3 patients will
      be initially enrolled. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed, the cohort will be
      expanded. Provided patients do not develop intolerable toxicity (that does not respond to
      either supportive care or dose reduction) or clinically meaningful disease progression,
      treatment with additional cycles may be continued so long as patients experience clinical
      benefit in the judgement of the Investigator.
