  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether intervention strategies targeted at the level
      of the environment (e.g. improving access to community based leisure groups, transportation)
      can successfully promote the community participation experiences of community-dwelling older
      adult Manitobans who use wheelchairs in the winter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence to support that community-dwelling older adults who are able to
      maintain their involvement in social, recreational, spiritual and physical activities
      experience positive effects on their health and quality of life. While winter creates
      challenges to community participation for many Manitobans, these difficulties are magnified
      for older adults and particularly for older adults who use wheelchairs. The aim of this study
      is to explore ways to improve or maintain community participation of community-dwelling older
      adults who use wheelchairs in the winter. Using a single-subject design, five older adult
      Manitobans who are wheelchair users will each select three community-based participation
      goals to work on throughout the winter months. Each older adult participant will work with an
      occupational therapist to receive individually-focused interventions aimed at increasing his
      or her community participation. The investigators will use a client-centered outcome measure
      designed to detect changes in performance and satisfaction in the goals that the individual
      has self-identified as being important to him or her, yet difficult to perform. The findings
      of this study will help determine the feasibility of conducting a larger scale study that
      would include a greater number of older adult Manitobans. Older adult wheelchair users in
      Manitoba bear a disproportionate burden in the winter when aging, mobility limitations, and
      weather coincide to create conditions that make community participation exceedingly
      difficult. It is important to the health and well-being of older adult Manitobans to find
      effective ways to promote community engagement throughout the winter months.

    <measure>Change in occupational performance using the The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) at 5 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial and 5 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a client-centered outcome measure designed to detect changes in performance and satisfaction in occupations that the individual has self-identified as being important and difficult to perform. The COPM has well-established psychometric properties and will be used as the primary outcome measure and will be used to set treatment goals, determine baseline stability, and detect change in performance of, and satisfaction with, the goals.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-report health status using the WHO-DAS2 at 5 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial and 5 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO-DAS 2.0 25 is a generic self-report health status measure, linked to the concepts of health and disability outlined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and is intended to identify limitations in six domains, including self-care, and community and social functioning experienced over the past 30 days. The WHO-DAS 2.0 is responsive to change, has excellent internal consistency, established content validity, and high convergent validity. The WHO-DAS 2.0 will be used to identify changes in overall health status that occur through the study.</description>
