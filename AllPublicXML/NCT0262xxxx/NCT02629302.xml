  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effects of animal-assisted therapy on patients with severe
      disorders of consciousness. The focus lies on the short-term biopsychosocial effects that
      occur when animals are present during therapy sessions in comparison to therapy sessions
      without animals, observing a group of 10 patients during 16 therapy sessions.

      While half of the sessions are held in presence of an animal and half without, they are as
      comparable as possible with respect to content and setting. In this study, patients in a
      minimal conscious state are recruited.

      This pilot study is designed as a controlled cross-over, within-subject trial with repeated
      measurement. The experimental condition is the standardised therapy session using therapy
      animals (AAT), while the control condition is the comparable &quot;standard&quot; therapy session
      without the presence of an animal.

      Over a period of four weeks, patients have four standardised therapy sessions per week, that
      alternate in a way that two sessions in two consecutive weeks are similar except for one is
      with the presence of animals and one without. In this way, data is collected over 16 therapy
      sessions (8 experimental, 8 control) for each patient.

      Each therapy session lasts about 20 minutes.

      The study takes place at REHAB Basel. Animal-assisted therapies are held in a special room at
      REHAB Basel in the presence of one or more small animals that will be selected by the
      therapist.

      Patients are allocated randomly to start with either the experimental or the control
      condition.
