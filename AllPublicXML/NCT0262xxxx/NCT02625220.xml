      Non-randomized, single-masked, 2-visit, bilateral wear, single-arm dispensing study to
      evaluate the visual acuity, rotational performance, lens fit, stability and subjective
      characteristics of a senofilcon-based JJVCI investigational toric contact lens design.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Eyes With Monocular Visual Acuity Better Than 20/40</measure>
    <time_frame>7 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Monocular visual acuity was assessed using distance Snellen visual acuity. Visual Acuity data was dichotomized such that 'response=1' if a subjects has 20/40 or better and 'response=0' if subject has worse than 20/40. The proportion of eyes with 20/40 or better was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Proportion of Eyes With Absolute Rotation Less Than or Equal to 10 Degrees</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute rotation was measured using a slit lamp. Absolute rotation measured at 15-minute post insertion was categorized into a binary outcome as 'response=1' if the absolute rotation is less than or equal to 10 degrees or 'response=0' otherwise. The proportion of eyes with absolute rotation less than or equal to 10 degrees was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Eyes With Lens Stability With Blink Within 5 Degrees</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Lens stability with blink was measured using a slit lamp. The rotational stability of the lens during a series of normal (unforced) blinks was measured for both eyes. The data was dichotomized as 'response=1' if the lens stability was less than or equal to 5 degrees or 'response=0' otherwise. The proportion of eyes with rotational stability of 5 degrees or lower was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subject Eyes With Acceptable Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minute Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of contact lens fit was assessed via slit lamp and was reported as a binary response as Acceptable or Unacceptable. The proportion of eyes with acceptable fit was reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult males or females that are ≥18 years of age and ≤39 years of age.

          -  The subject must read, understand, and sign the Statement of Informed Consent and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          -  The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          -  The subject must be a habitual toric contact lens wearer. Habitual wearer is defined
             as someone who wears toric lenses for at least 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for the
             past 30 days.

          -  Subject's vertex corrected spherical component of their distance refraction must be
             between -1.50 Diopters Sphere (DS) to -4.00 DS (inclusive) in each eye.

          -  Subject's vertex corrected refractive cylinder must be between -0.75 and -1.50
             Diopters Cylinder (DC) (inclusive) in each eye.

          -  Subject's refractive cylinder axis must be within 180±15° and 90±15° in each eye.

          -  If needed, the subject must have a wearable pair of spectacles with 20/30 or better
             vision Ocular Uterque (OU). If spectacles are not needed, the subject must have 20/40
             or better vision OU without correction.

          -  Subject's best corrected distance acuity must be 20/25-2 or better in each eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             hyperthyroidism, recurrent herpes simplex/zoster, Sjogren's syndromes, xerophthalmia,
             acne rosacea, and/or Stevens-Johnson syndromes, by self-report.

             immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV), by self-report.

          -  Habitual wearer of extended wear contact lenses.

          -  Any previous history of ocular and/or refractive surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,

             report.

          -  History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus, by self-report.

          -  Habitual wearer of rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, orthokeratology lenses, or hybrid

             classification scale.

          -  Any history of a contact lens-related corneal inflammatory event within the past year
             that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any active ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.
