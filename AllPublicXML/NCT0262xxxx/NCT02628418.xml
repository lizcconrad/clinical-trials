    <textblock>
      Hand recovery following cerebral stroke is complex and requires intensive training. The
      investigators aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of robot-assisted hand
      rehabilitation compared to physiotherapist-guided treatment in recovering dexterity and hand
      strength in hospitalized sub-acute hemiplegic patients. Design. 30 patients affected by
      stroke from cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage (Ashworth spasticity index &lt;3) were randomized.
      Patients in the Treatment group received intensive hand training with Gloreha, a hand
      rehabilitation glove that provides computer-controlled, repetitive, passive mobilization of
      the fingers, with multisensory feedback. Patients in the Control group received conventional
      intensive hand rehabilitation under physiotherapist guidance. Hand motor function (Motricity
      Index, MI), fine manual dexterity (Nine Hole Peg Test, NHPT) and strength (Grip and Pinch
      test) were measured at baseline and after rehabilitation, and the differences between final
      and basal results were compared between groups.

      Upper limb recovery, particularly that of the hand, is complex in patients with cerebral
      stroke and requires an intensive approach.

      Regarding upper limb rehabilitation, several research groups have developed robotic devices
      to provide passive and/or active movements. Their use appears to reduce the motor deficit of
      the arm and affected hand and to improve hand function both at the wrist and fingers. Hence,
      the evidence supporting specific robot-assisted rehabilitation of the hand is very promising
      even if further study is required.In particular, evidence is limited about the benefit of
      passive exercises and mobilization of the hemiplegic upper limb following stroke, and further
      research is called for.

      In this study the investigators used Gloreha, a new hand rehabilitation glove that provides
      computer-controlled, repetitive and passive mobilization of the fingers, with multi-sensory
      feedback. The purpose of the study was to evaluate in the rehabilitation of patients with
      ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in the sub-acute phase: 1) the feasibility of this new
      neuromotor rehabilitation device 2) its efficacy in improving arm function abilities, and 3)
      the costs involved.

      Post-stroke patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation between May 2013 and January 2014
      were screened for enrollment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned, following a simple
      randomization procedure (computerized random numbers) conducted independently of the study
      investigators, to Treatment group or Control group, on a 1:1 ratio.

    <time_frame>Baseline and end of the study after 30 sessions, an average of 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motricity Index, a measure of the motor function of the paretic upper limb. Motricity Index used to measure the ability to activate a muscle group to move a body segment through a range of motion and resist external force. The upper extremity motricity index includes: 1. pinch grasp, 2. elbow flexion, and 3. shoulder abduction.
The total upper extremity score involved adding one to the sum of the three actions.
The score of each action ranges from 0 (no ability) to 33 (maximal ability) with a maximum possible score=100.</description>

    <description>The Arm disability was assessed of the study with the Quick version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick-DASH) questionnaire.
The Quick-DASH is a 19-item ordinal scale with a 5-level rating of items from 1 (no difficulty) to 5 (unable to do).
Quick-Dash can be divided into an 11-item (abilities and symptoms) and an 8-item optional work module and sports/performing arts module. In the 11-item sub-scale, the subject defines the ability to perform some actions (8 items) and the intensity of some symptoms (3 items), referring to the previous week. The total score range is from 19 (no disability) to 95 (full disability).</description>

    <measure>The Costs Involved in Using Gloreha in the Rehabilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, from admission to discharge in the Rehabilitation Centre, over a period of about 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Costs were calculated in terms of the time required by healthcare personnel, using the average cost per hour of a physiotherapist per total number of rehabilitation treatments per patient. The equivalent cost of the device for the period of patient treatment was calculated incorporating depreciation, considering the estimated residual value of the device with depreciation rate of 20%.. Indirect costs were not considered because these were common to both groups.</description>

        <description>Motricity Index, a measure of the motor function of the paretic upper limb. Motricity Index used to measure the ability to activate a muscle group to move a body segment through a range of motion and resist external force. The upper extremity motricity index includes: 1. pinch grasp, 2. elbow flexion, and 3. shoulder abduction.
The total upper extremity score involved adding one to the sum of the three actions.
The score of each action ranges from 0 (no ability) to 33 (maximal ability) with a maximum possible score=100.</description>

        <description>The Arm disability was assessed of the study with the Quick version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick-DASH) questionnaire.
The Quick-DASH is a 19-item ordinal scale with a 5-level rating of items from 1 (no difficulty) to 5 (unable to do).
Quick-Dash can be divided into an 11-item (abilities and symptoms) and an 8-item optional work module and sports/performing arts module. In the 11-item sub-scale, the subject defines the ability to perform some actions (8 items) and the intensity of some symptoms (3 items), referring to the previous week. The total score range is from 19 (no disability) to 95 (full disability).</description>

The equivalent cost of the device for the period of patient treatment was calculated incorporating depreciation, considering the estimated residual value of the device with depreciation rate of 20%.. Indirect costs were not considered because these were common to both groups.</description>

      <desc>Three patients lost to follow-up for clinical problems not for side effects related to SHR. If Gloreha was able to open a spastic hand it would be potentially dangerous (the glove was not sensitized) so we cannot know exactly what happens on the patients’ hand. If the force applied by Gloreha was such as to open a spastic hand it could cause pain.</desc>
