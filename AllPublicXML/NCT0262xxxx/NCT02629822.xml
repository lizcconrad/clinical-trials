      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the antiretroviral activity and to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of open-label MK-1439A consisting of a single fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) tablet of MK-1439 100 mg/lamivudine 300 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      300 mg in treatment-naive HIV-1 infected participants with selected NNRTI transmitted
      resistance mutations.
