    <textblock>
      In this randomized double blind controlled trial, a group of healthy middle-aged people (45
      to 65 years old) had a nutritional intervention to evaluate the Lactobacillus plantarum 3547
      probiotic effects over different inflammation and immune system markers, the experimental
      group took the experimental supplement (Lactobacillus plantarum 3547) during one period of
      parallel study (12 weeks), the volunteers consumed 1 capsule/daily with Lactobacillus
      plantarum 3547 (10x109 cfu/d) immediately after finishing their meal, the capsule contains:
      77 mg probiotic Lp3547 and 390 mg maltodextrins. The control group took the control
      supplement (Maltodextrin) during one period of parallel study (12 weeks), volunteers consumed
      1 daily capsule of maltodextrin without Lactobacillus plantarum 3547 (Placebo) immediately
      after finishing their meal. (The capsule contains 425 mg of maltodextrin)
