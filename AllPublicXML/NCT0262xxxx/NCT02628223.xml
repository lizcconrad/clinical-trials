  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is a well-recognized way to lower eye pressure in
      treatment of glaucoma. This treatment is performed for 180 degrees or 360 degrees, and
      studies at academic centers have shown mixed results when comparing the success rates of 180
      degrees or 360 degrees. Both protocols are now typically done by comprehensive
      ophthalmologists. However, there is no data that compares success rates of 180 degrees and
      360 degrees in the community setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective evaluation of the two treatment algorithms for SLT by
      measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) after treatment. The hypothesis is that 360 degrees of
      SLT will produce a greater reduction in IOP than 180 degrees of SLT at 3 months follow up.
