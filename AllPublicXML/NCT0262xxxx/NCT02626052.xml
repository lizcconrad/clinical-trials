      The purpose of this study is to explore the diagnostic values associated with both a positive
      and negative Skull Vibration Induced Nystagmus Test (SVINT) performed in room light (with
      fixation). The hypotheses include: 1. A positive room light SVINT will be identified in
      individuals with moderate to severe vestibular asymmetries. 2. A positive room light SVINT
      will be present when 10 beats or more (counted over 10 seconds) of nystagmus are found with
      fixation blocked.

    <textblock>
      Dizziness and vertigo account for about four million visits to the Emergency Department per
      year and costs for management in the Emergency Department are estimated to be about four
      billion dollars per year. Vestibular problems are a major cause of dizziness. Simple to
      perform and inexpensive bedside vestibular tests are needed. The Skull Vibration-Induced
      Nystagmus Test (SVINT) with fixation blocked has been considered a vestibular gold standard
      test with strong psychometric values. No studies on the diagnostic accuracy of the SVINT in
      room light have been performed.

    <description>Under room light, the presence or absence of nystagmus is determined. If nystagmus is present, then the direction of nystagmus is determined. When fixation is blocked, the presence or absence of nystagmus is determined. If nystagmus is present, then the direction of nystagmus is determined. The number of beats per 10 sec is also determined.</description>
