    <description>Subjects will undergo tDCS stimulation. We will use electrodes of 35cm^2, at an intensity of 2mA on the primary motor cortex contralateral to the amputated limb (or for bilateral amputees contralateral to the most painful side). The subject will undergo stimulation for 20 minutes. The subject will have 5 sessions of stimulation during a 1 week time period.</description>
