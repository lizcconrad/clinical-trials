  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the PH94B nasal spray is effective for Acute
      Treatment of the symptoms of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) in adult men and women. The
      hypothesis is that PH94B nasal spray (.8 micrograms) has a rapid onset of efficacy to improve
      performance and interaction anxiety in patients with diagnosed Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover trial of the
      efficacy and safety of PH94B in the treatment of subjects diagnosed with Social Anxiety
      Disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV and confirmed by the MINI
      (5.0.0). The study is intended to serve as a feasibility trial of a multi-center phase 3
      study protocol of similar design.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate design features for a larger Phase 3 study
      that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of PH94B for the acute management of symptoms in
      subjects with Social Anxiety Disorder. Careful review of diary entries and measurement of
      study medication compliance each week will be used to determine the feasibility of using the
      study medication on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis for anxiety-provoking social events. Specifically,
      the frequency of use, variability of SUDS ratings, effect size of differences in average peak
      SUDS ratings during treatment with PH94B and placebo, and general reliability of the diary
      recording method will be evaluated and used to refine inclusion and exclusion criteria as
      well as provide guidance for designing a larger multi-site study.

      The study will last a total of 6-8 weeks. The randomized double-blind treatment period will
      last a total of four weeks for all subjects.

    <time_frame>Study medication nasal spray is to be administered 15 minutes prior to public performance and following each event they will be asked to record maximum subjective anxiety level experienced during the event.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study endpoint is average peak anxiety level for public performance or social interaction events during the two 2-week double-blind treatment phases (PH94B and placebo). Subjects will be asked to self-administer double-blind PH94B or placebo 15 minutes prior to public performance or social interaction events. Following each event, they will be asked to record the maximum (peak) subjective anxiety level experienced during the event using the patient rated Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), where anxiety scores range from 0 (no anxiety) to 100 (maximum anxiety ever experienced). Within each 2-week treatment phase, all subjective anxiety ratings will be summed and divided by the number of events recorded.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement rating &amp; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale</measure>

    <description>Two key secondary endpoints of the study are overall subject improvement as assessed by the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement rating (CGI-I), and the Investigator rated Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). The proportion of subjects receiving a clinician-rated CGI-I score of 1 (Very much improved) or 2 (Much improved) following two weeks of treatment with placebo will be compared to the proportion of patients receiving a clinician-rated CGI-I score of 1 or 2 following two weeks of treatment with PH94B.</description>

    <time_frame>Every two weeks during treatment and one week after treatment with Study Medication Nasal Spray</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability of PH94B will be assessed through changes from screening/baseline in laboratory values, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital sign assessments following exposure to PH94B, as well as by comparison of adverse events reported during treatment with PH94B and placebo.</description>
