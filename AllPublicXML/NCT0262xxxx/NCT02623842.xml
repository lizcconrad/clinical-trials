      Pilot study, case series conducted in women with a clinical diagnosis of urinary incontinence
      and were treated with radiofrequency technique for capacitive transfer non ablative in
      external urethral meatus. All participants did an hour Pad Test. The participants made five
      sessions of Radio Frequency (RF) with an interval of seven days between them. The application
      of RF was performed by physical therapist trained in the technique of radio frequency through
      the Tonederm® brand device with capacitive transfer method using non-ablative handle with
      electrode in the region of the external urethral meatro and coupling electrode placed on the
      participant's back. For application, the participants were in gynecological position. The
      session had an average duration of 20 minutes. The temperature was measured by an infrared
      thermometer when it reached 41graus radiofrequency was maintained for 2 minutes.
