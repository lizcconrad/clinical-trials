      A Phase 1b/3 Multicenter, Randomized, Trial of Talimogene Laherparepvec in Combination With

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/3, multicenter, clinical trial. The study will be conducted in 2 parts
      (phase 1b and phase 3). In phase 1b talimogene laherparepvec will be administered in
      combination with pembrolizumab to approximately 40 subjects with recurrent or metastatic
      SCCHN. DLT will be evaluated based on the first 18 DLT-evaluable subjects. An expansion
      cohort of up to an additional 22 treated subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the
      safety and to estimate the efficacy of the combination of talimogene laherparepvec with
      pembrolizumab to support a decision to initiate the phase 3 study.
