      Study Design: This is a single center Phase 2 study of myeloablative (MA) and
      nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning, transplantation of partially HLA-mismatched bone marrow
      or peripheral blood stem cells and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (Cy) in patients
      with hematologic malignancies including:

        1. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and Burkitt's
           lymphoma in remission.

        2. Relapsed lymphoma, including marginal zone B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and
           chemotherapy-sensitive large-cell or Hodgkin lymphoma.

        3. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)

        4. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective is to determine overall survival 180 days after transplantation
      involving Myeloablative and Non myeloablative conditioning, HLA-haploidentical marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell grafts, and post-transplant Cyclophosphamide as GVHD prophylaxis.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Secondary objectives include estimating overall and progression-free survival at 100 days,
      180 days, and one year after transplantation, treatment-related mortality, incidence of
      neutrophil and platelet recovery or engraftment, incidence of graft failure, cumulative
      incidence of acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD), incidence of infections, and
      cumulative incidence of relapse/progression. The investigators will also examine the amount
      of time to transplant (day of unrelated search initiation to day 0).
