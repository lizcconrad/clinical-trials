    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation in the
      treatment of patients with malignant pulmonary nodules（not exceed 3cm ）who are not suitable
      candidates for or refuse surgical resection.

      Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique widely used to
      treat solid tumors. Patients with malignant pulmonary nodules will undergo a series of CT-
      guided percutaneous RFA procedures. During the procedures，percutaneous needles will be
      inserted into the target tissues under CT guidance，the needles deliver thermal energy and
      then destroy the tumors by causing coagulation necrosis via tissue heating. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of RFA in pulmonary nodules （maximum
      tumor diameter ≦30 mm） was 10 mm apart from the big trachea, primary bronchi, esophagus,
      great vessels，heart and pleura. Preoperative and postoperative evaluations，including recent
      laboratory tests evaluated and imaging studies reviewed，will be performed both before and
      after the procedures.

    <description>In this group, patients willingly receive CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation procedures are selected according to the inclusion criteria as follows. After a series of preoperative evaluation and preoperative preparation，the procedures will be performed under the CT guidance. CT/MRI scans will be ordered after 24-48 hours to see if there are complications (such as haemorrhage, pneumothorax and pleural effusion). Regularly follow-up will be carried out for several years after RFA to assess the effectiveness and safety of RFA integratedly.</description>

    <description>Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique will be performed in patients with malignant pulmonary nodules in this group. RFA kills the tumors by causing coagulation necrosis via tissue heating. The electrode delivers thermal energy will be inserted into the target tissues under the CT guidance to ensure the area of ablation should cover the targets and the lung tissues 0.5-1.0 cm around the tumors. Post-operative scan and laboratory test will be conducted in time.</description>
