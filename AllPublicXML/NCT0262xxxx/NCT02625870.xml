      The trial was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing Omega-3-Acid Ethyl
      Esters 90 Soft Capsules and placebo. The primary objective of the present study was to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Omega-3-Acid Ethyl Esters 90 Soft Capsules in subjects
      with severe hypertriglyceridemia (TGs ≥500 mg/dL but ＜2000 mg/dL).
