  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, multi-country, Latin American study utilizing a prospective
      single-cohort design. Eligible CU patients will be enrolled in the study and will be followed
      for 24 months (Â± 6 weeks).

      In accordance with the observational nature of the study, there will be no interventions or
      interference with the routine care of the patient which will be based solely on the clinical
      judgment of the treating physician. However, with respect to the frequency and schedule of
      assessments, the schedule included in Table 7-1 will be recommended.

      The selection of the treatment for CU will be clearly separated from the decision to include
      the patient in the study, and will be made at the discretion of the treating physician in
      accordance with standard medical practice, the investigator's clinical judgment, and global
      urticarial guidelines.

      In order to prevent selection bias, investigators should offer enrollment to all consecutive
      patients meeting study criteria, likely to be available for the full duration of the
      follow-up period of 24 months, and willing to participate in the study.

      The overall objective of the study is to evaluate in real-life the CU disease burden, the
      current treatment patterns and the use of health care resources in patients refractory to
      H1-antihistamine treatment

    <description>The CU-QoL is a validated instrument with established psychometric properties developed specifically for the assessment of the health burden of CU. The 2013 international CU guideline recommends the use of CU-Q2oL for assessing quality of life impairment and monitoring disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Urticaria Activity Score for 7 days (UAS7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 7 days before each visit</time_frame>
    <description>Patients willing and able to comply with the UAS7 assessment will be given a paper-based urticaria diary at every site visit and be asked to complete it daily over the week preceding the next site visit. The diary consists of questions to evaluate the severity of their disease, and patients have to assess the severity of their disease, numbers of wheals and severity of itching</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Angioedema Activity Score (AAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 24 hours before each visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Angioedema Activitiy Score (AAS) is a validated, easy to use tool to determine disease activity in patients with recurrent angioedema, independent of its underlying causes. The AAS is designed to be used by patients for their daily documentation of swelling episodes including their duration, severity and impact on daily functioning and appearance.</description>
