  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in China to provide evidence for inclusion in applications to
      competent authorities that the Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachet is effective
      in managing the symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation in patients with
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double blind, two arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe and frequent GERD symptoms. After signing
      a written informed consent, patients will undergo a screening period of up to 7 days.
      Patients who satisfy the study entry requirements within 7 days of consent, will be
      randomised to receive either Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachets (20ml four
      times daily) or matching placebo sachets (20ml four times daily),for a 7- day treatment
      period. At the beginning and end of the treatment period, patients will be required to
      complete the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ).

      In addition, at the end of the 7 (-1 day to +2 days) day treatment period, patients will be
      required to complete the Overall Treatment Evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary diagnosis: Current evidence of symptomatic GERD/NERD that comply with the
             Montreal definition of GERD/Nonerosive Esophageal Reflux Disease (NERD). GERD is a
             condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome
             symptoms and/or complications. The concept of NERD is preserved in the typical reflux
             syndrome without esophageal injury, while reflux esophagitis falls under the category
             of esophageal syndromes with esophageal injury.

          -  GERD status: patients will be recruited by the Investigator from out-patient clinics,
             hospital database or those who respond to the advertising. Patients must have a GERD
             history of frequent episodes of GERD-related symptoms during the last 3 months, and
             must have had troublesome heartburn and/or regurgitation of at least moderate
             intensity on at least 4 days during the week before the start of screening.

          -  Patients must be sufficiently literate to be able to complete the RDQ unaided.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have a history of drug, solvent or alcohol abuse (weekly alcohol intake â‰¥

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential who, for the duration of the study, are
             either unwilling or unable to take adequate contraceptive precautions or are unwilling
             to be sexually abstinent.

          -  Pregnancy or lactating mother.

          -  Patients with a history and/or symptom profile suggestive of the following: any other
             gastrointestinal (GI) disease (e.g. gastric or duodenal erosions and polyps larger
             than 0.5 cm), erosive GERD (Los Angeles [LA] classification grades C-D), Barrett's
             esophagus, peptic ulcer and/or ulcer complications, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,
             gastric carcinoma, pyloric stenosis, oesophageal or gastric surgery, intestinal
             obstruction, current pernicious anaemia, indication for H-pylori eradication, hiatal
             hernias greater than 3 cm, known gastro-intestinal bleeding (hematochezia or
             hematemesis) within the last 3 months, and severe diseases of other major body
             systems.

          -  Patients who have taken anti-cholinesterase drugs, traditional Chinese medicines for
             treating gastrointestinal disease, Ulcermin or misoprostol preparations within 7 days
             prior to screening or throughout the study.

          -  Patients who have taken Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) during the 10 days prior to
             screening, prokinetics or H2 antagonists during the 5 days prior to screening, or
             systemic glucocorticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs except
             low dose aspirin given for cardioprotection) on more than 3 consecutive days during
             the last 28 days prior to screening or PPI-based triple or quadruple therapy for
             eradication of H-pylori during the last 28 days prior to screening and throughout the
             study.

          -  Patients with any co-existing condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would be likely to compromise patient safety or interfere with assessment of efficacy.

          -  Patients with any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values.

          -  Patients with severe/impaired renal function or insufficiency.

          -  Any previous history of allergy or known intolerance to any of the formulation
             constituents.

          -  Relevant clinically significant abnormalities in the physical examination, ECG and
             safety analysis.

          -  Previously randomised into the study.
