  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WITAVI study was designed to explore the kinetic and associated outcome of Von Willebrand
      Factor-multimerizaton defects associated with devices in cardiovascular diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to understand the Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) abnormalities observed
      in association with implantation of different devices in cardiovascular diseases
      (percutaneous valve replacement and circulatory support devices).

      The main objective of the study was to describe the time-course of VWF abnormalities
      onset/offset during implantation of devices in cardiovascular diseases.

      Adult patients &gt; 18 years who need a CF-LVAD or trans-aortic valve implantation are included
      in this cohort; Blood samples are obtained just before procedures

    <measure>Von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer defects</measure>
    <time_frame>180 minutes after device implantation</time_frame>
    <description>VWF multimeric analysis is performed by electrophoresis. The results of HMW-multimers are expressed as the relative amount of the largest multimers (mer&gt;15) of the sample compared with those of the normal pooled plasma (NPP standard human plasma Siemens healthcare diagnostics, Marburg, Germany, coefficient of variation=11%) present on each gel. 4-6 With this method the HMW-multimer ratio is defined as the HMW-multimers (&gt;15-mer) in patient plasma sample divided by HMW-multimers in normal pool plasma, the HMW-multimer ratio of normal pooled plasma is 1 (by definition) and an HMW-multimer defect is defined as a reduced HMW-multimer-ratio (&lt;1).</description>

    <measure>platelet function analyser- ADP (PFA-ADP) closure time</measure>
    <time_frame>5, 15,30, 60 minutes; day 1 , day 7 after device implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The PFA test is initially performed with the Collagen/Epinepherine membrane. A normal Col/ADP closure time (&lt;180 seconds) excludes the presence of a significant platelet function defect.</description>
