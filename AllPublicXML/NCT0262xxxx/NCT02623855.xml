    <textblock>
      The SHINE study is a randomized controlled study of the effect of a park-based family support
      group on multiple outcomes (including stress and physical activity) in a low income
      population.

    <textblock>
      Despite mounting evidence that nature matters for human health, we are not aware of any
      prospective intervention trials looking at the use of nature as a health intervention. Like
      other protective factors, such as the presence of a caring adult, safe play places, greater
      stimulation, the presence of green-space in a child's life has been empirically linked to
      greater resilience. Nature has been proposed as a buffer to stress through several pathways:
      by providing a space for friends and families to gather (thereby increasing social support
      and improving family relationships), by increasing opportunities for physical activity, and
      by improving cognition. Research to date suggests that participation in outdoor activities
      facilitates a sense of connectedness to place. This sense of attachment may also provide a
      form of social support. Families served by Children's Hospital Oakland Primary Care Clinic
      experience high levels of stress. As a safety-net clinic, the primary care clinic serves a
      diverse set of patients, with a common thread of poverty. The Stay Healthy In Nature program
      was developed to encourage stress management skills through play and physical activity in
      parks. The program uses a combination of facilitated and independent outings into local parks
      to encourage sustained behavior change and measurable health benefits.
