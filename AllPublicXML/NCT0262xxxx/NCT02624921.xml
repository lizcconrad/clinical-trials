  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to explore therapeutic effects of natural environments. To do so, the
      investigators evaluated the immediate and sustained changes in several indicators of
      well-being while people (n=26) with poor mental health were engaged in unconstrained
      exposures to natural (green, blue) and urban environments. The indicators included:
      affection, cognition, physiological responses.

      Each participant was exposed to all environments for a period of 210 minutes between October
      2013 and January 2014. During the exposure period, participants were instructed to do what
      they would usually do in that environment. Before, during (at 30 and 210 minutes) and after
      each exposure, several psycho-physiological measures were taken: (i) heart rate variability
      and heart rate using a Holter monitor, (ii) blood pressure using a digital blood pressure
      monitor, (iii) physical activity using the CalFIT application installed in a Smartphone, (iv)
      lung function using a portable computerized spirometer, (v) stress level using salivary
      cortisol samples collected using Salivettes, (vi) affect, perceived restoration and social
      interactions using questionnaires, (vii) cognitive functioning using the backwards digit-span
      task test.

        All the participants (n=26) were individuals that had previously participated in a survey
        of 1000 people in Barcelona city as part of the PHENOTYPE project. As part of the survey,
        they had answered the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) subscale from the SF-36 health
        questionnaire. The investigators purposively selected those individuals MHI-5 scored in the
        lower 50th percentile.
