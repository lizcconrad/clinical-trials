    <textblock>
      Approximately 3000 advanced NSCLC patients will be recruited , and the medical information of
      recruited patients must be recorded in the hospital electronic system from Jan 1st 2014 to
      Dec 31st 2014 .The study will focus on the EGFR testing rate in adenocarcinoma patientsï¼Œso
      the collecting data for non-adenocarcinoma patients will be controlled in less than 10% for
      each site.
