      College athletes will be recruited to complete a voluntary online survey that will take
      approximately 10 minutes. In this survey, they will answer a series of questions related to
      the concussion symptoms they have experienced in their recent sports season, their opinions
      related to concussions and concussion treatment, and demographics.

      College athletes will be recruited to complete a voluntary online survey that will take
      approximately 10 minutes. In this survey, they will answer a series of questions related to
      the concussion symptoms they have experienced in their recent sports season, their opinions
      related to concussions and concussion treatment, and demographics.

      Of interest, participants will indicate what concussion symptoms they have recently
      experienced in one of four formats, to which they will be randomly assigned. Participants
      will either *check the symptoms they have experienced, *check the symptoms they have not
      experienced, *uncheck the symptoms they have experienced, or *uncheck the symptoms they have
      not experienced. It is believed that an alternative method of reporting symptoms that
      requires participants to indicate the symptoms they have not experienced will lead them to
      report having experienced a greater number of symptoms, based on past research regarding
      inclusion vs. exclusion modes of thought.
