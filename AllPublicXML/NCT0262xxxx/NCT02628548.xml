  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal aging is associated with gradual cognitive declines. These mild neurocognitive
      disturbances affect daily functioning, health status, and quality of life, and likely account
      for the roughly $2.9 billion lost by the elderly each year to fraud. The goal of this project
      is to compare two different 8-week training programs to promote successful neural and
      cognitive aging. Changes in neural structure and cognitive function will be assessed in a
      cohort of older adults, as well as the long-term stability of these changes over 24 months.

      Normal aging is associated with gradual cognitive declines. These mild neurocognitive
      disturbances affect daily functioning, health status, and quality of life, and likely account
      for the roughly $2.9 billion lost by the elderly each year to fraud. People are paying
      millions out of pocket for cognitive training programs like Lumosity to stave off these
      declines. These cognitive decreases have been strongly associated with normal age-dependent
      declines in neural structure and function, including cortical thickness decreases
      (approximately 0.02 mm per decade) across most of the cortical mantle, as well as decreases
      in the volume of the hippocampus (approximately 1-2% annually), white matter microstructure,
      and functional connectivity across the brain. Life expectancy is increasing and so
      identifying interventions that can be widely implemented and that can slow or reverse normal
      cognitive decline are clinical and public health priorities. Some training programs can
      improve cognitive performance in cognitively normal older adults, and gains are maintained
      post training. The investigators hypothesize that different techniques to boost cognition
      likely works through different neural mechanisms, and thus may provide different cognitive
      benefits. The goal of this project is to compare two different 8-week training programs to
      promote successful neural and cognitive aging. Changes in neural structure and cognitive
      function will be assessed in a cohort of older adults, as well as the long-term stability of
      these changes over 24 months.
