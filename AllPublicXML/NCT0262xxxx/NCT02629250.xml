  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserve tend to suffer higher risk and develop
      more complications following major surgery. Quite a few researches have shown the benefits of
      goal-directed therapy (GDT) using fluid loading or inotropic agents or both to improve
      outcome during major surgery. However there is concern that inotropic therapy for a
      supernormal oxygen delivery (DO2I) may lead to an increased incidence of myocardial ischemia.
      Even though the meta-analysis has stated that DO2I strategy could possibly reduce the
      incidence of cardiac complication than stroke volume optimization strategy, there are very
      few evidence available in the literature regarding the effect on myocardial ischemia in
      surgical patients, especially in non-cardiac surgical patients. This study is undertaken to
      test the hypothesis that an intraoperative DO2I optimization result in a decreased myocardial
      ischemia in the elderly high-risk surgical patients.

    <textblock>
      Elderly patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserve tend to suffer higher risk and develop
      more complications following major surgery [1]. Quite a few researches have shown the
      benefits of goal-directed therapy(GDT) using fluid loading or inotropic agents or both to
      improve outcome during major surgery [2-7]. The maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion and
      global oxygen delivery (DO2I) is essential to maintain adequate tissue perfusion and
      oxygenation in relation to increased metabolic demand during high risk surgery. However,
      there is concern that inotropic therapy for a supernormal oxygen delivery may lead to an
      increased incidence of myocardial ischemia [8]. Even though the meta-analysis has stated that
      DO2I optimization could possibly reduce the incidence of cardiac complication than stroke
      volume optimization strategy [9],there are very few evidence available in the literature
      regarding the effect on myocardial ischemia in surgical patients, especially in non-cardiac
      surgical patients. This study is undertaken to test the hypothesis that an intraoperative
      DO2I optimization result in a decreased myocardial ischemia in the elderly high-risk surgical
      patients. The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled,
      double-blinded trial in seventy patients who scheduled for proximal femur surgery under
      General anesthesia following nerve block. Both the patients will be allocated to one of two
      equal groups to receive either intraoperative fluid regimen guided by SV strategy or DO2I
      strategy. In the control(SV) group, the patients will receive an intravenous infusion of 250
      ml Ringer's lactate solution in 5 min as a fluid challenge for stroke volume maximization. In
      the experimental(DO2I) group, fluid and dobutamine will be given to reach a stroke volume
      maximization and supernormal oxygen delivery. The primary outcome is preoperative and 24h
      postoperative serum concentration of troponin T. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of
      tachycardia, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, pneumonedema and acute heart failure, blood
      pressure, pulmonary infection, fluid volume, blood transfusion volume, renal function, PONV,
      Length of postoperative hospital stay and mortality. Data will be collected and recorded by
      the clinical teams who are blind to study arm allocation.

The fluid challenge will repeat until the SV failed to increase by a factor of 10%.

    <description>Goal directed fluid therapy is administrated as group SV maximization. Then DO2I will be assessed. If at this stage the DO2I can not be greater than 600 mL/m2 (supernormal oxygen delivery goal), then dobutamine will be started at a dose of 2.5 Î¼g/kg/min and increased by the same increment every 20 minutes until the described target is reached or until a maximal dose of 20 Î¼g/kg/min is given. Dobutamine is decreased in dose or discontinued if the heart rate is above 100 beats per minute or shows signs of cardiac ischemia.</description>
