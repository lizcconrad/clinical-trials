    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the open-label, dose-escalation study is to investigate the safety
      of single-dose monotherapy and repeated-dose of KHK2375 combined with exemestane in female
      subjects with advanced or recurrent breast cancer. The secondary objective is to investigate
      the pharmacokinetics and efficacy.
