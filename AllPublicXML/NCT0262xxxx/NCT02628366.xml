  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with failed kidneys need an artificial kidney machine (called dialysis) to remove
      toxins and extra fluid from the body. Most patients receive dialysis treatments at a hospital
      three times a week. During treatment, a patient's blood pressure may drop, causing dizziness
      and muscle cramping. Repeated drops in blood pressure can also injure the heart and brain.
      Over time, this can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and sometimes death. New research shows
      that cooling the temperature of the dialysis fluid (called dialysate) can reduce heart and
      brain injury. In most hospitals, all patients' dialysate temperature is set at 36.5 ºC (to
      match body temperature). In our study of 73 patients, we showed that reducing the dialysate
      temperature to 0.5 ºC below body temperature protected the heart and brain from injury [1,2].
      We now want to test this simple, safe, low-cost intervention in a large study with more than
      7000 dialysis patients in Ontario. We can lower the dialysate temperature on dialysis
      machines in Ontario at no added cost. This intervention has the potential to reduce many
      hospitalizations and deaths in Ontario, and relieve suffering in patients with kidney
      failure.

      1. Statement of the health problem or issue

           Dialysis is a life-saving treatment for patients with kidney failure. However, over 20%
           of patients die within one year of starting dialysis from heart disease or stroke.

           One reason that so many dialysis patients die from heart disease and stroke may be
           related to the dialysis treatment itself. During dialysis, blood pressure often drops,
           and the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and brain is reduced. Over time, this can
           cause significant damage and result in heart attacks, strokes, and even death.

           Our team was the first to show that the heart and brain become starved of blood and
           oxygen during dialysis. We and others have shown that lowering the temperature of
           dialysis (to just below the patient's own body temperature) improves blood flow and
           protects the heart and brain during dialysis. We will now determine if this method can
           prevent heart attacks and strokes in a large population of dialysis patients.

        2. Objective of your project

           Our study will now determine whether a cooler, personalized dialysis temperature
           prevents heart attacks, strokes, and death.

        3. How will you undertake your work?

           We will conduct a randomized controlled trial. Our study will include 7500 dialysis
           patients in 82 dialysis centres across Ontario. The name of this study is MY TEMP.
           Patients in the treatment group will receive cooler dialysis (0.5ºC below their measured
           body temperature). Patients in the control group will receive standard dialysis at a
           fixed temperature of 36.5ºC. This study will last for two years. At the end of two
           years, we will compare the number heart attacks, strokes and deaths in the treatment and
           control groups.

        4. What is unique/innovative about your project?

           We usually need to study a large number of patients in a clinical trial to reliably
           understand the effects of a treatment. Normally, a study with 7500 patients would cost
           more than $15 million dollars to conduct; however, our study will provide a reliable
           answer to the question being asked and cost less than $2 million. This is because we
           will use data that is already being collected by our healthcare system. For example,
           when a patient is hospitalized for a heart attack or stroke, this information is
           recorded in a secure healthcare database. We will be able to analyze this healthcare
           data at the end of the study (and link patient outcomes to the type of dialysis
           treatment received (i.e. treatment or control)). This innovative study design means that
           our study will be much larger (but cost less) than a traditional clinical trial.

           In addition, MY TEMP is a simple and safe intervention that can be provided on any
           dialysis machine at no added cost. If proven effective, this simple, low-cost
           intervention could be easily adopted across Canada (and worldwide), and save our
           healthcare system millions of dollars by reducing the number hospitalizations for heart
           attacks and strokes.

        5. What is the impact of the proposed research?

      Each year in Ontario, more than 2,000 hemodialysis patients die or are hospitalized for a
      major cardiovascular event. Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death in
      dialysis patients. Unfortunately, medications that prevent heart disease and stroke in other
      patients do not work as well in dialysis patients. If our intervention is successful, we
      think it will prevent at least 200 deaths and cardiovascular events each year (in Ontario
      alone).
