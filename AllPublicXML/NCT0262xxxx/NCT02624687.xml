      This study will test the effects of a sedentary behavior intervention on low back pain in
      working adults. The behavioral intervention will include the use of a sit-stand desk and a
      wrist-worn activity prompter that will notify participants when they have been sedentary for
      too long.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is prevalent, debilitating and costly. Though exercise is a recommended
      treatment for LBP, outcomes are variable and adherence is often poor due to barriers such as
      time, sedentary jobs, and fear-avoidance of movement. Thus, the management of LBP must
      include a biobehavioral lifestyle treatment approach. Preliminary evidence suggests that
      prolonged sitting at work can exacerbate LBP, LBP is relieved shortly after prolonged sitting
      ends, and standing more at work can relieve pain. Thus, this proposal will examine an
      innovative intervention to decrease pain in patients with chronic LBP (cLBP) through a
      reduction in sedentary behavior. The target population will be University of Pittsburgh
      (UPitt) employees with cLBP who are inactive and sit at their desk for â‰¥20 hours/week. Over 6
      months, individuals will be provided with a workstation that allows for standing while
      performing work duties, a wrist-worn activity device that vibrates after prolonged
      sedentariness, and a behavioral intervention including an initial orientation and monthly
      follow-up telephone contacts. This is a novel pain reduction approach that is easily
      incorporated into the workplace and targets a timeframe during which prolonged sitting is
      common. A unique aspect of the approach is that individuals with cLBP who avoid movement due
      to pain may especially benefit from this emerging strategy of more frequent, lifestyle
      activity facilitated by newly-available devices. The investigators hypothesize that this
      intervention will reduce pain intensity thereby leading to increased work productivity,
      decreased healthcare utilization, improved health-related quality of life, and improved
      physical function in LBP sufferers. If effective, this scalable intervention could be
      implemented broadly to enhance employee health.
