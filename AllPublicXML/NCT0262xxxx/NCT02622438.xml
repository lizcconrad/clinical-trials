  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On the basis of published data and our results indicating that oxidative stress may
      contribute to the peripheral skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients with FSHD, investigators
      conducted a pilot randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial to test whether oral
      administration of vitamins and mineral could improve the physical performance of patients
      with FSHD.The result of this clinical trial showed that antioxidants supplementation may
      improve skeletal muscle function of patients with FSHD and suggest that an antioxidant
      strategy adapted may be a relevant therapeutic approach for these patients. Since then,
      patients with FSHD who attend consultation at Montpellier hospital are systematically
      supplemented with antioxidants according their own blood tests.

      This study will assess course of patients with FSHD in accordance with usual care performed
      within the Department of clinical physiology at the University hospital of Montpellier. This
      prospective longitudinal study include an initial assessment. Then the follow up of patients
      will be monitored at 6 months and annually for a period of two years. The eventual objective
      will be to develop a FSHD disease cohort in care at the Montpellier hospital.
