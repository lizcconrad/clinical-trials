  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The observational pilot study at the Churchill Hospital, funded by Oxford Respiratory Trials
      Unit, will assess the feasibility and efficacy of thoracic ultrasound (TUS) assessment in
      patients undergoing talc pleurodesis via intercostal chest drain (ICD) for recurrent
      symptomatic malignant pleural effusions (MPE). Participants will undergo TUS pre and post
      pleurodesis on up to four occasions. We hypothesise that a TUS scoring system will be able to
      predict short and long-term pleurodesis success earlier than current conventional medical
      practice allows. This study may ultimately allow the proposal of a treatment algorithm to
      manage patients with MPE in a more efficient manner.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study.

          -  Adult male or female, aged 18 years or above.

          -  Diagnosed with a malignant pleural effusion requiring intercostal chest drain
             insertion and subsequent talc slurry pleurodesis for symptom relief and/or other
             therapeutic purposes as part of routine clinical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years.

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Known hypersensitivity/allergy to medical talc, or other contraindication to the
             administration of intrapleural talc, as determined by the responsible clinician.

          -  Evidence of significant trapped lung that would prevent pleurodesis being performed,
             as determined by the clinician responsible for assessing the patient.

          -  Expected survival of less than one month due to underlying co-morbidities.
