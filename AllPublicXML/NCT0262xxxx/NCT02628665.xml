    <textblock>
      The therapy of photofrin PDT was effective in improving life quality of patients with
      advanced esophageal and/or gastric cardiac cancer and the time optimizing for employing laser
      irradiation was of great importance.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy and adverse effects of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) on esophageal and/or gastric
      cardiac cancer during different time after inject photofrin.

      The investigators plan to recruit the patients who were pathologically confirmed with
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or gastric cardia adenocarcinoma from the Oct.2015. The
      patients will be divided into two groups. Group 1: Following intravenous administration of
      photofrin at dose of 2 mg/kg.b.w. as the photosensitizer, 630 nm laser irradiation (DIOMED)
      with 400 mW/cm was applied on each part of tumor for 750 seconds through cylinder diffusing
      quartz fibers localizing in the biopsy channel of a flexible endoscope at 24th. Group 2:
      Following intravenous administration of photofrin at dose of 2 mg/kg.b.w. as the
      photosensitizer, 630 nm laser irradiation (DIOMED) with 400 mW/cm was applied on each part of
      tumor for 750 seconds through cylinder diffusing quartz fibers localizing in the biopsy
      channel of a flexible endoscope at 48th.
