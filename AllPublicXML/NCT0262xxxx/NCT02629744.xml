  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label study in healthy participants to assess
      the pain, tolerability, injection leakage, safety, and usability of a single
      self-administered subcutaneous (SC) dose of etrolizumab. Some participants will receive
      &quot;needle-experience&quot; training using a needle and syringe on Days -7 and -5, and health care
      professionals (HCPs) will then assess the participant's suitability to self-inject with a
      prefilled auto-injector (AI). The remainder of participants will be &quot;needle na√Øve&quot; and will
      not have previously self-injected. Eligible&quot; needle experienced&quot; and&quot; needle naive&quot;
      participants will attend an AI training visit at the study site on Day -3 (three days prior
      to etrolizumab dosing on Day 1). Following training and simulated injections by the
      participant the HCP will determine if the participant is suitable to proceed to actual
      etrolizumab dosing. All eligible study participants will self administer a single dose of
      etrolizumab (by AI) on Day 1 and will be followed up to Day 85 following dosing. Pain,
      tolerability, safety and usuability will be assessed.
