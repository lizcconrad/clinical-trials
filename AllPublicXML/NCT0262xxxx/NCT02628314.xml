  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test whether researchers can reliably measure the
      response pupils have when an acute painful stimulus is experienced. Changes in the size of
      the pupil of the eye can be an indicator of brain activity in a region of the brain that is
      important for feeling pain.

      There is strong rationale to support a role for locus coeruleus (LC) responsivity to acute
      painful stimuli in regulating speed of recovery after surgery and for LC responsivity as a
      mechanistic link explaining the risks for slow recovery from weak Conditioned Pain Modulation
      (CPM), catastrophizing cognitive style, and low enzyme activity
      catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype. Preliminary data show feasibility to
      perform the proposed study.

      Primary Hypothesis: An observational study of pupil responses to noxious stimuli shows strong
      intra-individual reliability over 8 weeks.

      Key secondary hypotheses: Compared to individuals homozygous for val at the val158met site of
      the catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, those homozygous for met will show smaller
      pupil responses to noxious stimuli and weaker CPM.
