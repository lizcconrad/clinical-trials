  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent substance abuse (SA), which includes the consumption of alcohol, cigarette
      smoking, the consumption of drugs and other behaviors, is a significant public-health issue
      in the world today. Recent data showed that prevalence of SA among adolescents in Croatia and
      surrounding countries (i.e. former Yugoslav republics) is alarming and needs serious
      intervention. It is hypothesized that participation in physical-exercise-and-sport (PE&amp;S)
      will reduce the tendency of young people to abuse substances. However, the literature to date
      has not consistently validated the perception PE&amp;S factors are factors which could buffer SA
      among children and adolescents. One of the probable reasons for evident inconsistencies on
      findings about relationship between PE&amp;S and SA is a cross-sectional nature of studies done
      so far. Therefore, the main rationale (i.e. problem) of this study is lack of current
      knowledge about influence of the PE&amp;S on SA among adolescents. The main objective of this
      study is to prospectively investigate the influence of PE&amp;S on SA among adolescents aged 17
      to 18 years old. Aims of the project are: (1) to define prevalence and trends of SA among
      adolescents aged 17 to 18 years old; (2) to define prevalence and trends of PE&amp;S
      participation; (3) to establish interrelationships which exist between socio-demographic,
      psychological, educational-factors, and PE&amp;S (predictors); (4) to identify multivariate and
      univariate associations between: socio-demographic and SA, psychological factors and SA, PE&amp;S
      and SA, educational - scholastic factors and SA.Expected results of the project are: (1)
      definition of the prevalence of SA among adolescents; (2) definition of the adolescents'
      participation in PE&amp;S; (3) identification and interpretation relationships which exist
      between and within studied predictors of SA (educational factors, socio-demographic factors,
      PE&amp;S, psychological factors); (4) identification of the influence of studied predictors on
      SA.

        The sample will comprise approximately 1,000 participants (50% males). At the beginning of
        the study, the participants will be attending the 3rd year (grade) of high school, and
        therefore practically all subjects will be 17 years of age at the moment the study starts
        (+/- 6 months). Participants will be randomly selected from 10 to 15 high schools which
        offer a 4-year high school education. Because of the prospective study design and
        consequent need to repeatedly test the same participants, only those schools where the
        investigators already have personal and professional contacts with the school authorities
        will be used as possible test environments.
