  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have shown that a single dose of ultraviolet irradiation (as found in
      sunlight) will lower blood pressure for around one hour. They are now testing whether daily
      UVA for two weeks will produce a sustained fall in BP in patients with high blood pressure.

      They will also measure the effect of daily UVA on other cardiovascular risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies suggest that sunlight reduces all cause mortality, and particularly
      cardiovascular mortality.

      The investigators have previously shown vasodilatation and a transient fall in blood pressure
      following irradiation of human volunteers with 2 standard erythemal doses of UVA radiation.
      This was independent of vitamin D and temperature rise and correlated with a nitric oxide
      synthase independent mobilisation of NO stores from the skin to the systemic circulation.

      In this randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over double blind study, they will measure whether
      twice daily UVA administration can produce a sustained fall in BP and other cardiovascular
      risk factors in a cohort of pre-hypertensive patients.
