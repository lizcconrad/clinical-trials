      What is the role of Agricultural biodiversity in improving diet diversity, quality and
      nutrition?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Agricultural biodiversity can have an important role in improving diet diversity, quality and
      nutrition and can be seen as the foundation of the food and nutrition value chain.

      Increasing the availability and access to local agricultural and/or wild biodiversity genetic
      resources has the potential to increase production, making more food available for
      consumption as long as entitlements to access it exist. However, as the history of food
      security interventions has shown, increasing the production and supply of staple crops alone
      is not enough to improve food security or nutritional status. However, while agricultural
      diversification is an important component, it is not alone sufficient to improve diet
      diversity. Other system elements including women's education and knowledge, intra-household
      dynamics and women's status and cultural beliefs and practices that improves children's
      health and nutrition are important to ensure biodiversity has a successful role in improving
      dietary diversity and quality.
