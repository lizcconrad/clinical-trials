  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to its expected efficacy based on the retrospective data available in ITP, its relatively
      good safety profile and its very low cost , dapsone could be a good steroid-sparing
      second-line option for adults with ITP.

      This study is a phase III prospective multicenter randomized open trial comparing two
      treatment strategies:

        -  Arm A (experimental arm): prednisone at 1 mg/kg for 3 weeks + dapsone at 100 mg per day
           up to week 52 if an initial response is achieved.

        -  Arm B (control arm): prednisone alone at 1 mg/kg for 3 weeks followed by monitoring and
           &quot;standard of care&quot; The aim of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of dapsone based
           on the overall response rate (including response and complete response) as a second-line
           treatment for adults with newly-diagnosed persistent or chronic (modified by amendment
           08/11/2016) ITP not achieving a durable response with corticosteroids. The primary
           endpoint will be the overall response-rate (response or complete response according to
           standard definitions) in both arms at week 52 (1 year).

      The secondary endpoints are the following :

        -  To assess the safety of dapsone over the study period and especially the incidence of
           cutaneous reactions.

        -  To analyze the overall response rate (platelet count &gt; 30 x 109/L with at least a
           doubling of the pre-treatment count in the absence of any other ITP treatment) in both
           treatment arms at week 24.

        -  To compare the rate of complete response and failure in both arms at 24 and 52 weeks.

        -  To compare time to treatment failure (TTF) in both arms

        -  To investigate the mechanisms of action of dapsone in ITP in a subgroup of patients
           (ancillary study)
