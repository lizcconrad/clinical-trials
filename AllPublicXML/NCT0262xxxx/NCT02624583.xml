  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ramadan fasting (RF) has been shown to be associated with vascular and metabolic disorders
      including glycemic control and lipid profile. It may also alter pharmacologic properties of
      some medications. Many patients with CAD and under Clopidogrel insist to observe the fasting
      and taking the risk of altering the pharmacologic proprieties of this drug.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of RF on clopidogrel resistance in patients at
      high cardiovascular risk with particular interest to patients with DM.

    <description>the platelet reactivity to clopidogrel is assessed by the VerifyNow P2Y12 point-of-care assay .
Results are reported as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU); the lower the PRU value, the higher the platelet aggregation inhibition by clopidogrel.
High platelet reactivity after clopidogrel (clopidogrel resistance) was defined at two cutoff values (PRU≥235 and ≥ 208).</description>

    <description>An automated analyzer (Beckman Coulter DXC 600, UK) measured the concentrations of biochemical parameters using the appropriate reagents.
The total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined using an enzymatic colorimetric method. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were determined by immuno-inhibition. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using the Friedewald formula: LDL-C (mmol/L) =TC - HDL-C - TG: 2.2.</description>

      Venous blood samples were collected from the enrolled participants. Blood samples were
      analyzed for hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet cell count, Prothrombin time, activated partial
      thromboplastin time, and clopidogrel effect on P2Y12 receptor by optical turbidimetry
      (expressed as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU)).
