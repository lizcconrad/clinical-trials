      Compare the effects of a combination of colesevelam and clonidine to placebo on bowel
      symptoms in patients with urge or combined type of FI.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence (FI) is a common symptom that can significantly impair quality of life.
      There is very limited, mostly uncontrolled, evidence to support the approaches currently used
      to manage FI. The alpha-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine decreased the frequency of loose
      stools in FI patients with diarrhea. Among patients with diarrhea, clonidine decreased the
      proportion of days with FI; however results were not statistically significant. Uncontrolled
      studies suggest that the bile acid binding resin colesevelam also increased stool consistency
      in patients with functional diarrhea. In this study, the investigators propose to compare the
      effects of a combination of colesevelam and clonidine to placebo on bowel symptoms in
      patients with urge or combined type of FI. The investigators hypothesis is that combination
      treatment with clonidine and colesevelam is better than placebo in reducing stool frequency
      and rectal urgency in FI.

    <measure>Percentage of patients who have a 50% reduction in the frequency of fecal incontinence (FI) episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill out daily bowel diaries and mail them in weekly. Frequency of incontinent episodes will be calculated by analysis of the bowel diaries. The investigators will compare number of episodes of fecal incontinence per week after 4 weeks of treatment with that at baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the number of days with fecal incontinence</measure>

    <description>Patients will fill out daily bowel diaries and mail them in weekly. Frequency of incontinent episodes will be calculated by analysis of the bowel diaries. The investigators will compare number of days per week with fecal incontinence after 4 weeks of treatment with that at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the volume of fecal incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using the Fecal incontinence and Constipation Assessment (FICA) Scale - This validated instrument, developed in our program, has 4-items (frequency, type, amount of leakage, and presence of urgency) used to rate the severity of fecal incontinence. It is the only instrument that incorporates the amount of leakage, which is an important yardstick for the severity of fecal incontinence</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in composition of leaked stools</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill out daily bowel diaries and mail them in weekly. Composition of incontinent episodes will be calculated by analysis of the bowel diaries. Stool consistency will be expressed in terms of the Bristol stool form. The investigators will compare the average daily Bristol stool form after 4 weeks of treatment with that at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of episodes of passive and urge incontinence per week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of episodes of passive and urge fecal incontinence per week will be calculated by analysis of the bowel diaries. The bowel diaries will be averaged first for each day and then for each week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in rectal urgency</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The number of episodes of rectal urgency will be calculated by analysis of daily bowel diaries. From that the percentage of daily bowel movements preceded by rectal urgency will be calculated. The mean percentage of bowel movements preceded by rectal urgency will then be calculated for each week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time for which a bowel movement can be deferred after occurrence of urgency</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time for which a bowel movement can be deferred after occurrence of urgency (expressed in minutes) will be calculated by analysis of the bowel diaries. The bowel diaries will be averaged first for each day and then for each week. The average time for which a bowel movement can be deferred will be compared at the end of 4 weeks of treatment with that at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stool consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will rate their stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Scale. The Bristol Stool Scale is a medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories or types. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation with 3 and 4 being the &quot;ideal stools&quot; especially the latter, as they are the easiest to defecate, and 5-7 tending towards diarrhea.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in proportion of FI episodes that were diarrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of FI episodes that were diarrhea will be calculated by analysis of the bowel diaries. The bowel diaries will be averaged first for each day and then for each week. Stool consistency will be determined using the Bristol stool scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of bowel symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS does not have any pre-set marks between the extremes of 0 (no bowel symptoms) and 100 mm (extreme bowel symptoms). The investigator measures the mark made by the participant in mm and records this for the value of bowel symptoms. The higher the value the more severe the symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of FI</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). It is a validated 4-item scale used to assess the frequency of 4 different types of FI (gas, mucus, liquid stool, solid stool). The subject responses are weighted and summed for the 4 types of FI. Scores can range from 0 (no symptoms) to 61 (very frequent FI). Values will be computed from pre- and post- treatment questionnaires</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of FI on quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire which is a 30-item validated questionnaire that assesses the effects of fecal incontinence on quality of life. The difference in QOL will be compared by pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact on symptoms of anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 (no symptoms) and 21 (severe symptoms) for either anxiety or depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with treatment measured by the visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>In order to determine if patients are satisfied with the treatment received, we will use a previously validated visual analog score. Patients will be asked to subjectively indicate their level of satisfaction with continence function. This will be measured with a visual analogue sliding scale that ranges from 0 to 100 mm (0 means not satisfied while 100 means completely satisfied). The investigator measures the mark made by the participant in mm and records this for the value of bowel symptoms. The higher the value the more satisfied the patient is with continence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of days where patient used loperamide</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 weeks after start of treatment with drug or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>This will be caculated from daily bowel diaries. The number of doses of loperamide used/day will be averaged over each week and will be compared between post-treatment and pre-treatment.</description>
