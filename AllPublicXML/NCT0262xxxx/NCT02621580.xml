  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser therapy is an established method to stabilize and control proliferative diabetic eye
      disease. Questions on the long-term effect on the retina from these treatments remain to be
      answered. The purpose of the study was to evaluate changes in the retina following panretinal
      photocoagulation (PRP) over time, using structural and functional diagnostic tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of adult-acquired retinal vascular disease.
      Diabetic retinopathy is estimated to affect more than 100 million adults, and is the leading
      cause of blindness worldwide.

      Over the past 30 years, epidemiological studies and clinical trials have shown that early
      detection through annual eye exams, intensive glucose and blood pressure control, and timely
      laser photocoagulation could prevent visual loss. More recently, a variety of newer ocular
      treatments and medications have been introduced, such as the use of the PASCAL
      photocoagulation laser system, and various anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies.
      While these treatments have revolutionized how diabetic retinopathy patients are managed
      clinically, questions on appropriate patient selection and the long-term efficacy and safety
      of these treatments remain to be answered.

      The purpose of this study is to focus on studying the nature and the time course over 2 years
      of structural and functional changes to the retina following PASCAL photocoagulation in
      severe preproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients.

    <description>Diabetic retinopathy does not usually impair sight until the development of long-term complications, including proliferative retinopathy, a condition in which abnormal new blood vessels may rupture and bleed inside the eye. When this advanced stage of retinopathy occurs, pan-retinal photocoagulation is usually recommended.
During this procedure, a special laser is used to make tiny burns that seal the retina and stop vessels from growing and leaking. Hundreds of tiny spots of laser are placed in the retina to reduce the risk of vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment.</description>
