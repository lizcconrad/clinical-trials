  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep deprivation is common in anaesthesiology residents. Its effects on technical skills
      have been reported with controversial results. Non-technical skills (team working, situation
      awareness, decision making and task management) contribute to safe and efficient task
      performance. They have a crucial role in anaesthetic practice, especially during crisis
      management. The investigators hypothesized that sleep deprivation was associated with a
      reduced mobilisation of non-technical skills in anaesthesiology residents.

      The scenario consisted in a rapid sequence induction for emergency general anaesthesia in
      case of acute peritonitis complicated by an anaphylactic shock secondary to the injection of
      succinylcholine. All scenarios were performed with the assistance of an anaesthetist nurse,
      facilitator of the scenario. In a second time, after patient stabilisation (defined as oxygen
      saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) &gt; 95%, mean arterial pressure (PAM) &gt; 65 mmHg and heart
      rate (HR) &lt; 100 bpm for at least 2 minutes) consecutive to an expected injection of 100 Âµg of
      epinephrine decided by the participant, a surgeon entered the operating room to create a
      dilemma regarding patient destination (continue surgery or intensive care unit admission)
