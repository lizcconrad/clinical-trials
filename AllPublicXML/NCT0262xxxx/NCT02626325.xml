  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High saturated fat acids diets are associated with elevated blood pressure which is
      associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. For this reason, a change of diet is
      recommended to manage blood pressure and prevent cardiovascular complications. To achieve
      this nutritional goal, a high-carbohydrate diet or high-monounsaturated fat diet can be
      advised in the replacement of a saturated fat diet.

      Previous meta-analysis of Garg (1998) cited randomized articles with inconsistent blood
      pressure lowering after consumption of a high-monounsaturated-fat diet compared with a
      high-carbohydrate diet only in type 2 diabetes patients. Moreover, another meta-analysis of
      Shah et al. (2007) showed slightly high blood pressure on diets rich in carbohydrates than
      diets rich in cis-monounsaturated fat after randomized and nonrandomized articles.

      For this reason, a new meta-analysis of a randomized clinical trial will be performed to
      clarify the effects of high-carbohydrate or high-monounsaturated fat diets on blood pressure.
      Results from this meta-analysis will help health professionals take important decisions on
      patient diet and minimize cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
