    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn about how the participants lungs and heart are working
      after treatment for throat cancer. The investigators are looking to see if there is a
      long-term impact on overall health from the cancer treatment. The long-term goal of this
      study is to compare the participants overall quality of life to similarly aged people who
      have not had throat cancer.

      The goal of this study is not to test the impact of a specific intervention, but rather to
      evaluate the long-term cardiovascular health and quality of life of oropharyngeal cancer
      survivors using validated survey instruments, cardiopulmonary testing, and measurements of
      cardiac risk factors. Thus, no intervention, other than the assessments will be administered
      as part of the protocol. All participants will have received treatment according to the
      standard of care or a therapeutic clinical trial in which they may have participated
      previously. We will collect information about prior treatment from the electronic medical
      record (EMR).

    <description>This is a cross-sectional pilot study of long-term survivors of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer treated with CTRT who are at least three years from treatment completion. This study consists of a onetime assessment of cardiopulmonary fitness, physical function status, measurement of lean body mass, endothelial function quality of life assessment, medical history and blood laboratory evaluation for traditional cardiac risk factors, endocrine derangement and inflammation.</description>

        In protocol 10-111 &quot;Surviving Oropharynx Cancer: Long-term Impact of Human Papillomavirus
        (HPV) on quality of life&quot;, a population of HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer survivors was
        identified. There are nearly 150 participants who have completed the one-time questionnaire
        on 10-111 who may meet the eligibility criteria for this study.

          -  Diagnosis of HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx confirmed by the pathology
             department of MSKCC. Positive HPV status defined as chromogenic in situ hybridization
             with wide spectrum HPV probe (HPV III family 16 probe (Ventana) with affinity to HPV
             genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and

          -  66) or p16 immunohistochemistry done in a Clinically Laboratory Improvement Amendment
             (CLIA) approved laboratory; if either of these 2 tests are positive, the patient is
             classified as HPV positive]
