      This phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy of the combination of pemetrexed and
      sorafenib in patients with recurrent or metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).
      Candidate pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study of a regimen of dose-dense pemetrexed
      and sorafenib to determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent or
      metastatic TNBC. Eligible patients will be those who have had disease progression during or
      after treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease with one previous cytotoxic chemotherapy
      regimen. Additionally, patients with disease progression or recurrence during or within 6
      months of completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are also eligible. Correlative
      studies will be conducted using blood samples and archived tumor samples.

      Simon's two-stage design will be utilized in this study. In the first stage, if there are ≤ 3
      patients of the first 18 efficacy-evaluable patients who have a partial or complete response,
      then the trial will end for futility. If ≥ 4 patients have a partial or complete response,
      patient accrual will continue in the second stage to add 10 more efficacy-evaluable patients.

      The total sample size for the Simon's two-stage design is 35 patients. Based on enrollment of
      2-3 patients per month, the expected enrollment period will be about 12-18 months.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer achieving an objective response (either PR or CR). The proportion of patients who have a response will be calculated along with its 95% confidence interval by the biased-reduced estimation method by Chang et al (36), recommended by Porcher and Desseaux (37).</description>

    <measure>The percentage of progression-free survival (PFS).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from initiation of study treatment until documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to describe the time to death or disease progression; the median time to death or progression will be estimated, along with 95% confidence intervals. A Cox regression model may be used to model the time to death or progression, adjusting for any effects of potential covariates (such as tumor size, tumor stage, biomarker, and age).</description>
