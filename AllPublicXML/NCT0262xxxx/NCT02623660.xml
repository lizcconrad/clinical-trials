  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients undergoing a total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA) experience a clinically significant reduction in healing time when treated post
      operatively with a specific form of micro and nano-ampere current. The results of this trial
      will provide a basis for generalizing its outcomes to apply to other joint replacements and
      revisions by reducing edema and inflammation and therefore will result in a shorter time to
      heal.

      The study will compare electrically treated and non electrically treated patients by using
      digitally based measurements to determine objective reductions of lower extremity edema
      including intra and inter cellular shifts in fluid distribution, increased range of motion
      (ROM) and muscle strength, and improved functional tests of ambulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to assess the efficiency and efficacy of the ODIN1Â® microcurrent
      generating device to reduce post-operative edema, shorten the time to heal and regain maximum
      function in total knee replacement patients. Changes in swelling will be documented by
      utilizing a 3D scanning device (Perometer) and a Bio-Impedance Spectroscopy (BIS) device
      (Impedimed SFB7). These instruments quantitate limb volume and inter and intra-cellular fluid
      respectively with a high degree of accuracy. Measurements will be made from the first
      post-operative day until the completion of rehabilitation therapy several months later.

      Edema volume and fluid distribution data collected from both control and experimental groups
      will be compared to determine the statistical significance of the difference between these
      groups. An additional analysis will be performed on data collected from the non-operated
      lower limb of each patient.

      The second primary objective is to determine the time to complete post-op rehabilitation.
      Completion will be determined by the ability of the patient to experience an optimal outcome
      by utilizing performance based measurements of knee function including quadriceps strength
      and range of motion. The time from surgery to optimal post-op rehabilitation will be
      recorded.

      The determinations of statistical significance between the electrically treated and
      non-electrically treated groups will be made by analysts on a blind basis. They will not know
      whether a sample data set is from an experimental or control patient. The codes that document
      which group the set belongs to will be opened after all analysis is completed by an
      independent analyst.

The frequency of the treatments will vary over the period of time from post-op recovery to end of rehab.
All treatments are applying current that consists of different combinations of intensities within the micro to nano ampere ranges.</description>
