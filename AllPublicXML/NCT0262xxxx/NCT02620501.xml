  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to a placebo or study group who will receive topical lidocaine
      prior to EGD. Amount of medication used, recovery time, patient/endoscopist satisfaction will
      then be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a double blinded randomized placebo controlled trial

      Patients between 18 and 89 years old who are scheduled for EGD may be eligible to enroll in
      the study. Potential subjects will be sought through referral by their treating attending and
      fellow gastroenterologist, who will be apprised of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Patients possibly meeting inclusive and exclusive criteria will be approached and discussed
      the study further with the investigators. Those expressing a desire to participate in the
      study will be given written informed consent prior to participation. The investigators will
      enroll patients into the study with a goal of at least 53 patients in each group which is the
      number of patients our statistician recommended to appropriately power our study.

      Patients who consent to enroll in the study will be randomized into 2 groups. Group 1: Swish
      and swallow 10ml of 2% lidocaine solution Group 2: Swish and swallow 10ml of 0.45% sodium
      chloride solution

      The patients will then undergo endoscopy for the indication identified in their clinic
      appointment. Following the procedure, patients will be taken to the recovery area and
      recovered per clinic protocol. The endoscopist will complete a satisfaction questionnaire.
      The day following the procedure a nurse will call to check for post-operative complications
      per clinic protocol. The day following, an investigator will also call to perform a patient
      satisfaction survey..
