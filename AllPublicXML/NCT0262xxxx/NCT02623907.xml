    <textblock>
      With the aging of Chinese population, degenerative valvular disease is becoming more and more
      frequent, which has brought a heavy burden to our society. Taking aortic stenosis (AS) as an
      example, the incidence of AS in population over the age of 65 are about 2%, and in population
      above the age of 85 can be amounted to 4-8%, in the Western country. Since the invention of
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR),aortic valve disease (AVD),including AS and
      aortic regurgitation (AR), has attracted more and more attention. To date, there are few data
      about the prevalence of AVD in China. The characteristics and prognosis of AVD in China are
      still unknown. Therefore, the investigators design a prospective, observational cohort study
      to investigate characteristics, treatments and prognosis of AVD in Chinese elderly
      population. The results of the study will provide a basis for the future national health
      policy for prevention and treatment of AVD in the elderly.
