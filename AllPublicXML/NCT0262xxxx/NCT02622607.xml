  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone metastases are common in patients with advanced lung cancer and can have devastating
      consequences. Preventing or delaying bone metastases may improve outcomes. Bisphosphonates
      are inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The current indications for
      bisphosphonates include the treatment of metabolic disorders of bone metabolism (e.g.,
      osteoporosis and Paget's disease), the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HCM), and
      the prevention of skeletal-related events(SREs）from malignant bone disease. Clinical trials
      also confirm that bisphosphonates, and zoledronic acid（ZOL) in particular, can prevent bone
      loss from cancer treatment.There is also emerging evidence that the benefits of
      bisphosphonate therapy in the oncology setting are more extensive. This study will evaluate
      whether the addition of ZOL 4 mg every 3 months for up to 1 years in patients with stage
      IIIB/IV lung cancer could reduce the rate of bone metastases ,improve progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS), and delay time to bone metastases .

      Bone metastases are common in patients with advanced lung cancer and can have devastating
      consequences. which can lead to pain, decreased mobility and skeletal complications
      .Preventing or delaying bone metastases may improve outcomes. Bisphosphonates are inhibitors
      of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The current indications for bisphosphonates include
      the treatment of metabolic disorders of bone metabolism (e.g., osteoporosis and Paget's
      disease), the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HCM), and the prevention of SREs

    <description>Percentage of participants developing at least 1 bone metastasis, whether or not symptomatic. Bone scans were scheduled at screening and at 6-monthly intervals after study entry, or when symptoms suggested the presence of bone metastases.

Time to disease progression (TTP) was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines with evaluations every 3 months.</description>
