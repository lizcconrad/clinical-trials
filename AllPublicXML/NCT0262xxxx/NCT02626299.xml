  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if giving a larger amount of DHA than currently
      included in some prenatal supplements can reduce early preterm birth (birth before 34 weeks
      of pregnancy).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a nutrient found in some fish and eggs and its intake in US
      diets is typically low. Because DHA is important for early brain development, it has recently
      been added to many prenatal supplements. The usual amount is around 200 mg/day. Participants
      in this study are guaranteed to receive at least 200 mg/day of DHA.

      Almost 5 in 100 births in the US occur before 34 weeks of pregnancy. There is no way to
      predict which births will occur before 34 weeks. In an earlier study conducted at the
      University of Kansas Medical Center, women who received 600 mg DHA/day compared to no DHA had
      fewer births before 34 weeks of pregnancy with fewer complications of preterm birth.

      This study is designed to compare standard care (200 mg/day of DHA) to a higher amount of DHA
      (1000 mg/day) to determine if the higher amount will reduce early preterm birth (birth before
      34 weeks of pregnancy). Individual participation in this study is expected last about 5
      months.
