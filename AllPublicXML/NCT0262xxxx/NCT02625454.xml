    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to administer acetaminophen (Tylenol) for the treatment of fever in
      laboring patients by either an oral or intravenous (IV) route. The investigators want to see
      if the maternal fever will decrease faster with the IV or the oral dose. The investigators
      also want to look at other outcomes such as the cesarean section rate, the rate of neonatal
      intensive care unit admissions in both groups.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, study of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (OFIRMEV) versus
      orally administrated acetaminophen for the reduction of intrapartum maternal fever and fetal
      tachycardia. Compared to oral acetaminophen, intravenous acetaminophen has increased
      bioavailability and more rapid onset of action. IV acetaminophen has been used successfully
      in the management of fever in post-operative patients. Additionally, intravenous
      acetaminophen has also been used in the intrapartum setting for management of pain.However,
      the use of intravenous acetaminophen for the treatment of maternal temperature and subsequent
      fetal tachycardia, has not yet been evaluated.

      The study will have two arms that will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. A double dummy, double
      blind, comparator controlled study design will be utilized. After inclusion criteria have
      been satisfied, subjects in the control arm will receive an oral dose 1000 mg acetaminophen
      and an intravenous placebo resembling Ofirmev. The subjects in the experimental arm will
      receive 1000 mg of IV Ofirmev and an oral placebo resembling acetaminophen. Both groups will
      receive standard obstetrical care, continuous fetal monitoring, and antibiotics if there is
      suspected chorioamnionitis. The blinding technique will eliminate provider bias.
