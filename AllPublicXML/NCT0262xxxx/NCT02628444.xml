    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety of the primary series vaccine schedules and the
      booster vaccination

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue
           serotype by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 2 dose schedule (Placebo 1/CYD Dengue
           vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose
           schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post-final vaccination.

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue
           serotype by tetravalent CYD vaccine given as a 1 dose schedule (Placebo 2/CYD Dengue
           vaccine group) compared to the immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose
           schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine group) 28 days post final vaccination.

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue
           serotype 28 days after administration of a single booster dose of tetravalent CYD
           vaccine

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited by tetravalent CYD
           vaccine given as a 2 dose schedule (Placebo 1/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the
           immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine
           group) 28 days post-final vaccination.

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited by tetravalent CYD
           vaccine given as a 1 dose schedule (Placebo 2/CYD Dengue vaccine group) compared to the
           immune response elicited by CYD vaccine given as a 3 dose schedule (CYD Dengue vaccine
           group) 28 days post-final vaccination.

        -  To describe the neutralizing antibody levels of each dengue serotype at 28 days post
           Dose 3 to the Ab levels immediately before receiving booster injection in all 3 CYD
           vaccination groups.

        -  To describe the neutralizing antibody levels of each dengue serotype at 28 days
           post-dose 2 and 28 days post-dose 3 from CYD Dengue vaccine group in a primary series
           schedule.

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response elicited against each dengue
           serotype 28 days after administration of a single booster dose of tetravalent CYD
           vaccine.

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of CYD vaccine after each and any injection

      Healthy subjects between age 9 and 50 year will receive in various schedules of CYD vaccine
      and placebo administration over a 12-month period. They will be further randomized to receive
      a single booster vaccination of CYD vaccine at either 12 months or 24 months following the
      last primary series injection.
