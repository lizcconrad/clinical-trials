      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of using confocal laser
      microlaryngoscopy (CLM) as a tool to perform non-invasive, in vivo, real time pathologic
      assessment of laryngeal lesions.

      In order to achieve this purpose, this study will prospectively enroll patients with clinical
      evident laryngeal pathology concerning for cancer or dysplasia, who are scheduled to undergo
      a formal intraoperative biopsy of their lesion. While in the operating room, prior to
      performing a formal biopsy, CLM will be used to evaluate the area of pathology, surrounding
      tissue, and contralateral normal tissue. Then the biopsy will be performed, as per standard
      protocol, and the diagnostic results from CLM and the formal biopsy will be compared.

    <description>On the day of surgery, participants will have placement of laser-safe endotracheal tube and a rigid laryngoscope will be introduced into the oral cavity to gain access to the laryngeal introitus and then placed into suspension (standard of care)
Fluorescein dye will be administered intravenously
Confocal laser probe will be introduced through the rigid laryngoscope and touched first on the lesion of concern and put into scanning mode in order to obtain photos and video footage of the lesions. The probe will then be placed on normal appearing vocal fold tissue to obtain a control sample.
The remainder of the procedure is standard excisional biopsy and KTP laser photoablation</description>
