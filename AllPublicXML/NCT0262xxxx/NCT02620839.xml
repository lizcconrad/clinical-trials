    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose and side effects of alpelisib and cisplatin in
      treating patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive solid tumor malignancies.
      Alpelisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving alpelisib and cisplatin may work better in treating
      patients with solid tumor malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of alpelisib in
      combination with weekly cisplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate and median progression-free survival with the
      treatment combination in HPV positive (+) solid tumor malignancies.

      II. To characterize the safety profile of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive alpelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 or 1-21, and cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8, or days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

          -  Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the study and through
             the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment:

        Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 16
        weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in this period,
        but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. A condom is required to be
        used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

        Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming
        pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and through at least 16
        weeks after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective contraception is defined as
        either:

        Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
        subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation
        methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].

        Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case
        of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
        follow up hormone level assessment.

        Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study subjects, the vasectomized male
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient].

        Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

        Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) Barrier methods of
        contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
        foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

        Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not allowed
        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.

        For women with therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH
        and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status.

        NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH)
        agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian
        suppression.
