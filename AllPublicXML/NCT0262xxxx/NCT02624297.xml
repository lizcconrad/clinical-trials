  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that chemoreflex response of muscle sympathetic nerve activity
      (MSNA) during hypoxia and hypercapnia will be increased in coronary artery disease (CAD)
      patients and that the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) will potentiate these
      responses. And, that the exercise training would decrease the chemoreflex response of MSNA in
      these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty patients with coronary artery disease, with (n=20) and without (n=20) obstructive sleep
      apnea will be studied. A healthy control, age-paired group (n=10) will be also evaluated. The
      patients will be submitted to a polysomnography and randomized for clinical follow-up or
      exercise training for four months. It will evaluated the autonomic function, chemoreflex
      control of sympathetic activity during hypoxic and hypercapnic maneuvers, endothelial
      function and inflammatory markers.
