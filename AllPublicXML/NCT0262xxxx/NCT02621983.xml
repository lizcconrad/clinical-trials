      This study will evaluate the ability of aerobic exercise to improve cognition in people with
      schizophrenia. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two interventions: (1)
      aerobic exercise class (stationary bicycle, or &quot;spin&quot; class) for up to 45 minutes three times
      per week for 12 weeks, or (2) balance and stretching class for up to 45 minutes three times
      per week for 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe, chronic, and disabling psychotic illness that affects
      approximately 87,000 Veterans. Previous studies have reported improved short-term memory with
      AE, but there in a lack of information on cognitive effects of AE in SCZ. The investigators
      want to determine if twelve weeks of AE training improves cognitive function in Veterans with
      SCZ.

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed by using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). It assesses seven key cognitive domains: processing speed, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The MCCB is a battery of tests with a computerized scoring system that produces T-scores and composite scores.</description>
