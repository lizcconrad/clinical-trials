  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy, safety, and effect on hemoglobin levels, of once weekly
      epoetin beta subcutaneous injections (30,000 International Units [IU]) in anemic patients
      with solid tumors. The anticipated study duration is 4 months, and the target sample size is
      40 individuals.
