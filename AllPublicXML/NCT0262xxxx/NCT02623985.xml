    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate accuracy of rapid tests for group A beta hemolytic
      streptococci in patients who presented with sore throat at out patient department in Siriraj
      Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who presented with sore throat at out patient department less than 5 days and
      age over 6 years old would be enrolled by the primary physicians and the consent forms will
      be completed by researcher.

      The throat swab would be performed by using Sofia, QuickVue rapid tests compare to the gold
      standard which is a throat swab culture to evaluate the accuracy of the rapid tests.

      The sample size for validation of sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests is 358 patients.

      The primary outcome is will be evaluated sensitivity and specificity of both rapid tests.
