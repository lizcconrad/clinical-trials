  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a handicraft topical device of negative
      pressure versus traditional healing treatment for skin ulcers in lower limbs; in patients
      with diabetes mellitus, venous stasis and arterial insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this trial is that the handicraft topical device of negative pressure is
      even better for the treatment of skin ulcers located in the lower limbs of patients with
      diabetes mellitus, venous stasis and arterial insufficiency. We anticipate that in a sample
      of 144 patients with ulcer, will heal or at least improve with this treatment

We introduce a device to distribute the negative pressure or vacuum on ulcer; conducted margins make recommendations 5-12 mm over the edge of the wound, applying negative pressure or vacuum retracted sponges, likewise for the spare fewer gauze was placed Sterile adhesive film covering the defect to seal the system cover adequately the probe output nelaton not to submit drain the system. Connect the probe to the sterile nelaton this hose and a suction system with pressure gauge, pressure -80-125 mmHg. Change it every 72 hours.</description>

    <description>Were handled as follows:
Under local anesthesia, prior asepsis and antisepsis of the skin ulcer with iodinepovidone sterile fields are placed, we proceeded to debridement of all necrotic tissue or devitalized then a cure with liquid soap surgery was performed and was irrigated with 1000 cc of solution physiological 0.9%, and finally the ulcer was covered with sterile gauze.
healing of skin ulcers were performed every 24 hours.
the evolution of skin ulcers was evaluated every 3 days, requesting a differential valuing of clinical and biochemical form the aforementioned variables.</description>
