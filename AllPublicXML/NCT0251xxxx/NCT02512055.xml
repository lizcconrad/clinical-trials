      Ketamine provides a safety zone for sedated but spontaneously ventilated children especially
      in remote conditions such as radiotherapy units where sedation is an essential practice for
      children to keep calm and motionless In this study, investigators planned to analyse ketamine
      doses needed and the recovery times in pediatric oncology patients undergoing repeated
      radiotherapy sessions.

      Ketamine provides a safety zone for sedated but spontaneously ventilated children especially
      in remote conditions such as radiotherapy units where sedation is an essential practice for
      children to keep calm and motionless.However, there had been a disagreement about the
      ketamine doses needed for a continuous and steady level of sedation during repeated
      radiotherapy sessions in children. In this study, investigators planned to analyse ketamine
      doses needed and the recovery times in pediatric oncology patients undergoing repeated
      radiotherapy sessions.After approval from the Baskent University, School of Medicine, Ethics
      and Research Committee (KA09/247) and informed consents of the patients' guardians, 33
      pediatric patients undergoing radiotherapy due to oncologic disorders were enrolled to
      receive ketamine 2 mg/kg and atropine 10 Î¼g/kg.Patients' demographic data such as age,
      gender, weight, ASA physical status and duration and total number of radiotherapy sessions
      were noted. Total ketamine consumption to maintain the targeted sedation level during each
      session, additional dose administration and the recovery time were recorded. The adverse
      events such as apnea, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, desaturation, respiratory depression,
      bradycardia, sedation levels deeper or superficial than intended to, excessive salivation,
      allergy, nausea and vomiting and need for emergency medication were also noted after each
      session. The study drugs were prepared, labelled and administered by an anesthetist according
      to the study protocol and data were recorded by an anesthetist blind to the amount of the
      study drug used.
