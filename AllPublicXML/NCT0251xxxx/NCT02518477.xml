      This study will examine whether lymphedema after breast cancer surgery can be reduced. In a
      randomised controlled design the aim is to investigate whether an early intervention with
      progressive resistance training and close monitoring of arm swelling can reduce the incidence
      of lymphedema after breast cancer surgery.

      Lymphedema is a well known and much dreaded complication after breast cancer surgery. The aim
      in this study is to examine if lymphedema can be prevented with early progressive strength
      training focusing on the arm, and close monitoring of pre clinical lymphedema in the 1 year
      exercise period. The primary outcome is lymphedema, and secondary outcomes are pain,
      self-reported symptoms of swelling, sensory disturbance, physical and psychological
      functioning, fatigue, depression, anxiety and health related quality of life.

      158 patients operated for breast cancer with axillary node dissection, will be invited from
      three hospitals in Denmark, Sealand (Rigshospitalet, Ringsted Hospital, and Herlev Hospital),
      while on the surgical wards. Two weeks later upon consent they are recruited, baseline tested
      and randomized to either exercise intervention or usual care control.

      The exercise intervention consists of progressive resistance training, combined with a
      stretching programme, with a total duration of 60 minutes per session. The group attend
      supervised exercises twice a week and a once weekly home exercise programme of 45 to 60
      minutes duration. After 20 weeks, exercises are converted to home exercises, and they are
      monitored by a weekly sms-service. At 12 months, follow-up measurements are taken for both
      groups. Lymphedema is defined as 3% limb volume change from the baseline measurement.

    <description>The first 20 weeks, twice-weekly 60 minute session of physical exercise supervised by the research assistant and once weekly home exercise programme is offered. The exercise intervention will consist of stretching, scar tissue mobilization and resistance exercises.
For the following 32 weeks a home-training manual specifying three times weekly training is provided. At week 26 an individual booster session will be offered. In the case of lymphedema, referral to trained lymphedema physiotherapist for evaluation of appropriate intervention is made.</description>
