  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of beclomethasone
      dipropionate administered via BAI at a dose strength of 40 or 80 mcg per oral inhalation (320
      or 640 mcg/day, respectively) compared with placebo treatment in patients with persistent
      asthma as assessed by the standardized baseline-adjusted trough morning (pre-dose and
      pre-rescue bronchodilator) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) area under the effect
      curve from time 0 to 6 weeks (AUEC[0-6wk]).

      Run-In Period (Days -14 to Day -1): Participants were provided with single-blind placebo
      breath-actuated inhaler (BAI) or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) device for twice-daily use after
      appropriate training and demonstration of the proper technique. Participants discontinued
      their current asthma therapy for the duration of the study.

      Treatment Period (Day 0 to Week 6): Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and
      device type through a qualified randomization service provider (ie, IRT). The interactive
      response technology (IRT) system stratified patients based on treatment at the time of
      screening visit, either inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or non-corticosteroid (NCS). During the
      study, blinded persons were blinded to treatment (active or placebo) assigned but not device
      (BAI or MDI) assignment.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 of Treatment Period), weeks 2, 4, 6</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy variable was the standardized baseline-adjusted trough morning (pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) FEV1 AUEC(0-6wk). Pulmonary function measurements such as FEV1 were obtained electronically by spirometry at the randomization visit, each treatment visit (Weeks 2, 4 and 6) and any unscheduled visit (such as the early termination visit). The highest FEV1 value from 3 acceptable and 2 repeatable maneuvers (maximum of 8 attempts) was used. The least-square (LS) means, difference of LS means and its 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value represent the results obtained from the analysis of covariance with covariate adjustment for baseline, sex, age, current asthma therapy, and treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Timeframes: Baseline (Day -7 to Day 0 which is part of the Run-in Period); Treatment Period from Day 0 up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the weekly average of daily trough morning (pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) PEF by handheld spirometer over the 6-week treatment period. PEF were determined twice daily, in the morning and in the evening, before administration of study drug or rescue medications. A handheld spirometer was provided to patients and used to determine the morning and evening PEF throughout the study. The spirometer was programmed to record the highest PEF obtained from 3 valid attempts. Baseline was defined as the average of recorded trough morning PEF assessments over the 7 days prior to the first dose of double-blind study treatment, including the morning assessment at the randomization visit. The LS means, difference of LS means and its 95% confidence interval, and p value are obtained from the mixed model for repeated measures analysis with covariate adjustment for baseline, sex, age, current asthma therapy, treatment, week, and treatment by week interaction.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in the weekly average of total daily (24-hour) use of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol over weeks 1 through 6. Patients recorded the number of inhalations (puffs used) of rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI [90 mcg ex-actuator] or equivalent) each morning and evening in the diary. The average number of daily inhalations over the 7 days before the randomization visit was the baseline value and was compared with the rescue medication use during the 6-week treatment period.</description>

    <description>Asthma symptom scores were recorded in the patient's diary each morning and evening before determining FEV1 and PEF and before administration of study or rescue medications. The Daytime Symptom Score was recorded in the evening on a scale of 0 (No symptoms during the day) to 5 (Symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities) plus the Nighttime Symptom Score in the morning on a scale of 0 (No symptoms during the night) to 4 (Symptoms so severe that I did not sleep at all) for a total score range of 0-9. Baseline was defined as the average of recorded daily asthma symptom scores (average of daytime and nighttime score) over the 7 days prior to the first dose of double-blind study treatment, including the morning assessment at the randomization visit.

    <measure>Count of Participants Withdrawn From Study Drug Treatment Due to Meeting Stopping Criteria for Worsening Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who were withdrawn from study drug due to worsening asthma. Alert criteria for individual patients with worsening asthma were designed to ensure patient safety. The investigator determined whether the patient's overall clinical picture was consistent with worsening asthma and if the patient should be withdrawn from study drug treatment (but not the study) and be placed on appropriate asthma therapy in the interest of patient safety. An example of an alert criteria is:
Morning FEV1 by handheld spirometer as measured at home falls below the FEV1 stability limit (FEV1 &lt;80%) as calculated at the screening visit for the Run-in Period and at the randomization visit (Day 0) for the Treatment Period on 4 or more days out of any 7-day period.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

        <title>Standardized Baseline-Adjusted Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in One Minute (FEV1) Area Under the Effect Curve From Time Zero to 6 Weeks (AUEC(0-6wk))</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy variable was the standardized baseline-adjusted trough morning (pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) FEV1 AUEC(0-6wk). Pulmonary function measurements such as FEV1 were obtained electronically by spirometry at the randomization visit, each treatment visit (Weeks 2, 4 and 6) and any unscheduled visit (such as the early termination visit). The highest FEV1 value from 3 acceptable and 2 repeatable maneuvers (maximum of 8 attempts) was used. The least-square (LS) means, difference of LS means and its 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value represent the results obtained from the analysis of covariance with covariate adjustment for baseline, sex, age, current asthma therapy, and treatment.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in the weekly average of daily trough morning (pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) PEF by handheld spirometer over the 6-week treatment period. PEF were determined twice daily, in the morning and in the evening, before administration of study drug or rescue medications. A handheld spirometer was provided to patients and used to determine the morning and evening PEF throughout the study. The spirometer was programmed to record the highest PEF obtained from 3 valid attempts. Baseline was defined as the average of recorded trough morning PEF assessments over the 7 days prior to the first dose of double-blind study treatment, including the morning assessment at the randomization visit. The LS means, difference of LS means and its 95% confidence interval, and p value are obtained from the mixed model for repeated measures analysis with covariate adjustment for baseline, sex, age, current asthma therapy, treatment, week, and treatment by week interaction.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in the weekly average of daily trough morning (pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) FEV1 by handheld spirometer over the 6-week treatment period. FEV1 were determined twice daily, in the morning and in the evening, before administration of study drug or rescue medications. A handheld spirometer was provided to patients and used to determine the morning and evening FEV1 throughout the study. The spirometer was programmed to record the highest FEV1 obtained from 3 valid attempts. Baseline was defined as the average of recorded trough morning FEV1 assessments over the 7 days prior to the first dose of double-blind study treatment, including the morning assessment at the randomization visit. The LS means, difference of LS means and its 95% confidence interval, and p value are obtained from the mixed model for repeated measures analysis with covariate adjustment for baseline, sex, age, current asthma therapy, treatment, week, and treatment by week interaction.</description>

        <description>Asthma symptom scores were recorded in the patient’s diary each morning and evening before determining FEV1 and PEF and before administration of study or rescue medications. The Daytime Symptom Score was recorded in the evening on a scale of 0 (No symptoms during the day) to 5 (Symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities) plus the Nighttime Symptom Score in the morning on a scale of 0 (No symptoms during the night) to 4 (Symptoms so severe that I did not sleep at all) for a total score range of 0-9. Baseline was defined as the average of recorded daily asthma symptom scores (average of daytime and nighttime score) over the 7 days prior to the first dose of double-blind study treatment, including the morning assessment at the randomization visit. The LS means, difference of LS means and its 95% CI, and p value are obtained from the mixed model for repeated measures analysis with covariate adjustment for baseline, sex, age, current asth</description>

        <description>An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

          <title>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
          <description>An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>
          <population>The safety analysis set included all randomly assigned patients (ITT analysis set) who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In this analysis set, treatment was assigned based on the treatment patients actually received, regardless of the treatment to which they were randomly assigned.</population>
