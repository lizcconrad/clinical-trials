      RV6153 is a new medicine being developed for possible treatment of asthma and smoking related
      lung disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD).

      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics of single and repeat doses of RV6153
