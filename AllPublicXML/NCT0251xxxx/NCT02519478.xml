  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of the helmet-less tackling
      training (the HuTT Technique) intervention to reduce head impacts in high school football
      players and to gain an understanding of the neurocognitive effects of repetitive head impacts
      in football. The investigators hypothesis is that the HuTT Technique will result in a reduced
      frequency and magnitude of helmet impacts than the control group measured by a head impact
      measurement system. Also, the investigators hypothesize the HuTT Technique group will
      demonstrate less changes in neurocognitive scores in the mid and post season evaluations
      compared to the control group. Head impacts will be measured using the SIM-G impact monitor
      made by Triax Technology. The SIM-G impact monitor measures the location, magnitude, and
      direction of every head impact in real time and is stored on a protected cloud-based system.
      The sensor is worn by each athlete in a headband or skullcap. Neurocognitive function will be
      measured using the Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) test.
      The test is used as a tool to determine baseline neurocognitive function and is used in
      comparison if an athlete was to be injured to ensure he/she returns to baseline. ImPACT
      measures memory (verbal, visual, working), processing speed and reaction time using a variety
      of tests. Subjects will be recruited from local high school football teams and will include
      freshman, sophomores and juniors. Since the study is expected to run for 2 years, seniors
      will not be eligible for participation. The target is to recruit at least 150 total subjects.
      All subjects will be equipped with a new helmet that is fitted to their head and a headband
      that will be used to hold the head impact telemetry sensor. In addition, all subjects will
      take an ImPACT test preseason, midseason and postseason. At the conclusion of each season,
      all of the impacts from the SIM-G impact monitor system and ImPACT test scores will be
      analyzed. The relevant outcome measures to be analyzed include head impact frequency,
      location, magnitude, symptom scores, memory, visual motor speed and reaction time composite
      scores. Statistical analysis will be used to determine if the HuTT intervention minimized
      head impacts and neurocognitive decline compared to the control group.

    <description>The HuTT program is modeled after a tackling drill progression common to the sports of rugby and American football, but participants do not wear helmets or should pads as they normally would in football. Drills will be executed at 50%-75% effort. The goal of the contact is to execute proper technique. Drills will be supervised at all times and feedback will be provided to confirm proper technique and correct improper technique. The HuTT drill will be completed in two phases and takes approximately 6-10 minutes per session. A research assistant will ensure adherence and standardization of the treatment throughout the season. Subjects in the intervention group will participate in HuTT 4 times per week throughout the 2 weeks of pre-season and 2 times a week during in-season.</description>
