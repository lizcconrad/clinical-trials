    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study was an open label, single-center 18-week study to compare basal and meal
      stimulated plasma gastrin levels before and after treatment with 3 intramuscular injections
      of 250 µg G17DT, with and without the concomitant administration of Omeprazole.

    <description>G17DT is a therapeutic immunogen, formulated as a white, sterile, semi-viscous, water-in-oil emulsion (30:70 weight for weight). It was manufactured and supplied by Nova Laboratories Ltd., in glass ampoules containing 0.5 mL at a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL, as a single dose to be administered by intramuscular injection.</description>
