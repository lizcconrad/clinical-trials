      This is an open-label, staggered dose-escalation, cohort expansion study that will enroll
      subjects at multiple study sites in the United States of America (USA) and Australia. The
      study will consist of two treatment arms:

        -  Low dose (100 mg) CC-90001 administered orally once daily (QD) for 12 continuous weeks.

        -  High dose (200 mg) CC-90001 administered orally QD for 12 continuous weeks. The high
           dose (200 mg) CC-90001 arm will not start until at least three subjects complete a
           minimum of 2 weeks of low-dose CC 90001 and the low dose treatment arm is determined not
           to meet the study dose escalation stopping criteria (Figure 2).

      Each subject will participate in a Screening (up to 4 weeks prior to treatment), a 12 week
      Treatment Phase, and a 4-week Follow-up visit. Subjects will be screened for eligibility.
      Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at
      Screening will return to the study site on Day 1 for assessments and to begin administration
      of a QD dose of CC 90001, according to the dose level in which the subject is enrolled. Three
      subjects will initially be enrolled to receive low dose CC-90001 (100 mg QD), and will be
      evaluated for all scheduled assessments through 12 weeks of treatment. Once a total of three
      subjects have completed the Week 2 visit, a decision to continue the study at the high dose
      level (200 mg QD) will be determined.

      If the criteria for escalation to the high dose (CC-90001 200 mg QD) are met, the low dose
      (CC-90001 100 mg QD) subjects will remain on low dose (CC-90001 100 mg QD) and six additional
      subjects will be enrolled at the high dose level (CC-90001 200 mg QD). If one of the three
      subjects at the low dose (CC-90001 100 mg QD) experiences an event that meets the individual
      subject dose stopping criteria, another three subjects will be enrolled in the low dose arm.
      Dose escalation to the high dose (CC-90001 200 mg QD) will not occur if two or more of the
      six subjects meet the individual subject dose stopping criteria. All subjects (low and high
      dose) will remain on CC-90001 for a total of 12 weeks unless an individual subject
      experiences an event that meets any of the individual subject stopping criteria. In addition,
      the dose of CC-90001 may be reduced CC-90001 200 mg QD to CC-90001 100 mg QD) for an
      individual who meets any of the individual subject dose reduction criteria. If two or more
      subjects in the high dose (CC-90001 200 mg QD) arm experience an event that meets the
      individual stopping criteria, the 100 mg QD dose arm may be repeated in three additional
      subjects, or the study may be stopped.

      Study visits will occur at Screening, Day 1, and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 (a
      Follow-up visit). Blood and urine samples will be collected at specified times for clinical
      safety laboratory assessments, pharmacokinetic analysis (how the drug affects the body), and
      pharmacodynamic analysis (how the body affects the drug). Safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.

                       disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), environmental or
                       chemical-related pulmonary fibrosis, other forms of interstitial pulmonary
                       fibrosis, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.

               8. No clinically significant laboratory test results as determined by the
                  Investigator.

               9. Male subjects agree to use barrier contraception NOT made of natural (animal)
                  membrane (eg, latex or polyurethane condoms are acceptable) when engaging in
                  sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential (FCBP) while on CC 90001
                  and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study medication. A FCBP is
                  defined as a sexually mature female who has not undergone a hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy or who has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least
                  24 consecutive months (ie, who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
                  consecutive months).

              10. All FCBPs must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1. Any FCBP
                  who engages in activity in which conception is possible must use two forms of
                  contraception simultaneously while on CC-90001 and for at least 28 days after
                  taking the last dose of CC-90001: one highly effective form (ie, hormonal,
                  intrauterine device, tubal ligation, vasectomized partner) and one additional
                  form (latex condom or any nonlatex condom NOT made of natural [animal] membrane
                  [eg, polyurethane], diaphragm, sponge). If one highly effective form of
                  contraception cannot be used, then two forms of barrier contraception must be
                  used, ie, latex condom or any nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural (animal)
                  membrane [eg, polyurethane] with either of the following: sponge with spermicide
                  or diaphragm with spermicide.

              11. Female subjects that are postmenopausal (defined as 24 months without menses
                  before Screening, with an estradiol level of &lt; 30 pg/mL and FSH level of &gt; 40
                  IU/L at Screening).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects will be excluded from enrollment if any of the following occur:

               1. Exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding
                  the first dose of CC-90001 administration, or five half-lives of that
                  investigational drug, if known (whichever is longer).

               2. Subjects who are part of the clinical staff personnel or family members of the
                  study site staff.

               3. Screening forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 40% predicted.

               4. Screening lung diffusion capacity (DLco) &lt; 20% predicted.

               5. Any condition other than pulmonary fibrosis that is likely to result in the
                  subject's death or increases the risk of death within a year from signing the
                  ICF.

               6. Known clinical diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension that currently
                  requires treatment.

                  other serious concomitant respiratory disorder other than pulmonary fibrosis, as
                  determined by the Investigator. Subjects with reactive airway disease, chronic
                  obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma may be included as long as, in the
                  opinion of the Investigator, fibrosis is the major contributing factor to the
                  subject's respiratory disorder.

               8. Use of any cytotoxic agents within 4 weeks of dosing.

               9. Currently being administered any targeted therapy for pulmonary fibrosis and not

                  period).

              10. Use of EsbrietÂ® (pirfenidone) or OfevÂ® (nintedanib) within 30 day prior to first
                  dose.

                  stable dose for â‰¥ 6 weeks duration prior to first study dosing (potential

                  OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT2 and have a narrow therapeutics index (eg, P-gp
                  substrate digoxin).

              13. Use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) at a dosage &gt; 3 grams per day within 2 weeks

                  that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

              16. History of recurrent bacterial infections (at least three major infections
                  resulting in hospitalization and/or requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment
                  within the past 2 years)

              17. History of Human Immunodeficiency (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C
                  Virus (HCV). Subjects treated for HCV who have a sustained virologic response of
                  6 months following final HCV treatment can be included.

              18. History of active malignancy within 5 years prior to signing the ICF, excluding
