      The purpose of this research study is to determine the amount of medicine absorbed in the
      lungs following dosing via eFlow nebulizer and Seebri® Breezhaler® with and without activated
      charcoal in subjects with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-dose per dosing period, five-way crossover study in
      subjects 40 to 70 years of age with a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD per Global
      Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines. After a subject provides consent
      for study participation, there will be a Screening Period lasting up to 3 weeks to determine
      study eligibility and to allow for appropriate washout of prohibited medications.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of 10 treatment Sequences. There will be a
      minimum of a 7-day washout period between each treatment visit. At each visit, subjects will
      receive one dose of study medication according to the sequence assigned.

      Subjects with a ≥ 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) based on
      review of the Visit predose value compared with the Screening value will be evaluated by the
      investigator for continuation in the study.

      Subjects taking theophylline will not be able to participate in the study.

         13. Recent documented history (previous 12 months) of substance abuse.

         14. .Positive urine drug screen at Visit 1 provided the subject is unable to produce a
             valid medical rationale for the test result (eg, prescription medication).

         15. Positive HbsAg, Hepatitis C antibody, or HIV 1/2 antibody test at Screening.

         16. History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to aerosol medications, β2-agonists,
             anticholinergics, or sympathomimetic amines.

         17. Significant psychiatric disease that would likely result in the subject not being able
             to complete the study, in the opinion of the Investigator.

         18. Participation in another investigational drug study where drug was received within 30
             days prior to the Screening Period, or current participation in another
             investigational drug trial in which study treatment is being administered, including a
             SUN-101 study

         19. Previously received SUN-101 (active treatment; formerly known as EP-101).

         20. Previously received any glycopyrrolate product within 28 days of Screening.
