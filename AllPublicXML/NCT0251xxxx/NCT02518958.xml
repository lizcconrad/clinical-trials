  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation protocol to determine the feasibility of co-administration of
      RRx-001 and nivolumab. Immune surveillance is an endogenous mechanism to cause remission of
      neoplastic growth. Epigenetic agents like RRx-001 are associated not only with enhanced gene
      transcription and restored expression of silenced genes but also with increased expression of
      pro-inflammatory mediators, upregulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells and de-repression of
      antigens that promote immune recognition of tumors. It is hypothesized that RRx-001, will
      prime or sensitize to immune checkpoint therapy targeting PD-1 interaction with nivolumab.

      This is an open-label dose escalation study, consisting of the following periods:

        -  1) Screening Period (Up to 16 days): Eligibility for the study will be determined by
           Screening tests, physical examination/medical history, and fulfillment of eligibility
           criteria. Potential participants are required to provide written informed consent prior
           to the performance of any study specific Screening procedures.

        -  2) Treatment Period (Day 1 to 57): Between 15 and 45 eligible male and female adult
           subjects will receive weekly RRx-001 for a total of nine doses and every other week
           nivolumab for a total of 5 doses (odd cycles) or 4 doses (even cycles). Study medication
           (RRx-001 and nivolumab) will be administered intravenously at the study center. The
           Treatment Period will end following the last dose of nivolumab. Subjects will attend the
           study center weekly for on-study assessments.

        -  3) Follow-up Period: Subjects that have completed nivolumab dosing will undergo a
           follow-up assessment monthly, up to 100 days, for the emergence of delayed toxicity with
           particular attention to delayed immune related toxicities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced, malignant, solid
             tumor(s) or lymphoma that are either refractory or is intolerant to, or has refused
             all standard available life-prolonging therapies.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease based on RECIST criteria version. 1.1.
