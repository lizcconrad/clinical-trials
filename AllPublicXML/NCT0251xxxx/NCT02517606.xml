  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic nonspecific low back pain is an important health condition with a high prevalence
      worldwide and it is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs to the society.
      Clinical practice guidelines show that many interventions are available to treat patients
      with chronic low back pain, but the vast majority of these interventions have a modest effect
      in reducing pain and disability. A biomechanical approach that has been raised is that a
      weakness of the hip abductors, extensors, and lateral rotators musculature (posterolateral
      complex - PLC) would lead to excessive contralateral pelvic drop during weight-bearing
      activities such as walking, running, climbing up or downstairs, generating an overload in the
      lumbar area. Although the strengthening of the hip PLC is largely used in clinical practice
      for treating patients with hip and knee injuries, there is still a lack of evidence regarding
      patients with low back pain. Therefore, questions remain about the efficacy of the hip
      dynamic stabilization as an additional intervention to conventional treatment in a well
      design trial with statistic power.

      Randomised clinical trial will be held in following the recommendations of the CONSORT
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). Will be recruited participants of both genders,
      aged between 18 and 60 years, with and without chronic nonspecific low back pain for over 3
      months without irradiation for lower limbs. Potential participants with chronic nonspecific
      low back pain will be referred by their doctors orthopedic surgeons and/or rheumatologists
      that will make all the assessments and routine exams, for example, Imaging tests,
      prescription drugs and referral to physical therapy care. The characteristics of participants
      will be collected through an evaluation form specially designed for this study. This
      assessment form will contain issues related to demographic and anthropometric data, plus
      information about the clinical picture of the participants, as for example the use of
      medications, physical activity level, educational level, prior history of back pain and
      duration of symptoms.The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of treatment (6
      weeks) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization.

      The data will be collected by a blinded assessor. The statistical analysis will follow the
      intention-to-treat principles.

    <description>The gait and step down kinematic parameters will be calculated with SIMI Reality Motion Systems. The subjects will be fitted with colors markers on the lower limbs and trunk. Our approach automatically processes video sequences gathered with a digital camera and extract the 2D joints' location and their angle trend over time. The peaks of the movements of the hip, pelvis and trunk in the frontal and sagittal planes will be evaluated and compared between groups before and after treatment.</description>
