      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the concordance between the 18F-PET/CT under
      thyrotropin stimulation and the diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging, in the
      detection of residual mass in 40 patients with partial response or relapsed differentiated
      thyroid carcinoma.

      The schedule and the procedures of the study are the following ones :

        -  Baseline evaluation :

             -  Clinical examination with neck echography after rhTSH stimulation

             -  Normal whole body scan

        -  First visit (inclusion):

           18F-FDG PET/CT DW-MRI of the neck if possible performed shortly after the PET CT or
           within following days

        -  Following visits: at 6 months and 12 months

             -  DW-MRI of the neck performed shortly after the PET CT or within following days.

             -  Ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration for cytology for detection of
                cervical metastases and identifying thyroglobuline in the needle washout fluid if
                needed and in case of positivity of either PET or DW-MRI exams.

             -  Histological assessment of biopsies if performed
