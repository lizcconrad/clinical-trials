  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates and validates a new classification proposed by Juodzbalys and Daugela in
      2013 predicting the complexity of impacted mandibular third molars surgical extraction,
      comparing it with other two, scientifically approved (Pell and Gregory, Winter)
      classifications.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The extraction of mandibular impacted wisdom teeth is the most widespread surgical procedure
      performed in oral surgery. There are many situations indicating the extraction of those teeth
      as well as risks and protective factors that may contraindicate it. A reliable classification
      predicting the complexity of the surgical procedure and the related risk of complications
      would greatly help the surgeon in the diagnostic phase.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate if the classification proposed by Juodzbalys and Daugela
      in 2013 could be effective in predicting the complexity of impacted mandibular third molars
      surgical extraction, and to compare its effectiveness with commonly used Pell and Gregory,
      Winter classifications.

      A blind expert surgeon will assess postoperatively all CBCTs (Cone beam computed
      tomographies) and OPGs (orthopantomographs) not older than 12 months, and will assign the
      score for each extracted tooth for the three classification (Juodzbalys and Daugela - Pell
      and Gregory - Winter). Duration of the surgical procedure, assessment of the surgical
      technique and of intra- and post-operative complications will be considered as the main
      parameters to evaluate surgical difficulty. VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) pain score and NSAID
      (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) pills count taken by each patient of the 7 days
      postoperative period will be also evaluated.

      Statistical unit analyzed will be the single tooth. It should be noted that if a single
      patient has a bilateral impacted tooth to be extracted it will be randomly selected only one
      to be analyzed. Patients will be divided into two groups according to Juodzbalys and Daugela
      classification score (x&lt;9≤y), two groups according to each predicted extraction difficulty to
      Pell Gregory (x&lt;Class 2B≤y) and Winter (x&lt;Horizontal impaction≤y) classifications.

    <description>Mandibular third molar surgery is a mandibular wisdom tooth removal procedure in which surgical access is required to completely remove a tooth. Even if the tooth is visible in the mouth without surgically exposing it, surgical techniques may be necessary to remove the tooth. This includes sectioning the tooth into two or more pieces, corticotomy, and removal with forceps and elevators, whether or not a soft tissue incision is made.</description>

        A total number of 110 (including eventual drop outs) third molar surgery patients will be
        selected randomly. One tooth per patient is going to be evaluated. It should be noted that
        if a single patient has a bilateral impacted tooth to be extracted it will be randomly
        selected only one to be analyzed. In total 104 extraction are going to be evaluated.
        Patients will be divided into two groups according to Juodzbalys and Daugela classification
        score (x&lt;9&gt;y). Sample size of 52 subjects per group was calculated to detect a mean
        difference between the two groups of 10 minutes with an expected SD of 18 minutes. Power
        was set at 80% and alpha at 0.05.
