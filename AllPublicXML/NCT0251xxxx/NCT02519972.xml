  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening with the use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces mortality from lung
      cancer. Relatives with family history of lung cancer are at increased risk of lung cancer
      compared to those without a family history in pooled analysis. A prospective trial using LDCT
      of lung to screen the relatives with family history of lung cancer is needed.

    <textblock>
      Investigators invited participants with family history to join in this study under the
      criteria of (1) relatives of the lung cancer patients; (2) age older than 55 years old or age
      older than the age of onset of lung cancer proband if the family members were less than 55
      years old; (3) compulsory signing the consent agreement after understanding the purpose of
      study and the exposure of radiation. The participants with (1) proved lung cancer either with
      or without treatment, (2) presence of hemoptysis or history of remarkable lung fibrosis, (3)
      any other cancer history or (4) chest CT examination within one year would be excluded from
      the study.

      The study was planned to enroll 1000 participants from simplex families and 500 participants
      from multiplex families for lung LDCT screening. Multiplex family was defined as two or more
      family members with lung cancers, and simplex family as one family member with lung cancer.

    <description>All the Low dose computed tomography of lung was performed with 64 slices multidetectors CT in single hold breath covering entire lung. The protocol of scanning parameters (120KVp, 40-80 mA, 1.25 mm or less in thickness) was standardized. The raw data would be reconstructed to axial images (3 mm thickness and interval) and coronal images (3 mm thickness and interval). The scan should be finished in a single breath (15-20 second) from the thoracic inlet to adrenal glands.</description>
