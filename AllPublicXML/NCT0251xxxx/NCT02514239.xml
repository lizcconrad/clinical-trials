  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI
      836909 administered by continuous i.v. infusion in patients with relapsed and/or refractory
      multiple myeloma. If the MTD is not reached based on safety findings, a recommended dose for
      further development will be determined. This will depend on the safety data,
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics data and potentially preliminary efficacy data. Secondary
      objectives are to document the safety and tolerability of BI 836909, to perform
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses and to evaluate relevant biological effects in
      terms of parameters of efficacy.

          -  Relapse or progression of disease with an indication for therapy as per investigatorÂ´s
             judgement at time of screening

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0, 1 or 2 at time of screening
