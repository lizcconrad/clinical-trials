  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is a risk factor for bad clinical events, such as heart failure, stroke,
      kidney failure and death. This risk is much higher in those with 'resistant' hypertension, in
      whom the blood pressure remains high despite more than 3 blood pressure medicines. Current
      estimates of the proportion of individuals with resistant hypertension may be an
      overestimate, since some of them are not actually adherent (i.e. not taking the medicines
      they are prescribed). Methods to detect non-adherence, such as asking the patient, counting
      pills, and getting records from pharmacy are not fool proof. Direct observed therapy (where
      patients are administered medicines under observation by a health care personnel) is quite
      useful to diagnose this, and is the standard of care in the Renal Hypertension Clinic, before
      more tests and interventions (such as CT scans, renal angiogram) are performed.

      In this study, the investigators will measure the proportion of patients with resistant
      hypertension who are non-adherent based on direct observed therapy, and follow them up to
      examine the impact of this diagnosis.

      This is a prospective, observational study.

      Patients fitting inclusion and exclusion criteria, after informed consent, will undergo the
      direct observed therapy test in the hypertension unit (this is usual care in the unit, which
      they will undergo even if they are not part of the study).

      The Direct Observation Therapy (DOT) Test includes the following components:

        1. Administer and observe ingestion of usual morning antihypertensive medications.

        2. Monitor BP every 30 minutes, using 5 readings of an automated oscillometric BP device (
           BP-TRU), until plateau affect achieved, defined as 3 consecutive cycles of BP readings
           declining by less than 10 mmHg per cycle).

        3. Registered Nurse (RN) repeats standing BP prior to initiation of 24 hour Ambulatory
           Blood Pressure Monitoring(ABPM).

        4. RN initiates 24 hour ABPM

      In addition, participants will undergo an additional 24-hour ABPM test 1 month after the DOT
      test is undertaken.
