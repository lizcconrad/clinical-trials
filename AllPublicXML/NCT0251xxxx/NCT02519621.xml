  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the efficacy and economics of two NPWT branded devices of
      wound healing outcomes. It is also designed to assess the effectiveness of negative pressure
      and negative pressure with continuous irrigation on multiple parameters of wound healing. It
      is a single-center, open-label, active controlled, parallel-group trial that aims to
      determine the efficacy of Quantum with simultaneous irrigation in the treatment of diabetic
      foot ulcers. Specifically, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either PRO
      negative press therapy with simultaneous irrigation; or PRO negative pressure therapy without
      irrigation; or KCI Ulta negative pressure therapy.

      Subjects will be taken to the operating room for the initial debridement procedure of the
      wound. At the end of the procedure, subjects who continue to meet all inclusion and no
      exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to be treated with either PRO, PRO
      with simultaneous irrigation (PROI), or KCI Ulta NPWT. Prior to study initiation sealed
      pre-numbered randomization envelopes will be provided to the research staff and used to
      obtain randomization assignment. Opening of the randomization envelop will occur
      intraoperatively at the conclusion of the initial surgical debridement of the wound and
      conformation of all eligibility requirements. Study staff will use the randomization number
      labels contained in the envelop. The number will become the subject ID. The assignment will
      be subjects randomized to PRO, PRO with simultaneous irrigation, or KCI Ulta NPWT.

      The research staff will note treatment assignments on the intra operative randomization CRF
      and instruct the investigator. Treatment therapy wound dressings will be applied in the
      operating room or in the patient's room immediately after surgery per the investigators
      discretion, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In order to ensure consistent
      study treatment, subjects will receive assigned treatment therapies within their study arm
      after the initial and any subsequent surgical debridements until the wound is deemed ready
      for closure or coverage by the Investigator.

      Subjects randomized to the PRO with simultaneous irrigation Treatment arm are the only
      subjects that will receive irrigation therapy at any time during the study period. If
      irrigation therapy is discontinued, subjects in the Treatment arm will transition to PRO NPWT
      without irrigation. Subjects randomized to the PRO Control arm will receive NPWT only from
      the PRO therapy unit.
