  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine how the viscosity (thickness) of an FDA approved gel made by
      Cook medical affects the ease in which endoscopic mucosal resections (EMR) - a type of
      endoscopic surgery performed for localised cancer - can be performed when the gel is injected
      submucosally. The lifting characteristics of the gel will be assessed by height and diameter
      and ease with which the subsequent EMR dissection can be performed. These characteristics
      would be assessed on excised human stomachs and colon, which are harvested during routine
      sleeve gastrectomy surgeries or colectomies, in an ex-vivo manner.
