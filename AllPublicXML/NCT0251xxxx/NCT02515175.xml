  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the reduction in viral shedding after vaccination with a new formulation
      of GEN-003 in subjects with genital HSV-2 infection. Two-thirds of the participants will
      receive GEN-003, one-third will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of a new
      formulation of GEN-003 for treatment of HSV-2 genital infection.

      Eligible subjects will enter a baseline period to collect anogenital swabs for 28 consecutive
      days prior to randomization. Each subject will receive up to 3 doses at 21 day intervals then
      complete a second set of anogenital swabs for 28 consecutive days after the third dose. Each
      subject will be followed for one year after the third dose.
