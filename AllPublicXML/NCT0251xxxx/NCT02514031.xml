      This is a study of ARQ-761 (beta-lapachone) with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in
      subjects with advanced (metastatic, unresectable, or recurrent) pancreatic cancer that has
      not been treated with gemcitabine.

      Screening:

        -  Demographic information (age, gender, race, ethnic origin).

        -  Physical exam and review of your past and present medical history including any
           surgeries a and/or infections;

        -  Vital signs (temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure); height, weight;

        -  Concurrent medications (medications whether prescribed or over-the counter that you have
           taken or are currently taking);

        -  Performance Status (how well you are able to perform daily activities)

        -  Review of any side effects that you may have experienced or may be experiencing before
           receiving the study drug and medications

        -  Blood will be collected for routine lab tests

        -  Urinalysis

        -  Pregnancy Test (if you are a woman of child-bearing potential)

        -  Radiologic evaluation (review of any CT scans you may have had)

        -  Tumor measurements:

        -  A CT scan (chest/abdomen/pelvis) is a special test that produces an image of your body
           using a. small amount of radiation. The image shows the body tissues and structures in
           three dimensions (3-D).

        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG), a tracing of the electrical activity of the heart;

        -  Oxygen saturation (measures how much oxygen the blood is carrying)

        -  Biopsy for correlative studies - if archived tumor specimen cannot be obtained, you will
           need to undergo a fresh biopsy

        -  Completion of a Quality of life questionnaire

      This visit may last approximately 1-2 hours. Visits that included radiologic evaluation may
      last longer, approximately 2-3 hours.

      The treatment consists of:

        -  A 2 week lead-in monotherapy of ARQ-761 - they will receive the current dose of ARQ761
           alone

           o The amount of ARQ-761 that will be given to you will depend on the time at which you
           are enrolled in the study.

        -  Afterwards the 28-day cycle of combination treatment of ARQ-761 along with gemcitabine
           (1000 mg/m2) + nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) will begin
