    <textblock>
      Early detection of viable residual tumor or early neoplastic recurrence represents a real
      challenge in monitoring patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy squamous cell
      carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.

      The locoregional recurrence rate is indeed high (up 40%) over the first two years of this
      therapeutic method.

      The conventional imaging methods such as CT and MRI appear limited in terms of sensitivity
      because of the many post-treatment changes are fibrosis, tissue edema and the tissue
      distortion.

      PET-CT 18F-FDG proves to be a non-invasive, reliable for the detection of residual tumor and
      metastasis, even in the absence of clinical signs.

      To date, the acquired CT examination in the same time and in the same position that PET is
      performed without iodinated contrast injection, used for anatomical identification and
      attenuation correction of PET fused images. The patient usually has a second CT imaging,
      centered on the neck with contrast injection iodized within the radiology department.

      To date, no team has yet studied the interest of the PET-CT 18F-FDG coupled with a CT scan
      with contrast injection iodized in the diagnosis of early recurrence in head and neck
      malignancies while interest of the contrast agent injection has been demonstrated in ovarian
      neoplastic recurrence research, pancreatic and colon.
