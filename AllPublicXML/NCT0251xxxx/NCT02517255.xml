  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic disease is responsible for one third of all deaths annually and is a major
      cause of comorbidities. While atherosclerosis is by itself a benign disease, it often leads
      to complications such as acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation. Rescue
      angioplasty is indicated if thrombolytic therapy fails. However, the benefits in reducing
      mortality and the amount of myocardium effectively saved are not well established. The
      development of new tools, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to identify myocardial
      area at risk and infarcted increased diagnostic accuracy. However, unlike the context of
      primary angioplasty, little is known about the relation between coronary epicardial and
      microvascular flow after rescue angioplasty and myocardial salvage. The objective of this
      study is to evaluate whether there is a relation between these flows and myocardial salvage
      identified by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). At the end of this research, the
      investigators hope to contribute to a better understanding of coronary flow and its relation
      to the amount of heart muscle saved after rescue angioplasty. This is an important
      information that can help understand which cases benefit most from rescue angioplasty.
