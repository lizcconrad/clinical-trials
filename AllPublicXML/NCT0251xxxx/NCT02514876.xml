      This study will evaluate the efficacy of 2D forward-looking and 3D Intracardiac
      Echocardiography (ICE) to guide septal punctures during Atrial Fibrillation ablation
      procedures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is at least 18 years old.

          -  Patient is undergoing an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure.

          -  Patient has a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) within the 48 hours prior to
             ablation procedure to rule out left atrial thrombus.

          -  Patient provides informed, written consent for participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in whom placement of an ICE catheter in the right atrium for adequate atrial
             visualization is not technically feasible (as evaluated and determined by the
             physician performing the procedure).

          -  Patients in whom transseptal puncture is relatively contraindicated.

          -  Patients in whom left atrial clot or dense spontaneous contrast is identified on TEE,
             which would increase thromboembolic risk.

          -  Women of child bearing potential, in whom pregnancy cannot be excluded.

          -  Patients unable to grant informed, written consent for participation in the study.
