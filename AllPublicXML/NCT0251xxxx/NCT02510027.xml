    <textblock>
      While there is broad consensus that HR-HPV detection is the best available primary screening
      test, there is no agreement about the most efficient and reliable triage procedure for HR-HPV
      positive women. Transient HR-HPV infections are very common, and the vast majority of these
      infections spontaneously regress after a year or two. Only a small fraction of cases will
      lead to persistent infection responsible for cervical neoplasia. The FRIDA Study is a large,
      population-based study that was designed to evaluate the performance and cost-effectiveness
      of different triage strategies for hrHPV-positive women in Mexico.

      The target population is over &lt;100,000 women aged 30 to 64 years who attend the Cervical
      Cancer Screening Program in 100 health centers in the state of Tlaxcala, Mexico. All women
      will be evaluated to determine hrHPV infection using the Cobas® 4800 HPV test. Triage
      strategies will be performed as reflex tests in all hrHPV-positive participants: HPV-16/18/45
      genotyping, detection of the E6 oncoprotein of HPV-16/18, cytology, and immunocytochemistry
      using p16INK4a/Ki67. Women with at least one positive triage test will be referred for
      colposcopy evaluation, where a minimum of four biopsies and an endocervical sample are
      systematically collected. Histological confirmation will be performed by a standardized panel
      of pathologists.

    <description>All women will be colposcopically evaluated in order to rule out any clinically evident invasive cancer. In cases of invasive cancer, patients will be referred to onco-gynecology services immediately. Before biopsy collection, endocervical sampling is performed using an Endocervex Brush®. A minimum of four biopsies are collected, at least one per quadrant, from the more suspicious area on cervical transformation zone. Histological evaluation of all samples (biopsies and/or endocervical curettage samples) will be evaluated for final diagnosis and confirmation of CIN2+ cases by two pathologists according to Mexico's Cervical Cancer Screening Programme's guidelines. An external expert-pathologist, will resolve discrepancies and render a final decision.</description>

      Two cervical samples will be collected using a Cervex-Brush® (Rovers®). The first collected
      sample will be placed in a vial containing BD CytoRich™ preservative (BD Diagnostics,
      Burlington, NC), and the second sample will be placed in a ThinPrep® vial (Hologic, Inc.,
      Bedford, MA). Both samples will be temporarily stored at room temperature at the health
      center until they are delivered to the lab facilities. Women who refuse a pelvic examination
      will be offered the option to self-collect a vaginal sample at the health facility or at
      their home that can be used for hrHPV testing. Only HR-HPV positive participants will move
      onto the cytology/molecular triage testing phase. After triage procedures, all remaining
      samples collected in either of the vials from HR-HPV positive women will be stored
      independently for additional analysis as required by the study procedures.
