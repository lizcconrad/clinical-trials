      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 90 Y
      TARE (Y90) in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with unresectable
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).

    <description>90Y TARE will be given on day 3 or 4 of cycle 1 and start at 75% of the dose calculated by the body surface area formula and escalated by 25% per cohort in combination with cisplatin 25 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 300 mg/m2 in cycles 1 and 2.
Once the 90Y TARE has reached the 100% dose level, the gemcitabine dose will increase to 600mg/m2 in dose level 3 and 1000mg/m2 in dose level 4. The cisplatin dose will remain at 25/mg/m2.
For all dose levels, from cycle 3 to cycle 8, the cisplatin dose will be 25mg/m2 and the gemcitabine dose will be 1000mg/m2.</description>

             by a multidisciplinary team that includes a hepatobiliary surgeon.

          -  No prior liver radiation therapy or immunotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma.

          -  Only previous single agent chemotherapy for ICC allowed.

          -  Patient may have prior liver resection.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years of age.
