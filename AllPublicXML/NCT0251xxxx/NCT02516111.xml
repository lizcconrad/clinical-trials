  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a single-centre, randomized, controlled clinical trial to
      evaluate and compare the clinical efficacy of autologous PRF, 1% alendronate (ALN) and 1.2%
      atorvastatin (ATV) gel placement with open flap debriedement in treatment of intrabony
      defects in patients with chronic periodontitis.

      Background: Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a second-generation platelet concentrate which
      releases various growth factors that promote tissue regeneration. Alendronate and
      Atorvastatin are known to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and were proposed to have
      osteostimulative properties by causing osteoblast differentiation in vivo and in vitro as
      shown by an increase in matrix formation. The aim of the present study is to evaluate and
      compare the efficacy of autologous PRF, 1% alendronate and 1.2% atorvastatin gel placement
      with open flap debriedement in treatment of intrabony defects in patients with chronic
      periodontitis.

      Methods: 120 CP subjects with IBD ≥3 mm deep and probing depth (PD) ≥5 mm, following scaling
      and root planing (SRP), were categorized into four treatment groups: 1) OFD 2) OFD with PRF
      3) OFD with 1% ALN gel and 4) OFD with 1.2% ATV gel. Clinical parameters including site
      specific plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD) and
      relative attachment level (RAL) as well as percentage radiographic intrabony defect depth
      reduction (DDR) were recorded at baseline before surgery and 9 months post-operatively.
