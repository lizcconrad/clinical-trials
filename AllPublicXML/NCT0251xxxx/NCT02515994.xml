      Randomized, double-masked, controlled, 2-arm parallel group, multi-site, 3-month dispensing
      study of Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) Investigational contact lens, compared
      with a marketed, monthly replacement contact lens. Subjects will wear the JJVCI
      investigational contact lenses on a daily wear basis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the JJVCI investigational
      contact lens by comparison to the marketed, monthly replacement contact lens, both worn for
      thirty days on a daily wear modality.

    <measure>Slit Lamp Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Slit Lamp Findings (SLF) were assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the FDA grading scale (Grade: 0, 1,2, 3 and 4) with grade 0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing successively worse findings (i.e. Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). This was performed on each subject eye at 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- and 12-week follow-up evaluations. The data was then dichotomized into two groups. Those with grade 3 or higher and those with grade 2 or lower. The number of SLF with grade 3 or higher by eye was reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Monocular best-corrected visual acuity was assessed using a Snellen (ETDRS) on a LogMAR scale at each follow-up visit 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- and 12- weeks for each subject and subject eye. LogMAR visual acuity was evaluated under high luminance high contrast condition. The average visual acuity across all visits was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular symptoms, problems and complaints were assessed by a questionnaire at each visit 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 8- and 12- week follow-ups. The number of events where subjects that responded 'yes' to the item &quot;Experienced Eye Symptoms or Problems?&quot; were reported.</description>

    <measure>Average Wear Time</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Average Wear time was recorded for each subject at each follow-up visit 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- and 12- weeks. The average wear time across all visits was reported.</description>

        <title>Slit Lamp Findings</title>
        <description>Slit Lamp Findings (SLF) were assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the FDA grading scale (Grade: 0, 1,2, 3 and 4) with grade 0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing successively worse findings (i.e. Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). This was performed on each subject eye at 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- and 12-week follow-up evaluations. The data was then dichotomized into two groups. Those with grade 3 or higher and those with grade 2 or lower. The number of SLF with grade 3 or higher by eye was reported.</description>
