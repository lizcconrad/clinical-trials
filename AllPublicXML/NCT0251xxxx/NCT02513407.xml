  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot research trial studies how well Eat, Move, Live (EML) works in reducing
      chronic disease risk in medically vulnerable communities. Obesity, unhealthy diet, and
      physical inactivity are linked to increased cancer risk, especially hormone-related cancer
      (example, breast cancer). Improving healthy lifestyle practices, namely increasing physical
      activity and encouraging healthy eating behaviors may reduce the risk of getting cancer and
      chronic disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Level of exercise.

      II. Reduction in barriers to exercise.

      III. Level of self-reported 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables consumption.

      IV. Reduction in barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption.

      V. Improvement in biologic/metabolic markers such as hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose,
      and body weight.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants complete an assessment on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors at
      baseline and attend 2 weekday sessions comprised of interactive education segment that is
      culturally responsive, and based on the community EML program, and topics including:
      nutrition guideline, nutrition label reading, comparison shopping/grocery store tour, recipe
      modification and healthy food preparation, eating healthy on a budget, and making healthy
      choices outside the home (e.g., restaurants) and physical activity over 1 hour led by
      Certified Health Educator (CHE), a physical activity conducted by Duarte Fitness Centers
      instructors over 30 minutes, and cooking/taste test demonstration co-led by the CHE and local
      chef over 30 minutes over 12 weeks. Participants are also prescribed and encouraged to
      participate in 3 days a week exercise classes (for &gt; 30 minutes) including salsa, Zumba and
      other aerobic exercises that are provided at Duarte Fitness Center.

      GROUP II: Participants receive a fitness tracker to track their physical activity and be wait
      listed to receive the intervention during month 10-12.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up immediately and at 3 months.

    <measure>Changes in plasma glucose level measured using point of care glucometer OneTouch Ultra® 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will convert plasma glucose into binary outcome variables and evaluate the effect on intervention on these outcomes controlled for significant confounders (age, income, and education will be evaluated for confounding in the logistic regression model). Chi-square goodness of fit tests will compare percent reduction in weight between the control and intervention groups. Chi square tests will be used to determine whether participants reduced weight by 3%. Repeated ANCOVA will be used. Outcome variables will be dichotomized to fit a logistic regression modeling procedures.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Chi-square test and Logistic regression analysis will be used to determine whether the intervention significantly motivated participants to consume 7-8 servings of fruits/vegetables per day, adjusting for significant confounders (e.g., age, baseline BMI). Additionally, the Cochran Q test will be used to evaluate changes on barriers to fruit/vegetable consumption at the baseline and follow-up time points.</description>
