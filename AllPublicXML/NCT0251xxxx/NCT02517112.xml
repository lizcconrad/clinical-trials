    <textblock>
      3-D Ballistocardiography (BCG) recording was performed in microgravity during the Spacelab D2
      missions on a single astronaut. The results from this experiment have been published in the
      literature: the influence of respiration have been demonstrated and the signal processing
      methodology for the reconstruction of the displacement in one cardiac cycle have been
      developed. A 3D-BCG sensor has been developed and a collaboration to perform a sustained
      microgravity experiment onboard the Russian segment of ISS has been initiated. To be
      integrated in the PNEUMOCARD device, this new sensor needs to be tested in microgravity
      before implemented on ISS.

      The aim of the present parabolic flight study is to serve as a feasibility demonstrator and
      test bed in order to evaluate the feasibility of 3D-BCG in sustained microgravity and to test
      whether the sensitivity of the developed 3D-BCG sensor is appropriate
