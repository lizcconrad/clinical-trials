      A randomized, double blind, active controlled study in approximately 40 opioid dependent
      subjects. The study includes a Screening period of up to 3 days and a 2-day, double blind
      induction phase (subjects confined to the clinic). Screening and the first day of treatment
      (Day 1) may occur on the same day or Screening may occur up to 3 days prior to Day 1.

      Opioid dependent subjects who provide informed consent at the Screening visit; have a
      Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) total score ≥12; and meet other entry criteria are
      eligible for enrollment into the study. Subjects will be confined to the clinic beginning on
      Day 1 (optional confinement on Day -1) and will remain there for up to 48 hours after
      administration of the first study drug dose.

             Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th edition (DSM-5)

          6. Clinical opioid withdrawal scale (COWS) total score ≥12 prior to dosing on Day 1

          7. Subject is otherwise in good general health in the judgment of the Investigator as
             determined from the physical and oral examination findings.

          8. Subject is committed to getting help for their opioid dependence, in the judgment of
             the Investigator.

          9. Subject has at least 1 verified contact.

             diagnosis of substance use disorder (excluding opioids and tobacco)

          4. Prolonged QT interval by medical history, family history, or current electrocardiogram
             (ECG) finding

                  (intent to act) or 5 (specific plan and intent) on the electronic Columbia
                  Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS)

               -  History of suicidal behavior ≤1 year prior to Baseline (actual attempt,
                  interrupted attempt, aborted attempt and/or preparatory acts/behavior) on the
                  electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS)
