  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open-labeled phase I trial based on a dose escalating study design
      assessing two dose levels of sirolimus when prescribed in combination with metronomic
      cyclophosphamide (CP), methotrexate (MT) and zoledronic acid (ZA) followed by an expansion
      cohort once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is established.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation part of the trial will be concerned on adults with advanced solid tumor
      with bone metastasis and young and adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic osteosarcoma.

      The Expansion cohort will be conducted on young and adult patients with unresectable locally
      advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma.
