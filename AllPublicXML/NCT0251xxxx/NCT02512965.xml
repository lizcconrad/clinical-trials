      The purpose of this study is to find out if SBRT is better than CRT at controlling pain in
      the spine 3 months after receiving treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because while there is some evidence suggesting that SBRT may
      improve treatment for patients with spine metastases, more research is needed to determine if
      it is better than CRT. The first part of the randomized trial (phase II) looked at whether it
      was possible (feasible) to provide these treatments in cancer centres across Canada, by
      aiming to recruit 54 participants within 18 months. This part of the study was successfully
      completed in early 2017. The second component of this study, called a randomized phase III
      trial, is now underway. It involves recruiting another 98 participants to receive either CRT
      or SBRT, using the same study procedure as in the feasibility study. We will continue to
      obtain information about whether SBRT is better than CRT at controlling pain.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of cancer (excluding seminoma, small cell lung
             cancer and hematologic primaries).

          -  Spinal metastasis documented with MRI and suitable for treatment with radiotherapy
             with the following characteristics:

               -  Painful, as defined by a pain score ≥ 2 for worst pain in the planned target
                  treatment volume;

               -  ≤ 3 consecutive spinal segments involved by tumour to be included in the planned
                  target volume. The patient may have other spinal metaastases to be treated as per
                  the radiation oncologist's discretion, but the eligible spinal metastatic site
                  has to be one where there is pain and no more than 3 consecutive segments to be
                  included as clinical target volume and appropriate for either 20 Gy in 5
                  fractions or 24 Gy in 2 fractions per the randomization.

          -  There is no plan to change the pain medication on the first day of protocol treatment
             with radiotherapy.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2.

          -  Seen by a radiation oncologist and judged to be appropriate for participation in this
             study including ability to tolerate protocol radiotherapy (SBRT or CRT).

          -  Age of 18 years or older.

          -  Patient is able and willing to complete the Patient Diary (pain and analgesic use).

          -  Patient is able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the quality of life
             questionnaire in either English or French. The baseline assessment must be completed
             within required timelines, prior to randomization. Inability (illiteracy in English or
             French, loss of sight, or other equivalent reason) to complete the questionnaires will
             not make the patient ineligible for the study. However, ability but unwillingness to
             complete the questionnaires will make the patient ineligible.

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in
             the trial to document their willingness to participate.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.

          -  In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 3 weeks of
             patient randomization. From the time of successful treatment planning, no more than 12
             days can elapse before the first fraction of radiotherapy is delivered.

          -  Women/men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use a highly effective
             contraceptive method. A woman is considered to be of &quot;childbearing potential&quot; if she
             has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to
             routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual
             celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy
             prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal
             ligation, or vasectomy/vasectomized partner. However, if at any point a previously
             celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for
             use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for
             beginning contraceptive measures.

          -  Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test to determine eligibility as
             part of the Pre-Study Evaluation; this may include an ultrasound to rule-out pregnancy
             if a false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic gonadotropin
             is high and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour production of
             hCG, as seen with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if an ultrasound
             is negative for pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have a pacemaker, such that MRI cannot be performed or treatment cannot
             be delivered safely.

          -  Patients with prior treatment with any radionuclide within 30 days prior to
             randomization.

          -  Patients with prior radiation to the spinal segment intended to be treated with
             protocol radiotherapy such that the protocol therapy cannot be delivered as intended.

          -  Patients with prior surgery to the spinal segment intended to be treated with protocol
             radiotherapy.

          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy within 1 week prior to administration of
             protocol radiotherapy or who are expected/planned to receive chemotherapy within one
             week of completing protocol radiotherapy. Centre guidelines regarding administration
             of targeted non-cytotoxic therapy must be followed with the proviso that no systemic
             anticancer therapy should be administered within 24 hours prior to and
             post-radiotherapy. Endocrine therapy may be administered during radiotherapy as per
             the discretion of the treating physician.

          -  Patients with spine instability as judged by a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score
             (SINS) of more than 12.

          -  Patients with symptomatic spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome resulting
             from bony compression or epidural compression of the spinal cord and cauda equina,
             respectively.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.
