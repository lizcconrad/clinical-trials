    <textblock>
      Awake intubation is a recommended safety procedure in specific cases where the intubation or
      ventilation before general anesthesia is at risk.

      Numerous techniques to allow awake intubation have been described, such as pure awake
      technique, local anesthetics or intravenous sedation for example.

      Hypnosis is used for various operating room techniques and surgeries. The investigators aim
      to analyze the feasibility of awake laryngoscopy and intubations on patients placed under
      hypnosis alone.

      Awake intubation is a recommended safety procedure in specific cases where the intubation or
      ventilation before general anesthesia is at risk.

      Numerous techniques to allow awake intubation have been described, such as pure awake
      technique, local anesthetics or intravenous sedation for example.

      Hypnosis is used for various operating room techniques and surgeries. The investigators aim
      to analyze the feasibility of awake laryngoscopy and intubations on patients placed under
      hypnosis alone.

      Once patient will consent to be enrolled in the study, the same physician, trained in
      hypnosis, will accompany the patient in the operating room and place him into a hypnotic
      state. Once this hypnotic state is achieved, an oro-tracheal laryngoscopy will be performed
      with an Airtraq videolaryngoscope by an experienced anesthetist, specialised in the
      management of the difficult airway. If conditions allow it, the laryngoscopy will be followed
      by an oro-tracheal intubation.

      A questionnaire assessing objective and subjective criteria from the patient and from the
      airway specialist will be collected.
