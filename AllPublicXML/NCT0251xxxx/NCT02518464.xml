  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study treating 40 subjects to assess the
      hypothesis that P2Y, G protein-coupled 12 (P2Y12) inhibition with Brilinta/ticagrelor (90 mg
      by mouth (PO) twice a day) reduces episodic and/or chronic migraine headache symptoms in
      patients with right to left shunt. Headache frequency while on Brilinta/ticagrelor will be
      compared with the documented baseline for each subject. If the Brilinta/ticagrelor therapy
      was effective (&gt; 50% reduction in monthly headache days), the subject could elect to continue
      therapy for an additional two months (56 days), while continuing to complete daily headache
      logs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headaches are poorly understood, and can be severely debilitating. Many types of
      drugs have been tried in migraine sufferers including anti-depressants, anti-seizure
      medications, blood pressure medicines and others. The investigators have shown that in a
      small number of patients, a certain type of blood thinner (Clopidogrel) can reduce or
      eliminate migraine headaches in patients who also have a hole in the heart wall that allows
      flow from the right side of the heart to the left. Ticagrelor is a blood thinning drug which
      works in the same way as the clopidogrel, but is broken down by the body differently and thus
      allows everyone to use it. The investigators wish to test this medication to see if it works
      as well, or better than the clopidogrel.

    <description>A participant will be considered to have achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (a &quot;Responder&quot;) if she/he has &gt;50% reduction in the number of monthly headache days during the month of therapy compared with participant's own baseline. If there is &lt; 50% reduction in the number of migraine days, she/he will be considered a Non-Responder.</description>

    <description>Interventions include the following: All participants will have a loading dose of Ticagrelor (Brilinta) 180 mg administered in the office at the time of enrollment. Thereafter, for 28 days, Ticagrelor 90 mg tablet will be taken once in the morning and once in the evening, as close to 12 hours apart as possible. Each day, the subject will receive a text message reminder to login to the website, to record her/his headache activity.</description>

    <description>Patients will be loaded with 180 mg of Ticagrelor during the enrollment office visit and provided with a 28 day supply of Ticagrelor, 90 mg twice per day. P2Y12 reactivity unit (PRU) testing will be conducted at 7-14 days. If the patient has a positive response, they will have the option of continued access of Ticagrelor 180 mg for another 2 months. Participants will be reminded via text message daily to complete a headache survey on line in order to track their headaches.</description>
