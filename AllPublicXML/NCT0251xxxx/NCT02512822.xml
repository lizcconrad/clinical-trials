      To evaluate the efficacy of novel noninvasive RF technology for reduction of submental fat.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, Novel radiofrequency (RF) technology was introduced as a promising tool for
      non-invasive body and face contouring, which can heats subcutaneous fat up to 45℃
      continuously without surface damage and induces adipocytes apoptosis.

      Subjects with an excessive subcutaneous fat on the submental area received twice treatments
      at 1-month intervals. Clinical outcomes including the thickness of the submental fat
      (measured by ultrasound) and the submental circumference (measured by a tape measure), and
      clinical photographs were obtained at baseline, and 1-month and 6-month after last treatment.
