  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The literature has shown that supervised exercise programs for patients with PAD and who
      report intermittent claudication (IC) have improved health outcomes, but this is not locally
      available. Introducing the use of a pedometer may act as a method to encourage patients to
      continue on their independent exercise regimen. There is very little literature which has
      examined the effectiveness using pedometers as a measure of compliance within this
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been established that exercise therapy has a central role in the management of
      peripheral arterial disease. Such treatment should be comprised of intermittent walking of
      sufficient distance to induce significant discomfort, and be carried out over a period of at
      least several months. Supervised exercise training utilizing intermittent treadmill walking
      is a well-validated treatment for claudication. Most prospective randomized single site
      studies have reported significant improvement in walking distance following supervised
      exercise training but not with non-supervised regimens.

      Furthermore, this has been acknowledged in both the current AHA/ACC 'Guidelines for the
      management of patients with peripheral arterial disease', which recommends supervised
      exercise training as an initial treatment modality with a Class 1A level of evidence
      (highest), as well as in the TransAtlantic Intersocietal Consensus, which provides an 'A'
      categorical recommendation. In spite of these peer-reviewed, published recommendations,
      supervised exercise training remains little used, expensive, not reimbursed by Ontario Health
      Insurance Plan, and therefore is rarely available to patients with claudication in Ontario.

      The purpose of this multicentre study is to examine whether the use of a pedometer enhances
      patient compliance with walking as compared to usual care.
