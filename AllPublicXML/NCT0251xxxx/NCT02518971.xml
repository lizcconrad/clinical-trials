  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic tamsulosin in reducing the incidence
      of postoperative urinary retention in primary total knee and hip arthroplasty patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic administration of tamsulosin will be compared to a placebo to evaluate the
      effectiveness in reducing the incidence of postoperative urinary retention in total hip and
      knee arthroplasty patients.

    <time_frame>Postop day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who have not developed POUR will have two consecutive, spontaneous urine voids with residual volume of less than 200 mL, as determined by bladder scan or straight catheterization. Patients who do not successfully have the two spontaneous urine voids of less than 200 mL will be considered as having developed POUR. The incidence of POUR will be compared statistically between those taking and not taking tamsulosin at the time of surgery.</description>
