  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because a large proportion of the embryo's quality is dependent upon the egg, this
      investigation focuses on treatment of the oocyte during in vitro maturation (IVM). In typical
      IVF cycles, the egg is recovered when it is mature and ready to be fertilized. However, at
      this point the oocyte's quality has been set, and cannot be altered. Therefore, to have an
      impact on oocyte quality the use of in IVM is critical. Development of a successful IVM
      protocol for clinical use would not only provide an option for women of advanced maternal
      age, it would also reduce the cost of IVF due to fewer exogenous gonadotropins used for
      stimulation, and significantly lessen the risk of ovarian hyper-stimulation.

      The objective of this research study is to evaluate a newly developed oocyte maturation media
      system for human clinical use in assisted reproductive technology (ART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel device (IVM media system), is designed to support nuclear maturation of immature
      oocytes recovered after minimal ovarian stimulation with no LH/hCG administration, and
      improve oocyte competence. This may result in development of a greater number of embryos to
      the blastocyst stage.

      FSH is administered starting on cycle day 3 to stimulate follicle growth. When the leading
      follicle reaches 12-14 mm, egg retrieval will be scheduled. No hCG/LH trigger will be
      administered. Specially designed maturation media is used to collect and culture the immature
      eggs once recovered from the follicle. Once the eggs have matured in vitro, fertilization and
      embryo culture, vitrification and comprehensive chromosomal screening will be completed as
      per standard operating procedures.
