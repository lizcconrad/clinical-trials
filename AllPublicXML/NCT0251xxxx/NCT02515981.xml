      The New Hampshire Medicaid Wellness Incentive Program (WIP) will address both the health
      disparity and increased costs by providing incentivized health promotion programs to
      overweight or obese and/or tobacco-smoking Medicaid beneficiaries receiving services at New
      Hampshire's 10 regional Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs).

    <textblock>
      In the New Hampshire Medicaid Wellness Incentive Program, multiple program options will fall
      into two categories: (1) Supported Fitness and Weight Management and (2) Supported Smoking
      Cessation. Eligible participants are able to participate in 1 or both of the programs. The
      program options for Supported Fitness and Weight Management are: 1. Fitness Club Membership
      for 12 months, 2. Fitness Club Membership plus weekly meetings with a Health Mentor for 12
      months (In SHAPE), 3. Weight Watchers Membership for 12 months, 4. In SHAPE plus Weight
      Watchers for 12 months. The options for Supported Smoking Cessation are: 1. Prescriber
      meeting to discuss smoking cessation treatment options, 2. Prescriber meeting plus NH State
      Tobacco Helpline, 3. Prescriber meeting plus Telephone-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
      Smoking Cessation. Vouchers for memberships to community fitness centers and formal weight
      loss programs will be provided, as well as incentives for participation and positive
      outcomes. An equipoise stratified randomization design will be used to preserve the research
      benefits of randomization while maintaining the highly valued opportunity for consumer
      choice. Research assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and
      12 months.
