    <textblock>
      Acute self poisoning is a leading cause of suicide attempts and leads to frequent emergency
      department visits. However, the exact epidemiology of acute self poisoning is not known. The
      description of the clinical pathway and the characteristics of patients with acute self
      poisoning could lead to an improvement in emergency care.

      The Investigators will conduct a 48h observational study in emergency services in France.
      Investigators primary objective is to gathered epidemiological clinical and treatment data
      during emergency dispatch, prehospital care and inhospital emergency care.

      Acute self poisoned patients will be prospectively and anonymously recruited by emergency
      physicians in charge during two days. Acute self poisoning is define as follow: intentional
      medicine intake in the 24h hours before emergency department admission.

      Epidemiological, clinical, toxicological and treatment data will be gathered. Outcome of
      patient will be prospectively assessed at 30days.

      All data will be transmitted to the principal investigators. Then, 20% of the data will be
      monitored by an independent committee.

      Exhaustivity will be retrospectively assessed by the number of inclusions in 10 emergency
      centers divided by the total number of possible inclusions in these centers.

      Finally, an independent statistician will be in charge of the analysis.
