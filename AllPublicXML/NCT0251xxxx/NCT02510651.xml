  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ORSHFS grafts yielded lower cell counts than NCECS but the M-K ratio and resultant
      repigmentation did not show significant difference with better healing of the donor site.
      Compared to cryoblebs, CO2 gave more homogenous pigmentation. The acral sites showed better
      results using combination of donor NCECS and recipient cryoblebs.

      Background: Melanocyte-keratinocyte suspension (M-K susp) is gaining popularity for vitiligo
      treatment. Few studies have addressed procedure-related variables.

      Objective: To assess the effect of different M-K susp procedure-related variables on the
      clinical outcome in stable vitiligo.

      Methods: This retrospective study included 40 cases with stable non-segmental vitiligo
      treated by M-K susp followed by narrow band- ultraviolet B phototherapy twice weekly. Donor
      site was either a skin graft in non-cultured epidermal cell suspension (NCECS) (34 cases) or
      hair follicle unit in Outer Root Sheath Hair Follicle Suspension (ORSHFS) (6 cases).
      Recipient site was prepared by either cryoblebbing (24 cases) or carbon dioxide (CO2)laser
      resurfacing (16 cases). Cell counts and viability were recorded in the cell suspensions, and
      tissue melanocytes and keratinocytes were examined by Melan A and Cytokeratin respectively.
      Assessment of repigmentation was done 18 months after the procedure.
