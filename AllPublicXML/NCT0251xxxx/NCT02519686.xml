  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the trendelenberg (TD) position (position in
      procedures that involves placing the patient at an angle so that their head is lower than
      their feet on the procedure bed) in select patients undergoing colonoscopy is superior than
      the left lateral (LL) position (patient laying on their side, traditionally used for
      colonoscopies) in terms of decreasing time necessary to pass the colonoscope through the left
      colon, and decreasing the difficulty of the procedure.

      The colonoscopists will be asked to rate their prediction of difficulty of the procedure
      prior to the colonoscopy and to rate the ease of procedure after the colonoscopy. The
      clinical experience of the study investigators is that TD positioning is superior to LL
      positioning in patients with risk factors for having a difficult colonoscopy (thin women;
      those with diverticulosis- small bulging pouches present in the colon; or prior pelvic
      surgery).

      Patients with risk factors for difficult colonoscopy will be randomized to undergo
      colonoscopy while positioned in the TD position or the LL position during advancement of the
      colonoscope through the sigmoid colon. The sigmoid colon is a section of the colon, proximal
      to the rectum, that is curved. The sigmoid colon is a normal component of GI tract anatomy,
      although due to it's shape, especially with the risk factors listed previously; can cause
      challenges to inserting the colonoscope.

    <description>Trendelenburg (TD) positioning (supine with head tilt-down) is used in abdominal and gynecological surgery as well as during colonoscopy to allow better access to the pelvic organs, as gravity pulls the bowel out of the pelvic cavity and the rectosigmoid angle straightens.</description>
