    <textblock>
      The work plan will have the following S&amp;T components. Component 1: Cross-sectional Study

      Cross-sectional study will be of 1.5 years where 400 women from rural will be screened
      randomly for the vitamin D deficiency and its determinants including duration of sun
      exposure.

      Component 2: Prospective Study

      This open-label randomized placebo-controlled trial would be done in 150 pre-diabetic women
      with vitamin D deficiency. The women will be recruited from cross-sectional study, out
      patient department and health camps and they will be followed up for 2 years. The women will
      be randomized into two groups; lifestyle modification counseling along with intervention with
      either vitamin D or placebo. The levels of vitamin D and blood glucose will be assessed
      periodically (every 6 months). In those having recurrent vitamin D deficiency, the course of
      vitamin D will be repeated. At the end of the study, incidence of T2DM in both groups will be
      compared.
