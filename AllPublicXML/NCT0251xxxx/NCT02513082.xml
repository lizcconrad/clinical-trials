    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness of adductor canal block and femoral nerve block
      in total knee arthroplasty in general anesthesia. Two block techniques were proved safe and
      effective in pain control after total knee arthroplasty. But some authors insist that
      quadriceps muscle power was decreased by femoral nerve block. The study design is a
      double-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty patients planed to undergo simultaneously
      bilateral total knee arthroplasty are randomised to receive ultrasound-guided femoral nerve
      block on one leg and adductor canal block on the other, in addition to combined general
      anaesthesia. The primary outcome was comparative postoperative pain in either extremity at
      four, eight, 12, 24, 72 hours and 7days postoperatively. Secondary comparative outcomes
      included motor strength by cybex test.

    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty(TKA) is very popular in nowadays. But almost patients complained of
      postoperative pain and it affect the delay of early mobilization which prevent knee
      stiffness, lessens hospital stay and improves overall patient satisfaction and outcome of
      TKA. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or epidural analgesia is a conventional
      postoperative analgesia. Recently other block techniques like a adductor canal block and
      femoral nerve block were known for good methods of pain relief after TKA. However, femoral
      nerve block reduces quadriceps muscle strength thereby potentially compromising postoperative
      mobilization. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of pain treatment and
      the preservation of muscle function after the procedure of adductor canal block and femoral
      nerve block.

      The present study aimed to determine and compare the efficacy of adductor canal block and
      femoral nerve block combined with general anesthesia on (1) postoperative pain control, (2)
      early patient ambulation and functional recovery and (3) change of muscle power after total
      knee arthroplasty.
