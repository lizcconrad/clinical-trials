    <textblock>
      The Northwest Coalition for Adolescent Health (NWCAH) replicated the Teen Outreach Program
      (TOP) in five states across the pacific northwest including Idaho, Alaska, Montana, Oregon,
      and Washington. The purpose of this study is to measure: at the end of the program year, were
      TOP students less likely than control group students to report ever being pregnant or causing
      someone to be pregnant?

      TOP is a youth development and service learning program for youth ages 12 to 17 designed to
      reduce teenage pregnancy and increase school success by helping youth develop a positive
      self-image, life management skills, and realistic goals. The TOP program model consists of
      three components implemented in school, after school, or in community settings over nine
      months: (1) weekly curriculum sessions, (2) community service learning, and (3) positive
      adult guidance and support. The TOP Changing Scenes Curriculum is separated into four
      age-/stage-appropriate levels, Level 1 is typically for youth ages 12 or 13 and Level 4 is
      typically for youth age 17. The curriculum focuses on the presence of a consistent, caring
      adult; a supportive peer group; skill development; sexual health; and sexual behavior
      choices. The intended program dosage for each participant is a minimum of 25 weekly sessions
      (one per week at 40-50 minutes each) and at least 20 hours of community service learning over
      nine months. One or two facilitators, who plan the order of sessions based on the needs and
      interest of youth, implemented TOP in a group of 10 to 25 youth.

      In this cluster randomized controlled trial, middle and high school students were randomly
      assigned at the class level into either the TOP treatment group or the CV control group.

      After class eligibility was determined, the TOP facilitator began the consent process. Both
      active parental consent and student assent were required for students to participate in the
      study. The consent process was the same regardless of whether TOP and CV programs were
      delivered in already-formed classes, as a pull-out during the school day, or after school.
      The parental consent form clearly stated that the student was eligible to participate in one
      of two programs, which would be determined by chance. In signing the form, the parent
      consented to participation in both the program and the evaluation.

      Random assignment of the classes did not technically occur until completion of the baseline
      administration of the survey, as students could have been either added or subtracted from the
      class list until the time of survey administration. No one outside of PRA was informed of the
      outcome of random assignment until after the baseline survey was administered.

      All students, TOP and CV, were followed for two years. They completed a total of three
      surveys (baseline, a post-survey at the end of the school year, and a follow-up survey in the
      spring of the year following the intervention). Data were collected in groups, with
      questionnaires being read aloud to students. When students were absent or moved, interviews
      were also completed on the telephone or students were given a link to complete their surveys
      online.

    <description>Students in the control condition receive a benign intervention called the Community Voices (CV) program, which like TOP, meets in a group setting. The CV students are convened four times during the program year. Sessions are the same length as the TOP sessions. The first and last CV sessions are primarily focused on survey data gathering. At the two other sessions, CV students are convened to discuss current issues among young people in their community. The CV program specifically does not include any sexuality education or community service learning opportunities.</description>
