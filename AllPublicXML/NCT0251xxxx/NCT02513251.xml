    <textblock>
      Pain is defined as &quot;An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or
      potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.&quot; In particular, chronic pain
      has significant impact on health care cost and socio-economic aspects of the society. It is
      clear that the development of effective chronic pain management is paramount in reducing the
      significant socio-economic burden of this common healthcare problem.

      One of the difficulties in measuring outcomes in chronic pain patients is the subjective
      nature of pain. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was developed in 1975 with the aim of
      quantifying the subjective pain experiences of patients. Since then it has become one of the
      major assessment tools in evaluation of chronic pain patients during the course of
      treatments. The Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) developed in 1987 has further
      refined pain descriptors into &quot;sensory&quot; and &quot;affective&quot; domains, and incorporating the Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS) for easier administration in hospitals and clinics. The validity and
      reliability of both the original English and translated versions of MPQ and SF-MPQ have been
      well demonstrated. The latest version of Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2)
      included descriptive terms for neuropathic pain which expanded the scope of coverage on
      chronic neuropathic pain patients. It has also been evaluated in cancer pain patients.
      Translated versions of SF-MPQ-2 showed good reliability and validity. Therefore the
      investigators devised this study to (1) translate SF-MPQ-2 into Traditional Chinese-Cantonese
      (C-SF-MPQ-2) suitable for use in Hong Kong patients, (2) examine the validity, reliability
      and psychometric properties of this translated version in Hong Kong patients.

      Objectives of this trial

        1. To validate the C-SF-MPQ-2 among chronic pain patients in Hong Kong.

        2. To evaluate the validity, reliability and psychometric properties of the C-SF-MPQ-2 as
           an assessment tool for measuring pain.

      Trial design Prospective non-randomized trial with self-administered questionnaire in chronic
      pain patients.

      Methods The study will be carried out in 2 phases (I and II). Phase I refers to the
      translation process and phase II refers to the validation process.

      Since this study will be carried out at 2 pain centres (Hong Kong West Cluster Pain
      Management Centre and Kowloon East Cluster Pain Management Centre), approvals from Ethics
      Committee of Hong Kong West Cluster and Kowloon East Cluster will be obtained.

      (I) Translation of the original English version of SF-MPQ-2 into Traditional
      Chinese-Cantonese version (C-SF-MPQ-2) Forward translation shall be done by one pain
      specialist and one lay person with linguistic background. Both shall be native
      Chinese-Cantonese speaker with proficiency in English. Each translator shall produce a
      translated version independently. Afterwards the principle investigator will co-ordinate with
      both translators to come up with one commonly agreed translated version (version 1).

      Backward translation shall be done by one pain specialist who is a native English speaker
      with proficiency in Chinese-Cantonese (version 2). This will be compared to the original
      questionnaire. The principle investigator will discuss with all the translators on any
      discrepancy between version 2 and the original version and make necessary adjustments to
      version 1 to produce a revised version (version 3).

      The translated version 3 will then be tested on 5 randomly selected chronic pain patients
      from both pain management centres. They shall be native Chinese-Cantonese speakers. Consent
      will be obtained beforehand. An interviewer will inquire whether patients have any difficulty
      on completing the questionnaire or have any suggestions with regard to the translated terms.
      Any adjustments shall be made after receiving feedback from the interviewer to produce the
      finalized version (C-SF-MPQ-2).

      (II) Validation of C-SF-MPQ-2 A total of 220 chronic pain patients will be recruited for the
      process of validation. After obtaining consent, basic demographic information including age,
      sex, pain diagnosis and duration, education level, co-existing medical problems and
      employment status will be recorded. The C-SF-MPQ-2 will then be administered to patients. For
      the construct validity, the Chinese versions of Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (SF-36),
      ID-Pain and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) will be administered at the same time. For the
      test-retest reliability, the C-SF-MPQ-2 will be administered again after 2 weeks at the pain
      management centres during which patients should not receive any alternation in their pain
      management or intervention. Patients' data privacy and confidentiality will be ensured during
      the entire process of study.
