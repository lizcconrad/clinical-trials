  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) is an under researched area of clinical practice,
      largely in the management of acutely agitated and violent patients. The goal of this pilot
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to assess the benefit of medically monitoring patients
      that present with extreme agitation and/or violent behaviour to PES. Placing them in physical
      restraints and immediately administering chemical restraint, will enable medical monitoring
      of these potentially medically unstable patients. Investigators believe that this practice
      will provide safer management of patients, reduce risk to staff and other patients, reduce
      risk of undiagnosed medical conditions that underly the agitation, and increase clinical
      management and quality of care. Patients that come into the Emergency Department that are
      agitated and violent, where verbal-deescalation will not suffice, will be randomly treated
      with either immediate placement in seclusion (current practice) or be placed in physical
      restraints and given chemical restraint (as outlined in the BETA project guidelines). The
      same time interval assessments will be performed on both groups of patients including;
      medical monitoring and agitation scale assessment. Data will also be collected on number of
      violent episodes, code whites, required increase in the use of physical restraints, length of
      intervention, and more. This assessment will enable a comparison between the current practice
      and the proposed practice to establish evidence based clinical guidelines for the management
      of acute agitation in PES, where de-escalation techniques are ineffective and the lack of
      medical monitoring is harmful to the patient and can negatively effect their outcome. In
      order to best assess the importance of medical monitoring for such patients, a pilot study
      must be performed to assess the feasibility of such a phase III RCT study.
