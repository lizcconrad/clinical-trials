      Title: A Prospective Household observational cohort study of Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial
      virus and other respiratory pathogens community burden and Transmission dynamics in South
      Africa (The PHIRST Study) This study will improve understanding of the community burden of
      influenza, RSV, pertussis, tuberculosis and pneumococcal infection in South Africa. It will
      also provide data on the carriage prevalence of meningococcus and diphtheria. The data
      generated from this study will also provide important information on the transmission
      dynamics of influenza, RSV, pertussis and pneumococcus in the community allowing to better
      strategize interventions (including targeted vaccination strategies) and evaluate their
      potential impact. Moreover, there is an absence of prospective data on tuberculosis infection
      from high tuberculosis burden countries. The data generated will both inform modelling of
      transmission, sample size for prevention studies and surveillance assessing the impact of the
      National Tuberculosis Control Program.

      Background: Information on the community burden of influenza is essential to inform control,
      but is not routinely collected. For example, influenza transmission models, which are widely
      used to inform the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of vaccines, antivirals and
      non-pharmaceutical countermeasures, depend on valid epidemiological estimates of the
      community occurrence and transmission of disease. While community level studies such as the
      Flu Watch cohort study in the United Kingdom have been implemented in recent years in
      high-income countries, the community burden of influenza remains largely unknown in lower-
      and middle-income countries, especially in Africa where the burden of influenza may be
      higher. In addition, no data exist on the household transmission dynamics of influenza
      viruses. Such data could provide important insight to inform targeted interventions, for
      instance, how to maximize indirect effects of influenza vaccination to protect more
      vulnerable groups for which the available influenza vaccines are currently not licensed or
      the efficacy is low (e.g. children &lt;2 years of age).

      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of childhood acute lower respiratory
      tract infection, especially among infants &lt;3 months of age. While a RSV vaccine is currently
      not available, the efficacy of promising RSV candidate vaccines is being evaluated.
      Alternative strategies for RSV vaccination have been proposed, including vaccination of older
      age groups to indirectly protect vulnerable infants by reducing circulation of virus in the
      population or preventing chains of transmission to the infant. Nonetheless, to evaluate these
      effects knowledge of the RSV burden, transmission dynamics and source of infection for
      infants in the community is needed.

      Pneumococcus is the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia. The pneumcoccal conjugate vaccine
      (PCV) was introduced into the expanded programme on immunisation in 2009. Data on carriage
      prevalence, dynamics of carriage and interaction with other respiratory pathogens will be
      helpful to guide interventions to target pneumococcal disease not prevented by vaccination.
      Both diphtheria and pertussis have been identified as emerging pathogens in South Africa in
      recent years, giving rise to outbreaks in 2014 and 2015 after years of low prevalence.
      Meningococcus is an epidemic-prone disease causing cyclical outbreaks in South Africa but
      little is known about the carriage prevalence in South Africa. Annual incidence of
      tuberculosis in Southern Africa is the highest globally, with Swaziland, Lesotho and South
      Africa have the highest rates of tuberculosis in the world. Moreover, in South Africa
      tuberculosis is the leading cause of death on death notification forms and, in HIV-infected
      individuals (both not yet receiving antiretrovirals and whilst taking antiretrovirals), is
      the leading serious opportunistic infection.

      Data on the carriage prevalence and/or transmission dynamics of these pathogens are important
      to guide control measures, including targeted vaccination strategies. Prevention efforts to
      limit transmission in households are often recommended but data on household transmission and
      the impact of HIV infection are limited to date.

      Objectives Primary

        -  To estimate the community burden of influenza and RSV, including: (i) the incidence of
           influenza and RSV infection in the community; (ii) the symptomatic fraction associated
           with influenza and RSV infection; (iii) the severity associated with symptomatic
           infections; and (iv) the fraction of individuals with symptomatic infection seeking
           medical care.

        -  To assess the transmission dynamics of influenza and RSV infections in the community,
           including: (i) the estimation of the household secondary infection risk (SIR), serial
           interval and length of shedding; (ii) the estimation of transmission of infection
           between age groups within the household and possibly the community; and (iii) the
           estimation of the effective reproductive number (Rt) and its variation over time in the
           community.

      Secondary (selected)

        -  To estimate the symptomatic fraction, the severity associated with symptomatic
           infections and the fraction of individuals with symptomatic infection seeking medical
           care among influenza or RSV positive cases by HIV serostatus and age.

        -  To estimate the SIR and length of shedding of influenza and RSV among HIV-infected and
           HIV-uninfected index cases and the rate of acquisition of influenza and RSV infection
           among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected household members.

        -  To assess the role of asymptomatic infections in the household transmission of influenza
           and RSV.

        -  Determine the heterogeneity of influenza and RSV virus strains within household clusters
           and describe viral evolution within and between households as well as the association
           between virus strains and the duration of virus shedding and HIV status

        -  To describe and compare nasopharyngeal pneumococcal loads in healthy individuals by age
           and over time, and how the loads may be altered by respiratory viral infection,
           HIV-status and vaccination-status

        -  To identify the prevalence and duration of B. pertussis colonization within the
           community by age group, vaccine status and over time, the transmission dynamics within a
           household, and the proportion of individuals that develop symptomatic infection

        -  To determine the prevalence of N. meningitidis and C. diphtheria colonization within the
           community by age group at a single point in time each year

        -  To measure the annual incidence of tuberculosis infection in individuals living in study
           households and assess risk factors (including incident and prevalent HIV) for acquiring
           tuberculosis infection.

        -  To ascertain the impact of housing quality, fuel use and indoor air quality and selected
           measures of ventilation on tuberculosis infection and on household transmission of
           respiratory viruses and bacteria Methods: We will conduct a household-level community
           cohort study in a rural community in Mpumalanga Province where health and demographic
           surveillance (HDSS) is conducted (the Agincourt HDSS surveillance site) and selected
           urban areas in the Matlosana Muncipality in North West Province. Prospective,
           hospital-based surveillance for influenza- and RSV-associated severe acute respiratory
           illness has been conducted at these sites since 2010. The prospective cohort study will
           be conducted for 3 consecutive years, from 2016-2018, to include 3 consecutive RSV and
           influenza seasons. Approximately one hundred households (50 households per site, with an
           expected average number of household members of 5 to recruit a total of 500 enrolled
           individuals) will be randomly selected within the study population each year and
           consented to participate to the study. For each household member, serum will be
           collected quarterly (January-February, April-May, September-October and
           November-December) including before and after the RSV (February to May) and influenza
           (May to September) seasons and a final blood draw at the end of the year. The
           demographic characteristics of the household members will be collected on enrollment.
           Starting before the RSV and influenza seasons, upper respiratory tract samples will be
           collected twice-a-week by trained study nurses from all household members irrespective
           of the presence of respiratory symptoms throughout the year. During each visit the
           development of symptoms (using a severity score) and healthcare seeking behavior of
           symptomatic cases will be recorded. In addition, during winter at one household visit,
           an oropharyngeal swab will be collected from each individual for testing for
           meningococcus and diphtheria. Nasopharyngeal samples will be tested for the detection of
           RSV or influenza virus and pneumococcus and B. pertussis infection by real-time
           reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Blood samples will be tested
           for rise in RSV, influenza and pertussis antibody titers. From consenting patients,
           blood samples will be tested for HIV infection. For tuberculosis infection, we will do a
           tuberculin skin test (TST) at baseline and the end of the first year and annually
           thereafter in people are found to be TST negative at their previous test. HIV testing
           will be offered to all participants at baseline and then six monthly thereafter. All
           participants will have a sputum sample taken for culture at baseline and thereafter
           symptom screened for symptoms of tuberculosis monthly, and investigated with Xpert
           Mtuberculosis/Rif if symptoms of tuberculosis are present.

      The sample size of approximately 1500 individuals over 3 consecutive seasons will allow the
      estimation of 20% risk of infection and a 10% risk of illness with 95% CI and 5% desired
      absolute precision in the community. Individuals in the households enrolled in the first and
      second year of the study will be have a single follow-up visit towards the end of the 2nd and
      3rd year of the study (October). At this visit a blood specimen for testing for HIV
      infection, influenza and RSV serology will be collected and TST testing for individuals found
      to be TST negative at the previous test will be performed.

      Impact: This study will improve understanding of the community burden of influenza, RSV,
      pertussis, tuberculosis and pneumococcal infection in South Africa. It will also provide data
      on the carriage prevalence of meningococcus and diphtheria. The data generated from this
      study will also provide important information on the transmission dynamics of influenza, RSV,
      pertussis and pneumococcus in the community allowing to better strategize interventions
      (including targeted vaccination strategies) and evaluate their potential impact. Moreover,
      there is an absence of prospective data on tuberculosis infection from high tuberculosis
      burden countries. The data generated will both inform modelling of transmission, sample size
      for prevention studies and surveillance assessing the impact of the National Tuberculosis
      Control Program.
