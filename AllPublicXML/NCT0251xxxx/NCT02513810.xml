      DES are preferred over BMS for most patients, however prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy is
      required for patients treated with DES for prevention of late or very late stent thrombosis.
      which increases a risk of major bleeding. BioFreedom is a Biolimus A9-coated stent that
      consists of a stainless steel stent platform with a textured abluminal surface without use of
      any polymer in the coating. Biolimus A9 rapid release and polymer-free property may give
      BioFreedom the advantages of both DES and BMS that may require less duration of DAPT.
      BioMatrix Flex, Biolimus-eluting stent with biodegradable polymer, also demonstrated safety
      and efficacy. We will compare these two difference types of Biolimus A9-eluting stents with
      different duration of DAPT. With proven adequate and safe duration, we will compare between
      one versus more than six months of dual antiplatelet therapy after Biolimus A9-eluting stents
      implantation using different properties of BioFreedom and BioMatrix Flex.
