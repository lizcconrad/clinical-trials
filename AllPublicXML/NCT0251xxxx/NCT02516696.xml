    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase III study to investigate the efficacy of combination
      therapy with an induction phase utilizing a combination clarithromycin (Biaxin®),
      lenalidomide (Revlimid®), dexamethasone (Decadron®), in multiple myeloma patients who are
      newly diagnosed and require treatment when compared to patients who receive lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone alone.

      This research study is for men and women with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple
      myeloma. The purpose of this study is to observe the how well the different combinations of
      study drugs work as therapy for patients with newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible,
      previously untreated multiple myeloma.

      The study will be done in two arms:

      BiRd Arm:

        -  Clarithromycin 500mg PO twice daily on days 1-28 for a 28-day cycle

        -  Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle

        -  Dexamethasone 40mg PO will be given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle

      Rd Arm:

        -  Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle

        -  Dexamethasone 40mg PO will be given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle

      Subjects will be treated in 28-day cycles and may continue treatment as long as they are
      responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable side effects or disease progression.
      There will be an evaluation at the end of each cycle. Participants will be in the study until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
