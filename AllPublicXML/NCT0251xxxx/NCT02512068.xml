      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYR-472 when administered
      at a dose of 25 mg once weekly using placebo as a control in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus complicated by severe renal impairment or end-stage renal failure and inadequate
      glycemic control despite diet and/or exercise therapy (if given) or despite treatment with
      one other antidiabetic drug in addition to diet and/or exercise therapy (if given); and to
      evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of SYR-472 when administered at a dose of 25 mg
      once weekly to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by severe renal impairment
      or end-stage renal failure.
