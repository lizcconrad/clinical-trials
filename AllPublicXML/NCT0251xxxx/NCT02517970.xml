  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to conduct a within-subject experimental study that
      will assess the effect of environmental distractions on a mothers' ability to recognize and
      feed in response to infants' feeding cues. Investigators hypothesize that mothers will spend
      significantly more time looking at their technology compared to looking at their infant,
      which will be negatively associated with the mothers' responsiveness to her infant. This will
      have a positive association with infant intake during the feeding. Investigators also
      hypothesize that mothers will show less sensitivity when distracted when compared to when
      they are not distracted.
