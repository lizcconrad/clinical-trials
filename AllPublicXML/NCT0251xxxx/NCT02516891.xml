      The aims of this study are: 1) To identify more resistant the guidewire type to the retrieval
      maneuvers after the jailing.

      2) To determined anatomic and technical factors influencing the induced damage in the
      guidewire.

      Design of the study: prospective randomized study to compare 2 types of guidewire:
      hydrophilic and no hydrophilic. Patients and methods: Two hundred patients with bifurcation
      coronary lesions will be included. All of then will be treated by provisional side-branch
      stenting using the jailed wire technique. One hundred patients will be randomized to
      hydrophilic wires and another 100 patients to non-hydrophilic wires.

      The percutaneous approach of bifurcation lesions is a complex procedure; when the stent is
      implanted at main vessel, a closure of the side-branch may occur. The re-wiring of the
      side-branch in these conditions may be difficult or even impossible. To facilitate the
      re-wiring maneuvers the operators use the jailed wired technique. For this technique a
      guide-wire is introduced in the side-branch before main vessel stent implantation; after the
      stent deployment the wire remains jailed between the vessel wall and the metallic structure
      of the stent. If the side-branch became occluded, this wire is a good landmark of it is
      position, facilitating the access with a new wire. However, the rupture of the wire has been
      described in some cases, during the retrieval maneuvers.
