  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, window of opportunity study
      investigating the biological mechanism of metformin in prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A potential role for metformin in prostate cancer has been suggested and given its wide
      availability, tolerable side effect profile and safety record it may represent a therapeutic
      option for men with prostate cancer. However, the mechanism of action by which metformin
      exerts its anti-cancer effect has yet to be fully characterised. This 'window of opportunity'
      trial provides an opportunity to investigate this by comparing baseline prostate biopsies
      with post-treatment surgical specimen by focussing on assessment of the FASN/AMPK axis.

      Patients with newly-diagnosed, early stage, prostate cancer scheduled for radical
      prostatectomy will either enter the main study and be randomised 1:1 to receive metformin (2g
      daily over 2 divided doses; Arm A) or placebo four weeks prior to prostatectomy (standard of
      care; Arm B). Or a subset of five patients will enter the exploratory PET-MRI Substudy .
      These five patients will all receive metformin and will undergo an additional two PET-MRI
      Scans.

      Prostate tissue (at baseline from biopsy and post treatment from prostatectomy) will be used
      for analysis of p-AMPK, p-ACC, FASN by immunohistochemistry and proliferation will be
      measured using Ki67 and TUNEL in both metformin and placebo groups.
