      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a top-down treatment approach, prescribing
      infliximab (IFX) and azathioprine (AZA) at diagnose, yields better outcome in comparison to
      the usual step-up treatment approach, starting with prednison and AZA or exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN) and AZA, in moderate-to-severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) patients.

      Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a top-down treatment approach,
      prescribing IFX and AZA at diagnose, yields better outcome in comparison to the usual step-up
      treatment approach, starting with prednison and AZA or EEN and AZA, in moderate-to-severe
      pediatric CD patients.

      Sample size: We will include 100 (2 x 50) patients. With these numbers a difference of 60%
      and 85% (= 25) can be shown at a power of 80% (2-sided Î± 0.05).

      Study design: an international open-label randomised controlled trial Study population:
      Children (age 3-17 yrs) with new-onset, untreated, CD with moderate-to-severe disease
      activity (weighted Pediatric CD Index [wPCDAI] &gt;40) Intervention: Patients will be randomised
      to either top-down or conventional step-up treatment.

      Treatment arm 1: Top-down IFX treatment will consist of a total of 5 IFX infusions of 5 mg/kg
      (IFX induction at week 0, 2 and 6, followed by 2 maintenance infusions every 8 weeks)
      combined with oral AZA 2-3 mg/kg once daily. AZA therapy will continue after the last IFX
      infusion to maintain remission.

      Treatment arm 2: Step-up treatment will consist of standard induction treatment by either
      oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) once daily for 4 weeks, followed by tapering in 6
      weeks until stop, or EEN with polymeric feeding for 6-8 weeks after which normal foods are
      gradually reintroduced within 2-3 weeks. Either of these induction treatments will be
      combined with oral AZA 2-3 mg, once daily, as maintenance treatment.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Clinical remission at 52 weeks without need for additional
      CD related therapy or surgery. Secondary endpoints include clinical response, remission and
      mucosal healing at week 10 and 52, growth, quality of life and adverse events.
