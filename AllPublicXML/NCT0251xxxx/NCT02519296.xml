      In this article, the investigators report the design and protocol of a functional magnetic
      resonance imaging study (fMRI) of the treatment of Danish veterans with PTSD with Prolonged
      Exposure Therapy (PE). In total 30 Danish veterans will be recruited, who meet the ICD-10
      diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and treated with PE. A group of controls will be recruited
      consisting of age-appropriate same sex veterans who have participated in international
      missions similar to the patient group

      Primary outcome measures are the changes in d2-test assessment of attention and
      concentration, Beck Depression Inventory, Post-traumatic Symptom Scale-Interview version and
      PTSD Checklist- Military Version.

      Secondary outcome measures concern changes of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BNDF) and
      changes in the brain structure with focus on the hippocampal function using fMRI.
