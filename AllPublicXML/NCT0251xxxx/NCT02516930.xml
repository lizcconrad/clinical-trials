  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness
      of two methods (crowdsourcing versus social marketing) for creating one-minute videos
      promoting condom use among MSM and TG in China. Crowdsourcing is the process of shifting
      individual tasks to a large group, often involving open contests and enabled through
      multisectoral partnerships.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crowdsourcing may be a powerful tool to spur the development of innovative videos to promote
      condom use among key populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender (TG)
      individuals. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of a
      crowdsourced video and a social marketing video on condom use among Chinese MSM and TG who
      report condomless anal sex during the past three months. The crowdsourced video was developed
      using an open contest, formal transparent judging, and several prizes. The hypothesis is that
      a crowdsourced video will not be inferior (within a margin of 10%) to a social marketing
      video in terms of condomless sex at three to four weeks (with an additional follow-up at
      three months) of watching the video.
