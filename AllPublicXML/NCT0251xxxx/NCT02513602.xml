  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of the bone, using several techniques and on several aspects will be the
      purpose to study the possible impact of the kidney transplant (and, extensively, the
      pre-transplant dialysis, the organ replacement and the immunosuppressive therapy) could have
      on the bone metabolism and on the density of the bone where the implants are placed. The
      assessment on the bone density only in a retrospectively selected population that underwent
      the same surgical procedure will help the comparison of the data to get a satisfactory
      conclusion. The evaluation of other clinical and instrumental parameters in the test group
      makes the kidney-transplant patients bone quality clear, and will consequently demonstrate if
      implants are a feasible therapy for these patients.

      The primary purpose of this study is the evaluation of the effects of the kidney transplant
      on the periimplant bone density by the comparison with the density of healthy patients. The
      secondary purpose is obtaining clinical, histological and radiographic data to evaluate the
      effect of systemic conditions and its rebound on the insertion of fixtures.

      Evaluation criteria

        1. Control group: evaluation of the periimplant bone density (1 mm) next to the implant
           virtually planned using the CT editing software on the cone beam CT acquired in a
           retrospective sample of patients already treated with the insertion of a fixture in the
           molar or premolar edentulous site

        2. Test group: periodontal evaluation with plaque index, bleeding on probing index and
           probing 1 month before operation.

        3. Test group: evaluation of periimplant bone density (1 mm) in the fixture
           virtual-projected zone (the implant will be inserted there) with the CT acquisition and
           editing software.

        4. Test group: evaluation of the implant stability after their insertion (primary
           stability) using the Resonance Frequence Analysis. ISQ (Implant Stability Quotient)
           value is expressed in 4 numbers (mesial, distal, buccal, lingual), average values of
           three measures acquired in each side.

        5. Test group: evaluation of the implant stability immediately after the insertion
           calculating the insertional torque value (ITV) with an implant motor.

        6. Test group: evaluation of the periimplant bone using an endoral periapical radiograph
           with Rinn device immediately after the operation.

        7. Test group: histomorphological examination of the bone core sample made by a trephine
           resulted from the implant site preparation

        The minimal number of the participants of this study is 26 per group: this results from the
        measure of a 0,8 effect size. If the effect size is less than 1 (minimal value), it
        represents the situation where the medium difference of standard deviations of the variable
        &quot;bone density&quot; is equivalent to the difference of the value between the two groups of the
        study.

        Subject of test group will be enrolled an a kidney transplanted patients, while Subjects of
        control group will be enrolled retrospectively in healthy patients
