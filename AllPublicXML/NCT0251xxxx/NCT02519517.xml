  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators studied 15 patients scheduled for pulmonary resection through thoracotomy.
      Initial tidal volume (VT) 10ml kg-1 was reduced to 8ml kg-1 after one lung ventilation (OLV)
      and the rate adjusted to maintain partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 30-35
      mm Hg. Data were obtained at: T1, 15 min post establishing OLV with normocapnia, T2, 15 min
      post establishing OLV with hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.98kPa (60mmHg) and 9.31kPa (70mmHg) and pH
      &gt;7.1), and T3, 15 min after resuming OLV with normocapnia. One-way repeated measures analysis
      of variance (ANOVA), with post hoc Dunnet´s test were used for analysis. A P value &lt; 0.05 is
      considered statistically significant.

      Investigators studied 15 patients scheduled for elective pulmonary resection through
      thoracotomy. Patients had a standardized management for thoracotomies. Initial VT 10ml/ kg
      was reduced to 8ml/kg after OLV and the rate adjusted to maintain PaCO2 30-35 mm Hg.
      Haemodynamic, respiratory variables and echocardiographic data (Tei index and TAPSE) were
      obtained at: T1, 15 min post establishing OLV with normocapnia, T2, 15 min post establishing
      OLV with hypercapnia (PaCO2 7.98kPa (60mmHg) and 9.31kPa (70mmHg) and pH &gt;7.1), and T3, 15
      min after resuming OLV with normocapnia. One-way repeated measures ANOVA, with post hoc
      Dunnet´s test were used for analysis. A P value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically
      significant.
