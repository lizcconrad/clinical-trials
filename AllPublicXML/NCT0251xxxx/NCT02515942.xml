      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 12 (every 28 days)
      intravitreal (IVT) injections of CLG561 as a monotherapy and in combination with LFG316 as
      compared to sham in subjects with geographic atrophy.

    <textblock>
      This study consists of an up-to 30-day screening period, an approximately 336-day treatment
      period, and a follow-up period consisting of two visits occurring 4 and 16 weeks after the
      last administered injection.
