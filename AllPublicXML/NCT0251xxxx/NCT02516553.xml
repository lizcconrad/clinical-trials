  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the phase Ia (dose escalation) part of this trial is to assess the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 894999 administered at escalating doses in two treatment schedules
      (schedule A of continuous dosing, schedule B with two weeks on treatment followed by one week
      off in 3-week cycles) in patients with solid tumours. In the phase Ib expansion part, the aim
      is to further evaluate the safety profile of BI 894999 at the recommended dose and schedule
      in patients with solid tumours and to assess target modulation and the potential antitumour
      efficacy in patients with selected types of tumours. Once the MTD has been determined for
      both schedules in patients with solid tumours, the MTD will be determined as well in patients
      with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), using the recommended schedule for solid
      tumours.The PK profile will be determined from the first cycle in all patients in both
      phases.

          1. Age 18 years and older at the time of signature of the informed consent

          2. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks after the start of the treatment according to the
             investigator's judgement

          3. Male or female patients. Women of childbearing potential* must be ready and able to
             use highly effective methods of birth control per ICH M3(R2) that result in a low
             failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. A list of
             contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information.
             For women of childbearing potential using a contraceptive pill, an additional barrier
             method is necessary due to the potential CYP3A4 inducing effect of BI894999. Male
             patients having a partner of childbearing potential must use condoms and ensure their
             partner is using a highly effective method of birth control as described above, during
             the trial and for at least three months after the end of the trial

             * Any female who has experienced menarche and does not meet the criteria for &quot;women

             Women not of childbearing potential are defined as: women who are postmenopausal (12
             months with no menses without an alternative medical cause) or who are permanently
             sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral
             salpingectomy).

        whom no therapy of proven efficacy exists, or who are not amenable to standard therapies 2.
        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score 0 or 1 at the time of screening 3.
        Recovery of therapy-related toxicities from previous chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase
        inhibitors, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, antibodies, vaccine therapy, or radiotherapy to
