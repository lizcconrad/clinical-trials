      This study compares the effect of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture on advanced pancreatic
      cancer pain and then investigates its potential mechanism of peripheral blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture may alleviate abdominal or back pain of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
      Acupuncture participants would receive electroacupuncture on Jiaji (Ex-B2) points for 3 times
      in a week. Placebo acupuncture participants would receive placebo acupuncture on non-point
      points for the same period. Pain scores on numeric rating scale (NRS) and blood levels of
      β-endorphin and nerve growth factor are compared.

    <description>Disposable stainless steel filiform needles (40mm in length and 0.30mm in diameter) are inserted perpendicularly into T8-T12 Jiaji (Ex-B2) points bilaterally to a depth of 25 mm. After De Qi sensation is achieved, the handles of needles on homolateral T8 and T12 Jiaji are respectively connected to the Han's acupoint nerve stimulator at a frequency of 2/100 Hz and a current of 1mA with a disperse-dense waveform for 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Placebo acupuncture needles (Dongbang AcuPrime Acupuncture Inc., South Korea) are used on the non-point points at the same level as T8 and T12 Jiaji, 4.5 cun lateral to the posterior median line. The needles with blunt tips are quickly put onto points without inserting into the skin. The needles on homolateral points at the same level as T8 and T12 Jiaji are then connected to the electric stimulator, but with zero frequency and electric current.</description>
