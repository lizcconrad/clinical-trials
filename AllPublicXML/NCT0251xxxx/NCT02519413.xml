    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to retrospectively investigate changes in lymphocyte
      counts and lymphocyte subtypes, with a focus on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in participants on
      Tecfidera therapy for at least 6 months. The secondary objective is to investigate changes in
      lymphocyte subtypes other than CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

        This study will be conducted in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS)
        who initiated Tecfidera treatment for the first time (treatment naïve) under routine
        clinical care. For inclusion in the study, patients' charts must have a baseline
        measurement for absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and absolute CD4+ or CD8+ count within 6
        months prior to Tecfidera initiation, and at least 1 measurement for ALC and absolute CD4+
        or CD8+ count while on Tecfidera treatment for at least 6 months. For patients who
        discontinue Tecfidera, data will be collected for up to 6 months following Tecfidera
        discontinuation.
