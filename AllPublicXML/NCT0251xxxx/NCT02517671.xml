    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of 35 EECP sessions on cardiopulmonary
      training performance in healthy volunteers. Data from this study will be used to generate
      sample size and power calculations for feasibility of future EECP studies. The results of
      this study could provide evidence that can help active duty and Department of Defense
      beneficiaries optimize physical conditioning, endurance and overall health.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of 35 EECP sessions on cardiopulmonary
      training performance in healthy volunteers. Prior published and anecdotal evidence suggests
      that EECP should improve athletic performance. Data from this study will be used to generate
      sample size and power calculations for feasibility of future EECP studies. The results of
      this study could provide evidence that can help active duty and Department of Defense
      beneficiaries optimize physical conditioning, endurance and overall health. It could help
      active duty members maximize their physical training potential enabling them to better
      prepare for missions down range. Additionally, physiologic cardiopulmonary improvements may
      have the potential to decrease the conditioning time required for injured, post-operative and
      post-partum active duty members to return to duty.

    <description>EECP is a non-invasive therapy that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of refractory angina and heart failure. This study is using the device to potentially improve 1.5 mile run times and VO2max in healthy volunteers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy active-duty military personnel or DoD beneficiaries

               -  Medically cleared for the 1.5 mile run test [subjects will be medically cleared
                  via PI's discretion or physician consultation letter]

          -  18 years or older [no age cutoff is needed, subjects will be medically cleared via
             PI's discretion or physician consultation letter]

          -  Scoring below 55 out of 60 points on a 1.5 mile run portion of test using current AFI
             fitness standards [adjusted for age and gender]

          -  Maintaining a steady work-out routine and agreeing to adhere to it for the duration of
             the study. The workouts cannot vary by greater than 50% week to week (e.g. a subject
             that works out 3 hours on week 1, can only work out between 1.5 to 4.5 hours on week
             2).
