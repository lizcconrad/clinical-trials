    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disease that is characterized by
      incompletely reversible airflow obstruction. It is projected to be the fifth leading burden
      of disease worldwide by the year 2020. Pulmonary dysfunction reduces exercise capacity in
      COPD patients, and it has been previously shown that COPD patients suffer deterioration in
      their quality of life. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of a physical
      therapy intervention in stable patients with COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading diseases causing mortality
      and morbidity, despite advanced pharmacotherapy and therapeutic management. Although COPD
      primarily affects the lungs, it also implies extrapulmonary manifestations, such as
      nutritional depletion, skeletal muscle dysfunction, and abnormal respiratory muscles.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation is widely used to treat COPD patients and it has been shown that
      pulmonary rehabilitation should be implemented at all COPD stages, bringing them benefits in
      terms of improved exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life.

    <description>Five times sit to stand test (5STS) will be used to assess exercise capacity, 5STS is a simple assessment tool that is feasible in all healthcare settings, and may be a rapid method of assessing changes in exercise capacity in COPD and screening for poor physical functioning individuals.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Respiratory function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is regarded as the gold standard measure of respiratory function. Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Dyspnea perception</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea perception will be assessed with Borg modified scale. Patients will classify their breathlessness between 0 and 10.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) will be used to assess quality of life. EQ-5D is a generic questionnaire and consists of two parts, the EQ-5D Visual analogue scale (VAS) and the EQ-5D index. The EQ-5D VAS consists on a vertical rating scale from 0 to 100 (0 = death/worst possible health state and 100 = best possible health state). The EQ-5D index is a five-item questionnaire (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The FSS is a nine-item instrument designed to assess fatigue as a symptom of a variety of different chronic conditions and disorders. The scale addresses fatigue's effects on daily functioning, querying its relationship to motivation, physical activity, work, family, and social life, and asking respondents to rate the ease with which they are fatigued and the degree to which the symptom poses a problem for them.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of COPD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of COPD in patient's life will be evaluated with COPD Assessment Test (CAT) that is a simple instrument to quantify chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) impact in routine practice.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life related to respiratory symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) will be also used to evaluate the quality of life of patients in the previous year. It includes 50 items, divided into three domains: Symptoms, Activity and Impacts. A score is calculated for each domain and a total score including all items is also obtained. Low scores indicate better health related quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Peripheral vascular status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle-brachial index will be used to predict the presence or absence of peripheral arterial disease.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Baecke Questionnaire will be used to assess the physical activity levels. It is a frequently used questionnaire to measure habitual physical activity in the elderly.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive status will be assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA) which is a cognitive screening test designed to assist Health Professionals for detection of mild cognitive impairment.</description>
