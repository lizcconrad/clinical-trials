      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mucolytic activity of Tacholiquine® compared to
      saline (0.9%) in chronic bronchitis patients. Lung function parameters, biomarker profiles in
      sputum and serum, and clinical symptoms by standardized questionnaires [COPD activity index
      (CAT), Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) &amp; Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI)and the St. George's
      Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)] will be evaluated in response to Tacholiquine® vs. saline
      in chronic bronchitis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare Tacholiquine ® and saline (0.9%) regarding their ability
      to promote the discharge of mucus from the respiratory passages in patients with chronic
      bronchitis (COPD). Alleviated discharge of mucus should ease breathing, improve subjective
      wellbeing, reduce inflammation in the air passages and improve lung function.

      Determine the magnitude of the effect of Tacholiquine ® compared to saline (0.9%) in chronic
      bronchitis patients. Lung function parameters, biomarker profiles in sputum and serum, and
      clinical symptoms and quality of life by standardized questionnaires [COPD activity index
      (CAT), Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) &amp; Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), St George's respiratory
      Quality of Life Questionnaire] will be evaluated in response to Tacholiquine ® vs. saline at
      day one and at end of treatment.

             post-bronchodilator FEV1&lt;80% of predicted normal value at screening (spirometry will
             be used for this criteria assessment).

          4. Current smoker or ex-smoker with a tobacco history of ≥10 pack-years (1 pack year = 20
             cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year).

          5. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use a highly effective form of birth
             control (confirmed by the Investigator).

             − Women &gt;50 years old would be considered postmenopausal

          6. At least a CAT value &gt; 10 at Visit 1.

          7. Presence of chronic cough and sputum production either &quot;several days per week&quot; or
             &quot;almost every day&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically important pulmonary disease other than COPD (e.g. active lung infection,
             clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis,
             hypoventilation syndrome associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha 1 anti-trypsin
             deficiency and primary ciliary dyskinesia) or another diagnosed pulmonary or systemic
             disease that is associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (e.g. allergic
             bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, hypereosinophilic
             syndrome).

          2. Any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
             hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic,
             haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the
             opinion of the Investigator and could:

               -  Affect the safety of the subject throughout the study

               -  Influence the findings of the study or their interpretation

               -  Impede the subject's ability to complete the entire duration of study

          3. Documented Unstable ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, heart failure,
             renal failure, uncontrolled hypertension as defined by the Investigator, or any other
             relevant cardiovascular disorder as judged by the Investigator that in Investigator's
             judgment may put the patient at risk or negatively affect the outcome of the study.

             a COPD exacerbation within 4 weeks prior to (Visit 1).

          5. Acute upper or lower respiratory infection requiring antibiotics or antiviral
             medication within 4 weeks prior to (Visit 1).

          6. Pneumonia within 4 weeks prior to (Visit 1), based on the last day of antibiotic
             treatment or hospitalization date, whatever occurred later. The subject cannot be
             re-screened if this exclusion criterion is met.

          7. History of anaphylaxis to Tacholiquine®.

          8. Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) defined as need for oxygen &gt; 4L 02 flow with signs
             and/or symptoms of cor pulmonale, right ventricular failure or evidence by
             echocardiogram or pulmonary artery catheterization of moderate to severe pulmonary
             hypertension. In order to be admitted to the trial subjects on LTOT have to be
             ambulatory and be able to attend clinic visits.

          9. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs,
             hematology, or urinalysis during Visit 1, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may put the subject at risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may
             influence the results of the study, or the subject's ability to complete entire
             duration of the study.

         10. Use of immunosuppressive medication, including rectal corticosteroids, high potency
             topical corticosteroids and systemic steroids within 28 days prior to (Visit 1).
