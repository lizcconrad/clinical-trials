      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azilsartan medoxomil
      (AZM) in Asian adult participants with both essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called azilsartan medoxomil. Azilsartan medoxomil is
      being tested to treat people who have essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). This study will look at the blood pressure of people who take azilsartan medoxomil in
      addition to standard care for T2DM.

      The study will enroll approximately 363 patients. All participants will receive azilsartan
      medoxomil 40 mg tablets to be administered orally, once a day, for 12 weeks. If a
      participant's blood pressure (BP) has not reached BP goal of &lt;140/85 mmHg at week 6,
      azilsartan medoxomil dose will be up-titrated to 80 mg daily.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Asia. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 14 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
