      This study compares patients bound for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) who were
      transported by either ground ambulance or emergency medical helicopter. The investigators
      describe long-term follow-up in relation to mortality and labour affiliation.

    <textblock>
      Since 2003, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-Segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI) has been the preferred therapy in Denmark over fibrinolysis (thrombolysis)
      if performed within 120 minutes. Nevertheless, centralisation of designated PCI-centres may
      lead to systems delays as transport distance may be longer instead of just choosing
      thrombolysis at the nearest hospital.

      As every minute counts when trying to minimize the ischemic injury and size of infarction
      following an acute coronary event, timely transportation by helicopter may facilitate overall
      prognosis.

      As a part of a national initiative to improve prehospital care of patients with time critical
      illness such as myocardial infarction (MI), the first Danish Helicopter Emergency Medical
      System (HEMS) was implemented in the eastern part of Denmark May 1st 2010.

      An initial study on 450 patients investigating short-term effects, found that HEMS
      significantly reduced time from the first electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis on-scene to
      arrival at the cardiac catheterisation laboratory (CCL) despite longer transport distances.
      Investigators also found a lower, but insignificant 30-day mortality in HEMS patients,
      adjusted OR=0.40 (95% CI=0.12-1.39, p=0.14).

      The aim of the present study is to investigate long-term effects of HEMS in relation to
      mortality and labour market affiliation.

        All STEMI patients having acute coronary angiography performed at the PCI centre at
        Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet in a 40-month period from January 1st 2010
        until April 30th 2013; and who were diagnosed with STEMI within the geographical area
        covered by both HEMS and GEMS.

        Patients are divided into two groups: 1) &quot;field triaged&quot; (ECG recorded out-of-hospital) and
        2) inter-hospital transfers (ECG recorded in-hospital).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators include all STEMI patients having acute coronary angiography
             performed at the PCI centre at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet in a
             40-month period from January 1st 2010 until April 30th 2013; and who were diagnosed
             with STEMI within the geographical area covered by both HEMS and GEMS. Patients with
             multiple contacts; only first contact is eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators exclude patients with cardiac arrest before hospital admission. For
             labour market analyses the investigators exclude patients not working full time three
