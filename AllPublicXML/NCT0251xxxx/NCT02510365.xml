          1. Male or female, 18-65 years old.

          2. Completely spinal cord injury at the cervical and thoracic level (C5-T12).

          3. Classification ASIA A, occurring within past 21 days.

          4. Patients signed informed consent.

          5. Ability and willingness to regular visit to hospital and follow up during the protocol
             Procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A current diagnosis of any primary diseases affecting limb functions (e.g., trauma,
             infection, tumors, congenital malformations, peripheral muscular dystrophy,
             Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease).

             electrolytes, biochemistry, liver and kidney function tests, urinanalysis).

          5. History of mental illness or suicide risk, with a history of epilepsy or other central
             nervous system disorders.

          6. Severe arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, frequent superventricular
             tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter) or cardiac degree II or above
             conduction abnormalities displayed via 12-lead ECG.

          7. Lactating and pregnant woman.

          8. Alcohol drug abuse /dependence.

          9. Participated in any other clinical trials within 3 months before the enrollment.

         10. A drug or treatment known to cause effect on the central nervous system during the
             past four weeks.

         11. A drug or treatment known to cause major organ system toxicity during the past four
             weeks.

         12. Poor compliance, difficult to complete the study.

         13. Any other conditions that might increase the risk of subjects or interfere with the
             clinical trial.
