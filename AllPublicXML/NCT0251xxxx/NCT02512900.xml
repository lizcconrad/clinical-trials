      The primary objective is to evaluate the PK profile of a single-dose of 140 mg subcutaneous
      (SC) administration of MEDI9929 (AMG 157) in adolescent subjects with mild to moderate
      asthma. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MEDI9929 and to
      evaluate the immunogenicity of MEDI9929 (AMG 157). The exploratory objective is to evaluate
      the effect of MEDI9929 (AMG 157) on pulmonary function

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE resulting in any of the following outcomes such as death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. A TEAE is defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug. The AEs were summarized using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 19.0</description>

          <description>Computerized triplicate 12-lead ECGs as well as Qualitative 12-lead ECGs were obtained during the study. ECG parameters included heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and corrected QT (QTc) intervals. Number of participants with TEAEs related to ECG after the start of study drug were to be reported.</description>
