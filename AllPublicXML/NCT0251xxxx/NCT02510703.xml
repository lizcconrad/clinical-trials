  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with early and diffuse abnormalities of endothelial function,
      especially in the coronary arteries, which are a factor of poor prognosis. Following acute
      coronary syndrome, the endothelial function abnormalities usually persist for several weeks
      before regressing. Their persistence 6-8 weeks after myocardial infarction is a poor
      prognostic factor. Investigators assume that global abnormalities of endothelial function in
      patients with diabetes may be additive with segmental abnormalities in revascularized
      myocardium, and contribute to worsening the prognosis in these patients. Furthermore, there
      is no published data showing any relationship between calcium score and endothelial function
      abnormalities in these patients. The investigators seek a relationship between calcium score
      and persistence of abnormalities of coronary endothelial function in these patients.

      The main objective of this study was to compare coronary endothelial function by quantitative
      method (TEP at 15O-H2O) in diabetic patients and nondiabetic following acute coronary
      syndrome.
