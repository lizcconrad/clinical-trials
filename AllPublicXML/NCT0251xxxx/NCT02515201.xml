  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trial, that aim is evaluation of the use of taurolidine and heparin in the
      prevention of bloodstream infection in venous catheter in children with intestinal failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Will be collected data about sociodemographics : date of birth, hospitalization and which is
      use (taurolidine or heparin), sex, underlying disease and associated co-morbidities.

      About central venous catheter will be collect: catheter type in each period, the number of
      lumens, date of insertion of each catheter usage time, reason for removal of the catheter
      insertion site and catheter material (silicone or polyurethane ).

      Data relating to parenteral nutrition will also be collected: osmolarity of parenteral
      nutrition, infusion time every 24 hours and concentration of glucose parenteral nutrition
      bag.

      It will be used for aseptic handling technique of the solutions, as well as for handling the
      connections of the central catheter. For preparation and administration of taurolidine and
      heparin is used an operations manual that was made for the authors. Patients are divided into
      two groups: taurolidine or heparin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The population will consist of patients 30 days of life to fourteen years old,
             admitted to the pediatric inpatient units, with intestinal failure receiving
             parenteral nutrition through a central venous catheter and at least eight weeks of use
             forecast.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children will be excluded other associated diseases that occur with frequent use of
             antibiotics, for example, cystic fibrosis, primary or acquired immunodeficiency. Also
             excluded are the children admitted that they are not accompanied by a responsible
             family recognition, or accompanied by responsible under the age of 18 years. Children
             with allergic reactions to the use of some of the solutions (taurolidine or heparin)
             will be suspended medication and receive appropriate treatment. Although these
             children have stopped the use of medication, will be followed according to the
             assessment protocol by the end of the study.
