    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of (0,1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is the physician's determination of the participant's Psoriasis (Ps) lesions overall at a given time point. Lesions were categorized by descriptions for induration, erythema, and scaling. Participant's Ps was assessed as 0 (clear), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe), or 5 (very severe). An sPGA responder was defined as having a post-baseline sPGA score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 75% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of scaling, redness, and plaque induration/infiltration (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no Ps to 72 for the most severe disease. For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0 (0%) to 6 (90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling with a scores range from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored separately and the scores then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI calculated as: sum of severity parameters for each region * area score * weighing factor [head (0.1), upper limbs (0.2), trunk (0.3), lower limbs (0.4)]. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of fingernail (fn) Ps. This scale is used to evaluate the severity of fn bed Ps and fn matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fn unit. The fn is divided with imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fn is given a score for fn bed Ps (0 to 4) and fn matrix Ps (0 to 4) depending on presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fn bed and fn matrix Ps in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fn is sum of scores in fn bed and fn matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fn is evaluated, then the sum of all fn equals the total NAPSI score with a range from 0 to 80 (0 indicates no Ps, 80 indicates worst Ps). LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis including dosing regimen, country, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, dosing regimen-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed factors, with variance-covariance structure set to unstructured.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSI is a physician assessment of erythema, induration and desquamation and percent of scalp that is covered with a scores range from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). The composite score is derived from the sum of scores for erythema, induration, and desquamation multiplied by the score recorded for the extent of the scalp area involved, 1 (&lt;10%) to 6 (90-100%) with a total score ranging from 0 (less severity) to 72 (more severity). LS mean change was calculated using MMRM analysis including dosing regimen, country, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, dosing regimen-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed factors, with variance-covariance structure set to unstructured.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Palmoplantar PASI (PPASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Palmoplantar PASI is a composite score derived from the sum scores for erythema, induration, and desquamation multiplied by a score for the extent of palm and sole area involvement, ranging from 0 (no PPASI) to 72 (most severe PPASI). The PPASI was only assessed if participants have palmoplantar psoriasis at baseline. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis including dosing regimen, country, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, dosing regimen-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed factors, with variance-covariance structure set to unstructured.</description>

        <description>The sPGA is the physician's determination of the participant's Psoriasis (Ps) lesions overall at a given time point. Lesions were categorized by descriptions for induration, erythema, and scaling. Participant's Ps was assessed as 0 (clear), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe), or 5 (very severe). An sPGA responder was defined as having a post-baseline sPGA score of “0” or “1” with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline.</description>

An sPGA responder was defined as having a post-baseline sPGA score of “0” or “1” with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Participants who did not meet the clinical response criteria or had missing data at Week 52 were considered non-responders for Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) analysis.</population>

        <description>The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of scaling, redness, and plaque induration/infiltration (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no Ps to 72 for the most severe disease. For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0 (0%) to 6 (90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling with a scores range from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored separately and the scores then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI calculated as: sum of severity parameters for each region * area score * weighing factor [head (0.1), upper limbs (0.2), trunk (0.3), lower limbs (0.4)]. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease).</description>

        <description>The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of scaling, redness, and plaque induration/infiltration (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no Ps to 72 for the most severe disease.
Least Squares mean (LSmean) was calculated using Mixed-Effects Model of Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis including dosing regimen, country, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, dosing regimen-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed factors, with variance-covariance structure set to unstructured.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score</title>
        <description>The NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of fingernail (fn) Ps. This scale is used to evaluate the severity of fn bed Ps and fn matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fn unit. The fn is divided with imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fn is given a score for fn bed Ps (0 to 4) and fn matrix Ps (0 to 4) depending on presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fn bed and fn matrix Ps in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fn is sum of scores in fn bed and fn matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fn is evaluated, then the sum of all fn equals the total NAPSI score with a range from 0 to 80 (0 indicates no Ps, 80 indicates worst Ps). LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis including dosing regimen, country, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, dosing regimen-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed factors, with variance-covariance structure set to unstructured.</description>

LS mean change was calculated using MMRM analysis including dosing regimen, country, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, dosing regimen-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed factors, with variance-covariance structure set to unstructured.</description>

          <description>The Itch NRS is a participant-administered single-item 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no itch” and 10 representing “worst itch imaginable.” Overall severity of a participant's itching from Ps is indicated by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours. LS mean change from baseline in PSSI was calculated using MMRM analysis including dosing regimen, country, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, dosing regimen-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed factors, with variance-covariance structure set to unstructured.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned and who had baseline and post-baseline Itch NRS data.</population>

        <description>The pain VAS is a participant-administered single-item scale designed to measure Skin pain from Psoriasis using a 0-100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. Overall severity of participant's skin pain from Psoriasis is indicated by placing a single mark on the horizontal 100 mm scale from 0 mm (no skin pain) to 100 mm (severe skin pain). LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis including dosing regimen, country, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, dosing regimen-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed factors, with variance-covariance structure set to unstructured.</description>
