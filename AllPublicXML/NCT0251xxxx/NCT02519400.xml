  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 24 healthy Korean male subjects will receive a single oral dose of amitriptyline,
      25 mg. Subjects will be enrolled in this study based on their cytochrome P450 2D6 and
      cytochrome P450 2C19 genotypes, and serial blood sampling will be done for plasma
      concentrations of amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and their metabolites. Various
      pharmacodynamic markers related to the adverse event of amitriptyline will be measured
      serially during the study.
