    <textblock>
      This is a phase-II study to evaluate the efficacy of a salvage regimen in children with
      relapsed T-cell ALL or lymphoma. Peg-asparaginase, mitoxantrone, intrathecal triples (IT)
      (intrathecal methotrexate/hydrocortisone/cytarabine) (ITMHA) and dexamethasone are commonly
      used drugs to treat relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma (ALL). In
      this study, the investigators want to know if adding three drugs called panobinostat,
      bortezomib and liposomal vincristine (VSLI) to this regimen will result in remission (no
      signs or symptoms of leukemia or lymphoma).

        -  Panobinostat has been approved by the FDA for treating adults with multiple myeloma, but
           it has not been approved for use in children and has not been given together with the
           other drugs used in this study. It has not been widely studied in children.

        -  VSLI has been approved by the FDA for adults with relapsed or refractory ALL, but has
           not yet been approved for treating children with leukemia or lymphoma.

        -  Bortezomib has been approved by the FDA for treating adults with a cancer called
           multiple myeloma and adults with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma; it has not been approved
           for treating children.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the complete remission (CR) rate for patients with T-cell lymphoblastic
           leukemia and lymphoma in first relapse.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) levels at end of each block of therapy.

        -  To describe the toxicities of vincristine sulfate liposome injection (VSLI) when used in
           combination with chemotherapy and bortezomib.

    <textblock>
      This is a study of re-induction therapy that will comprise of three blocks of multi-agent
      chemotherapy. CR will be evaluated following each block of therapy. All patients will be
      candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) once they achieve negative minimal
      residual disease (MRD). If patients cannot proceed to HSCT following Block A, they will
      continue therapy on Block B and Block C until ready for HSCT.

      Three Block Induction:

      Block A: approximately 5 weeks

        -  Dexamethasone 10 mg/m^2/day orally (PO) Days 1-8, 15-22 (Total 16 days)

        -  Panobinostat 24 mg/m^2/dose PO Day 2,4,6

        -  Liposomal vincristine (VSLI) 2.25 mg/m^2 no cap intravenously (IV) on Days 7, 14, 21, 28

        -  Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m^2 IV Day 7,14 (In the absence of peripheral blasts, Day 14
           Mitoxantrone will be given if WBC ≥1000 and ANC ≥300)

        -  Peg-asparaginase 2500 units/m^2 on Days 9,23

        -  Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m^2 IV Days 16, 19, 23, 26

        -  Intrathecal Triples (IT) (intrathecal methotrexate/hydrocortisone/cytarabine) (ITMHA)
           Days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28. Additional ITs on Days 10 and 17 for patients with central
           nervous system (CNS) 2, 3 or traumatic tap with blasts

      Block B: approximately 5 weeks

        -  High-dose methotrexate 8 g/m^2 IV over 24 hours (will not be given to patients with
           prior cranial irradiation) Day 1

        -  6-mercaptopurine 50 mg/m^2 PO days 1-14

        -  ITMHA Day 1

        -  High-dose cytarabine 3 g/m^2 IV every 12 hours (Q12H) Days 15 and 16

      Block C: approximately 3 weeks

        -  Nelarabine 650 mg/m^2/day IV Days 1-5 (Clofarabine 40 mg/m^2/day IV Days 1-5 will be
           given instead of nelarabine for patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma in
           stratum II)

        -  Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2 IV Days 1-5

        -  Etoposide 100 mg/m^2/day IV Days 1-5

      Response evaluation is performed after the end of each treatment block. All patients should
      proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after achieving negative minimal
      residual disease (MRD) when a suitable donor is identified. Patients could continue on Block
      B and Block C if not ready for HSCT. If after completion of Block C, MRD is persistently
      positive, the plan will be discussed with the principal investigator and co-principal
      investigator and the transplant team. Enrollment on ongoing natural killer (NK) cell studies
      will be considered. For patients who require a second transplant, HAP3R (another clinical
      trial at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) may be an option. Donor will be selected
      according to institutional practices and transplant regimens will be used according to
      institutional HSCT protocols and guidelines.
