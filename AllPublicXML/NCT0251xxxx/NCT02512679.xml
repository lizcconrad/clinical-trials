  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many genetic diseases of lymphohematopoietic cells (such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia,
      Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Combined Immune Deficiency (CID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, chronic
      granulomatous disease, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, and metabolic diseases affecting
      hematopoiesis) are sublethal diseases caused by mutations that adversely affect the
      development or function of different types of blood cells. Although pathophysiologically
      diverse, these genetic diseases share a similar clinical course of significant progressive
      morbidity, overall poor quality of life, and ultimate death from complications of the disease
      or its palliative treatment. Supportive care for these diseases includes chronic transfusion,
      iron chelation, and surgery (splenectomy or cholecystectomy) for the hemoglobinopathies;
      prophylactic antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, and immunomodulator therapies for the
      immune deficiencies; and enzyme replacement injections and dietary restriction for some of
      the metabolic diseases. The suboptimal results of such supportive care measures have led to
      efforts to implement more aggressive therapeutic interventions to cure these
      lymphohematopoietic diseases. The most logical strategies for cure of these diseases have
      been either replacement of the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with those
      derived from a normal donor allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) or hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant (HSCT), or to genetically modify the patient's own stem cells to replace the
      defective gene (gene therapy).

      The present study is to evaluate de-escalation of the cyclophosphamide (CY) dose in an
      innovative conditioning regimen with fludarabine and alemtuzumab as additional agents to
      achieve immunoablation, in combination with Busulfan (BU) to achieve myeloablation.
      Replacement of at least part of the cyclophosphamide dose by fludarabine in the conditioning
      regimen would be expected to maintain immunosuppression (and, therefore, engraftment) while
      reducing transplant-related complications (mucositis, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity,
      pulmonary toxicity, hemorrhagic cystitis, mucositis, and possibly GVHD), thereby improving
      disease-free survival rates. Similarly, the potential benefits of alemtuzumab in the proposed
      conditioning regimen are increased rates of hematopoietic engraftment with less toxicity than
      that observed with cyclophosphamide, ultimately resulting in improved immune function and
      enhanced quality of life (12,13). A fludarabine/alemtuzumab-based, less intensive
      conditioning regimen with adequate immunosuppressive activity could conceivably allow more
      successful engraftment of stem cells from related donors in patients with genetic
      lymphohematological diseases, as well as lower rates of transplant-related mortality.

      Regimen-related toxicity is also believed to be a major contributing factor to GVHD (14).
      Therefore, conditioning regimens that cause less tissue injury may also lead to reduced GVHD.
      In the present study, the use of alemtuzumab in the conditioning regimen may be an added
      benefit, as this antibody causes T-cell depletion, thus, the risk of GVHD may also be reduced
      (15). The overall goal of the study is to improve the therapeutic index of HSCT by decreasing
      and, if possible, eliminating cyclophosphamide as a component of the pre-transplant
      conditioning for patients with genetic diseases of lymphohematopoiesis. The investigation
      will explore the risks and benefits of the proposed novel-conditioning regimen using a
      decreased dose of cyclophosphamide and additional immunosuppression with fludarabine and
      alemtuzumab to prevent graft rejection and recurrence of disease. The investigators will
      evaluate this regimen's impact on conditioning-related morbidity and mortality, and measure
      the success of the transplant procedure by engraftment and disease-free survival. If this
      regimen is able to successfully permit engraftment and reduce regimen-related toxicity, the
      next phase of treatment will test a further dose de-escalation for cyclophosphamide. It is
      anticipated that there will be four dose levels of cyclophosphamide in the overall study: 1)
      105 mg/kg; 2) 70 mg/kg; 3) 35 mg/kg; and then finally, 4) 0 mg/kg. This study design was
      chosen to minimize study risks possibly associated with substitution of fludarabine and
      alemtuzumab for CY as immunoablation. The present protocol represents Level 1 in the study
      design; an amended protocol will be prepared prior to further de-escalation of the
      cyclophosphamide dose.

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) develops within the first three months after transplantation and appears as a skin rash, often accompanied by hyperbilirubenemia, abnormal liver enzymes and gastrointestinal symptoms, as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Level of aGVHD is graded from 1-4. Chronic GVHD, typically a late complication of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) characterized by skin changes, sometimes sclerotic changes, with joint contractures, liver function abnormality, gastrointestinal symptoms and sometime other organ involvement such as eyes, lungs, and obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). Chronic GVHD is graded as absent, limited, or extensive.</description>

             with the patient. All patients who have previously had serious life- threatening
             events due to disease process may be included in the study. Patients must have

             further evaluation will be done to determine the suitability as transplant recipient.
             Should these studies indicate that chelation is necessary the following should apply:
             That the treating hematologist will provide the specific chelation type and timing.
             Evaluation of organ iron load will be part of the HSCT work-up and if high iron load

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) develops within the first three months after transplantation and appears as a skin rash, often accompanied by hyperbilirubenemia, abnormal liver enzymes and gastrointestinal symptoms, as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Level of aGVHD is graded from 1-4. Chronic GVHD, typically a late complication of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) characterized by skin changes, sometimes sclerotic changes, with joint contractures, liver function abnormality, gastrointestinal symptoms and sometime other organ involvement such as eyes, lungs, and obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). Chronic GVHD is graded as absent, limited, or extensive.</description>
