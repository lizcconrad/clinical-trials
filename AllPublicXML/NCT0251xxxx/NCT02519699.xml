  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal levels of mean arterial pressure that must be achieved in septic shock are
      subject of debate. Studies tried to correlate blood pressure increase in patients with septic
      shock with microcirculation. However, there are few studies that specifically assessed septic
      shock patients with previous arterial hypertension. The main objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of increased blood pressure level in the microcirculation of these
      patients and compare them with patients without arterial hypertension.

      Hypothesis: After a rise in mean arterial pressure, microcirculation improvement will occur
      only in the previously hypertensive patients.

      Study design: Prospective clinical trial Setting: Intensive care units of the Anesthesiology
      Department at the Federal University of Sao Paulo and the intensive care unit of Kidney
      Hospital.

      Studied population: Forty patients will be included, being 20 without known history of
      systemic arterial hypertension and 20 with this diagnosis for at least 2 years and already
      with clinical or subclinical organ damage.

      Inclusion criteria: age over than 18 years old, norepinephrine drug use for at least 12 hours
      and for less than 72 hours, sedation level equal or deeper than Ramsay 4, blood pressure
      stable for the last 30 minutes prior to inclusion, central venous catheter in place and
      signed informed consent.

      Exclusion criteria: pregnancy, cirrhosis, systemic sclerosis, and need to maintain mean
      arterial pressure above 65mmHg for others conditions.

      Intervention: noradrenaline dose will be risen to obtain a mean arterial pressure of 85-90
      mmHg.

      Assessments and outcome: Systemic hemodynamic (central venous oxygen saturation, cardiac
      output, heart rate, central venous pressure) and sublingual microcirculation variables
      (microcirculatory flow index, total vascular density, proportion of perfused vessels,
      perfused vascular density) will be measured before and after the rise in mean arterial
      pressure. Sidestream darkfield will be used to assess microcirculation. The variation between
      those variables before and after the intervention will be compared.
