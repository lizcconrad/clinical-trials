  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if 2-weeks of nightly exposure (7-12 hours) to
      moderate hypoxia (~2,400 meters or 7,500 feet) improves glucose metabolism in people with
      type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to hypoxia has been advocated as a possible therapeutic aid against obesity. Indeed,
      our laboratory has provided the first evidence that intermittent, nightly exposure to
      moderate hypoxia is beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity in healthy obese patients
      and, therefore, lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Benefits included reduced
      fasting glucose levels and improved whole-body (skeletal muscle) and hepatic insulin
      sensitivity. Whether such intermittent hypoxia improves glucose metabolism in people with
      type 2 diabetes is unknown.

    <description>Participants will sleep in a tent (which will fit his/her personal mattress) simulating an altitude of ~2,400 meters for 7-12 hours each night for a period of 14 days. Baseline testing measures will include a oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and body composition (iDXA). Post-treatment testing measures will include OGTT only.</description>
