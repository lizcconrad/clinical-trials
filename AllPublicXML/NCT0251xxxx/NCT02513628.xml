  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early prognostication in resuscitated cardiac arrest (CA) patients, within the first day
      after admission in the intensive care unit (ICU), remains difficult. Optic nerve sheath
      diameter (ONSD) measurement could predict increased intracranial pressure. Preliminary works
      showed that ONSD measurement could be used to predict outcome in post-CA patients.

      The aim of this study was to assess the ability of bedside ONSD ultrasonographic measurement
      to predict survival and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at hospital discharge in
      post-cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH).

      Prospective observational study including all consecutive successfully resuscitated and
      TH-treated CA patients without traumatic or neurological etiology of CA in two French ICUs.
      ONSD measurements were performed on day 1, 2, and 3 after return of spontaneous circulation
      (ONSD1,2,3 respectively).

      The primary outcome is survival at hospital discharge (with an average follow-up of 3 month
      until ICU admission).

        All unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤6) patients ≥18 years old, admitted in ICU after
        successful resuscitation from CA, and treated with TH targeted to 33°C were screened.
        Exclusion criteria were as follows: unavailable ONSD measurement within 24 hours after
        return of spontaneous circulation (unavailable investigator, early death, or major
        hemodynamic instability), traumatic or neurological origin of CA, previous cerebrovascular
        disease, facial trauma affecting the orbits and/or eyeballs, and previous history of ocular
        pathology such as exophthalmia, glaucoma or cataract.
