  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety from the mixture of
      daratumumab and rHuPH20 prepared immediately before administration via Subcutaneous (SC)
      delivery (Part 1) and CF (co-formulated daratumumab and rHuPH20 preparation) administration
      via SC delivery of daratumumab (Part 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), multicenter, 2-part,
      Phase 1b dose escalation/expansion study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of
      what the body does to a drug), and antitumor activity of SC delivery of daratumumab to
      participant with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Up to approximately 53 participants
      in part 1 and 80 participants in part 2 will be enrolled. The purpose of Part 1 is to select
      an appropriate SC therapeutic dose for the mixture of daratumumab with rHuPH20 based on
      safety and pharmacokinetics. This dose, selected from part 1 will be the initial dose for the
      co-formulated daratumumab and rHuPH20 preparation to be evaluated in Part 2. The purpose of
      Part 2 is to evaluate the SC delivery of CF and confirm the dose level selected from Part 1
      based on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor activity. Participant's safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

             line of therapy may consist of one or more agents and may include induction,
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and/or maintenance therapy. Radiotherapy,

             has received autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) within 12 weeks before Cycle
             1 Day 1

          -  Participant has a history of malignancy (other than multiple myeloma) within 5 years
             before Cycle 1 Day 1 (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin
             and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that in the opinion of the
