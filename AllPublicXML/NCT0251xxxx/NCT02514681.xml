    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab, trastuzumab
      and chemotherapy as a pertuzumab retreatment compared to trastuzumab and chemotherapy in
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients for previously treated with pertuzumab

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend the
      use of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and taxane as first-line treatment for patients with MBC. As a
      second-line treatment, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is also recommended. After a
      pertuzumab-containing regimen and T-DM1, other HER2-targeted therapeutic regimens, including
      lapatinib-containing regimens and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, are recommended as
      third-line treatments and beyond. However, continual pertuzumab use for progression after a
      pertuzumab-containing regimen and retreatment with pertuzumab are unclear based on evidence.

      The efficacy and the safety of two distinct modalities of a trastuzumab plus
      pertuzumab-containing regimen after pertuzumab use should be assessed in MBC: continual
      treatment and retreatment. However, it is clinically difficult to examine the efficacy of
      continual treatment with a trastuzumab plus pertuzumab-containing regimen because of several
      circumstances including the results of the MARIANNE study.

      In addition, it is also important to evaluate the usefulness of retreatment with a
      pertuzumab-containing regimen. Continual pertuzumab treatment for progression after
      pertuzumab treatment is not same as pertuzumab retreatment. HER2-HER3-signaling suppressed by
      pertuzumab-containing regimens could potentially be restored by anti-HER2 therapy without
      pertuzumab. Pertuzumab retreatment could potentially re-suppress HER2-HER3-signaling.
      Therefore, Pertuzumab retreatment can be more effective than trastuzumab-containing treatment
      without pertuzumab.
