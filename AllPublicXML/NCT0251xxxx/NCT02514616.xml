      The investigational device that will be used in this trial is the EndoStim® Lower Esophageal
      Sphincter (LES) Stimulation System.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and the effectiveness of electrical
      stimulation therapy (EST) on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in the treatment of
      subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

      The study population will consist of subjects diagnosed with pathological GERD as defined by
      abnormal pH and who complain of heartburn, regurgitation or both for &gt; 6 months, on a daily
      PPI use.

      Study Design:

      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study. All subjects undergo screening
      and baseline visits, followed by system implantation, and randomization after 2 weeks to
      either a treatment Group (stimulation) or Control Group (delayed stimulation).

      Randomized subjects complete a 10-week, double-blind phase. At the 14-week visit, subjects
      are unblinded, control group subjects begin receiving stimulation, and all subjects are
      followed for an additional 9-month open-label treatment phase.

      Subjects continue receiving stimulation for an extended follow-up phase involving annual
      visits through 5 years.

      Study Visits:

      Screening and baseline visits. Laparoscopic implantable pulse generator (IPG) and lead
      implant procedure. Post-implant follow-up office visits at 2 weeks/randomization, 6, 10, 14,
      24 and 48 weeks, followed by annual visits through 5 years.

      Sample Size and Scope:

      Forty-six subjects will be implanted and followed to 12 months after stimulation treatment at
      3 investigational sites.
