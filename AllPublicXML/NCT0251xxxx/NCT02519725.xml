    <description>The intervention is the elaboration of an ICU diary by caregivers and families The first pages of the diary is standardized to include an explanation of the purpose of the diary. The diary is maintained by the family and ICU staff. The only instruction given to the families and staff members about diary entries is to refrain from writing about confidential matters that could not be shared among the patients, the staff and the relatives. Staff members are free to express compassion and their hope, or absence thereof, that the patient would recover. Relatives can speak freely with the patients without receiving guidance from the ICU staff. At the minimum, the ICU staff write a brief entry at each weekly staff meeting. For patients discharged to wards and if he can receive the diary, the diary is given to the patient. If the patient died, the diary is given to the family.</description>
