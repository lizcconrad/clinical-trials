  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active control, parallel group, exploratory phase 4 study
      to compare the effect of teneligliptin versus sitagliptin on glucose variability when added
      on to metformin in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with in adequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus who
      have been on metformin (1,000 mg or above) for 8 weeks at least or longer and randomly add
      teneliglipin (20 mg/day) or sitagliptin (100 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Continuous glucose
      monitoring will be checked before and after 4-week administration of teneliglipin or
      sitagliptin together with mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Other efficacy and safety
      parameters will be also assessed.
