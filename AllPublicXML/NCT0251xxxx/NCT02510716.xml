      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary
      efficacy of a Scheduled Gradual Reduction (SGR) intervention via SMS (short message service)
      text messaging plus SMS Support Messages in decreasing smoking in an older adult rural
      population. The SGR group (n=20) will receive a four-week SGR program delivered via SMS text
      messages plus SMS support messages. The control group (n=20) will receive SMS support
      messages to aid in quitting.
