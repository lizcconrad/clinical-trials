      Background: Pediatric asthma is the most common chronic illness among children and is
      associated with poor quality of life, activity restriction, school absences, and thousands of
      physician visits annually. The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of using
      an innovative tracking system (CareTRx) for the self-management of asthma, including daily
      and rescue medication use, among children and adolescents with pediatric asthma.

      The primary study objective is to measure the effectiveness of using an innovative tracking
      system (CareTRx) for the self-management of asthma, including daily and rescue medication
      use, among children with asthma. The study objectives will be achieved using a pre-post
      design for the participants. The investigators aim to enroll at least 26 participants for a
      3-month intervention period. With this pilot study, the investigators hope to examine the
      impact of self-management behaviors on health outcomes including asthma symptoms and quality
      of life measures.

    <description>Asthma symptom control as a measure of effectiveness of self-management behavior on asthma control, measured by Asthma Control Test (ACT). Asthma control test is a survey used to evaluate asthma control in patients. It includes 5 multiple questions that ask about how much of the time patient was having asthma symptoms. The higher the score the better asthma control. Lower scores especially less than 19 represent poor asthma control. each question has 5 answers. The total score is the sum of all the scores from 5 questions. the maximum score on the test is 25 which is excellent asthma control and the lowest is 0 which defines extremely poor asthma control.</description>

    <description>Forced expiratory volume measured in liters is the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced expiration and helps with evaluation of asthma control. FEV1 was only measure at baseline to assess the participants asthma status at baseline.</description>

          <description>Asthma control test is a survey used to evaluate asthma control in patients. It includes 5 multiple questions that ask about how much of the time patient was having asthma symptoms. The higher the score the better asthma control. Lower scores especially less than 19 represent poor asthma control. each question has 5 answers. The total score is the sum of all the scores from 5 questions. the maximum score on the test is 25 which is excellent asthma control and the lowest is 0 which defines extremely poor asthma control.</description>
