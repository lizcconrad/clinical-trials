    <description>SVR12 was defined as plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than the lower limit of quantification [&lt;LLOQ]) 12 weeks after the last dose of active study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint was superiority of the percentage of treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced HCV subgenotype 1b (GT1b)-infected participants treated with 3-DAA (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir [25 mg/150 mg/100 once daily] and dasabuvir [250 mg twice daily]) who achieved SVR12 compared with the historical control rate for comparable patients treated with telaprevir (TVR) plus pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and RBV.</description>
