      This study is considered a pilot exploratory study. Intervention, prospective, double-armed,
      randomized, placebo-control clinical trial.

      The therapeutic effect of oral Magnesium sulfate on spasticity and constipation will be
      studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity and constipation are major problems hindering improvement in motor development in
      children with cerebral palsy.

      Decreasing spasticity will have a positive effect on motor development and quality of life
      for the child and his family.

      The aim is to study the therapeutic and adverse effects of oral magnesium sulfate therapy on
      spasticity and constipation in infants and children with cerebral palsy.

      Hundred children with spastic cerebral palsy will be randomized to either intervention group
      n=50 will be treated with magnesium sulfate 4% orally for 28 days to treat spasticity and
      constipation in addition to their conventional treatment, or placebo group n=50 will receive
      conventional treatment and placebo.
