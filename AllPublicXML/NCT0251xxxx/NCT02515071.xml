  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to decrease systemic
      blood pressure in multiple populations as well as increase organ perfusion in areas of
      interest such as the pancreas and brain. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is
      associated with high blood pressure, dysglycaemia and impaired vigilance. The effect of
      dietary nitrate in OSAS has not been reported.

      Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to decrease systemic
      blood pressure in multiple populations as well as increase organ perfusion in areas of
      interest such as the pancreas and brain. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is
      associated with high blood pressure, dysglycaemia and impaired vigilance. The effect of
      dietary nitrate in OSAS has not been reported.

      The investigators hypothesize that chronic nitrate consumption might decrease blood pressure
      and dysglycaemia and improve vigilance compared to a placebo beetroot juice.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial. At baseline,
      mid-point and endpoint ambulatory blood pressure will be assessed in conjunction with
      demographics, questionnaires, vigilance and blood draw. After baseline measures, each subject
      will be randomized to consume nitrate rich beetroot juice for 14 consecutive nights when
      assessments will be repeated followed by 14 nights of placebo and endpoint assessments or the
      converse.
