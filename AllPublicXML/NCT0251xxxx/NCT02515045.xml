      To compare the use of an injectable compound containing an antibiotic and an
      anti-inflammatory at time of cataract surgery to standard of care that is the use 3 different
      topical medications to prevent inflammation and infection after routine cataract surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Key factors for a successful cataract surgery include, among others, preoperative
      measurements for accurate intraocular lens (IOL) calculation, surgical technique and
      surgeon's experience but also the use of prophylactic topical antibiotics and
      anti-inflammatories (steroidal and non-steroidal, NSAID) to decrease the risk of
      postoperative infection (i.e. endophthalmitis) and intraocular inflammation (i.e. macular
      edema, CME).

      Even though, the large body of literature that supports the significance of prophylactic eye
      drops prior to surgery, patient compliance is a common problem. Different factors have been
      associated with patient's lack of compliance. It could be due to patient's inability to self
      administer the drops, lack of understanding of the importance of using the prophylactic
      treatment as well as understanding the instructions of how to administer the drops and its
      storage, or just forgetfulness or the fact that they don't like to put the drops multiple
      times a day for 2-4 weeks, therefore they just avoid doing it.

      There is a new option called &quot;Dropless cataract surgery&quot;. This modality of treatment involves
      the injection of an eye compatible compound at time of cataract surgery.

      The purpose of is to assess the efficacy the compound injected during routine cataract
      surgery and intraocular (IOL) implantation with and without a topical NSAID compared to
      standard prophylactic treatment that includes the topical use of Moxifloxacin, Ilevro, and
      Prednisolone acetate 1%.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Preoperative Exam) in Macular Thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1.</time_frame>
    <description>Macula is the area in the retina that is responsible for the best central vision. Changes in its thickness may occur after cataract surgery due to the normal inflammatory process that occurs postoperatively but it returns to preoperative values unless there is an underlying disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline (Preoperative Exam) in Pachymetry (Corneal Thickness)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>Cornea is the clear part of the front of the eye. Normal corneal thickness is in average 0.540 mm. The corneal thickness is measured with a handheld device called pachymeter.
An increase in corneal thickness may indicate corneal edema (swelling of the cornea) that could be seen after ocular surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline (Preoperative Exam) in Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1.</time_frame>
    <description>Intraocular pressure refers to the pressure inside the eye. It is measured in mmHg using a device called a tonometer. The mean IOP is 15.5 mmHg. Raised IOP after cataract surgery is common and in most cases it is transient and benign.</description>
