      Dexmedetomidine's Sedative Effect on Diabetic Patient
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is a high selective α2 agonist,its sedative and analgesia feature is
      acclaimed. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with α2 excessive
      adrenaline receptors expression. This study is to evaluate whether the use of dexmedetomidine
      is helpful to Diabetic Patient through its antisympathetic effect
