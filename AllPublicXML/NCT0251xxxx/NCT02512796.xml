  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gadolinium contrast agents are frequently administered for MRI imaging. Very little is known
      of its toxicity outside of patients with reduced renal function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gadolinium contrast is administered to patients during MRI imaging. Recently, the
      investigators have observed potential gadolinium toxicity in some patients. To investigate
      this, the investigators propose to collect clinical data and lab data obtained as a part of
      clinical care. The investigators also plan to obtain 25 cc of peripheral blood at 2-4 weeks,
      4-6 weeks and again at 3 months to identify unique monocyte signatures, gene polymorphisms,
      and to quantitate circulating fibrocytes (in fresh blood and after culture). Plan to enroll
      15 patients with kidney, pancreas or liver transplant and exposed to gadolinium contrast
      agents, 15 non-transplant patients exposed to gadolinium contrast and 30 age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls not exposed to gadolinium contrast.

      Investigators plan to study the circulating fibrocytes numbers, changes in monocyte gene
      transcripts, identify polymorphism in gadolinium transport genes (OATPB1/3 and MRP2) and
      examine their osteogenic potential in cultures.

        organ transplants and not exposed to gadolinium contrast agents (within the last 3 years)
