    <textblock>
      The present study is an exploratory trial to establish a feasible DLW (doubly labelled water)
      protocol for implementation in clinical trials conducted at Profil Institut für
      Stoffwechselforschung, investigating treatment options for overweight and obesity in
      populations with and without diabetic comorbidity. The study aims at the practical validation
      of a 1-2-week DLW protocol in overweight and obese type 2 diabetic subjects.

      Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) values as assessed by DLW will then be compared to (1) TEE as
      calculated based on individual anthropometric measurements (including body composition) using
      the Müller formula and the AEE (activity related energy expenditure) based on reported work
      place and leisure time activities and (2) TEE as calculated from measured REE (resting energy
      expenditure) as assessed by indirect calorimetry and the AEE based on information recorded by
      the subjects in a physical activity diary and corresponding pedometer counts. Moreover, TEE
      assessments will be repeated once (separated by 2-4 weeks) to determine intra-subject
      variability / re-test reliability of the measurement.

    <description>DLW (doubly labeled water) method measures isotope dilution spaces and elimination rates to assess total energy expenditure (TEE). After enriching the body water of a subject with DLW (2H and 18O), it is only necessary to collect urine samples at defined time points, usually over a period of 1-2 weeks, so that the measurement can be done in individuals able to engage in their typical habits without restrictions. The resulting TEE measurement represents an integral value over the measurement period.</description>

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;= 25 kg/m2.

          5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (as diagnosed clinically) ≥ 12 months.

          6. HbA1c &lt;= 9 % at screening visit.

          7. Stable treatment (&gt;= 3 month) with

               -  Oral antidiabetics (OADs) (except OADs that are associated with a reduction in
                  body weight (α-glucosidase inhibitors, sodium glucose transporter 2-inhibitors
                  (SGLT2))) and/or

               -  basal insulin injections and/or

               -  a dietary regimen. Subjects on a basal-bolus insulin regimen will not be
                  enrolled.

          8. Considered generally healthy (apart from type 2 diabetes mellitus and with the
             exception of conditions associated with diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome,
             such as dyslipidaemia and hypertension) upon completion of medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, and analysis of laboratory safety variables, as judged by
             the Investigator.
