      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of isatuximab
           when administered in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone
           (VCDI) based on the dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLTs) observed in patients with newly
           diagnosed multiple myeloma non-eligible for transplantation.

        -  To evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy (overall response rate and complete response
           rate) of isatuximab in combination with 2 bortezomib-based regimens (VCDI) and
           isatuximab with bortezomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide (VRDI).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the overall safety profile of isatuximab in combination with each
           bortezomib-based regimen, including cumulative toxicities.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab and each combination drug
           in each isatuximab/bortezomib-based regimen.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab in combination treatments.

        -  To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of both bortezomib-based regimens in terms of
           duration of response and progression-free survival (VRDI cohort only).

        -  To assess the relationship between clinical effects (adverse event [AE] and/or tumor
           response) and CD38 receptor density.

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will include:

        -  A period to assess eligibility (screening or baseline period) of up to 3 weeks for VCDI
           cohort, up to 28 days for VRDI cohort;

        -  for patients in the VCDI cohort: a treatment period including up to 12 induction
           treatment cycles (50-week duration).

        -  for patients in the VRDI cohort: a treatment period including up to 4 induction cycles
           (24 week duration).

        -  Following induction, both cohorts have maintenance periods consisting of 4 week cycles
           until progression, unacceptable AE, or patient willingness to discontinue and an
           end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of treatment.

        -  Patients that discontinue therapy for reasons other than progression will have follow-up
           visits until progression or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy,
           whichever is earlier.
