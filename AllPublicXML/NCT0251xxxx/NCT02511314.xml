  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the use of an electronic incontinence identification
      system with nursing home support (Tena Identifi) versus usual care on the quality, resource
      use and outcomes of continence care for older residents of nursing care homes.

    <description>Tena Identifi is an integrated electronic monitoring system based upon a wearable continence pad which allows registration of resident's micturition patterns over a 72 hour period, allowing caregivers to construct an individualised continence care plan, including use of appropriate products.
To create a voiding report, a resident wears the Identifi Sensor Wear with an attached Identifi Logger for three consecutive days (72 hours). The logger continuously logs the moisture status of the brief. The resulting data is sent to a server via 3 G signal where it is mapped onto a graph indicating voiding times and volumes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Nursing homes: A facility which:

               -  provides care for residents over the age of 65 years

               -  has an existing policy for continence care

               -  is registered with the appropriate Provincial authorities

               -  engages in recording of the RAI- MDS v2.0

          -  Residents: Nursing home residents over the age of 65 requiring a continence assessment
             upon entry to the nursing home or requiring a reassessment because of either a change
             in clinical status or provincial requirement shall be eligible for entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Residents

               -  at the end of life,

               -  with profound behavioural disturbances likely to render the use of the Tena
                  Identifi system impractical

               -  an identifiable, potentially reversible cause for their urinary incontinence
                  (e.g.: acute urinary tract infection)

               -  with double incontinence dominated by faecal incontinence

          -  Staff and Managers - Staff who did not take the training on the Identifi system or
             managers whose units that did not participate in the study will be ineligible for the
             focus group.
