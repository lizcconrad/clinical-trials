  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of reducing tobacco-associated health disparities between cannot be
      understated. Racial/ethnic minorities are less likely to quit, and tend to have elevated
      stress and depressive symptoms, which may contribute to cessation disparities. Cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for cessation addresses these concerns and has the potential to
      reduce/eliminate disparities. Preliminary research found racial/ethnic differences in
      baseline perceived stress and depressive symptoms. Following CBT, these differences were no
      longer present. Moreover, compared to Whites, African Americans exhibited blunted
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning. This randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      will be the first to test the impact of CBT on smoking cessation disparities. The specific
      aims are to: (1) Examine the effects of CBT on perceived stress and depressive symptoms in a
      racially/ethnically diverse sample; (2) test the efficacy of CBT for eliminating smoking
      cessation disparities; and (3) examine physiological distress as an underlying mechanism for
      the effects of CBT on racial/ethnic minority smokers (exploratory). It is hypothesized that
      CBT will eliminate racial/ethnic differences in distress symptoms compared to the general
      health education (GHE) control group. A condition and race/ethnicity interaction on 7-day
      point prevalence abstinence (ppa) is also expected, with no racial/ethnic differences in
      cessation in the CBT condition only. It is also hypothesized that HPA functioning will
      mediate the effect of CBT on smoking cessation, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities.
      This study has implications for eliminating disparities in psychosocial factors related to
      cessation, and disparities in success. Addressing stress and depressive symptoms through CBT
      may facilitate cessation, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities.

    <description>The four-week CBT protocol includes 4 sessions during week 1, 2 sessions during week 2, 1 session during week 3, and 1 session during week 4. Sessions may include a functional analysis of smoking patterns, environmental cues, and motivation for change, and cover nicotine addiction and withdrawal, health consequences, benefits of cessation, stress management, negative affect, alcohol use, triggers, coping responses, cognitive restructuring, social support, decision making, weight control, and physical activity.</description>

    <description>The four-week CBT protocol includes 4 sessions during week 1, 2 sessions during week 2, 1 session during week 3, and 1 session during week 4. Sessions may include didactic information on tobacco-associated morbidities, such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Content may include Power Point-delivered lectures on the prevalence, etiology, basic pathology, symptom patterns, and treatment of the conditions, and discussion questions designed to facilitate learning and interest. Smoking cessation specific topics will not be addressed, and coping skills will not be provided. Participants will be allowed to share feelings regarding smoking (if they mention them) and general questions will be answered, although no specific behavioral quitting advice will be provided (i.e., they will be encouraged to adhere to the TNP protocol).</description>
