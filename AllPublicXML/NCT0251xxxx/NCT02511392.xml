      Objectives.-Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive stimulation
      methods that became widely used as therapeutic tools in neuropsychiatric research. The aim of
      this study is to Evaluate the therapeutic impact of different frequencies of repetitive
      transcranial stimulation (1HZ, 10HZ) in OCD patients. Material and Methods; Forty five
      patients of OCD were participated in the study. All patients fulfilled the diagnostic
      criteria of DSM-IV-TR. The mean age of the patients was 27.1+4.5 years. Each patient was
      subjected to the following: Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Anxiety
      Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S). The patients
      were randomly classified into three equal groups using closed envelop: 1st group received 1
      Hz rTMS at 100% of the RMT, 2nd group received 10 Hz rTMS with intensity of 100% of the RMT
      and 3rd group was sham group received the sham stimulation with a total 2000 pulses every day
      for each group for 10 sessions. Follow up of the patients using the same previous scales
      after the end of sessions and 3 months later.

    <description>Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS). It is an observer-rated scale that measures the severity of OCD symptoms. It is not a diagnostic tool. It is formed of 2 subscales, one for obsessions and another for compulsions. Each subscale consists of 5 items; і) time spent in the symptoms, іі) interference from the symptoms, ііі) subjective distress from symptoms, іv) resistance over symptoms, v) control over symptom. Each of these is rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms). The total Y-BOCS score ranges between: 0-7 subclinical 8-15 mild 16-23 moderate 24-31 severe 32-40 extreme (Goodman et al., 1989).</description>

    <description>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). The HAM-A was one of the first rating scales developed to measure the severity of anxiety symptoms by Max Hamilton (1959), and is still widely used today in both clinical and research settings. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where 0-14,normal range; 15-28, mild to moderate anxiety; 29-42, severe anxiety; 43-56, very severe anxiety. The scale has been translated into Arabic by Lotfy Fatem (1994).</description>

    <description>Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S): It is a 7- point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. (Guy 1976). Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1,normal,not at all ill; 2,borderline mentally ill; 3,mildly ill; 4,moderately ill; 5,markedly ill; 6,severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.
