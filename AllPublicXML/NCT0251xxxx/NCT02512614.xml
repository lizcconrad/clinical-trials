  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In March 2012, the investigators initiated a prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled
      field trial in Kisumu County, located in an area in western Kenya which has the highest
      under-five mortality rate in Kenya with 149 childhood deaths per 1,000 live births 9. The
      study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an antimicrobial hand towel (hereafter
      referred to as towel) in preventing diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections,
      self-reported fever, and skin infections in children &lt;2 years old.
