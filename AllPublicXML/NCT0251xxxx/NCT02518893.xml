  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to describe service members' experiences as participants in
      health research, including their reasons for deciding for or against research participation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies of war injuries have included as research participants US military service
      members returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Despite the increased demand for
      military relevant research, little is known about the recent experiences of service members
      as research participants or about their research participation decisions.

      The study aims are to: 1). Describe the experiences of military service members who have
      participated in health research; 2). Explore the reasons military service members decide for
      or against participation in health research; and 3). Identify effective strategies for
      promoting military service members' participation in research.

      Demographic data will be collected from up to 50 service members who have participated in
      health research or who have previously declined research participation.

      Up to 40 service members will participate in individual, in-depth, semi-structured interviews
      in person or via telephone.
