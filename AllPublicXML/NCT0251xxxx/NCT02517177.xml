      As a direct consequence of exposure to microgravity, astronauts experience a number of
      physiological changes which can lead to serious medical implications. Most immediate and
      significant is the headward shift of body fluids and the removal of gravitational loading
      from bone and muscles, resulting in progressive changes of the cardiovascular and
      musculoskeletal systems. The cardiovascular systems is subject to rapid changes which has
      been demonstrated in studies of short term (shuttle) and long term missions to Skylab and
      MIR.

      Our main hypothesis is that there is a linear relationship between the gravity level (0G,
      0.16G, 0.38G, 1G, 1.8G) and the cardiovascular parameters (heart rate (HR), heart rate
      variability (HRV), blood pressure and blood pressure variability (BPV) as well the spectral
      analysis of HRV and BPV.
