    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff arthropathy is a cause of shoulder arthritis which is a common condition seen
      both in primary and secondary care. It is a painful condition, with significant disability.
      Specialist shoulder replacements have found acceptance within the trust, nationally and
      internationally although there are high complication rates. There is however a significant
      cost difference (fifty fold) between a reverse total shoulder replacement and a botox
      injection, and to date there have been no randomised control trials, or any registered,
      comparing the use of a botox injection for pain relief in cuff arthropathy versus no
      treatment. If there is a significant clinical difference in the pain outcomes between the
      two, this could result in significant savings to the NHS and the taxpayer as a whole. If high
      levels of pain relief could be predictably obtained using Botulinum A toxin injections then
      potentially patients could avoid the need for surgery.

      Null Hypothesis This is a pilot / feasability study. The null hypothesis is that there is no
      effect on the pain or oxford shoulder scores reported by patients receiving a targeted
      botulinum A toxin injection in the presence of cuff arthropathy at 6 weeks, 3 months or 6
      months compared with the baseline values.

      Objectives The aim of this feasability study is to provide the necessary information for the
      planning of a future trial. It will test the feasibility of running such a trial and provide
      estimates of the differences in outcome measures and information on resource data.

      All potential participants for this study will be identified by an Orthopaedic Shoulder
      Consultant in the shoulder clinics run at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Trust. The patients
      will be screened for eligibility by a research associate (SG). The eligibility criteria will
      be that the patient is medically fit for an operation, and has painful rotator cuff
      arthropathy, that is deemed suitable for intervention by the consultant surgeon. The patients
      will be informed verbally and in writing about the trial by the research associate and
      informed consent will be taken.

      The participating patients will be allocated to an USS guided botox injection. All patients
      will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires prior to the injection: the Oxford
      Shoulder Score (OSS), a Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and the EQ-5D. The range of movement of
      the shoulder joint will be documented in the usual fashion.

      The injections will all be done by Dr Anaspure (Consultant Radiologist) under USS guidance in
      a standard manner.

      After the injection, patients will be reviewed using the range of movement, OSS, a patient
      satisfaction score and EQ-5D at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post injection. A record will
      be kept of any complications associated with the treatment. This data will be collected by
      the research associate, who is independent of either intervention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria The only eligibility criterion for participation in this study is
             that the patient is medically fit for an operation and diagnosed with symptomatic
             rotator cuff arthropathy. They must be able to give informed consent and have evidence
             of cuff arthropathy on plain radiographs of the affected shoulder.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria Contra-indications to surgery (defined as severe cardiac
             impairment, e.g. heart or valve replacement, arrhythmia, previous myocardial
             infarction; severe respiratory impairment, e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             asthma that has required hospital admission; any other systemic medical condition that
             would produce a specific contraindication to a general anaesthetic).

        Evidence that the patient would be unable to adhere to trial procedures or complete
        questionnaires, such as dementia or intravenous drug abuse Note: If a recruited patient
        requires a contra-lateral shoulder botox injection during the trial period, this second
        shoulder cannot be included in the study since the result of this intervention would not be
        independent from the first intervention.

        Other exclusion criteria include:

        Previous fractures or dislocations of the shoulder. Previous surgery on the affected
        shoulder. Any neurological or medical condition resulting in spasticity
