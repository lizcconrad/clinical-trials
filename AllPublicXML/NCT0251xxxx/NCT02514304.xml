    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, two component observational and standardized case-control
      study is to evaluate risk factors of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with a prospective
      3-month and 12-month follow-up to examine outcomes and their possible causes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antithrombotic therapies are effective for prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events but cause
      bleeding. Emerging evidence indicates that extra-cranial bleeding is just as important as
      myocardial infarction as a marker of risk for subsequent non-fatal and fatal CV events, but
      this issue has not been prospectively studied. If the association between bleeding and CV
      events is causal, prevention of bleeding, by targeting the risk factors, and prevention of
      the complications of bleeding, by targeting the causal pathways, could substantially reduce
      the burden of bleeding-related CV events. Progress in developing these approaches has been
      limited by a knowledge gap. Known risk factors do not fully explain bleeding risk and the
      investigators do not understand the mechanisms linking bleeding with adverse outcome and
      whether the association is causal.

      One-half of bleeds that lead to CV events in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy arise
      in the GI tract. INTERBLEED- Pilot and Vanguard plans to explore risk factors for GI
      bleeding, and outcomes after GI bleeding, in this well-circumscribed and important group
      using a case-control design with prospective 3 month and 12 month follow-up.

      Specific objectives are to: (1) identify risk factors for GI bleeding and estimate their
      population attributable risk; (2) determine the risk of non-fatal and fatal CV events and
      functional outcomes after GI bleeding; and (3) explore the possible mechanisms linking GI
      bleeding with CV outcome.

      INTERBLEED - Pilot and Vanguard will recruit 300 case-control pairs from 3 centres in
      Hamilton, Ontario, 300 case-control pairs from 3 other centres across Canada and 800
      case-control pairs from a minimum of 8 sites internationally will be recruited. Data will be
      collected on patient characteristics, medical history and, in cases, the work-up, management
      and outcomes after bleeding. Data from the INTERBLEED-Pilot and Vanguard will inform the
      design of the larger study that ultimately will help to develop new approaches to reducing
      the burden of bleeding-related CV events.
