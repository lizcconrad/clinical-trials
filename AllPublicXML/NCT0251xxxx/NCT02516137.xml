      The purpose of this study is to find out if individuals with tight hamstring muscles who
      receive dry needling in addition to a standard stretching exercise program, show an
      improvement in hamstring tightness and function compared to individuals with tight hamstrings
      who receive either sham dry needling or no needling (blunt needle) in addition to a standard
      stretching program.

    <textblock>
      Tightness of the hamstring muscles is a risk factor for injury. Currently, there is no data
      on the effect of dry needling on hamstring extensibility or functional performance measures
      among asymptomatic individuals with hamstring muscle tightness. The investigator wants to
      assess if individuals with tight hamstring muscles who receive dry needling in addition to a
      standard stretching exercise program, exhibit reduced hamstring tightness and improved
      functional performance compared to individuals with tight hamstrings who receive either sham
      dry needling or no needling (blunt needle) in addition to a standard stretching program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in hamstring muscle extensibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 5 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Bilateral 90/90 hamstring muscle extensibility passive range of motion (PROM) measurements will be assessed using a goniometer. The goniometer measures the angle of the joint at both extremes of the range of motion (ROM). An increase in the passive range of motion (PROM) indicates increased hamstring muscle extensibility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in unilateral hop for distance test scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 5 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The functional performance of the hamstring muscles will be assessed by using the unilateral hop for distance test. The subjects will be instructed to stand on the leg to be tested and hop and land on the same limb. The distance hopped, measured at the level of the great toe, will be measured (centimeters). Scores will be recorded as absolute distance (in centimeters). An increase in the score (distance covered) from baseline to 5 weeks from baseline indicates better functional performance of the hamstrings.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in crossover hop for distance tests scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 5 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The functional performance of the hamstring muscles will be assessed by using the crossover hop for distance test. The subjects will be instructed to hop forward 3 times while alternately crossing over a marking. The total distance hopped forward will be recorded. The heel of the hop leg will be used to determine the length of the jump. Crossover hop limb symmetry index (LSI) scores for knee function within normal ranges are generally greater than 95%. An increase in the crossover hop limb symmetry index (LSI) from baseline to 5 weeks from baseline indicates better functional performance of the hamstrings.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dynamometry pressure readings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 5 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The strength of the hamstrings will be assessed using a hand-held dynamometer.The subjects will be asked to exert maximal force against the dynamometer and the reading is recorded. Scores are based on force production in kilograms or pounds; kilograms (0-90), pounds (0-200). Higher pressure scores indicate better muscle strength of the hamstring muscles.</description>

    <description>Dry needling will be performed on two points over the hamstring muscles on the randomly determined side. Points 2 cm distal to the ischial tuberosity and halfway between the ischial tuberosity and popliteal crease within the medial and lateral muscle bellies will be identified and the skin cleansed with rubbing alcohol. A Seirin L- type 50 mm needle will be inserted into each of the two points to a depth no greater than three-quarters length of the needle into the hamstring muscle for 30 seconds using a vertical pistoning technique and then statically up to 10 minutes.</description>
