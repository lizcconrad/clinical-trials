  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a food
      supplement OMNIA compared to a placebo in reducing the body fat mass in 70 overweight
      subjects during 12 weeks treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity represent a serious public health issue. These conditions are
      characterized by an abnormal or excessive accumulation of body fat mass and they are related
      to an increase risk of developing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, diabetes,
      arthrosis and certain kind of cancer (breast; colon). It's thus necessary to find new
      products able to counteract both overweight and obesity.

      Omnia is a food supplement based on a Phaseolus vulgaris extract. It has pancreatic amylase
      inhibition properties.

      In the following clinical trial, OMNIA will be administrated to a group of overweight
      subjects in order to evaluate its efficacy on reducing the body fat mass. Its action will be
      compared to a placebo administered to a second group of overweight volunteers with the same
      modalities as OMNIA.
