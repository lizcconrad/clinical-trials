  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A considerable proportion of bereaved individuals experience chronic and disabling grief
      (so-called complicated or prolonged grief). Complicated grief is associated with severe
      mental and physical health problems as well as impaired social and occupational functioning.
      Interventions based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and applied via the internet have shown
      to be efficacious for this condition, but have not yet been adapted and evaluated in Norway.
      The aim of the current study is to adapt an internet-based cognitive-behavioral intervention
      for complicated grief and evaluate its effectiveness as a pilot study.
