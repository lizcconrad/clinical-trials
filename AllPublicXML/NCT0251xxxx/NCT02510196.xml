      Teaching program population: Participants in Hadassah Ein Kerem ultrasound training day -
      Anesthesia residents Exclusion criteria: Refusal to participate, insufficient understanding
      of written English used in the questionnaires

      Stage 1 - training The aims and requirements of the teaching program will be explained to the
      participants at the start of the workshop. All participants will be given a sticker with a
      number and a questionnaire numbered about current ultrasound practice which is numbered
      according to participant number to allow for blinding. Anyone not wishing to participate can
      either remove their sticker or not return the questionnaire at the end of the session. The
      number on the questionnaire correlated to participant number. This will be recorded against
      the participant name to allow for further follow up. All participants will rotate normally
      throughout the sessions. At the end of the neuraxial session participants will be scored by
      the session leader according to their ability to adequately carry out the procedure. Scores
      will be correlated to participant number.

      Stage 2 - assessment of skill retention

      Following the training day participants will randomly be allocated into two groups. One group
      will receive regular reminders to use ultrasound for all neuraxial anesthesias they perform
      in the OR or labor ward. They will be reminded on a regular basis that ultrasound is a new
      tool to assist them in performing neuraxial ultrasound. The other group with be allowed to
      continue with their regular practice and will not receive reminders to use ultrasound for
      neuraxial anesthesia insertion. Two months after the initial training day all participants
      with be observed performing neuraxial anesthesia and re-assesed according to the original
      scoring system. Each participant will be assessed 3 times over a 6 month period.
