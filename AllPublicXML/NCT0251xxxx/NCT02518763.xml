    <textblock>
      The vitamin D deficiency (25OHD) is very common and affects about 80% of the population of
      French osteoporotic women over 50 years [5]. It contributes significantly to bone fragility
      and consequently the risk of fracture. To remedy this deficit, it is necessary to provide a
      suitable and sustainable supplementation. Changes in vitamin D deficiency ranging from
      undetectable to a 25OHD value very close to 30ng / ml lead to differences in therapeutic
      regimens, specific to each clinician in the absence of precise data in the literature. No
      consensus on supplementation dosages and methods have been proposed so far. Also, given the
      frequency of vitamin D deficiency including osteoporosis observed in the population, it
      became necessary to establish a single, uniform regimen for all patients with osteoporosis
