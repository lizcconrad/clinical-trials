  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young infants are most vulnerable to severe disease and even death when infected with
      Bordetella Pertussis. The current vaccines and vaccination programs do not guarantee
      protection of neonates. During the last weeks of pregnancy, maternal IgG antibodies are
      transferred actively to the fetus. Administration of a pertussis containing vaccine during
      pregnancy offers protection through high titers of maternal antibodies transferred to the
      child. Since transplacental transport is immature, infants who are born prior to 37 weeks of
      gestation, might be vulnerable to pertussis infection even though maternal vaccination was
      administered, but specific data are lacking. The primary aim of this observational study is
      to measure whether vaccination during pregnancy offers protection to preterm born infants
      through higher titers of maternal antibodies, despite immature transplacental transport. Four
      cohorts of mother-infant pairs will be recruited: term versus preterm born infants, born from
      either vaccinated women or not vaccinated women. These mother-infant pairs are recruited
      according to the vaccination status of the mother and to the gestational age at delivery.
      Pertussis specific antibody titers (anti-Pertussis Toxin, anti-Filamentous haemagglutinin,
      anti-Pertactin titers) will be monitored in blood samples of the mothers at delivery to
      measure the possible influence of both gestational age and maternal vaccination status. In
      order to measure the decline of maternal antibodies in the first weeks of life, blood will be
      taken from cords as well as from infants at 8 weeks of age, before the first infant pertussis
      vaccine is administered.

      Pertussis antibodies to the same antigens will be measured in all infants after a primary
      series of acellular pertussis vaccines administered at 8,12 and 16 weeks of age and before
      and after a booster dose in the second year of life.

      In addition, cellular mediated immune responses will be evaluated in a subgroup of infants
      before and after a primary series of infants vaccines. A last goal is to measure whether
      vaccination during pregnancy could offer additional maternal antibodies through breast milk.
      Again a comparison is made between preterm and term born infants, born from either vaccinated
      or unvaccinated women. The amount of lactoferrin and pertussis toxin specific IgA in breast
      milk samples will be measured in samples taken at birth (colostrum), and at several time
      points afterwards as long as breastfeeding is continued.

        A cohort of preterm born infants will be compared to term born infants, and both will be
        compared within groups of vaccinated women (adult acellular pertussis containing vaccine)
        or unvaccinated women.
