      This research study is looking at a small device that measures white blood cell (WBC) counts
      by being placed against the finger nail for participants who are undergoing stem cell
      transplantation at Massachusetts General Hospital or have a hematologic malignancy and are
      being seen as an outpatient.

      The objective of this study is to obtain data that would support the use of a method to
      obtain WBC counts from images of small blood vessels called capillaries. These would be
      obtained by pressing a small device on the surface of participants' finger nails to look
      through the nail. These images will be obtained using a portable microscope called the
      Dino-Lite Digital Microscope.

      Having a non-invasive way to quickly measure WBC counts could be useful for a variety of
      healthcare applications.

    <description>Commercial portable optical microscope (AM4113-N5UT Dino-Lite ) which will be employed during the study for a pre determined time of non-invasive imaging of the nailfold capillaries in ASCT patients.
For Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) participants, the imaging will be performed once prior to ASCT upon admission to the hospital, and then daily after ASCT (starting on day +7) until count recovery</description>
