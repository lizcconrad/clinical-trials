  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tested the extent to which TOP®, when replicated with fidelity, produced impacts
      on sexual risk-taking behaviors in the short term and the longer term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomized controlled trial. Teachers were randomized within schools to the
      treatment and control conditions. To assess the impact of offering TOP®, students were
      surveyed three times: at baseline, before the intervention began for the treatment group; 12
      months after baseline (short-term impacts); and 24 months after baseline (long-term impacts).
      Baseline data and subsequent follow-up data were collected using a Web-based survey. Paper
      surveys were used as back-up for baseline data collection. The pooled survey data from two
      school-year cohorts (school years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013) were used to estimate program
      impacts using an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Program fidelity and interview data were
      used to describe program implementation.TOP® was delivered in middle schools, high schools,
      alternative schools, and public charter schools in Hennepin County. It was implemented during
      school hours in classes that spanned an entire school year with the same cohort of students.
      The subject of the class in which TOP® was placed differed across schools (for example,
      social studies, study hall, health).

    <description>TOP® is a youth development and service learning program for youth ages 12 to 17 designed to reduce teenage pregnancy and increase school success by helping youth develop a positive self-image, life management skills, and realistic goals. The TOP® program model consists of three components implemented in school, after school, or in community settings over nine consecutive months: (1) weekly curriculum sessions, (2) community service learning (CSL), and (3) positive adult guidance and support. The TOP® Changing Scenes® curriculum is separated into four age- and stage-appropriate levels, which range from Level 1, typically for youth ages 12 or 13, to Level 4, typically for youth age 17.</description>
