  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Nosten® device is able to reduce the time of underinflated balloon and removes
      excess pressure. This device may thus reduce the risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)
      and early tracheal lesions resulting from intubation with decreased discomfort, morbidity,
      and nursing workload.

      The main objective of the investigators is to show that Nosten® device is more effective than
      monitoring and manual inflation of the balloon of the tracheal tube to prevent VAP
      occurrence.

      Multicenter, controlled, prospective randomized open study with blinded assessment of the
      primary endpoint. Two groups are set up: one experimental group with the control of the cuff
      pressure by the Nosten® device versus one control group with the manual monitoring of the
      cuff pressure and inflation of the balloon.

      Inclusion: All orotracheally intubated patients for an expected period &gt; 48 hours will be
      selected. Inclusion will be decided using an algorithm adapted to each center to limit the
      number of inclusion per month without any biases.

      The total number of required insclusion is 500, or 250 / group. This calculation is based on
      the assumption that a frequency of 25% of patients having at least one VAP in the reference
      strategy, ensuring a 80% power in the detection by Chi-2 test with a difference 10%. A
      bilateral risk of first species determined at 5% was considered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged ≥18 years

             by the oral route using tubes with catheter polyvinyl chloride &quot;high-volume low
             pressure&quot; and of standard shape tubes Intubation indication is decided by the
             physicians in charge according to the usual criteria of respiratory, neurological and
             /or hemodynamic failure

          -  With an expected duration of mechanical ventilation &gt; 48 hours

             balloon catheter of conical shape

          -  Previously intubated patients for &gt; 48 hours before their possible recruitment

          -  Moribund patients (terminal illness or care-limiting decision)
