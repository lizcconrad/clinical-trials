  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In refractive surgery, stromal ablation depth is fundamental because it determines the
      thickness of the residual posterior wall. The posterior wall is an essential element that
      guarantees the refractive stability and the long term prevention of corneal ectasia after
      corneal refractive surgery. A minimum thickness of more or less 300 microns is universally
      accepted. Its calculation is based on well-known formulas, such as Munnerlynn ones.

      With the excimer laser platform last generation WaveLight® Allegretto® EX-500 of Alcon, a new
      treatment option called &quot;wavefront optimized&quot; is offered for myopia, astigmatism and
      hyperopia. The ablation profile has been developed to save stromal tissue consumption and to
      favor the quality of vision, by optimizing connections between the optical zone and the
      transition zone of the photoablation. Alongside the theoretical formulas, evaluation of the
      depth of ablation may be defined by differential ultrasonic pachymetry or by topographical
      analysis pre and postoperatively. The latter is currently the method of reference to assess
      the corneal thickness.

    <description>Stromal tissue consumption will be estimated preoperatively by WaveLight Allegretto EX-500 laser and central corneal thickness will be measured by Pentacam. One month after refractive surgery, during follow-up,central corneal thickness will be again measured by Pentacam. The difference between the estimated and the measured tissue consumption will be calculated.</description>
