    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>AE: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency after the informed consent form is signed. AE includes serious as well as non-serious AEs. SAE (subset of AE): medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to the study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event. Any AE that increased in severity or newly developed at or after initial dosing of study drug to Week 28 was considered treatment-emergent.</description>

        <description>Z-score is a statistical measure to evaluate how a single data point compares to a standard. It describes whether a mean was above or below the standard. Weight, adjusted for age and sex, was analyzed as weight-for-age z-score (weight z-score).
