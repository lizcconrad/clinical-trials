    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to evaluate the combined efficacy of Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF)
      and 1% Alendronate (ALN) with open flap debridement (OFD) in treatment of intrabony defects
      in chronic periodontitis patients.

      Background: Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a second-generation platelet concentrate, act as
      reservoirs of growth factors and cytokines which are the key factors for regeneration of the
      bone and maturation of the soft tissue. Alendronate (ALN), a potent member of bisphosphonate
      group is known to promote tissue regeneration by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption and
      promoting osteoblastogenesis. The present study was designed to evaluate the combined
      efficacy of PRF and 1% ALN with open flap debridement (OFD) in treatment of intrabony defects
      in chronic periodontitis patients.

      Methods: Ninety patients with single defects were categorized into three groups: OFD alone,
      OFD with PRF,OFD with PRF+1% ALN. Clinical parameters; site specific plaque index (PI),
      modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL)
      and gingival marginal level (GML) were recorded at baseline before surgery and 9 months
      post-operatively. Percentage radiographic intra-bony defect depth reduction (IBD) was
      evaluated at baseline and 9 months.
