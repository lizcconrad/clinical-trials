  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current recommendations for the diagnosis of bacteremia based on the embodiment
      February-March blood cultures separated by a minimum interval of 30 minutes. Each blood
      culture comprises seeding a pair of aerobic and anaerobic vials inoculated each with 5 to 10
      ml of blood. The sensitivity and specificity of this technique depends essentially on the
      amount of blood removed since there is a direct relationship between the volume of blood
      inoculated into each flask and the efficiency of the technique. A preliminary study conducted
      at the University Hospital of Caen found that 14-30% of patients depending on the services
      had received only one blood culture. In addition, at least four blood cultures in 24 hours
      were taken for 10 to 20% of patients. The practice of a single blood culture reduces the
      sensitivity of the analysis due to insufficient total amount of blood collected. The practice
      of too many blood cultures increases the risk of false positive (presence of contaminating
      bacteria), generates extra work for healthcare personnel (and laboratory) and represents a
      significant cost for an unproven benefit.

      The investigators propose to evaluate a single blood culture sampling technique with seeding
      4 vials (2 aerobic and anaerobic 2).

      Blood cultures will be collected from patients admitted with on of the following signs: fever
      (≥38.5°C), hypothermia (≤36°C), chills or shock. For the first blood culture, 40 mL of blood
      will be obtained aseptically by a single phlebotomy and equally distributed into two
      BacT/Alert FA aerobic bottles and two BacT/Alert FN anaerobic bottles (bioMérieux,
      La-Balme-les-Grottes, France). The four bottles will be labelled from one to four in the
      following order: aerobic-anaerobic-aerobic-anaerobic. Within the next 24 h, one to three
      other 20-mL blood cultures consisting of a single pair of aerobic and anaerobic bottles will
      have to be performed, spaced by a minimum of 30 minutes. Bottles will be incubated for 5 days
      or until positivity reported by the BacT/Alert 3D instrument.
