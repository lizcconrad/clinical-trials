  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy has been used in clinical practice since 1938, a number of
      randomized trials found significant differences favoring ECT in response rates between
      individuals with depression receiving real and sham ECT. Results of early studies performed
      on patients with schizophrenia weren't so clear, only few of these trials found appreciable
      differences between real and sham ECT in clinical outcome. The recent, more reliable studies
      have found that ECT is efficacious on different symptoms which might be present in the course
      of schizophrenia, for example, psychotic and affective ones, as well as suicidality. The
      serious complications of electroconvulsive therapy are rare, however, more frequent side
      effects may include cognitive impairment and postictal delirium. Thus, the researchers try to
      develop new, more effective and less harmful procedures of ECT, like bifrontal electrodes.
      The available studies revealed that bifrontal ECT has equal efficacy to bitemporal ECT with
      less cognitive impairment, but the literature examining this placement is limited to major
      depressive disorder and the results are inconsistent. In the worldwide literature there is
      lack of studies regarding the use of bifrontal ECT among patients with schizophrenia. It is
      interesting how bifrontal ECT would affect axial symptoms of schizophrenia, since the
      electrodes in this procedure are placed over the brain areas responsible for negative
      symptoms. This randomized, double blind study is going to assess whether the bifrontal ECT is
      more effective in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, has less
      harmful impact on the cognitive functions and decrease the frequency and severity of
      postictal delirium comparing to the bitemporal ECT. Moreover, as the first worldwide will
      assess the brain dopaminergic activity with the use of PET in the patients with schizophrenia
      after ECT and the impact of the ECT on the concentration of such neurotrophins as
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor-BDNF, neuron specific enolase-NSE and protein S100B.
