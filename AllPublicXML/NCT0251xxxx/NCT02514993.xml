      -  Analysis of patient data and computed tomography scan of polytraumatized patients
           thoracic spine fractures

        -  A concomitant sternal fracture was identified an indicator for an unstable thoracic
           spine fracture

      Previous studies stated, that sternal fractures can be regarded as an indicator for thoracic
      spine fractures and described the combined injury pattern of thoracic spine fracture and
      sternal fracture as &quot;upper thoracic cage injury&quot;. But literature research is lacking data
      that in patients with a thoracic cage injury a highly unstable thoracic spine fracture can be
      expected.

      In a large cohort of 130 patients with a thoracic spine fracture and concomitant sternal
      fracture the investigators analyzed the injury pattern and evaluated associated injuries,
      trauma mechanism, and clinical outcome.

      The investigators could prove that in patients with a thoracic cage injury the concomitant
      sternal fracture may be regarded as an indicator for an unstable thoracic spine fracture,
      which requires surgical stabilization. Furthermore the analysis revealed that even a highly
      rotationally unstable type C fracture has to be expected, if sternal and thoracic spine
      fractures are located in the same segment.
