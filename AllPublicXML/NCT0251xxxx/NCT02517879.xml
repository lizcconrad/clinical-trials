  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All households in three zones in Zambia's Eastern Province were invited to attend a community
      point distribution of insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs). Households were then randomized to
      different intervals for a community health worker (CHW) hang-up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Households were asked to attend a community point distribution of ITNs in one of three zones
      in Zambia's Eastern Province. Households that had been registered to receive ITNs were then
      randomized to one of five groups that received a CHW visit at different intervals. Group 1
      was visited 1-3 days after distribution, group 2 was visited 5-7 days after, group 3 was
      visited 10-12 days after, group 4 was visited 15-17 days after, and group 5 did not receive a
      hang-up visit. Groups 1-4 were categorized as having received a hang-up visit and group 5 was
      categorized as not having received a hang-up visit. All households in all five groups were
      visited at 7-11 weeks after the distribution and again at 5-6 months after the distribution
      to assess short- and medium-term ITN retention and usage.

    <description>Households were invited to a central location in their community (i.e. school, church, etc) where they received their allotment of ITNs (one per sleeping space, as pre-registered ahead of study activities). Households were provided with malaria prevention messaging at the distribution. They were called up one-by-one in front of other members of the community to mitigate misrepresentation of households.</description>
