      The primary objective of this study is to compare the 1-year local control in patients with
      operable, recurrent previously-irradiated squamous cell head-and-neck cancers with or without
      adjuvant SBRT. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the locoregional
      progression-free survival (PFS) distant PFS, overall PFS (local + regional + distant), and
      overall survival (OS), to evaluate the acute and late toxicities of adjuvant SBRT in the
      re-irradiation setting following salvage surgery, to determine prognostic factors that may
      predict the likelihood of local failure, regional failure, or OS in this cohort to guide
      future management, to compare the impact of adjuvant SBRT versus a wait-and-see approach on
      patient reported quality of life (PR-QoL), and to compare surgical versus SBRT-induced
      immunological serum markers in relation to local control.

    <description>Subjects will receive Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy at the following levels: Treatment Volumes &lt;25cc will receive 40Gy (5 fractions of 8Gy per fraction) or treatment Volumes ≥25cc will receive 44-50Gy (5 fractions of 8.8-10Gy per fraction). Ideally all tumors volumes ≥25cc will receive 50Gy over 5 fractions, however at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist based on tumor bed volume, prior radiation dose, and proximity to critical organs the dose can be reduced to 44Gy over 5 fractions as outlined in prior SBRT protocols.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically proven recurrent or second-primary head-and-neck cancer receiving prior
             radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.

          -  Prior radiotherapy to a dose of ≥50Gy

          -  No evidence of distant metastases

          -  Macroscopic complete salvage surgery with curative intent (surgery was not performed
             only for biopsy or palliation). Final pathology and imaging must indicate a R0 or R1
             resection (no gross disease remaining).

          -  High-risk pathologic features must be present: compromised/positive surgical margins
             (≤ 2mm) or extra-nodal extension (patient with other high-risk features gross
             perinueral invasion, bone invasion, angiolyphatic invasion, or a constellation of
             these factors may be eligible based on case-by-case basis at discretion of principal
             investigator).

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60 (ECOG 0-2)

          -  Any number or type of prior chemotherapy is allowed (patient may receive concurrent or
             adjuvant systemic therapy such as cetuximab at the discretion of the treating
             oncologic team)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of distant metastases on any staging or imaging modality

          -  Women who are breast feeding, or have a positive pregnancy test (reproductive age
             should use effective birth control during study if randomized to SBRT treatment arm)

          -  Any patient with gross residual disease following salvage surgery

          -  Any co-morbidity or condition of sufficient severity to limit full compliance with the
             protocol per assessment by the principal investigator.
