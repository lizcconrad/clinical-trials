      Background:

      - Influenza is a common viral infection. But it can be deadly for some people. Researchers
      want to learn more about how the body fights this virus. They want to study this in people
      who have recently been infected with influenza. They hope this can help them create more
      effective influenza vaccines.

      Objective:

      - To learn about long-term changes in the body s immune system after influenza infection.

      Eligibility:

      - People who have completed a previous LID Clinical Studies Unit influenza challenge study
      and are willing to have samples stored for future research.

      Design:

        -  Eligible participants will be asked to visit the clinic every 3 months for 2 years.

        -  During each visit, participants will have blood drawn from an arm vein using a needle
           and a syringe.

        -  Participants will have a medical history and physical exam and vital signs performed.
           This will include blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, temperature, weight, and
           finger-measured blood oxygen. They will answer questions about any medicines taken and
           possible recent illnesses.

        -  If participants have symptoms of influenza, they may have a sample taken from the nose.
           A small &lt;TAB&gt;amount of salt water will be sprayed into the nostril with a squeezable
           container. The salt water will then run out of the nose and into the container. Or the
           inside of the nose will be wiped with a swab that is

      similar to a Q-tip.

      - Participants will complete a health questionnaire once a month on a secure website.
      Participants may also give their responses over the telephone.

    <textblock>
      Circulating anti-influenza antibodies are an important factor in predicting clinical illness
      and severity in those infected with influenza. Specific antibodies against influenza include
      proteins targeting hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Lifelong immunity does not
      occur with influenza, either from natural infection or from vaccination. Due to the antigenic
      variation of Influenza A, individuals may become infected multiple times with the same
      subtype of influenza and even with the same strain. In the setting of natural infection and
      vaccination, antibody titer levels can persist initially, but then wane over time.

      In our previous challenge studies, measurements of antibody responses have been focused
      solely on the acute infection period up to 2 months after initial infection. Long-term
      changes in immunity have not been investigated. The challenge setting gives us the unique
      ability to follow individuals from a specific, known and well-characterized exposure/illness
      to measure long-term changes in antibody titers from a pre-exposure baseline. This study
      could offer unique insight into how anti-influenza antibody titers change over time naturally
      and in response to other infections and life events. This type of controlled study has never
      been done and we believe monitoring titers long-term will help us better understand
      protective correlates of influenza.

      In this natural history study, we will follow individuals who have undergone influenza
      challenge or have been naturally infected with influenza to evaluate changes in
      anti-influenza antibody titers over a 2-year period. Subjects will be followed for symptoms
      of influenza-like illness (ILI) and other changes in clinical status through quarterly
      clinical evaluations with blood draws. Monthly questionnaires will be used to follow subjects
      in between visits.

        Participants will be recruited from previous LID influenza challenge studies and LID
        natural history studies.

    </study_pop>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Completion of participation in an LID Clinical Studies Unit influenza challenge
                  study or current or prior participation in an LID natural history study.

               2. Willing to have samples stored for future research.

        CO-ENROLLMENT GUIDELINES:

        Participants may be co-enrolled in other research studies. This will be addressed on a
        case-by-case basis with the approval of the principal investigator (PI) or associate
        investigator.

        If a participant enrolls in another influenza challenge study, the participant will be
        removed from this study. The participant can re-enroll in this study after completion of
        the influenza challenge study and will be followed for two years following completion of
        the most recent influenza challenge study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any condition or event that, in the PI s opinion, may substantially increase the risk
        associated with study participation or compromise the study s scientific objectives.
        Conditions that exclude a subject are considered to be unlikely, but an example would
        include a newly diagnosed medical condition that may alter a participant s immune system
        and make it unsafe to obtain scheduled blood samples for research purposes.
