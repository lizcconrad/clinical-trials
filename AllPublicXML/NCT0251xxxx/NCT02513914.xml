  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pseudotumor cerebri, also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), is characterized
      by elevated intracranial pressure, headache, and if severe, vision loss. IIH is difficult to
      treat. Medical management may not adequately resolve the symptoms, and surgical management
      (primarily through cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] shunting) has a high failure rate. Recently, a
      relationship between IIH and stenosis of the dural venous sinuses (the veins that drain blood
      from the brain) has been reported. In patients with IIH in whom there is stenosis of one or
      more dural venous sinuses, placing a stent in the venous sinus may improve patients'
      objective symptoms (such as visual loss and papilledema) and subjective symptoms (such as
      headache). This study will determine whether dural venous sinus stenting is as effective as
      CSF shunting (considered the standard surgical treatment) in treating IIH patients who have
      moderate vision loss and stenosis of the dural venous sinuses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening evaluation: Screening will include standard-of-care IIH evaluation including
      general medical and neurological examinations, blood chemistries, complete blood count,
      prothrombin time (PT),partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and pregnancy test. Ophthalmological
      evaluation will include visual acuity, pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD), and optical
      coherence tomography (OCT). Quality of life assessments are Headache Impact Test-6, Short
      Form Health Survey-36 and Visual Function Questionnaire-25 + Neuro-Ophthalmology supplement
      tests. Participants must have had a recent (within 6 months of enrollment) magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the brain as well as a diagnostic lumbar puncture (including opening
      pressure, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count, CSF glucose and CSF protein), both of which
      are also part of the standard of care for diagnosis of IIH.

      Eligible patients will undergo outpatient diagnostic venography within one month of initial
      IIH evaluation. Under local anesthesia, transfemoral venous access will be obtained and a
      guide catheter will be placed in the right jugular bulb. A microcatheter (Excelsior SL-10,
      Stryker Neurovascular) will then be advanced into the dural venous sinuses, and venography
      will be performed to determine the presence of any dural venous sinus stenosis. Then, blood
      pressure will be transduced through the microcatheter at the following anatomic locations:
      Anterior superior sagittal sinus, posterior superior sagittal sinus, bilateral transverse
      sinuses, bilateral sigmoid sinuses and bilateral jugular bulbs. The venous pressure gradient
      will be defined as the difference in pressure measurements between the anatomic locations
      proximal and distal to any stenotic venous sinus segment, or between the transverse and
      sigmoid sinuses. A pressure gradient of ≥ 8 mmHg is considered sufficient for subsequent
      randomization. In patients in which pressure gradient is &lt; 8 mmHg, the patient will not be
      randomized.

      Subsequent visits: Once a patient has met eligibility criteria and undergone randomization,
      treatment will occur within two weeks of the Neuro-Ophthalmology evaluations and within one
      month of diagnostic venography. Follow-up visits will occur at two weeks, six months and one
      year after the index procedure.

      At two-week follow-up (within one week on either side), patients will undergo neurological
      and ophthalmological evaluations, OCT, perimetry, and visual acuity testing for safety. While
      perimetry at this point will not be used for primary outcome analysis, substantial worsening
      in any of the above measures despite treatment will prompt consideration for treatment
      failure.

      At six-month follow-up, subjects will undergo perimetry for primary outcome analysis,
      outpatient diagnostic cerebral venography, and pressure measurements identical to that of the
      screening evaluation (including pressure measurements at all predefined anatomical locations)
      within four weeks on either side of the six-month target date. Patients will also complete
      follow-up quality of life questionnaires (HIT-6, SF-36 and VFQ-25 + Neuro-Ophthalmology
      supplement) The one-year follow-up will include queries regarding interim medical history,
      headache status, medication usage (specifically details and dose of those agents used to
      treat IIH or headache), and the number of IIH-related procedures each subject has undergone
      since the index procedure. Follow-up will occur within four weeks on either side of the
      one-year target date.

    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>PMD was chosen as a primary outcome due to its generalizability, test-retest reliability and standardization across centers, as well as its sensitivity to severity and progression of visual symptoms of IIH. Based on previous work by the Neuro-Ophthalmology Research Disease Investigator Consortium (NORDIC) investigators, we defined the upper and lower bounds of visual field loss severity for study inclusion as between -8 and -30 dB in the worst-affected eye. The upper limit of -8 dB ensures enough baseline visual loss to consider surgical treatment and allow room for improvement, while the lower limit of -30 dB ensures that patients with severe visual loss unlikely to significantly improve with any treatment would be excluded. PMD will be tested using Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) standard 24-2 perimetry with stimulus size III.</description>

    <description>Pt. will undergo pre-treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel. Transfemoral venous access will be obtained (pt. heparinized).Guide catheter will be placed in jugular bulb ipsilateral to dural venous sinus stenosis. Stent will be deployed across stenotic segment. Balloon angioplasty will not be performed unless initial stenosis is not easily traversed with stent. No pressure measurements will be taken during stent placement. Patients will undergo serial physical/neuro exams for 24 hours post-procedure. Daily dual anti-platelet treatment will continue for 6 months after initial procedure, after which clopidogrel will be discontinued and aspirin 81mg daily will be prescribed indefinitely. If significant bilateral venous sinus stenosis is present, stenosis with more severe pressure gradient will be stented. In pt. with bilateral venous sinus stenosis with equivalent pressure gradients, side will be at surgeon's discretion.</description>
