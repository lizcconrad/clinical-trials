  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has opened new potential avenues for the treatment of
      neuropsychiatric diseases via the effects of modulation on neuroplasticity. Repetitive TMS
      (rTMS) is a non-invasive method of stimulation neural pathways in the brain of conscious
      subjects through the intact scalp. The investigators hypothesize that excitatory rTMS applied
      over the motor cortex would increase motor cortex activity and result in an increase in the
      inhibitory input through the corticospinal tract to the spinal cord, thus reducing alpha
      neuron hyperactivity and consequently clinical spasticity. In this study, the investigators
      will apply the stimulation on the legs motor cortex area, which can cover supplemental motor
      area (SMA). Therefore, not only the spasticity, but also the motor control of legs both can
      be modulated by stimulation. Theta burst stimulation is a condition of rTMS which was
      designed by the co-investigator. It has controllable, consistent, long-lasting, and powerful
      effects on motor cortex physiology and behavior. The investigators therefore design this
      protocol using theta burst stimulation on the motor cortex of the patients of cerebral palsy.
      The investigators expect that there would be an effect on the reduction of spasticity after
      rTMS on the brain of children with CP, thus improving the motor control of legs.

      In this study, the investigators design 3 steps to find out the optimal condition of rTMS for
      the treatment and managing of motor disability of CP. The first is to find out the optimal
      intensity of rTMS. The second is to find out the optimal duration of rTMS and long term
      effects. The third is to compare the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection, rTMS, and
      combined therapy (botulinum toxin injection and rTMS) for children with CP.
