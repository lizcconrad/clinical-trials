    <textblock>
      Every year, nearly 30% of people aged over 65 fall at least once and about 15% fall at least
      twice. These falls can have serious consequences that are a significant threat to the
      independence and well-being of older people. From an economic perspective, the cost of
      medical care related to falls and resulting injuries is very high and continue to grow with
      the aging of the population. Therefore falls prevention is a public health priority.

      Many data suggest that cognitive, common disorders in the elderly, is a major risk factor for
      falls and the elderly often have difficulty managing their parallel postural stability and
      other situations requiring attentional resources. Furthermore, the data used to evoke a role
      of vitamin D in the risk of falls in the elderly. Indeed, vitamin D has beneficial effects on
      muscle and on the human brain and several recent studies have shown the existence of positive
      relationship between serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D and cognitive function. These different
      actions may explain the beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of falling
      for practicing daily oral doses of vitamin D in the range of 700-1000 IU.

      Our goal in this study is to confirm the existence of a link between vitamin D status and
      some areas of cognitive functions, and analyze the roles played by vitamin D deficiency and
      cognitive impairment in the occurrence of falls. The study will also seek the existence of a
      threshold level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D below which may arise cognitive disorders. The
      prospective follow-up of patients for 2 years will study the effect of correcting the vitamin
      D deficiency (initial correction and regular supplementation) on cognitive function, balance,
      walking and the occurrence of falls.

      The study will be conducted in 150 subjects aged 50 years and over and fell in 150 subjects
      aged 50 and over at risk of falling. These patients will be enrolled in the Emergency
      Services, Orthopedics, Geriatrics, and Rheumatology of the University Hospital of Caen. All
      subjects will receive a dose of 25 hydroxyvitamin D, a comprehensive study of cognitive
      function, tests of balance and walking and assessment of activities of daily living and
      depression. All the examinations and tests will be carried out during the same half day.
      According to current recommendations, it will be prescribed a treatment with Vitamin D to
      subjects with a lowered rate of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (&lt;30 ng / ml) to normalize the rate and
      will be advised doctors to prescribe regular supplementation vitamin D in order to maintain
      it in the standard rate (30 to 80 ng / ml). The effect of the correction of hypovitaminosis
      D, confirmed by controlling the rate of 25 hydroxyvitamin D, on cognitive functions, balance
      and walking will be analyzed 3 months and 9 months. During the two years following their
      inclusion in the study, subjects will be contacted by a phone call every 3 months during
      which will be recorded any falls they have been victims, as well as changes to their drug
      treatments, particularly case of regular intake of vitamin D supplementation.

      If our hypothesis were true, it would be appropriate to consider a new approach to prevention
      of fractures involving the correction of vitamin D deficiency, cognitive rehabilitation and
      cognitive-motor drive in subjects with cognitive impairment.
