      1.Research purpose: Degree of continuous intravenous pumping Endostar (human recombinant
      endostatin) combination chemotherapy regimens including cisplatin two medicine first-line
      treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (with the exception of EGFR/ALK mutations)
      efficacy and safety.

      2.1 main objectives: PFS 2.2 the secondary goal: 2.2. 1 ORR, DCR and OS 2.2. 2 the quality of
      life 3. The study design 3.1 research nature This is a single arm, multicenter clinical
      study, is expected to total 100 patients into the group.

      Hierarchical factors include: the tumor staging (Ⅲ B vs Ⅳ), ECOG score (0 v 1), gender (male
      vs female).

      3.2 research center and research Proposed by taizhou people's hospital and medical
      association of jiangsu province tumor chemotherapy and biological branch of the lung cancer
      group led by several large and medium-sized hospitals in the province of the malignant tumor
      treatment related department to participate, in accordance with the unified test plan of this
      research.
