  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the study is to support HIV-infected pregnant women initiated on PMTCT
      Option B+ during antenatal to adhere to lifelong ART and postpartum care visits through an
      enhanced group peer support intervention called &quot;friends for life circles&quot;.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this implementation research is to improve retention in care and
      adherence to ART to 2 years postpartum among HIV infected women in urban and rural Uganda
      choosing PMTCT Option B+. Formative research will first be conducted to assess knowledge and
      attitudes regarding Option B+ and lifelong ART among PMTCT clients, community members and
      health workers. The formative research will inform the design of the group peer support
      intervention. Interventional research will then be conducted randomizing 540 women to either
      enhanced group peer support with income generating activities called the Friends for Life
      Circle (FLC) or MOH standard of care counselling with follow-up to 2 years postpartum.
      Primary outcomes will include retention in health care, ARV adherence and viral suppression
      at 6 weeks and 24 months postpartum. Secondary outcomes will include participants' health and
      economic outcomes.
