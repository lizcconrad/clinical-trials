  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have reported that alcoholic beverage consumption, especially in the form of
      wine, reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 40%. This association
      suggests that wine consumption may somehow improve the body's ability to control its blood
      glucose concentration. Indeed, it has been reported that when wine is consumed immediately
      prior to ingestion of glucose, the release of insulin is enhanced and blood glucose
      concentration is lowered. The mechanism of wine's effects on blood glucose concentration is
      unknown, but is likely related to its ethanol or antioxidant content. In this study, the
      investigators plan to test whether wine or plain ethanol (vodka) ingestion alters the control
      of blood glucose in subjects who have diabetes or pre-diabetes.

      Our central hypothesis is that improvement in glycemic control by acute consumption of wine
      is mediated by ethanol. Subjects will have type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, and be sedentary
      and obese (BMI &gt;30). Subjects' glycemic control will be assessed by an oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT) at three different time points. One OGTT will occur shortly after consumption of
      red wine, the second after consumption of vodka containing the identical amount of ethanol as
      the wine treatment, and the third OGTT will occur shortly after consumption of an equal
      volume of water. The three OGTTs will be administered in random order.
