  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol's solubility is achieved by adding to the excipient sodium salts, either as
      bicarbonate, carbonate or citrate. As the relationship between salt and hypertension is well
      known, due to the sodium content it has raised a hypothesis that may interfere with the
      control of that risk factor.

      Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on blood pressure of
      effervescent paracetamol compared to non-effervescent, in hypertensive patients.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, crossover, open, phase IV clinical trial,
      which compares the effect of two different formulations of paracetamol (effervescent or
      non-effervescent tablets) in the blood pressure of hypertensive patients after 3 weeks
      treatment (coded EUDRACT 2010-023485-53). The washing time between the two periods is
      approximately 1 week (minimum 3 days)

      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients included in the study must meet the following criteria:

        -  be hypertensive patients over 18 years

        -  with degenerative joint disease

        -  which regularly need analgesic treatment. They must submit BP in the consultation lower
           than 150 and 95 mmHg or lower than 135 and 85 mmHg if they have associated
           cardiovascular disease (stroke, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease) or
           diabetes mellitus.

      They can't receive pharmacological antihypertensive treatment, or this must be stable and
      unchanged in the last month.

      In relation to osteoarticular disease, they should have a degree of mild to moderate pain,
      with a score between 1 and 4 on a visual analog scale (VAS)

      Evaluation of results

      Primary endpoint:

      The primary endpoint is the change in mean daytime, night-time (sleep) and 24-hour systolic
      BP, measured by ABPM, from baseline at 3 weeks of treatment in both periods.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Changes in systolic BP measured in the clinic at the end of 3-week follow-up respect
           baseline in both periods.

        -  24-hour, daytime and night-time (sleep) diastolic BP measured by ABPM: change from
           baseline at 3 weeks of treatment in both periods

        -  Changes in diastolic BP measured in the clinic at the end of 3-week follow-up respect
           baseline in both periods.

        -  Percentage of patients maintaining clinical BP under 140 and 90 mmHg at the end of each
           period

        -  Degree of pain assessed by visual analog scale

        -  Consumption of rescue medication

        -  Therapeutic compliance
