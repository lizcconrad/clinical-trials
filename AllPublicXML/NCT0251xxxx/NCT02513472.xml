    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of eribulin mesylate in
      combination with pembrolizumab in participants with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer
      (mTNBC) previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy (cytotoxic or
      targeted anticancer agents) in the metastatic setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1b part will evaluate the safety and tolerability of eribulin mesylate in
      combination with pembrolizumab. Approximately 6 participants may be enrolled in the Phase 1b
      part of the study. The Phase 2 part will evaluate the tumor objective responses when treated
      with eribulin mesylate in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with mTNBC
      previously treated with 0 to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy (cytotoxic or targeted
      anticancer agents) in the metastatic setting. Approximately 106 mTNBC participants (including
      participants in Phase 1b who are on RP2D level) will be enrolled in Phase 2.

             hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal
             contraceptive product for at least 28 days before dosing and must continue to use the
             same contraceptive during the study and for 120 days after study drug discontinuation.

         14. Males who have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and their
             female partners meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential or
             practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period or for 120 days
             after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the study
             period or for 120 days after study drug discontinuation.
