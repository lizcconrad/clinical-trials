  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this protocol is to evaluate the safety and utility of diagnostic
      MRI in Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) beneficiaries with pacemakers and
      Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) and clinical need for MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A referring physician will request an outpatient MRI in an implanted device patient through
      an order placed in the electronic ordering system, over the telephone to the MRI scheduling
      office, or by directly contacting a radiologist or MRI technologist. Upon receiving such a
      request, the referring physician will be sent a copy of the attached screening form, which is
      used for all implanted device patients. The form includes instructions for obtaining approval
      for the study and space for documenting ordering physician, study indication, and information
      about the patient's implanted device (if their device is not followed by a UPHS physician).
      For CMS beneficiaries, an addition to the form will discuss the clinical trial and ask the
      referring physician how the results of the MRI will change patient treatment or prognosis and
      what would be done were an MRI not available. The approval of an attending radiologist in the
      radiology section that will be interpreting the study (e.g. neuroradiology for brain MRI,
      cardiovascular imaging for cardiac MRI) is required.

      Once the patient is deemed eligible and consented, the study staff will enter the patient
      into the registry as well as register them onto the trial through PennChart.

    <description>The primary measure of this study is physician decision making. Referring physicians will be asked about the effect of the MRI clinical management strategy, planning of treatments and interventions, as well as if/how the MRI results prevented other diagnostic studies or interventions, and other exposures (such as to ionizing radiation or iodinated contrast from CT scans). Analysis will be tabulation of how scan would change treatment or prognosis and what would be done if MR not available (based upon referring physician response on the screening form, physician and how the physicians believe that having the MRI will impact the treatment and quality of life by completing the QOL form.</description>
