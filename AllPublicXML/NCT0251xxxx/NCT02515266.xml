    <textblock>
      Postnatal growth is a crucial in premature infants as it could be correlated with the
      long-term cognitive development. Optimal nutritional care is required to reduce the initial
      weight loss and further growth deficit.

      The quantitative objective is to achieve growth that is at least equivalent to that of the
      fetus (on average 15 g/kg.day (12-18 g/kg.day according to gestational age). Children often
      grow during difficult 10-15 first days of life, so they accumulate a delay that should
      compensate them secondarily. Therefore, optimum postnatal growth is rather 20 g/kg.day than
      15 g/kg.day.

      Individualized fortification of human milk (HM) has been proposed to optimize postnatal
      growth. Specifically, the lack of protein intake is responsible for sub-optimal postnatal
      growth in preterm infants.

      The objectives of this study are to determine the effectiveness of additional protein
      fortification (APF) in terms of short-term growth along with the proportion of extremely low
      birth weight (ELBW) infants requiring APF.

      In a retrospective, single-center study, premature infants weighing &lt;1250 g at birth
      hospitalized in investigators' neonatal intensive care unit in 2012, who were exclusively fed
      with fortified HM and received APF for &gt;12 consecutive days were included.

      Weight gain (g/kg•d) over the previous 7 days was calculated daily based on weight data in
      patients' electronic medical records. When weight gain was considered insufficient (i.e.,
      below 20 g/kg•d) and the serum urea level was &lt;3 mmol/L, 1 g/kg•d protein was added. Before
      using the mixture, investigators verified that the osmolality was only slightly increased
      (from 412 to 422 mOsm/kg).

      Growth and digestive tolerance were compared between the week before (Wk0) and 1 and 2 weeks
      after (Wk1 and Wk2, respectively) the introduction of protein supplement; each participant
      served as his own control. Change from baseline for body weight was the main outcome. Energy
      and protein intake during Wk0, Wk1, and Wk2 were calculated. Standard deviation z-scores for
      growth parameters were calculated 7 days before, at time of protein introduction, and 7 and
      14 days after . Changes in Z-scores were calculated. The digestive tolerance score and
      metabolic tolerance (serum urea) were assessed during Wk0, Wk1, and Wk2 (5).
