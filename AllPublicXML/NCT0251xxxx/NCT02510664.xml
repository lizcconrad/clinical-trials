  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a newly developed intervention is feasible
      and acceptable to adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their families and diabetes care
      providers, and to evaluate trends in whether the intervention impacts important diabetes
      outcomes. The intervention involves diabetes care providers discussing and reinforcing
      individuals' and families' diabetes management strengths during routine, outpatient diabetes
      care appointments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a newly developed strengths-based clinical
      intervention delivered by diabetes care providers in the context of routine ambulatory
      diabetes care, designed to promote resilience and support diabetes management among
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their families. The emphasis of the intervention is
      shifting the tone of clinical encounters for diabetes care to emphasize and reinforce youths'
      and families' current diabetes strengths and positive diabetes management behaviors. Youth
      with type 1 diabetes are seen routinely in clinic every 3-4 months, and this intervention
      will occur at two consecutive clinic visits. The intervention consists of (A) assessing youth
      and family diabetes strengths and adherence prior to each visit, and (B) training diabetes
      care providers to tailor their clinical encounters around reinforcing each patient and
      family's unique &quot;diabetes strengths profile&quot; generated from the strengths and adherence
      assessments.

      Outcome assessments are conducted at baseline (prior to the start of the intervention) and
      immediately following the conclusion of the intervention (approximately 6-8 months later).
      The primary outcome is feasibility and acceptability, measured by qualitative feedback from
      participants and providers, as well as quantification of recruitment and enrollment, provider
      adherence to intervention protocol, and time to completion. Secondary (exploratory) outcomes
      include diabetes regimen adherence, glycemic control, family conflict, diabetes burden,
      diabetes strengths, and satisfaction with the diabetes care provider relationship. Strengths
      and adherence assessments are also completed prior to the second clinic visit to generate the
      diabetes strengths profile.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-4 months (second study visit), and 6-8 months after intervention begins (immediately following second study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will rate adolescents' adherence to the diabetes regimen using the 24-item Diabetes Self-Management Profile Self-Report (DSMP-SR). The version appropriate to the adolescents' current diabetes regimen (conventional or intensive insulin regimen) will be administered. Adolescents will also complete the youth-report version of the DSMP-SR at baseline and follow-up to assess their perceptions of adherence.
Objective measurement of adherence will occur through blood glucose monitoring frequency (a well-accepted surrogate of overall adherence), obtained via blood glucose meter downloads. The average daily frequency will be calculated over the 14 days prior to the assessment.</description>

    <description>Burden will be assessed via the Problem Areas in Diabetes measures for adolescents (PAID-T) and parents (PAID-PR). The PAID-T has 26 items and the PAID-PR has 18 items, and both demonstrate good psychometric properties.</description>

    <measure>Healthcare Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-8 months after intervention begins (immediately following second study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess healthcare satisfaction, parents will complete three subscales of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Healthcare Satisfaction Generic Module (PedsQL-HS), assessing their satisfaction with communication, inclusion of family, and how well the patient's emotional needs are addressed during the clinical encounter (13 items). Adolescents will rate their overall satisfaction with the patient-provider relationship on a 1-10 scale single item developed for this study, as there is no validated youth-report measure of satisfaction with care.</description>
