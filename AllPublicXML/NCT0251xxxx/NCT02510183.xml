  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative acupressure application on Postoperative
      nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of
      being in high risk group for PONV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of postoperative complications is one of the main tasks of nurses. However, there
      are limited nursing interventions that can be done to prevent PONV. The American Society of
      PeriAnesthesia Nurses suggest nurses to teach patients with a high risk of PONV about
      acupressure application on P6 acupoint or to apply acupressure wristbands preoperatively.
      However this suggestion has a low evidence.

    <description>Postoperative nausea, vomiting and medication need are assessed on 2nd, 6th and 24th hours postoperative. Nausea severity measured by 0-10 scoring (0- no nausea,10- nausea as bad as can be), and vomiting is assessed as episodes. Number of antiemetics and analgesics medications that are given (out of routine therapy) are also evaluated.</description>
