  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A measurable degree of heart muscle tissue injury is expected in patients undergoing heart
      valvular surgery. The level of this injury can be measured by cardiac biomarkers in blood
      samples. Those biomarkers are used to diagnose an acute myocardial infarction.

      Postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) is a frequent and important complication after
      cardiac surgery with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore it is very important to
      recognize any cardiac event in patients who undergo cardiac surgery. Different diagnostic
      tools can be used to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction; however few is known about
      the value of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTn) to diagnose a MI after heart
      valvular surgery.

      The aim of this study is to determine the upper reference limit of high-sensitivity troponin
      T concentration to consider the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients
      undergoing heart valvular surgery.

      This is a longitudinal prospective observational cohort mono centre study. Hs-cTn will be
      measured at different point of times in adult patients undergoing heart valvular surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and without recent medical history of ischemic heart disease.

      The study is conducted at the University Clinical Hospital of Valladolid, Spain. The Cardiac
      Surgery department annually performs approximately 550 cardiac surgeries with CPB in adult
      patients (approximately 300 heart valvular surgeries). Two operating rooms are routinely
      used. There is an intensive care unit (ICU) with 10 beds dedicated exclusively to the
      postoperative care of patients who undergo cardiac surgery.The hospital's research commission
      approved the study. All patients, preoperatively, provided informed written consent both for
      their heart surgery and for their participation in the study.

      Serum levels of hs-cTn will be measured before cardiac surgery, upon arrival at the ICU, as
      well as every 6 hours for 24 hours, then every 8 hours the following 24 hours and a last
      blood sample will be taken 72 hours after cardiac surgery. Samples are analysed at the
      department of Clinical Biochemistry of our hospital.

      Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained the day prior to heart valvular surgery,
      immediately upon arrival at the ICU, and then 24, 48 and 72 hours post-surgery will be
      reviewed by a cardiologist to evidence signs of myocardial infarction (MI). All cardiac
      events will be noted as The Third Global MI Task Force definition of MI describes.

      A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) will be also performed by a cardiologist after cardiac
      valvular surgery to determine the ejection fraction of left ventricle and the occurrence of a
      new regional wall motion abnormality. This TTE will be compared, by the same cardiologist,
      with a TTE performed before cardiac valvular surgery.

      The principal investigator will supervise data handling.

    <description>Postoperative MI remains a frequent complication after cardiac surgery with high morbidity and mortality. In 2012 the Third Global MI Task Force presented the third universal definition of MI implying that MI associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarkers values over 10 x 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values. In addition with either: a) new pathological Q waves or new left bundle branch block (LBBB), or b) angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or c) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Few is known about the established threshold values for hs-cTn after heart valvular surgery.</description>
