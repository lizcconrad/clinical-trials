  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how patients with Tourette Syndrome deal
      with sensory stimuli in their environment such as bright lights, loud noises, physical
      sensations such as shirt tags, etcetera. We will compare responses of patients with Tourette
      Syndrome to those without Tourette Syndrome.

      The study aims to better characterize sensory processing abnormalities by sensory modality:
      The investigators will use a measuring tool based on Dunn's 1997 model of sensory processing,
      the Sensory Profile, which will allow the investigator to characterize both registration and
      response to external stimuli, as well as to delineate which sensory modalities are affected.
      Identifying which sensory modalities are most affected may guide future research into the
      pathophysiology of sensory processing abnormalities in TS.

      The investigators also aim to correlate sensory processing abnormalities with the presence of
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , and
      autism spectrum disorders.

      While it is widely recognized that patients with tic and Tourette Syndrome (TS) experience
      heightened sensitivity to or abnormal processing of internal sensations, it has also been
      suggested that patients with tic and TS experience abnormal processing of external
      sensations/stimuli. While this sensitivity to external stimuli does not appear to trigger
      motor or vocal tics, it can significantly affect quality of life. These sensitivities can be
      a source of irritation, discomfort, and distraction that can be equally or more disruptive
      than vocal or motor tics. Heightened sensitivity to external stimuli or other abnormalities
      of external sensory processing have been identified in other neuropsychological disorders
      such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, ADHD, and
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) . TS often presents with co-morbid diagnoses including
      attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
      but it is not currently known whether sensitivity to external stimuli is due to a central
      processing abnormality common to these disorders.

      This study's objective is to use a variety of questionnaires to determine how external
      stimuli along with the presence of other disorders effect sensory processing.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>60 item questionnaire administered to participants age 6-10 with questions pertaining to sensory processing categories of Taste/Smell, Movement, Visual, Touch, Activity Level, and Auditory. Scores are tallied for each category. Results are plotted along an x and y-axis with one axis being perception or stimulus (low registration to sensory sensitivity) and the other being response to stimulus (sensation seeking to sensation avoiding). Each category is plotted along this axis and compared to normative data which is included in this tool.</description>

Scores are tallied for each category. Results are plotted along an x and y-axis with one axis being perception or stimulus (low registration to sensory sensitivity) and the other being response to stimulus (sensation seeking to sensation avoiding).

    <description>Clinician administered questionnaire given to all participants. Part 1 asks about 10 types of motor tics, 12 types of vocal tics (current, ever, age of onset, description). Part 2 is a severity rating that scores both motor and vocal tics on a 0-5 scale for each severity item: number of tics, intensity, frequency, complexity, interference, impairment.
