  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this Phase I study is to test MSB0011359C (M7824) at different dose
      levels to see if it is safe and well tolerated when given once every 2 weeks. Phase I means
      the study drug has not previously been given to humans or has only been given to a limited
      number of people, although it has been extensively studied in animals. Based on this
      information, it is hoped to find out which dose could be best for the treatment of patients.
      There are two parts of this research study: a dose-escalation part and an expansion part.
      Dose escalation means that the first people taking part in the study will receive low doses
      of the study drug, and as more people take part, the additional participants will receive a
      higher dose. This is done to find the safest dose for the study drug. Expansion means that
      after the dose-escalation part of the study has looked at the safety and effectiveness of
      different doses, many more people will be invited to take part in the study and will receive
      the study drug at the safest dose. Additional purposes of the study are to find out whether
      the study drug has anti-cancer effects and how the study drug is processed by the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial with consecutive parallel-group
      expansion in selected solid tumor indications. The current trial is composed of a standard
      dose escalation &quot;3 + 3&quot; cohort design, for which 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled at each
      dose level depending on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), followed by a
      consecutive parallel-group expansion in selected solid tumor indications. Cohorts of 3
      subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors, for which no standard effective
      therapy exists or standard therapy has failed, will receive MSB0011359C (M7824) at escalating
      dose levels. After determination of the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), enrollment in several
      expansion cohorts will be opened to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) /
      Pharmacodynamic, and clinical activity of MSB0011359C (M7824). Subjects who have experienced
      a confirmed complete response (CR) should continue treatment through the end of 12 months,
      although additional treatment is possible. In the case of progressive disease (PD), subjects
      should continue treatment through their next tumor assessment. Additional indications will be
      planned based on emerging data in the field.

    <time_frame>Up to 10 weeks after last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs (SAEs and non-SAEs) will be considered TEAEs when emerging on treatment period defined as the time from the first trial drug administration up to 10 weeks after the last drug administration date.</description>

    <description>Treatment related AEs are any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who received study drug with causal relationship with the investigational product as assessed by the investigator. AEs will be assessed according to severity; mild (not causing any significant problem, dose adjustment not required), moderate (caused problem that does not interfere significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, dose adjustment needed due to adverse event) and severe (caused problem that interferes significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, study drug stopped due to adverse event).</description>

    <description>BOR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 and as adjudicated by the Independent Endpoint Review Committee (IRC).The BOR per IRC adjudication will be determined according to RECIST 1.1 and modified immune related response criteria (irRC), respectively. BOR is defined as sum of complete response and partial response (CR+PR). For target lesions (TLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs; PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of largest diameter (SLD) of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline SLD. Overall immune-related complete response: Complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not) and no new lesions. All measurable lymph nodes also must have a reduction in short axis to 10 mm or less. Overall immune-related partial response (irPR): Sum of the longest diameters of target and new measurable lesions decreases &gt;= 30 percent (%).</description>
