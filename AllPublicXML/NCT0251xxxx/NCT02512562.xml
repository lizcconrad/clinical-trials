        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has provided written consent.

          2. In the investigator's opinion, the subject is able to understand and comply with
             protocol requirements, instructions, and protocol-stated restrictions and is likely to
             complete the study as planned.

          3. Subject is in good health as deemed by the investigator, based on the findings of a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and ECG.

          4. Male or female, 18-60 years of age.

          5. Body mass index (BMI) 18-32 kg/m2, inclusive. The minimum weight is 50 kg. No more
             than 25% of subjects may be enrolled with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.

          6. A female subject is eligible to participate in this study if she is of
             non-childbearing potential (defined as females with a documented tubal ligation,
             bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the
             laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females)). A post-menopausal female
             receiving hormone replacement therapy who is willing to discontinue hormone therapy 28
             days before study drug dosing and agrees to remain off hormone replacement therapy for
             the duration of the study may be eligible for study participation.

          7. If male, subject is surgically sterile or practicing specific forms of birth control
             until 6 months after the end of the study. Males must agree to refrain from sperm
             donation from check-in through 6 months after dosing.

          8. Willing to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking SMV and through follow-up.
             Subjects should also be advised to use a broad spectrum sun screen and lip balm of at
             least sun protection factor (SPF) &gt; 30 to help protect against potential sunburn.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) females, confirmed by a positive HCG laboratory test
             or females contemplating pregnancy. Men whose female partners are pregnant or
             contemplating pregnancy from the date of screening until 6 months after their last
             dose of study drugs.

          2. Clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal,
             hematologic, neurologic, thyroid or any other medical illness or psychiatric disorder,
             as determined by the Investigator and/or Sponsor's Medical Monitor.

          3. Positive screening test for hepatitis B, C or HIV serology. Subjects previously
             infected with HCV and achieved a sustained virologic response with treatment (no
             detectable HCV RNA 6 months post treatment) are eligible.

          4. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the study's
             objectives or the well-being of the subject or prevent the subject from meeting the
             study requirements.

          5. Participation in an investigational drug trial or having received an investigational
             vaccine within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to study
             medication.

          6. Clinically significant abnormal ECG findings. Particularly, a history or family
             history of prolonged QT syndrome (e.g., torsade de pointes) or sudden cardiac death.

          7. ECG with PR &gt; 200 ms, QRS &gt; 120 ms, QTcF &gt; 450 ms, as assessed by centrally read 12
             lead ECG at the screening visit.

          8. Clinically significant blood loss or elective blood donation of significant volume
             (i.e., &gt; 500 mL) within 60 days of first dose of study drug; &gt; 1 unit of plasma within
             7 days of first dose of study drug.

          9. Abnormal heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature or blood pressure values outside of
             the normal range (evaluated in a semi-recumbent or recumbent position after 5 minutes
             of rest). One repeat measurement after an additional 5 minutes of rest is permitted.

         10. Evidence of active infection.

         11. Unwilling to abstain from alcohol for at least 1 week prior to the start of dosing
             through the study completion visit.

         12. History of regular alcohol intake &gt; 7 units per week of alcohol for females and &gt; 14
             units per week for males (one unit is defined as 10 g alcohol) within 3 months of the
             screening visit.

         13. History of tobacco use or used nicotine-containing products within 3 months of the
             screening visit.

         14. The subject has a positive pre-study drug screen.

         15. The use of concomitant medications, including prescription, over the counter
             medications, herbal medications, inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes or drug
             transporters (including P-gp) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication is excluded, unless approved by the Sponsor's Medical Monitor. Occasional
             use of acetaminophen is permitted.

         16. Exposure to more than four new investigational entities within 12 months prior to the
             first dosing day.

         17. Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients of AL-335,
             ACH-3102 or SMV.

         18. Subjects of East Asian ancestry.

         19. Abnormal biochemistry or hematology laboratory results obtained at screening. Elevated
             bilirubin in subjects with suspected Gilbert's disease is allowed.

         20. Unwillingness or inability to comply with the study protocol for any other reason.
