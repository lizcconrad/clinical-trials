      Investigators are carrying out a study to assess the immediate and long-term effects of a
      positive youth development program (the Teen Outreach Program) on high school youth in
      Florida. This study will answer the following questions: What is the impact of the Teen
      Outreach Program on sexual activity and positive youth development at the end of the program
      and 10 months after the program?

      Schools were randomly allocated to either the intervention or the control group. At treatment
      (intervention) schools, youth participated in TOP in addition to their Health, HOPE, Critical
      Thinking, Career Research, or Leadership class. At control (non-intervention) schools, youth
      simply participated in their business-as-usual Health, HOPE, Critical Thinking, Career
      Research, or Leadership class. Two cohorts of students were recruited for this study, the
      first cohort joined the study in August 2012 and the second cohort joined the study in August
      2013. A survey was given to youth at both treatment and control schools. The paper-and-pencil
      survey took approximately 30 minutes and asked questions about youth school, grades, peers,
      health behaviors, and behaviors related to teen pregnancy, including what the participant
      believes and does in regards to sexual health. The survey was completely confidential and
      participant names were not linked to survey responses. All survey materials were pre-approved
      by school administration and the school district office. Participants will be asked to
      complete the a survey at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 10-months post-intervention
      (Cohort 1 only)

    <description>The Teen Outreach Program (TOP) is a positive youth development program that uses weekly educational peer group sessions, Community Service Learning (CSL), and positive adult guidance to help youth in grades 6-12 build healthy behaviors, life skills, and a sense of purpose. For this study, TOP was implemented in traditional public high schools in Florida and delivered by local health department staff, who were trained and certified as TOP facilitators. Youth enrolled in these classes received the TOP intervention in addition to, not as a replacement for, all business-as-usual curriculum content.</description>
