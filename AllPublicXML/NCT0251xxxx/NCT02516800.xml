  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mutations in the SLC34A2 gene, that encodes the sodium phosphate co-transporter (NaPi-IIb),
      cause defect cell-uptake of phosphate, which leads to formation of calcium-phosphate
      concretions in the lungs as seen in Pulmonary Alveolar Microlithiasis (PAM). Extra pulmonary
      calcifications, including heart valve calcification, have previously been reported in
      patients with PAM.

      Calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD) is a common disease in the elderly and is characterised
      by thickening and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets in the absence of rheumatic
      heart disease. CAVD is present in more than 25% of patients older than age 65 years and is
      associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Currently, there is no effective
      therapy for the disease other than surgical aortic valve replacement. Both calcium and
      phosphate are the major components of calcific deposits in PAM and CAVD. Based on these
      preliminary findings, the investigators hypothesize that mutations in sodium phosphate
      co-transporters may play a role in both pulmonary and extra pulmonary calcifications.

      Two studies will be performed: 1. A retrospective cross-sectional study including patients
      with an age ≤ 65 years with CAVD from Denmark and Örebro, will be carried out. Genetic
      association analysis will be performed to investigate the incidence of common variants in
      five genes representing sodium phosphate co-transporters (SLC34A1, SLC34A2, SLC34A3, SLC20A1,
      SLC20A2) compared to healthy controls. Associated genes will subsequently be sequenced to
      identify possible causal mutations. 2. In a prospective study, aortic valve tissue will be
      collected from patients with AS undergoing surgical valve replacement. Molecular
      characterisation of the transporters will be conducted by determining the level of specific
      mRNA and protein by RT-PCR/qPCR, and Western Blotting, respectively. The localisation and
      visualisation will be investigated by immunostaining and confocal laser microscopy.
      Fibroblasts and endothelial cells will be isolated and grown in cultures with subsequent
      functional studies of the phosphate uptake.
