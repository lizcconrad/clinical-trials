    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a method of bone marrow transplantation that results in
      only temporary donor immune function. In other words, the donor immune cells are given in a
      way that will allow them to attack leukemia briefly before being destroyed by their own
      immune system, or &quot;rejected.&quot; The investigators want to test whether temporary donor immune
      function is enough to improve the odds of achieving a remission without exposing the patient
      to the toxicities of a full bone marrow transplant. To do this, the investigators will use
      standard chemotherapy for AML followed by an infusion of donor stem cells. The donor will be
      a family member who is haploidentically, or half matched, to the patient such as a child or
      sibling. Chemotherapy designed to treat AML should not be strong enough to prevent them from
      rejecting the donor stem cells. The investigators will then follow the patient to see how
      long the donor stem cells stay in them. The study will test whether this process is feasible
      and can result in improved chances of obtaining a remission.

    <description>Peripheral Blood Counts: The peripheral blood neutrophil count should be ≥1,500/μl (sustained without growth factor support), and the platelets count should be ≥100,000/μl (without transfusion). No circulating blasts (in the absence of growth factor) should be detected.
Bone Marrow Aspirate: The cellularity of the bone marrow should approximate normal. There must be evidence of maturation of all cell lines. The bone marrow aspirate should contain &lt; 5% blasts. Auer rods should not be detected.
Extramedullary Leukemia: Extramedullary leukemia, such as CNS or soft tissue involvement, must not be present.</description>

        <description>Peripheral Blood Counts: The peripheral blood neutrophil count should be ≥1,500/μl (sustained without growth factor support), and the platelets count should be ≥100,000/μl (without transfusion). No circulating blasts (in the absence of growth factor) should be detected.
Bone Marrow Aspirate: The cellularity of the bone marrow should approximate normal. There must be evidence of maturation of all cell lines. The bone marrow aspirate should contain &lt; 5% blasts. Auer rods should not be detected.
Extramedullary Leukemia: Extramedullary leukemia, such as CNS or soft tissue involvement, must not be present.</description>

            <description>This is a single center trial to assess the feasibility of standard induction chemotherapy followed by a single dose of unmanipulated G-PBSC for the treatment of elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML.
Induction Chemotherapy: Patients with newly diagnosed AML will receive standard induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine (7+3 scheme). Patients who achieve CR may undergo consolidation chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating leukemia physician.
G-PBSC Infusion: G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood cells will be collected from the donors in the Donor Room according to standard MSKCC BMT guidelines. Patients will be infused by infusion of unmanipulated G-PBSC from a haploidentical related donor.</description>
