  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare pharmacokinetics of two formulations of misoprostol
      following single dose administration in adult women being given misoprostol for cervical
      ripening and induction of labour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostaglandin E2 (dinoprostone) given vaginally or intra-cervically, and oxytocin have been
      the most commonly used preparations for induction of labour. Misoprostol is a synthetic
      prostaglandin E1 analogue. Misoprostol has anti-secretory and mucosal protective properties
      and was originally developed in the 1970s for the prevention of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced peptic ulcers. It is now used much more widely for
      'off-label' indications like medication abortion, medical management of miscarriage, cervical
      ripening before surgical procedures, treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, and induction of
      labour. The lack of a specific license for Cytotec® to be used in obstetrics and gynecology
      has led to a number of problems regarding correct dose and dose regime.

      The study is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, comparative, parallel design,
      bioavailability study followed by repeat dosing of of two formulations misoprostol in healthy
      adult females being induced to go into labour.

      The drug shall be administered orally or sublingually.
