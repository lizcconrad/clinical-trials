      This is a single center study that seeks to study the impact of donor age on recipient
      outcomes in older kidney transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the years use of older kidney allografts has increased in an attempt to bridge the gap
      between demand and supply of organs. Simultaneously there has been in increase in the number
      of elderly renal transplant recipients. Numerous factors, both graft and host related, can
      impact recipient outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of donor age on
      recipient outcomes, based on the hypothesis is that elderly recipients who receive an older
      allograft have poorer outcomes that those who receive a younger allograft.

      Study subjects will be recruited from the cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant
      at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

      The transplant clinical database and electronic medical record (OTTR) used in the
      Comprehensive Transplant Center at Northwestern University will be scanned to screen for
      kidney transplant recipients who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential subjects
      will then be consented to participate in the study (see attached consent form), and subject
      participation will be documented in OTTR.

      The sample size for the study is 80 subjects, who will be divided into 2 groups based on
      recipient and donor age. All demographic and clinical data will be collected for the donor
      and recipients at time of transplant. Follow up clinical data, including but not limited to
      recipient survival and graft failure will be collected and analyzed for the recipients.
      Subject confidentiality will be strictly maintained. All subject data will be stored on a
      secure server and only shared between members of the research team. The investigators plan to
      publish the results in a peer reviewed journal.
