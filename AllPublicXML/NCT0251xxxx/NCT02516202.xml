      This is a new application from the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms
      and Health (MsFLASH) Clinical Trials network. Here we propose to conduct a large multicenter
      trial comparing two common treatments, a vaginal hormone tablet and an over-the-counter gel,
      with placebo to evaluate their effects on bothersome vaginal symptoms and sexual function,
      and to create a biorepository of specimens for future translational, mechanistic research on
      the etiology of vaginal symptoms.

    <textblock>
      The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) Clinical
      Trials network was established in 2009. By the end of 2014, the network completed 4 clinical
      trials testing 7 interventions in approximately 1000 women ages 40-62 with vasomotor (VMS)
      and other menopause symptoms.

      The current trial will evaluate a relatively understudied area of menopause - vaginal health
      and sexual function. This is a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial
      among postmenopausal women ages 45-70.

      Our primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of ultra-low dose vaginal estradiol (Vagifem
      10 mcg), non-hormonal hydrophilic non-prescriptive vaginal gel (Replens) and placebo in
      reducing the Most Bothersome vaginal Symptom (MBS).

      Secondary aims include an evaluation of a composite score of vaginal symptoms (dryness,
      itching, irritation or soreness), sexual function, quality of life and genitourinary atrophy.
      We will also create a biorepository of vaginal and blood specimens. In a subset of women, we
      will examine whether treatment response is related to: a) the post-menopausal vaginal
      microbiome; b) vaginal mucosal inflammation; and c) reproductive hormone profiles. The
      in-depth focus on the mechanisms associated with postmenopausal vaginal symptoms will use
      state of the art microbiologic techniques on longitudinally collected biologic specimens and
      will guide future translational studies.

    <description>One hundred participants will be randomized into the Vagifem® 'active' arm. These women will receive a bottle of Vagifem® tablets (estradiol 10 mcg). One tablet is to be inserted vaginally daily for 2 weeks, then 2 days/week for the remaining 10 weeks of the study.
Vagifem® tablets contain 10.3 mcg of estradiol hemihydrate equivalent to 10 mcg of estradiol. The excipient (inactive) ingredients are hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, maize starch, and magnesium stearate. Vagifem® comes as a small white film-coated tablet. The coating is made of hypromellose and polyethylene glycol.

    <description>One hundred participants will be randomized into the Replens® 'active' arm. These women will receive a tube containing Replens® vaginal gel. 2.5 gm to be applied vaginally every 3 days over 12 weeks.
Replens® is a bioadhesive polycarbophil-based moisturizing vaginal gel containing; purified water (vehicle humectant), glycerin (moisturizer), mineral oil (as a moisturizer), polycarbophil and carbomer homopolymer type B (allow the product to stick to the vaginal wall), hydrogenated palm oil glyceride (moisturizer), sorbic acid (preservative, antimicrobial), methylparaben, sodium hydroxide (adjusts pH of product so it is suitable for vaginal use).
A placebo vaginal tablet visually identical to Vagifem® is inserted daily for 2 weeks, then 2 days/week for remaining 10 weeks.</description>

    <description>One hundred participants will be randomized into the 'placebo arm' of the study. This arm is comprised of two placebo preparations; placebo vaginal tablet and placebo vaginal gel applied on the same schedule as 'active' arms.
The placebo tablet coating and excipient ingredients will be the same as are used for Vagifem®; the coating is made of hypromellose and polyethylene glycol and the excipient (inactive) ingredients are hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, maize starch, and magnesium stearate.

    <ipd_description>The DCC will perform the statistical analyses for the primary study results papers (and as many secondary papers as possible within our analytic resources). Once the primary study manuscripts are accepted for publication, a de-identified SAS dataset is made available to Network collaborators through the internal website for their use within the established Publications and Ancillary Study Committee policy. Within a 12-month period after publication of the main study results, the DCC will prepare datasets for public release that include all data elements in the main publication with certain deletions and recoding to protect study subject confidentiality. The public release datasets will include substantial documentation in electronic form, thus allowing external investigators to independently analyze the data. External investigators who wish to have access to network trial data prior to their readiness for public release can do so through collaboration with a network investigator.</ipd_description>
