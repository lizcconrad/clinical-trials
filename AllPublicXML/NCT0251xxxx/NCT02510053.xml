    <textblock>
      To investigate pharmacokinetics(PK) and pharmacodynamics(PD) of Caspofungin in ICU patients
      after received a loading dose of 70mg followed by 50mg (35mg if Child-Pugh score is 7-9), 40
      patients will be recruited. Blood samplings for PK analysis will be collected on day 4 in
      this study. Caspofungin plasma concentrations are measured by using solid phase extraction
      and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Safety analyses will be taken daily
      during the treatment of Caspofungin. Tests for drug tolerance of fungi and efficacy
      assessment (clinical and mycological responses) will be taken every 3 days by clinical and
      mycological tests.
