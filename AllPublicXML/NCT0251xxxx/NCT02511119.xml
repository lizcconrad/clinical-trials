      The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model of risk of developing melanoma. The
      investigators will used artificial intelligence techniques to analysed images patterns
      obtained by clinical and dermoscopic pictures. The investigators want to defined a new
      predictive risk model obtained from genetic information and image analysis of pigmented
      lesions. This model could help to discriminate more accurately those patients who are most
      likely to develop melanoma in a high-risk population.

        The patients were followed up in the Pigmented Lesions Unit at Reina Sofia University
        Hospital. In a subgroup of 200 patients, the investigators will analyze the dermoscopic
        imagines of melanocytic nevus, atypical nevus and melanomas to seek common patterns using
        artificial intelligence methods. With the patterns obtained, the investigators will build a
        robust model to classify population with the risk of developing melanoma. In this model the
        sociodemographic, clinical and genetic data will be used to increase the accuracy of the
        obtained model. In a second phase, in a subgroup of 100 different patients, the degree of
        accuracy of the predictive model will be evaluated.
