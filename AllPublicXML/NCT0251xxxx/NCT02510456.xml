  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to enroll women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to
      evaluate the efficacy of an investigational imaging technology known as Diffuse Optical
      Spectroscopy Imaging (DOSI) in predicting patient response to chemotherapy treatment. DOSI is
      a noninvasive imaging method that uses harmless near-infrared light using a simple handheld
      probe held against the skin to predict tumor metabolic activity. It uses nonionizing
      radiation, requires no external contrast agent and uses low light exposure to human tissue.
      DOSI scans can be performed frequently at the bedside in settings such as a doctor's office
      or infusion center.

      This study seeks to enroll women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to
      evaluate the efficacy of an investigational imaging technology known as Diffuse Optical
      Spectroscopy Imaging (DOSI) in predicting patient response to chemotherapy treatment. DOSI is
      a noninvasive imaging method that uses harmless near-infrared light using a simple handheld
      probe held against the skin to predict tumor metabolic activity. It uses nonionizing
      radiation, requires no external contrast agent and uses low light exposure to human tissue.
      DOSI scans can be performed frequently at the bedside in settings such as a doctor's office
      or infusion center.

      DOSI has already shown promise in monitoring breast cancer patients undergoing preoperative
      chemotherapy. Several groups have demonstrated optical changes predictive of response in the
      course of weeks to months of treatment. The investigators group has begun to show that DOSI
      measurements during drug infusions and at early time-points (first 24 hours) correlate with
      tumor final pathological response. While this data is provocative, significantly more work is
      needed to confirm that early time-points are predictive in different treatment groups and
      tumor molecular subtypes.

      In this study, breast cancer patients will receive DOSI scans at a subset or all of the
      following time-points: baseline, during drug infusion, early therapy, mid-therapy and
      post-therapy. DOSI results will be compared to standard of care pathology results determined
      after surgery. Additionally, the investigators will correlate DOSI parameters with any
      additional biopsy specimens taken during treatment (typically for patients on adaptive
      treatment trials). Each DOSI scan will take about 3045minutes/ session, although infusion
      measurements will take longer. DOSI can potentially help doctors to gain information
      necessary to make evidence-based changes in treatment strategies of individual patients. The
      investigators long-term goal is to provide oncologists with a relatively simple, risk-free
      bedside tool that can help predict response early, thereby maximizing therapeutic response
      and minimizing unnecessary toxicity.

    <description>Subjects will have up to seven DOSI scans at 7 different time points during the course of their chemotherapy. The time course of chemotherapy may vary between 39 months depending on the type chemotherapy subjects receive. Depending on chemotherapy schedule, subjects may or may not be asked to participate in all the 7 measurement time points. The number of DOSI scans each subject requires will be decided during consent. Each DOSI scan will take about 30-45 minutes, although scans at infusion timepoint will take longer in total due to repeated or continuous measurements.</description>
