  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hopes to determine if a negative pressure dressing is superior to a traditional
      dressing for speeding fistula closure after laparotomy. This study has a broad variety of
      implications. Patient safety is a paramount concern: Investigators hope to identify a
      superior method of wound management which minimizes risk for skin breakdown, sepsis, and
      morbidity. In addition, patient satisfaction would be improved with a method for faster wound
      healing. Finally,implications exist in the realm of a cost-benefit analysis, for example,
      although the VAC method is more costly, it may save money if it speeds healing and prevents
      the need for reoperation. Alternatively, if the VAC method is not shown to be beneficial,
      physicians can avoid using a more costly device with no proven benefit.

      Investigators are planning a superiority trial to show that VAC use speeds the closure of
      enterocutaneous fistulae over routine gravity drainage. The investigators' design is a
      randomized controlled trial with two arms. One of the arms (non-VAC) will include patients
      assigned to a system of ECFoutput management which does not involve negative pressure (for
      example, an ostomy bag placed over the fistula, wet to dry dressing changes, etc..), and the
      second arm (VAC) will consist of a group of patients assigned to VAC negative pressure
      therapy with regular sponge irrigation with normal saline (the V.A.C.Ulta™ Negative Pressure
      Wound Therapy System) .

      The fistula vac is made from standard sponge supplies and negative pressure suction devices.
      Initial placement will be by the bedside physician in the intensive care unit, the ward, or
      in the clinic. The patient will be taught basic wound care, and as is typical for those
      outpatients with wound VACs, a home nursing aide will be arranged. Those randomized to no VAC
      therapy will have ostomy bags or wet to dry dressings placed on the skin with no negative
      pressure applied. Again, initial application will be performed by the bedside physician or a
      wound care nurse. The patient will be taught wound care, with assistance provided as
      necessary.

      Once a fistula is noted to have closed (effluent = 0cc/day) the dressings or VAC will be
      discontinued, and the date of fistula closure noted.

    <description>For patients who fall under the VAC arm, a physician will do the initial placement of the wound VAC (V.A.C.Ulta™ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy System) at the patient's bedside. An information sheet will be provided to the patient, and the patient will be taught how to irrigate the sponge system independently. While inpatient, nursing will perform VAC sponge irrigation.</description>

    <description>For patients who fall under the non-VAC arm, a physician or wound care nurse will perform the initial application of the ostomy bag or wet to dry dressing change. An information sheet will be provided to the patient. While inpatient, members from the nursing or physician team will perform ostomy bag application and ostomy dressing changes.</description>
