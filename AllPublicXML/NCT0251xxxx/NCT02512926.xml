    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of carfilzomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and
      etoposide for children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors or leukemia. The medications
      cyclophosphamide and etoposide are standard drugs often used together for the treatment of
      cancer in children with solid tumors or leukemia.

      Carfilzomib is FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved in the United States for adults
      with multiple myeloma (a type of cancer). However, this drug is not approved for the disease
      being treated in this study. Since carfilzomib has not yet been used in this setting to treat
      this condition, the investigators must first find the best dose to give. The investigators
      are looking for the highest dose of carfilzomib that can be given safely. Therefore, not all
      children taking part in this study will receive the same dose of the study drug in the first
      part of the trial.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, treatment with a new
      combination of drugs, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carfilzomib has on cancer.

      In part 1 of the trial, small groups of children will be enrolled in steps. The first group
      will be given a certain dose of carfilzomib. If these children do not have side effects which
      are too bad, the next small group of children enrolled will receive a higher dose. This
      increase in doses with groups of people will continue until we find the highest dose of the
      drug that can be given without causing severe or unmanageable side effects.

      Part 2 of this study will enroll additional patients at the highest tolerable dose found in
      Part 1 in order to get more information on side effects and make sure the dose is tolerable.

                  administration of previous therapy. Six weeks must have elapsed from the
                  administration of nitrosureas or mitomycin C. For patients with ALL on
                  maintenance therapy, they may be eligible if 7 days have elapsed and they are
                  recovered from the toxic effects of the chemotherapy. This restriction does not
                  include intrathecal chemotherapy, which is permitted.

               3. Biologic agents- At least 14 days must have elapsed since the completion of
                  therapy with a biologic agent such as a monoclonal antibody. Seven days must have
                  elapsed since the last dose of retinoids

               4. Radiation therapy - At least 14 days must have elapsed for local XRT. At least 90
                  days must have elapsed if prior radiation to ≥50% of the pelvis, the spine, or
                  other substantial bone marrow radiation including TBI.

               5. Hematopoietic growth factors- At least 7 days must have elapsed since the last
                  dose of G-CSF or GM-CSF. At least 14 days must have elapsed since last dose of
                  pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®).

          6. Patient must be ≥ 3 months from hematopoietic stem cell transplant, must not have
             active GVHD, and must be off all immunosuppression

          7. Organ function:

               1. Either a serum creatinine ≤ ULN for age, or calculated or measured GFR ≥ 70
                  mL/min/1.73 m2

               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN for age, direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for age

               3. AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN for age unless elevation can be clearly attributed to liver
                  leukemia or metastases

                  infusion)

             However, the plt and ANC requirements can be waived if low counts thought to be
             secondary to leukemia or tumor bone marrow infiltration

          9. Reproductive function:

             ongoing signs/symptoms despite appropriate treatment

          9. Patient with illness, psychiatric disorder or social issue that could compromise
             patient safety or compliance with the protocol treatment or procedures, or interfere
