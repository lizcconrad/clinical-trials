      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States; more than
      600,000 Americans suffer a fatal cardiac event each year. Traditional CHD risk factors such
      as high blood pressure, smoking, and elevated cholesterol do not fully account for the timing
      and occurrence of CHD events and individuals with elevated levels of anxiety appear to have a
      greater risk of cardiovascular events. The present study will examine the impact of aerobic
      exercise and Lexapro in the treatment of anxiety and cardiovascular biomarkers among
      individuals with CHD.

      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States; more than
      600,000 Americans suffer a fatal cardiac event each year. Traditional CHD risk factors such
      as high blood pressure, smoking, and elevated cholesterol do not fully account for the timing
      and occurrence of CHD events. The term &quot;cardiovascular vulnerable patient&quot; has been used to
      describe patients susceptible to acute coronary events based upon plaque, blood, or
      myocardial characteristics. Psychosocial factors also have been shown to be associated with
      increased adverse health outcomes and increased cardiovascular vulnerability. For example,
      clinical depression and elevated depressive symptoms are associated with increased morbidity
      and mortality, and as a result, the American Heart Association has recommended that
      clinicians should routinely assess depression in CHD patients. Although much research and
      clinical recommendations have focused on depression, the significance of anxiety has been
      largely ignored, despite the fact that anxiety disorders are as prevalent as depression in
      the general population and are associated with similar levels of disability.

      Despite the prevalence and prognostic significance of anxiety in CHD populations, there have
      been few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) specifically targeting anxious CHD patients.
      Anxiolytic medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been
      shown to be effective in treating anxiety. SSRIs have been evaluated for the treatment of
      clinical depression in cardiac patients, with equivocal results. Surprisingly, to our
      knowledge, there have been no RCTs examining the efficacy of medications for treating anxiety
      in CHD patients. Moreover, because many cardiac patients are reluctant to take additional
      medications and psychotropic medications may not be effective for everyone or may produce
      unwanted side effects, there continue to be a need to identify alternative approaches for
      treating anxiety in cardiac patients. The investigators believe that exercise may be one such
      approach.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the following hypotheses in a population of CHD
      patients with elevated symptoms of anxiety. The present study will examine the impact of a
      3-month intervention of either exercise, Lexapro, or placebo on anxiety symptoms and CHD
      biomarkers among individuals with cardiac disease and elevated anxiety. The investigators
      hypothesize that: (1) Both exercise training and medication will reduce anxiety symptoms to a
      greater extent than placebo; (2) Exercise training will improve CHD biomarkers of risk
      including autonomic regulation, vascular endothelial function, and inflammation more than
      either medication or placebo; and (3) Improvements in CHD biomarkers will be mediated by
      reductions in symptoms of anxiety. The investigators also will explore potential moderators
      of treatment (e.g., anxiety diagnoses, CHD severity) as well as the longer-term benefits of
      treatment by documenting medical events and health care costs over a follow-up period of up
      to 4 years.

    <description>Patients will exercise three times per week, under medical supervision, at a level of 70-85% of their VO2peak as determined at the time of their baseline exercise stress test. Patients' exercise will consist of 10 minutes of gradual warm-up exercises followed by 35 minutes of continuous walking, biking, or jogging, and 5 minutes of cool down exercises for a total a 50 minutes per session. Patients will be instructed to monitor their radial pulses and will be checked at least three times per session to ensure that they are within their prescribed exercise training ranges.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Treatment in the medication will be supervised by a study psychiatrist. Drug dispensing will be done by licensed pharmacists at the Duke Investigational Pharmacy Service. The investigators will use the SSRI escitalopram (Lexapro), which has received FDA approval for the treatment of anxiety, in 5 mg capsules. Medication will be dispensed as capsules of escitalopram in individually coded bottles. Medication adherence will be assessed using pill count at each study visit. Patients will visit face-to-face with a study psychiatrist at week 0 (baseline), week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12 with phone encounters at weeks 3 and 6. The psychiatrist will make all medication adjustments based primarily upon Spielberger Anxiety Scores. Depending on symptoms, daily escitalopram doses will be titrated to 10 mg after week 2 and to 15 mg or placebo equivalent at week 3 if patients show no change or only minimal improvement.</description>

Drug dispensing will be done by licensed pharmacists at the Duke Investigational Pharmacy Service, who have extensive experience in clinical trials. Medication will be taken once daily in the morning but can be switched to once daily in the evening if deemed necessary. Placebo medication administration will follow the same protocol as outlined for Lexapro.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women with documented CHD (i.e., a prior MI, coronary revascularization
             procedure, or &gt;70% stenosis in at least one coronary artery)

          -  Age &gt; 39 years

          -  Patients also will have an anxiety symptom severity score of at least 8 on the
             Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Anxiety scale (HADS-A); a subgroup of patients will
             also have a DSM-5 diagnosis of an Anxiety Disorder.

        The study team plans to actively recruit women and minorities, with at least 50% women and
        25% minorities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An MI or coronary revascularization procedure (i.e., CABG or percutaneous coronary
             intervention) within the last 3 months

          -  Unstable angina

          -  Severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;30%) or decompensated heart
             failure

          -  Unrevascularized left main coronary artery stenosis &gt;50%

          -  Complete Pacemaker dependence

          -  Resting BP &gt;200/120 mm Hg

          -  Conditions that would preclude randomization to either the drug (e.g., prolonged QT
             interval, known allergy to or intolerance of escitalopram) or exercise (e.g.,
             musculoskeletal problems or abnormal cardiac response to exercise)

          -  Patients with a primary psychiatric diagnosis other than Anxiety Disorder will be
             excluded, including patients with MDD, PTSD, OCD, or any of the following DSM-5
             diagnoses:

               1. Dementia, delirium;

               2. Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective, or other psychotic disorder;

               3. Psychotic features including any delusions or hallucinations; or

               4. Current alcohol or other substance abuse disorder.

          -  Similarly, patients who pose an acute suicide or homicide risk or who, during the
             course of the study, would likely require treatment with additional
             psychopharmacologic agents will not be enrolled.

          -  Patients will also be excluded if they are taking other medications that would
             preclude assignment to either drug or exercise conditions (e.g., clonidine, dicumarol,
             anticonvulsants, and MAO inhibitors) or are taking herbal supplements with purported
             mood effects (e.g., St. John's Wort, valerian, ginkgo).

          -  Patients already engaged in regular exercise (at least 30 minutes &gt;1x/week) will not
             be enrolled.

          -  Finally, pregnant women will be excluded from participation.
