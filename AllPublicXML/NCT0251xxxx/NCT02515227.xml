  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine in combination with
      pembrolizumab. This study will also evaluate the effects of the combination of the peptide
      vaccine and pembrolizumab on the immune system. The investigators will monitor these effects
      by performing tests in the laboratory on participants' blood, a lymph node, and tumor
      samples.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with unresectable stage IIIB or IIIC melanoma, or stage IV metastatic
             melanoma that have clinical or radiological evidence of disease. Subjects may have had
             cutaneous, uveal, mucosal primary melanoma, or an unknown primary melanoma. Staging
             must be confirmed by cytological or histological examination. Staging of cutaneous
             melanoma will be based on the revised AJCC staging system

          2. Ability to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          3. ≥18 years of age

          4. A subject may be naïve for immunotherapy agents or have received interferon-alpha,
             ipilimumab or other CTLA-4 antibody, PD-1 antibody (or anti-PD-L1 antibody),
             interleukin-2, or prior cancer vaccines other than the 6MHP vaccine. Patients who have
             received a PD-1/PD-L1 antibody may be enrolled in either of the following settings:

               1. A patient who has experienced progression of melanoma during that therapy or
                  after having completed that therapy,

               2. A patient who fails to experience an objective clinical response (partial
                  response or complete response by RECIST 1.1 criteria) after either 12 weeks of
                  continuous anti-PD1 antibody or anti-CTLA4/anti-PD1 combination therapy, and is a
                  candidate to receive pembrolizumab therapy

          5. Measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

             Subjects will be required to have radiological studies to define radiologically
             evident disease. Required studies include:

               -  Chest CT scan,

               -  Abdominal and pelvic CT scan, and

               -  Head CT scan or MRI PET/CT fusion scan may replace scans of the chest, abdomen,
                  and pelvis.

          6. Subjects who have metastatic melanoma available for biopsy pretreatment and on day 22
             must consent to having those biopsies. These metastases may be in nodes, skin, soft
             tissue, liver, or other sites that can be accessed safely by needle biopsy, incisional
             or excisional biopsy, with or without image guidance. The lesions to be biopsied must
             be specified at study enrollment and not included as target lesions for RECIST
             calculations. In instances where disease that is accessible to biopsy is limited,
             archival tissue specimens collected after a subject's last systemic therapy may be
             used for baseline measures.

             Subjects must have measurable disease in addition to the lesion(s) to be biopsied.

          7. Subjects who have had brain metastases will be eligible if all of the following are
             true:

               -  Each brain metastasis must have been completely removed by surgery or each
                  unresected brain metastasis must have been treated with stereotactic
                  radiosurgery.

               -  There has been no evident growth of any brain metastasis since the most recent
                  treatment

               -  No brain metastasis is &gt; 2 cm in diameter at the time of registration.

               -  Neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline,

               -  There is no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases,

               -  Subjects are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to registration.

          8. The most recent surgical resections or gamma-knife therapy for malignant melanoma must
             have been completed ≥ 1 week prior to registration.

          9. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

         10. Adequate organ function.

         11. Two intact (undissected) axillary and/or inguinal lymph node basins.
