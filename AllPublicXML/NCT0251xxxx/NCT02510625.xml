      The objective of this study is to investigate arthroscopic treatments of recurrent anterior
      shoulder instability. Functional outcomes of arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction
      with bone graft will be compared to the gold standard, arthroscopic Bankart repair. The
      investigators hypothesize that arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction with bone graft
      will provide better functional outcomes and decreased risk of recurrent
      dislocation/subluxation.

      This will be a single center, double blinded, randomized controlled trial performed in
      Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The primary outcome measured will be the Western Ontario
      Shoulder Instability (WOSI) score. Secondary outcomes will be subluxation, re-dislocation,
      and range of motion. A minimum of 200 patients will be enrolled in the study as determined by
      sample size calculation. Routine radiographs as well as a pre-operative CT with 3D
      reconstruction and MRI are obtained for all patients. The patients will then undergo a
      clinical examination and complete a variety of functional and quality of life surveys.
      Randomization will be based on surgeon skill. Two groups (Bankart repair and anatomic glenoid
      reconstruction) will be selected with 100 subjects each. Postoperatively, patients in both
      groups will follow a standardized rehabilitation protocol. The patient will follow-up with
      the attending surgeon at 2 weeks post-operatively for a wound check. At the 3, 6, 12, and 24
      month visits the patient will again undergo the structured clinical examination conducted by
      a physiotherapist who is blinded to the patients' treatment group. The patient will also
      complete the questionnaires at each of these follow-up appointments. Complications, and
      subluxation/dislocation events will be documented at each follow-up evaluation. On the basis
      of a clinical examination and patient history, the surgeon will diagnose recurrent
      instability and categorize it as a traumatic or atraumatic subluxation or dislocation.

      Study Objective

      The objective of this study is to investigate the outcomes of arthroscopic treatments of
      recurrent anterior shoulder instability. Arthroscopic bone grafting of the glenoid will be
      compared to the gold standard, arthroscopic Bankart repair. The investigators hypothesize
      that arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction with bone graft will provide better
      functional outcomes and decreased risk of recurrent dislocation and subluxation. The null
      hypothesis is that there is no difference in change in WOSI scores between arthroscopic
      anatomic glenoid reconstruction and the current standard treatment, arthroscopic Bankart
      repair, at two years of follow up in patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation.

      Subject Selection

      The objective of this study is to determine if glenoid bone grafting provides superior
      functional outcomes as determined by WOSI score to Bankart repair in patients with anterior
      shoulder instability. This will be a single center, double blinded, randomized controlled
      trial of a minimum of 200 patients performed at the Halifax Infirmary, Queen Elizabeth II
      Health Sciences Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The primary outcome measured will be
      WOSI score. This is a validated measure assessing quality of life in patients with this
      condition. Secondary outcomes will be subluxation, re-dislocation, strength and ROM, and
      other validated functional outcome scores, including: the VR-12 questionnaire, the DASH
      questionnaire, and the Marx Shoulder Activity Scale (appendix). The ISIS (instability
      severity index score) (appendix) score will be calculated.

      The Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) is a tool designed for self-assessment
      of shoulder function for patients with instability problems. It is a disease specific quality
      of life score. Its high sensitivity makes it able to monitor an individual patient's
      progress. The WOSI score has good validity (0.768), a high degree of reliability (0.911), and
      a high degree of responsiveness.

      The Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a brief, generic, multi-use,
      self-administered health survey comprised of 12 items. It has been shown to have high
      internal consistency reliability (alpha &gt; .80) and high convergent validity for EQ-5D items
      (r &gt; .56). . The instrument is primarily used to measure health-related quality of life, to
      estimate disease burden, and to evaluate disease-specific benchmarks.

      The DASH Outcome Measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical
      function and symptoms in people with any of several musculoskeletal disorders of the upper
      limb. DASH stands for &quot;Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand.&quot; In a Norweigan study
      examing those with shoulder conditions the reliability was shown to be 0.93 and Construct
      validity was 0.75. The tool gives clinicians and researchers the advantage of having a
      single, reliable instrument that can be used to assess any or all joints in the upper
      extremity.

      The Marx Shoulder Activity Scale is a short, easy to administer measure of shoulder activity
      used to predict outcome of shoulder disorders. The activity rating is a numerical sum of
      scores for five activities rated on a five-point frequency scale from never performed (0
      points) to daily (4 points). The activity scale has excellent reliability (intraclass
      correlation coefficient 0.92) and construct validity (r = 0.66). It can be completed quickly
      and used in conjunction with patient-based measures of shoulder outcome to define patient
      populations for cohort studies, and to assess activity level as a prognostic factor in
      patients with shoulder disorders.

      The ISIS is a simple scoring system based on factors derived from a pre-operative
      questionnaire, physical examination and AP radiographs. It may help to distinguish between
      patients who will benefit from an arthroscopic anterior stabilization using suture anchors
      and those who will not. It has good reliability (r&gt;0.8). The score has high validity, as
      patients with a score of six points or less have an acceptable recurrence risk of 10%, and
      are therefore potentially good candidates for this procedure. By contrast, those patients
      with more than six points have a recurrence risk of 70%.

      Safety of both procedures will be monitored and any adverse events will be recorded.
      Preoperative CT and MRI findings of bone loss will be compared with each other and also with
      arthroscopic intra-operative measurements. The investigators hypothesize that arthroscopic
      bone grafting of the glenoid provide superior functional outcomes as determined by WOSI score
      compared to Bankart repair in patients with anterior shoulder instability.

      A minimum of 200 patients will be enrolled in the study as determined by a priori sample size
      calculations. The sample-size calculation was based on the mean WOSI score (85 of 100;
      standard deviation [SD] = 20) from a sample of 133 patients with traumatic anterior shoulder
      instability who were followed postoperatively for a minimum of one year. An estimate of
      change (10% change from the mean WOSI score) was used to ensure sufficient sample size and
      power. With the use of a two-sided test, an Î± value of 0.05, and power of 0.90, the sample
      size was determined to be eighty-six patients per group. This was inflated to one hundred
      patients per group to account for an estimated 16.8% loss to follow-up (this value
      demonstrated in a study with Canadian patients with similar characteristics as the target
      population). Each of the five surgeons participating in the study see approximately 40
      patients with this pathology per year, giving an estimated recruitment time of 200 patients
      in one year.

      Inclusion Criteria 2 or more documented incidences of anterior glenohumeral dislocation

      Exclusion Criteria Uncontrolled diabetes (Hgb A1C &gt;7% Age 16-60 Prior surgery of affected
      shoulder Pregnancy Multidirectional instability Posterior instability Paralysis of the
      shoulder Cancer Severe systemic illness

      Patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability who are referred to any of the
      orthopedic surgeons at Halifax Infirmary or the Dartmouth General Hospital will be initially
      seen by the research coordinator, who will confirm the diagnosis and screen patients for
      study eligibility. Following a detailed discussion of the risks/benefits/alternatives of the
      study, the patient will be provided with a copy of the informed consent to review if they
      demonstrate interest in the study. If the patient then wishes to be enrolled in the study,
      the surgeon or research assistant will obtain patient consent for the study according to the
      Division of Orthopaedic Surgery and Capital District Health Authority (CDHA) institutional
      protocols.

      Research Plan

      In the pre-operative period, there will be no additional time requirements for the patient,
      with the exception of the informed consent process for the study. Routine radiographs
      including an AP, axillary, and Y view of the shoulder as well as a pre-operative CT with 3D
      reconstruction and MRI are obtained for all patients, as is the standard of care for patients
      with recurrent shoulder instability. The patient will not be exposed to any additional
      radiation above the usual standard of care.

      The patients will return to clinic to complete a pre-operative assessment and collection of
      baseline data. Structured clinical examination will be conducted by a physiotherapist. and
      consist of active and passive range of motion testing by goniometer as well as strength
      testing by hand dynamometer. The patient will also complete baseline questionnaires ( WOSI
      questionnaire, the VR-12 questionnaire, the DASH questionnaire, the Marx Shoulder Activity
      Scale) and the ISIS score will be calculated. Any complications or events of dislocation or
      subluxation will be recorded. Primary outcome will be WOSI score. Secondary outcome will be
      subluxation/dislocation, and other quality of life measures and functional clinical
      assessment (ROM and strength) will be assessed.

      Randomization For eligible patients who meet the inclusion criteria, the research coordinator
      will obtain informed consent and randomly allocate patients to one of two surgical procedure
      groups: Bankart repair or Bankart repair and anatomic glenoid reconstruction with allograft
      bone. Randomization will be based on surgeon skill, with one surgeon (Dr. Wong) performing
      the anatomic glenoid reconstruction, and four Surgeons (Drs. Trenholm, Coady, Urquhart, &amp;
      Legay) performing Bankart repairs. Allocation will be determined through the use of
      computer-generated, variable-block-size randomization and consecutively numbered opaque
      envelopes. Patients will then meet the assigned surgeon, who will discuss the repair
      technique in a typical clinical context, reconfirm eligibility, and address any patient
      concerns regarding consent and randomization. The expertise-based randomization design
      allowed the surgeons to perform their preferred surgical procedure. Two groups (Bankart
      repair and anatomic glenoid reconstruction) will be selected with 100 subjects each. After
      patients have been randomized, the treating surgeon will have final decision to exclude
      patient.

      Surgical Technique A diagnostic arthroscopy is performed according to the method described by
      Snyder (2003). The amount of glenoid bone loss and any Hill-Sachs lesions are visualized and
      assessed according to a standardized protocol using a calibrated probe. This technique will
      be as described by Burkhart. In his cadaveric study, he showed that the bare spot is almost
      exactly in the center of the inferior glenoid, with very small standard deviations. A
      calibrated probe is introduced through the posterior portal, and the distance from the bare
      spot to the posterior glenoid rim is measured. The surgeon infers that the pre-dislocation
      intact measurement from the bare spot to the anterior glenoid rim would have been the same as
      the posterior measurement. The surgeon then uses the calibrated probe to measure the distance
      from the bare spot to the anterior glenoid rim. Hill-Sachs lesions will also be measured and
      documented with photography. Intraoperative photos and video will be recorded of this
      technique, and the photographs will be reviewed by an independent observer. The measurement
      will be quantified by the independent observer to remove any observer bias. Any bone loss is
      identified, quantified, and compared with the pre-operative CT and MRI.

      Bankart Repair Arthroscopic Bankart repair procedures will be performed according to each
      individual surgeon's usual technique. Procedures will be performed with the patient in the
      lateral or beach-chair position. Repairs for associated or conjoined superior labral
      anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) tears will be documented and performed at the surgeon's
      discretion. Labral detachments will be repaired with the use of suture-anchor fixation and
      arthroscopic tying techniques. Either two or three suture anchors will be used. Capsular
      redundancy will be addressed with arthroscopic suture plication at the surgeon's discretion.
      Surgeons will mobilize the capsulolabral tissue as deemed necessary. Surgical time and video
      of the operation will be recorded, and photographs will be taken documenting any bone loss.

      Anatomic Glenoid Reconstruction The surgical technique was the lateral decubitus
      all-arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction procedure for treatment of anterior shoulder
      instability as described by Wong et al. (In press) The procedure is done in a semi-lateral
      decubitus position that assists with optimal graft placement on the native glenoid. The
      investigators utilize the cannulated Bristow-Latarjet Instability Shoulder System
      (Depuy-Mitek, MA, USA). The surgical technique is identical to that of arthroscopic Bankart
      repair with one additional step. Prior to insertion of anchors, one additional medal portal
      is created for insertion of the bone graft. The distal tibia allograft is prepared; the
      cannulated guide is attached and advanced through the rotator interval and secured with two
      cannulated screws. Finally the Bankart repair is performed above the graft. Surgical time and
      video of the operation will be recorded, and photographs will be taken documenting any bone
      loss.

      Postoperative protocol

      Patients in both groups will follow a standardized rehabilitation protocol as described by
      The American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Therapists' Consensus Rehabilitation Guideline for
      Arthroscopic Anterior Capsulolabral Repair of the Shoulder. Briefly, the protocol includes a
      4-week period of absolute immobilization, a staged recovery of full range of motion over a
      3-month period, a strengthening progression beginning at postoperative week 6, and a
      functional progression for return to athletic or demanding work activities between
      postoperative months 4 and 6. The patient will follow-up with the attending surgeon at 2
      weeks post-operatively for a wound check. Then further follow-up appointments will be at 6
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 and 24 months, as per current clinical practice.

      At the 3, 6, 12, and 24 month visits the patient will again undergo the structured clinical
      examination conducted by a physiotherapist who is blinded to the patients' treatment group.
      The patient will be wearing clothing to cover all incisions, and will be given clear
      instructions to not reveal to the assessor which group they were allocated to. This will be
      monitored by the research assistant. The patient will also complete the WOSI, VR-12, Marx
      Shoulder Activity Scale, and DASH questionnaires at each of these follow-up appointments.
      Complications, and subluxation/dislocation events will be documented at each follow-up
      evaluation. On the basis of a clinical examination and patient history, the surgeon will
      diagnose recurrent instability and categorize it as a traumatic or atraumatic subluxation or
      dislocation. Safety monitoring will be in place to document and review all adverse events.

      Analysis of Data:

      Two independent assessors blinded to the surgical treatment group will view the
      intra-operative photos of measurement of glenoid size taken by each surgeon. The videos will
      not be associated with any PHI and only identified by unique coding number. The distance from
      the bare area to the anterior margin of the glenoid will be subtracted from the distance from
      the bare area to the posterior margin of the glenoid. The resultant value will be identified
      as the absolute anterior glenoid bone loss, and will be compared to the total diameter of the
      glenoid to estimate percent of glenoid bone loss. Summary statistics for measured bone loss
      will be recorded as mean +/- standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.
      The measured bone loss will be compared to pre-operative diagnostic imaging estimates via
      independent samples t-tests.

      The outcome measures for each group will be reported as mean+/- standard deviation and 95%
      confidence interval will be calculated. Two-Tailed T-tests will be computed for the WOSI,
      VR-12, Marx Shoulder Activity Scale, and DASH scores, range of motion, and strength measures
      comparing the 2 experimental groups at each time point. Repeated-measures ANOVA will be used
      to perform a within-subjects analysis to assess differences in WOSI, VR-12, DASH, Marx
      Shoulder Activity Scale scores, range of motion and strength within each group between time
      points.
