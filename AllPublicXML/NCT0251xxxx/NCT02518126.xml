      To see if there is a relationship between the level of LIF in IUGR fetuses and compared to
      the level of LIF in AGA fetuses

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During embryonic development, there are several cytokines such as: LIF (Leukemia inhibitory
      factor), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), epidermal growth factor family (EGF), neuregulin
      1 (NRG1) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) that were found are associated with
      neurogenesis and differentiation of brain cells .

      LIF is a cytokine that is essential for the development of the central nervous system, and
      has recently been shown in rats that maternal LIF stimulates placental ACTH that in turn
      promotes secretion of fetal LIF from nRBC , which in turn promotes brain development of the
      fetus Other studies on IUGR (Intra Uterine Growth Restriction) have shown that IUGR fetuses
      have more CP (Cerebral palsy) than those who were AGA (Average for Gestational Age) The
      hypothesis is that LIF is related to the proper development of the nervous system in the
      fetus and by testing cord blood of embryos IUGR and the placenta we will find changes in LIF
      and ACTH compared with AGA fetuses level.

      Studies have also shown a relationship between CP and IUGR, but the mechanism for this
      relationship is unclear.

      The purpose of our research is to see if there is a relationship between the level of LIF in
      IUGR fetuses and compared to the level of LIF in AGA fetuses, in one of two ways:

        -  Changes in the secretion of ACTH in placenta

        -  Changes in levels of LIF in the umbilical cord blood

    <description>After birth and fetal umbilical cord disconnection, a blood sample will be taken from the umbilical cord (cord blood) of IUGR and of AGA fetuses (5cc) for cytokine ELISA testing. Also a small sample of the placenta will be examined in order to assess the level of ACTH protein in IUGR and AGA embryos</description>
