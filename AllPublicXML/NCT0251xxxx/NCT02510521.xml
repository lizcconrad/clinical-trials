    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a major public health problem because of its increasing prevalence and
      morbidity and mortality that accompanies it. Therapeutic management of this pathology,
      lifestyle measures, dietary and physical activity are fundamental. Their observance is
      unfortunately too often insufficient, leading to a therapeutic climbing with first oral
      antidiabetic (OAD) then the use of insulin therapy.

      Yet there is now ample evidence that physical activity improves glucose control in these
      patients in particular improving insulin sensitivity after a training period but also after a
      single session of physical activity.

      Neuro-myo-electrical stimulation (NMES) is used in common clinical practice in physical
      therapy, patients with neurological or after orthopedic surgery in particular. In fact, this
      method enables improvement of volume and strength, even for denervated muscles. Recent
      studies have also shown the benefits of NMES in situations of cardiac or respiratory
      readjustments. In addition, NMES is used by top athletes supplements classical training in
      order to develop muscle strength or speed recovery.

      Investigators propose to test the impact of bilateral quadriceps NMES on insulin sensitivity
      in type 2 diabetic patients treated with OAD (excluding glitazone). To do this, investigators
      plan to assess their insulin sensitivity by the reference method of hyperinsulinemic
      euglycemic clamp before surgery, after a single session of bilateral quadriceps NMES and
      after a sequence of daily training 6 days a quadriceps NMES bilateral.

      Investigators hope to show an improvement in insulin sensitivity by this method, which would
      constitute an alternative to physical activity in the treatment of diabetes type 2. This
      procedure would be particularly interesting in diabetic subjects with type 2 counter-
      indications or an inability to perform a conventional physical activity.

Electrostimulation relates both quadriceps are stimulated simultaneously and jointly. During the sessions, the patient sits on a chair or on a chair, legs bent at 90 °.
