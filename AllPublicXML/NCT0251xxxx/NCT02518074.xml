      The investigators objective is twofold. Investigators propose to study how the vestibular and
      auditory information interact in the construction of coherence between the staff and
      extrapersonal space.

      Furthermore, investigators want to investigate whether, even in the absence of gravity, the
      auditory spatial information allocentric provide a framework for spatial reference.
