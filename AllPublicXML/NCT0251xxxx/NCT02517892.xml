  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to identify molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to
      targeted therapies in patients with unresectable or metastatic cancer.

      This is a protocol to study clinical characteristics and biopsy tissue of patients with
      oncogene-driven cancer who have had previous clinical response to targeted therapy and
      subsequently experience progression of disease. The tissues and other specimens will be used
      to carry out laboratory studies to explore the molecular basis of acquired resistance to
      targeted therapies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic cancer and who fulfill the following
        eligibility criteria will be considered eligible for this study:

          1. Patient affiliated to a social security regimen

          2. Therapy with a targeted agent (as defined in appendix 1).

          3. Tumor lesion accessible to core biopsies (malignant effusions can represent an
             alternative)

          4. Patient who is fully informed, able to comply with the protocol and who signed the
             informed consent.

          5. Availability of initial tumor material (ideally frozen, or non-Bouin fixed paraffin
             embedded material) acquired before exposure to the targeted therapy Note: Patients may
             have received other treatments since treatment with targeted therapies including
             radiation or chemotherapy, before undergoing the study biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Coagulation abnormality prohibiting a biopsy
