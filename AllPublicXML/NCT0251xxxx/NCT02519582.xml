    <textblock>
      Phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral appliqued niclosamide in patients
      who are progressive with metachronous or synchronous metastases of colorectal cancer among
      the previous therapy (Nikolo). Monocentric open-label clinical trial of phase II. All
      patients received 2 g p.o. niclosamide daily until progression (according to RECIST) or
      unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation of study for other reasons.

      Effectiveness:

      • effectiveness is measured by progression-free survival evaluated by RECIST (Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid tumor).

      Overall survival For overall survival, the curves are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method
