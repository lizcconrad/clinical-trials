  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Views for surgery method selection of intracerebral hemorrhage are still controversial. Since
      the application of neuroendoscopic technique in intraventricular hemorrhage was confirmed
      effective and safe, some investigators have attempted to use endoscopic strategies to
      evacuate intracerebral hematomas. Some significant advances have also been reported in
      endoscopic hematoma evacuation when compared to conventional craniotomy. However, it is still
      crucial to implement a prospective and controlled study to evaluate the efficiency and safety
      of endoscopic technique in the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage. In this study, the
      investigators will exclusively select some patients with intracerebral hemorrhage in the
      basal ganglia region. This study will compare the efficacy and safety of endoscopic surgery
      versus stereotactic aspiration on neurologic outcomes for patients with intracerebral
      hemorrhage.

    <textblock>
      Although the incidence and mortality of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have been
      decreased with the improved management of high blood pressure, ICH may induce serious
      disability for the patients and continue to be a major socioeconomic problem. The evacuation
      of ICH using open craniotomy or computer tomography (CT)-guided stereotaxy may improve the
      survival rate of these patients but failed to prove efficacy in improving patients'
      functional outcome despite numerous efforts. Endoscopy-guided evacuation of ICH provides a
      less invasive and quicker surgical decompression, which may potentially improve the
      functional outcome for patients. In previous studies, endoscope-guided evacuation of ICH is
      often referred to as that an endoscope only provides an illuminating system while the
      operating channel is independent from the endoscope (endoscopy-controlled microneurosurgery
      or endoscopy-assisted microneurosurgery). In recent years, authors have been committed to
      explore the procedure of intra-endoscopy-guided evacuation of ICH, which means that the
      illuminating channel, the irrigation-aspiration channel and the working channel are all
      located in the endoscope. This kind of procedure can be called as real endoscopic
      neurosurgery (EN), which may potentially decrease the operative concomitant injuries at the
      most extent. However, the inherent drawbacks of intra-endoscopic procedures, including the
      limited visualization of the surgical field and the difficult maintenance of patency of the
      aspiration wand, can offset the advantages in some instances. The authors exclusively
      invented a special endoscopic transparent sheath for guiding hematoma puncture and an
      agitation-aspiration system (AAS) for keeping patency of the aspiration wand. Detailed
      procedures of their application will be implemented and verified in a series of patients with
      intracerebral hemorrhage. Meanwhile, the mortality rate, complications and other outcome
      parameters between this procedure and CT-guided procedures will be compared.
