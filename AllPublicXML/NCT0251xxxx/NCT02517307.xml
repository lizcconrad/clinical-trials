    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about what causes insulin resistance. It has been
      suggested that proper breakdown of fat into energy (oxidation) in the body is important to
      allow insulin to keep blood sugar in the normal range. The investigators want to know if
      having one of the fatty acid oxidation disorders could have an influence on insulin action.
      Fatty acid oxidation disorders are genetic disorders that inhibit one of the enzymes that
      converts fat into energy. The investigators will study both normal healthy people and people
      with a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder.

      The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the effects of disordered mitochondrial
      fatty acid oxidation on insulin resistance in humans. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been
      implicated in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes during excess dietary
      fat intake and from increased release of endogenous free fatty acids , such as occurs in
      obesity. Controversy exists, however, as to whether this insulin resistance results from
      intrinsic defects in mitochondrial energy utilization or from abnormalities resulting from
      excess free fatty acid flux, as well as the role that subsequent accumulation of cellular
      metabolic intermediates play in impaired insulin signaling.

      To address these controversies, the investigators will study a unique population of patients
      with inherited defects in each of the three mitochondrial enzymes in the fatty acid oxidation
      pathway: 1) very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD); 2) trifunctional protein (TFP,
      which includes long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD)); and 3) medium-chain
      acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). These proteins are required for the oxidation of sequentially
      shorter fatty acids . The investigators will test the hypothesis that intrinsic defects in
      mitochondrial function involving oxidation of long-chain, but not medium-chain, fatty acids
      are sufficient to prevent intralipid-induced insulin resistance.
