    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the application of the Attention Training Technique in
      children with ADHD aged 7-11 years old. The research aims to investigate both the feasibility
      of this technique in this population as well as whether it can improve symptoms, behaviour
      and executive functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioural disorder characterised
      by core symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Its prevalence ranges between
      3-9% of school-aged children, making it one of the most common presentations in child and
      adolescent mental health services.

      In the last 10 years, research into the effectiveness of attention training as an
      intervention for children with ADHD has been increasing. This has tended to follow
      assumptions that children with the disorder either lack skills in focusing and maintaining
      their attention and/or have neurological deficits in areas responsible for attention
      functions. Results have been encouraging, with study participants demonstrating improvements
      in symptoms and behaviour following a course of attention training. However, the method and
      length of training has varied across studies.

      This study aims to investigate a treatment called the Attention Training Technique (ATT) that
      approaches attention difficulties in this disorder from a different perspective. Instead of
      viewing inattention as a result of structural or skills deficits, it posits that children
      with ADHD have these skills, but are perhaps unaware of the flexibility and control they have
      over them. This treatment aims to increase this awareness and subsequently improve ratings of
      attention, behaviour and other areas of executive functioning.

    <description>Participants will receive 3-5 sessions of the ATT over a period of 3-5 weeks. A set of standardised instructions will be read to each participant and then they will engage in the procedure for a period of 12 minutes. Participants will listen to a set of auditory stimuli and follow the directions of the recording. This will ask them to focus their attention on selected sounds or spatial locations, switch attention between different sounds and locations, before allocating their attention to all sounds simultaneously. Participants will be given a recording of the ATT on a C.D and asked to practice this at least once before the second session.</description>
