  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as
      a cognitive enhancer for patients with Alzheimer disease.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulation technique, that are
      applied to the brain by using two electrodes. These electrodes are placed on the scalp. The
      current is low intensity, usually 1-2 milliampere. tDCS may affect cognitive functions by
      increasing cortical excitability. tDCS is regarded as a safe treatment approach. In the
      present study, participants will undergo six stimulations. The effect of all stimulations
      swill be measured with neuropsychological testing before the first (pre) and after the sixth
      tDCS stimulation (post).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized controlled study (RCT) and will use tDCS to stimulate left
      temporal lobe and hopefully improve verbal memory functions. A total of 30 patients with
      Alzheimer disease will receive tDCS treatment for 30 minutes, six times. Half of the patients
      will undergo sham stimulation. These six stimulations will be executed during 10 days.
      Patients will be tested with neuropsychological tests before the first stimulation and after
      the last stimulation to assess the effect of the treatment. Patients will be retested six
      months later in order to investigate long-term effects ot the stimulation. The main
      hypothesis in the present study is that tDCS stimulation will lead to significant
      improvements in verbal memory functions.

    <description>We will use a neuropsychological test called California Verbal Learning Test and test verbal memory functions before the first treatment session and after the last treatment session. We will use this test to assess how the tDCS intervention will affect verbal memory functions. There will be a maximum of ten days between pre and post testing, since the entire stimulation procedure (six stimulations) will be executed during ten days.</description>
