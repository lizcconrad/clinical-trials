  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From previous parabolic flight campaigns completed by our research group investigators
      gathered data showing important changes in neuro‐endocrine and also immunological changes.
      This experiment now will complete the data set‐up obtained during the MARS500 study on how
      these respective individuals will re‐act to highly physically and emotionally challenging
      situations during a parabolic flight.

      This add‐on experiment to MARS500 will enable answering to the following questions i) if the
      stress response systems - when compared for two conditions but in the same individuals - do
      react uniformly and ii) if those subjects prone to have adequate stress response pattern will
      show gradually less immune modulation effects.

      The understanding of the complex interactions of stress and immunity under chronic and acute
      stress conditions might help to enable adequate health and immune monitoring and might as
      well suggest suitable countermeasures for the prevention of the unwanted immunological
      effects during long‐term confinement and space missions.
