  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of injecting ones own
      Schwann cells to augment sural nerve autografts after a severe, non-lacerating injury to the
      sciatic nerve has occurred.

      The secondary purpose of this research project is to evaluate whether transplanted Schwann
      cells can enhance recovery of sensory and motor function. Emergency expanded access for a
      single patient was granted, as the patient was an ideal candidate for sural nerve repair
      augmented by autologous Schwann cells which could be harvested from a relatively small
      segment of sensory nerve. The cells were expanded using cell culture techniques and placed
      along with the sural nerve grafts wrapped by an FDA approved collagen matrix (Duragen). This
      study is being conducted at the Jackson Memorial and the University of Miami health systems.
      As a research subject the patient will be in this study for a total of 5 years from the date
      receiving Schwann cell transplant augmentation of sural nerve autografts.
