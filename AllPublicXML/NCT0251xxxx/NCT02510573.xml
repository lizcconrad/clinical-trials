      The current study was designed to investigate the change of serum ficolin-3 levels and assess
      the prognostic predictive effect of serum ficolin-3 levels in the patients with severe
      traumatic brain injury.

    <textblock>
      Complement activation is one of the pathological mechanisms that contribute to the secondary
      brain injury after traumatic brain injury. Ficolin-mediated lectin pathways of complement
      activation contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and may be additive to
      complement-independent inflammatory processes. Lower serum ficolin-3 levels have been
      demonstrated to be highly associated with unfavorable outcome after ischemic stroke. This
      prospective observatory study was designed to investigate the relationship between serum
      ficolin-3 levels and 1-week mortality, 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcome
      (defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) in patients with severe traumatic brain
      injury. This study recruited 128 patients and 128 sex- and age- matched healthy controls.
      Serum ficolin-3 levels on admission were measured by sandwich immunoassays. It was postulated
      that serum ficolin-3 levels were correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale scores and ficolin-3 was
      identified as an independent prognostic predictor for 1-week mortality, 6-month mortality and
      6-month unfavorable outcome. Thus, it was proposed that lower serum ficolin-3 levels,
      correlated with injury severity reflected by Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, had the potential
      to be the useful, complementary tool to predict short- or long- term clinical outcome after
      severe traumatic brain injury.

      All blood samples from the patients at admission were collected in the tubes and centrifuged
      within 30 minutes at 1,000*g for 15 minutes. The serum was removed and frozen at -70°C until
      measurement.
