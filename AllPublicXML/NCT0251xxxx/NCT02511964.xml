    <textblock>
      The objective was to determine the effect of six running sessions of high intensity interval
      training (HIIT) at 1% and 10% incline on VO2max, peak of velocity (VPeak), and time limit of
      1% (TLim1%) and 10% (TLim10%) of inclination, as well as the influence of the specificity of
      training on performance in the different inclines.

      Our study is assuming greater activation / muscle overload coming from the uphill running.
      Accordingly, we believe that in a parallel-group design (1% or 10% gradient) established in
      controlled and randomized way we could answer the hypothesis that muscle overload provide
      superior gains to VO2max and aerobic performance. Moreover, considering the first hyphotesis,
      such developments on the running at 10% slope also promote significant gains in climb
      performance and also in the plan. Unlike the speculate that the gains from the 1% training
      does not help performance a 10% incline.
