    <textblock>
      Based on Good Post-marketing Study Practice (GPSP) regulation, general patient population
      with ischemic heart disease who are eligible for treatment with XIENCE PRIME SV Everolimus
      Eluting Stent will be registered, with no particular inclusion/exclusion criteria, and may be
      eligible for angiographic follow-up at eight months and clinical follow-up at one year.

Alternatively, contrast material clears from a segment distal to a stenosis noticeably more slowly than from a comparable segment not preceded by a significant stenosis; Grade 3: Anterograde flow into the terminal coronary artery segment through a stenosis is as prompt as anterograde flow into a comparable segment proximal to the stenosis. Contrast material clears as rapidly from the distal segment as from an uninvolved, more proximal segment.</description>

        General patient population with ischemic heart disease in Japan who are eligible for

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Patient informed consent is required for registration of this PMS. In cases where
             patient informed consent (or providing some type of information) is required for PMS
             per the participating site policy, the Sponsor will cooperate as needed.

          -  If it is known at the time of index procedure that the patient is not able to return
             for the 8-month follow-up visit for angiogram and for the 1-year clinical follow-up,
             then the patient should not be registered in the PMS.

          -  Patients who are treated (stent delivery system inserted into the body) by XIENCE
             PRIME SV will be registered (including provisional stenting for side branch treatment
             but excluding bail-out only use).

               -  The observations will be compiled on a per-patient basis even if multiple stents
                  are implanted during the index procedure.

               -  A patient whose side-branch is treated by XIENCE PRIME SV can be registered. In
                  such a case, main vessel should be treated by XIENCE PRIME.

               -  A patient who are treated by other drug eluting stent (DES) for planned stent and
                  XIENCE PRIME SV for bail-out purpose cannot be registered.

               -  Additional revascularization procedures as a part of adverse event treatment and
                  planned staged procedures will not be considered as another registration, or
                  adverse events.

               -  A patient who is treated, but failed to be implanted by XIENCE PRIME SV and
                  finally treated by other devices only (No XIENCE PRIME SV are implanted) must
                  also be registered. In such a case, only the stent information, device deficiency
                  information and reportable adverse events related to the PRIME stent, if any, are
                  required to be captured. Follow-up of the patient who does not receive any XIENCE
                  PRIME SV stent is not required.

          -  A patient may have another lesion(s) that may be treated by larger diameter stent(s).
             In such a case, treatment by XIENCE PRIME is preferable. Lesion(s) treated by other
             than XIENCE PRIME is not considered as the target lesion.
