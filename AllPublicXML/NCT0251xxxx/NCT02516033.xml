    <textblock>
      Recently a combined approach of surgeon ablation in combination with endocardial ablation
      (hybrid ablation) has been introduced. This therapy has shown excellent results in patients
      with previous failed endocardial ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as well in
      patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. The investigators hypothesize that the severity
      of atrial remodeling in patients with atrial fibrillation can be measured by clinical
      factors, echocardiographic parameters, circulating biomarkers and genetic background, and
      that these factors can be used to identify a risk profile to predict failure of the hybrid
      ablation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation. Aim of this study is to determine a
      risk profile based on clinical correlates, circulating biomarkers, and genetic background
      associated with failure of the hybrid ablation procedure, in a prospective single center
      registry setting. The investigators evaluate all consecutive patients who have agreed to
      undergo the hybrid ablation procedure because of atrial fibrillation. The investigators aim
      for a total of 250 participants. Extra study related procedures include blood sampling for
      biomarkers and genetic analysis, prolonged Holter monitoring for documentation of recurrences
      of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardias, and a quality of life
      questionnaire. Total follow-up will be five years.

      Main study endpoint is failure of the hybrid ablation procedure in patients with atrial
      fibrillation, i.e. any (a)symptomatic atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia
      &gt;30sec without anti-arrhythmic drugs at one year of follow-up by ECG recording and 3-day
      Holter monitoring.

      Rationale: The investigators hypothesize that the severity of atrial remodeling in patients
      with atrial fibrillation can be measured by clinical factors, echocardiographic parameters,
      circulating biomarkers and genetic background, and that these factors can be used to identify
      a risk profile to predict failure of the hybrid ablation therapy in patients with atrial
      fibrillation.

      Objective: To determine a risk profile based on clinical correlates, circulating biomarkers,
      and genetic background associated with failure of the hybrid ablation procedure in patients
      with atrial fibrillation.

      Study design: A prospective single center registry. Study population: Patients who have
      agreed to undergo the hybrid ablation procedure because of atrial fibrillation. The
      investigators aim for a total of 250 participants.

      Intervention: Extra study related procedures include blood sampling for biomarkers and
      genetic analysis at baseline and 1 year follow-up; prolonged Holter monitoring for
      documentation of recurrences of atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter/atrial tachycardias at 3
      months, 6 months and 1 year follow-up; and a quality of life questionnaire at baseline, and
      at 1 year and 5 year follow-up.

      Total follow-up duration: Five years. Main study endpoints: Failure of the hybrid ablation
      procedure in patients with atrial fibrillation, i.e. any (a)symptomatic atrial
      fibrillation/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia &gt;30sec without anti-arrhythmic drugs at one
      year of follow-up by ECG recording and 3-day Holter monitoring.
