  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive sitting time (sedentary time) has been associated with risk of insulin resistance
      and other factors which may be relevant to breast cancer prognosis. This 8-week study tests
      different strategies for helping breast cancer survivors to modify their levels of sitting
      time. Participants will be assigned with equal likelihood to one of three groups (1) overall
      reduction in sitting time, (2) interruption of sitting time with standing breaks, and (3)
      usual care.
