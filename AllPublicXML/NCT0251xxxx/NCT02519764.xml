      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a hydration protocol &quot;at
      thirst&quot; compared to other &quot;not at thirst&quot; hydration protocols on the changes in serum sodium
      in runners of the Ultra Trail Mont-Blanc (UTMB) in 2015.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To assess the relationship between hydration protocols and the dropout rate. B. To
      evaluate the correlation between body weight change before and after the race and serum
      sodium before and after the race.

      C. To evaluate the change in serum sodium into major types of conventional hydration
      protocols.

      D. To evaluate the incidence of adverse events (cramps, gastrointestinal symptoms, etc ...)
      depending on the hydration protocol and the serum sodium.
