  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POLYGYNAX® is a broad spectrum combination of nystatin, neomycin and polymixin B indicated
      for the local treatment of vaginitis due to sensitive germs and treatment of non specific
      vaginitis of adults. POLYGYNAX® has been marketed in France since 1969.

      Nevertheless, despite the well established use of POLYGYNAX®, there is no clinical study
      supporting the interest of the combinaison of antifungal and antibiotics agents versus
      antifungal agent alone.

      The aim of this project is to demonstrate that POLYGYNAX® is more effective than miconazole
      in the treatment of women experiencing symptoms of infectious vaginitis.

    <description>Success is defined by resolution (return to patient's usual gynaecological conditions, i.e. before the episode which warranted inclusion in the study) OR substantial improvement of clinical signs of infectious vaginitis (i.e. abnormal vaginal discharge), and/or vaginal symptoms (vaginal burning and/or vaginal pain, and/or vaginal irritation).
Failure is defined by persistence or worsening of symptoms and clinical signs or requirement of an alternative or specific treatment.
Not considered as &quot;Treatment Failure&quot;:
The need to initiate a specific treatment because of a STI (trichomoniasis; gonococcal and chlamydial infections) detected from the vaginal sample at Visit 1 / D1.
