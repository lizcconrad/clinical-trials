    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate acute low back pain, its origin, mechanisms, the
      cause of pain, evaluation of treatments and development. Employees from a large local
      manufacturing company are sent for a complete orthopedic and pain evaluation immediately
      after onset of acute low back pain. Thereafter, the included patients are allocated either to
      the advice to stay as active as possible in spite of the pain or to adjust their activity to
      the pain. Pain intensity and physical activity are followed prospectively over seven days
      using a diary and a pedometer.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate acute low back pain, its origin, mechanisms, the
      cause of pain, evaluation of treatments and development. Employees from a large local
      manufacturing company are sent for a complete orthopedic and pain evaluation immediately
      after onset of acute low back pain. The patients go through x-ray examinations, physical
      examinations, they complete a battery of questionnaires covering history of acute low back
      pain, lifestyle characteristics, work place factors, psychosocial factors, and indicate pain
      intensity and pain locations. Thereafter the patients are randomly allocated to one of two
      treatment advices: stay active as much as possible in spite of pain or adjust the activity to
      the pain. During seven days after the medical examination the patients wear a pedometer
      attached to the waist and annotate the number of steps and pain intensity, pain location and
      pain-related disability in a diary. A numeric graphic scale is used for pain intensity. Work
      absenteeism and sick leave due to the current acute back pain is collected from the company
      records. Immediate inclusion after pain onset is facilitated with continuous communication
      with the manufactory company. Physical activity and pain development over the seven days is
      investigated statistically using linear mixed models for repeated measures.
