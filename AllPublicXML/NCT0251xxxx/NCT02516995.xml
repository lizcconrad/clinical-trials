  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Merge the data of ultrasound with that of the anatomical and functional MRI is necessary
      since the high dose rate Curietherapy is carried out under ultrasound guidance. The
      investigators will recruit prostate cancer patients to evaluate the quality of the data,
      their sensitivity to exam conditions (patient position, volume of endorectal probe, gold
      grains implanted before intensity modulated radiotherapy , IMRT) and to merge data from
      different sources with the purpose of estimating the opportunities of integration treatment
      plan for Curietherapy broadband.

      The nuclear magnetic resonance imaging provides precise anatomical study, but also provides
      access to a functional approach to the tumor mapping of water diffusion coefficient (DW-MRI),
      for dynamic imaging with injection contrast agent (DCE-MRI) and finally by spectroscopic
      imaging (IRMS). This multimodality imaging project is part of a multidisciplinary context,
      involving close collaboration between clinicians, medical physicists, and physicists of the
      teams participating in this project (Institut Gustave Roussy and U2R2M-CIERM hospital
      Kremlin-Bicetre).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with prostate cancer biopsy-proven, intermediate or high risk (according to
        D'Amico Classification), for which radiotherapy is indicated.

          -  Accepting the imaging tests.

          -  Age &lt;70 years.

          -  Informed consent signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mental pathology that can interfere with the proper conduct of the study;

          -  Claustrophobia;

          -  Severe heart or respiratory disorder that can make it difficult to achieve relatively
             long imaging tests

          -  Contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

               1. pacemaker, other electronic appliance (depending on model);

               2. heart valve, intra-cranial clip aneurysm, cerebral ventricular bypass valve
                  (depending on model);

               3. intraocular metallic foreign bodies (chips), and other locations, according to
                  the site to discuss.

               4. metal tracheostomy cannula;

               5. endovascular stent or vascular embolization coils placed within six weeks in
                  advance;

               6. the impediments to a long examination with spectroscopy sequence of ten to twenty
                  minutes: major tremors, inability to lie more than 30 minutes;

               7. local sources of magnetic distortion which is sensitive spectroscopic imaging:
                  hip replacement, prostate biopsy older than six weeks.
