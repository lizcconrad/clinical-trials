      Acute respiratory infections are the fourth cause of hospitalization in elderly. Various
      studies have examined the impact of hospitalization in patients with respiratory pathology,
      showing the need of interventions in order to reduce the impact of hospitalization. The
      objective of this study is to examine whether a physical therapy intervention can reduce
      impairment in patients hospitalized due to pneumonia.

    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infections are the fourth cause of hospitalization in elderly. Hospital
      admissions due to pneumonia range from the 1.1 and 4 per 1,000 patients, increasing with age.
      Hospitalization causes a decline in physical and functional status. Physical impairment
      involves a higher risk of disability and mortality in elderly people. Various studies have
      examined the impact of hospitalization in patients with respiratory pathology, and it has
      been shown that hospitalization implies a significant physical impairment in patients
      admitted for pneumonia showing that this deterioration increases with age. That highlights
      the need of interventions in order to reduce the impact of hospitalization. The objective of
      this study is to examine whether a physical therapy intervention can reduce impairment in
      patients hospitalized due to pneumonia.

    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Quadriceps strength will be assessed with a portable dynamometer. The test will be performed as previously reported.</description>

    <measure>Exercise capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Five times sit to stand test (5STS) will be used to assess exercise capacity, 5STS is a simple assessment tool that is feasible in all healthcare settings, and may be a rapid method of assessing changes in exercise capacity in COPD and screening for poor physical functioning individuals.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory function</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is regarded as the gold standard measure of respiratory function. Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea perception</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea perception will be assessed with Borg modified scale. Patients will classify their breathlessness between 0 and 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days.</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) will be used to assess quality of life. EQ-5D is a generic questionnaire and consists of two parts, the EQ-5D Visual analogue scale (VAS) and the EQ-5D index. The EQ-5D VAS consists on a vertical rating scale from 0 to 100 (0 = death/worst possible health state and 100 = best possible health state). The EQ-5D index is a five-item questionnaire (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each item has three levels: no problem, some problem and severe problem.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The London Chest Activity of Daily Living (LCADL) is a valid tool that is validated to measure breathlessness during daily activities. It is a 15-item questionnaire divided in 4 domains: self-care (4 items), domestic (6 items) physical activity (2 items) and leisure (3 items).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The FSS is a nine-item instrument designed to assess fatigue as a symptom of a variety of different chronic conditions and disorders. The scale addresses fatigue's effects on daily functioning, querying its relationship to motivation, physical activity, work, family, and social life, and asking respondents to rate the ease with which they are fatigued and the degree to which the symptom poses a problem for them.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 8 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Mood in these patients will be measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dependency levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Dependency levels will be evaluated with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). It is an 18-item, 7-level scale developed to uniformly assess severity of patient disability and medical rehabilitation functional outcome.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Comorbidities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Charlson Comorbidity Index will be used to assess the comorbidities of the patients, it is a simple and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease. It contains 19 categories of comorbidity and predicts the ten-year mortality for a patient who may have a range of co-morbid conditions. Each condition is assigned with a score of 1, 2, 3 or 6 depending on the risk of dying associated with this condition.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Nutritional status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional status was evaluated with Mini nutritional assessment (MNA) test, that is validated to provide a single, rapid assessment of nutritional status in elderly patients in outpatient clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes. The MNA test is composed of simple measurements and brief questions that can be completed in about 10 min.</description>
