      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem
      Cell transplantation (AHSCT) for early severe or rapidly progressive Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)
      as currently performed by different study protocols used across Europe in various EBMT
      centres through the careful recording and analysis of routinely collected clinical and
      biological data.

    <textblock>
      Different protocols are used in the different centres, it is not yet clear which approach
      will be the most efficient and the safest. Every centre will follow its own local protocol
      for AHSCT which usually refers to the recent update of the EBMT Guidelines for HSCT in
      autoimmune disease. Patient selection for AHSCT treatment technique with regard to the
      risk/benefit balance has to be carefully addressed by standard patient pretransplant
      evaluation, whereas treatment local regimen, follow-ups evaluation, supportive medication and
      prophylaxis will be recorded and analysed.
