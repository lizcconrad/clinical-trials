  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a controlled and randomized, single-masked, crossover study in which 48 subjects
      will use the Biofinity Contact Lens (comfilcon A) with each of the two lens care products
      ('solutions'), (Synergi and Biotrue Multi-purpose Solution) for one month each. Follow-up
      visits for each solution will take place at one week, two weeks and four weeks: with a
      one-week 'wash-out' period between the solutions. Key outcome measures for this study include
      biomicroscopic and subjective responses to the lens/solution combinations.

             Statement of Informed Consent.

          3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

          4. They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of this
             study.

          5. They have a contact lens spherical prescription between - 0.50 to - 6.00 (inclusive)

          6. They have a spectacle cylindrical correction of -1.00D (Diopters) or less in each eye.

          7. At dispensing, they can attain at least 0.10 logMAR distance high contrast visual
             acuity in each eye with the study lenses within the available power range.

          8. They currently use silicone hydrogel soft contact lenses.

          9. They are willing to comply with the wear schedule (at least 5 days per week, ≥8
             hours/day).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          2. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          3. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

          4. They have had cataract surgery.

          5. They have had corneal refractive surgery.

          6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or
             have keratoconus.

          7. They are pregnant or lactating.

          8. They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

          9. They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic
             reaction.

         10. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.
