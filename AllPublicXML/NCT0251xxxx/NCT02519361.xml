  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging cause specific changes in the immune system. Processes like &quot;immunoessence&quot; and
      &quot;inflammaging&quot; offend the functioning of the immune cells and expose the elderly patient to
      infections that can lead to morbidity and death.

      Protein translation regulation offers a strategic advantage to the immune cells, because it
      enables rapid activation or termination of synthesis of specific proteins, required for
      inflammation or its resolution. Translation initiation depends on recruitment of eukaryotic
      initiation factor &quot;eIF4F&quot; complex.

      The aim of the current study is to investigate the involvement of the translation initiation
      factors (eIF4E and eIF4G) in the process of recovery from acute infection in elderly patient
      admitted to the internal department with an acute infection.

      1. Blood samples of elderly patients diagnosed with acute infection (fever and
           leukocytosis) will be collected twice - at admittance to Meir hospital and after
           recovery (24-48 hours without fever and leukocytosis). evidence of infection (chest x
           ray, urine and blood samples) will be collected. participants will be divided to two age
           groups: 65-80 yrs and very old patient &gt;85 yrs, and will be compared to younger patients
           aged 50-65.

        2. Peripheral blood samples will be separated to subpopulations of lymphocytes, monocytes
           and polymorphonuclears, and protein will be extracted.

        3. protein lysates will be separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotted for
           phosphorylated and total eIF4E and eIF4G; their regulators: Mnk 1/2, 4EBP1, mTOR and
           targets: cyclin D1, c-Myc, survivin, BCL2, VEGFA, etc.

        4. Paired samples (within each age group) will be analyzed and correlated with clinical
           response of the patients. The source of the infection will also be considered.

        5. Comparison between age groups at admittance and upon recovery will be made (Unpaired).
