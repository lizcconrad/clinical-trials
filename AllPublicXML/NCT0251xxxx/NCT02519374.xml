      The trial will be multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized with a 4-arm
      parallel-design. The subjects wil be randomized to one of the four arms, i.e. four doses of
      investigational product balanced in maltodextrin, given at the doses of 6, 9 or 12 g
      (corresponding to 4, 6, or 8 g of fibers) twice a day with the meals of the morning and of
      the evening versus control (maltodextrin, no fibers) over one week of intake.

      The total sample size is 40 healthy children from 8 to 12 years old, male and female.
