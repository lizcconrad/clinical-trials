  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system responsible
      for physical disability but can also cause cognitive disturbances annoying social and
      professional life of patients with the disease. Various studies have shown that there was a
      breach of episodic memory, working memory, attention and executive functions regardless of
      the form of disease, disability or duration of disease progression.

      The main objective of this study is to investigate the influence of emotional components and
      executive processes on the components retrograde and anterograde episodic memory (thanks to
      an original paradigm based on the emotional valence of the memory) in MS patients
