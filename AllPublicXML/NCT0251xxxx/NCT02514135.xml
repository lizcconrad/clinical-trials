  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to determine the incidence and prevalence of intra-abdominal
      hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome in consecutive intensive care admissions
      using broad inclusion criteria.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased pressure within the abdominal cavity is particularly common in intensive care
      patients and has been shown to be an independent risk-factor for mortality in this patient
      population. The quoted rates of intra-abdominal hypertension of range anywhere from 20-60%
      are dependent on the population of patient studied. The prospective observational studies
      performed to date have been underpowered, used strict inclusion/exclusion criteria or were
      performed prior to consensus guidelines on the definition and measurement of intra-abdominal
      pressure and hypertension.
