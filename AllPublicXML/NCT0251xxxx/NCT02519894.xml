      Introduction :

      Due to Chronic kidney disease is a public health problem, which is important increased in
      both developed and developing countries . And sodium intake restriction was related to the
      reduction of blood pressure and urine protein which is one of the important risk factor in
      chronic kidney disease. One of the problem in sodium restriction failure in Thai population
      with CKD nowadays is lack of knowledge and problem unawareness.

      The study hypothesis :

      Intense knowledge about sodium reduction and immediate feedback of the sodium intake could be
      simultaneously modifying the behavior to reduce sodium intake , blood pressure and also GFR
      reduction rate

      Objectives :

      To compare the effect of dietary salt restriction on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between
      CKD patients receiving strict controlled combined with immediate individual feedback (DISC
      Progrram) and those receiving standard education.

      Study design :

      Multicenter, open labeled, parallel, randomized controlled trial

      Sample size : 600

      Primary outcome : GFR reduction (CKD-EPI)

      Secondary outcome :

        -  Achievement rate of Na intake &lt; 2 g/day (Urine Na &lt; 90 mEq/day)

        -  Blood pressure difference

        -  Proportions of patients with BP reached the target (130/80 mmHg)

        -  Number of anti-hypertensive drugs use to achieve BP target

        -  Urine albumin/creatinine ratio

        -  Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)

        -  Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI)

        -  ankle-brachial index (ABI)

      Documentary Proof of Ethical Clearance :

      This project has been reviewed and approved by the Comittee on Human Rights Related to
      Research Involving Human Subjects , based on the declaration of Helsinki
