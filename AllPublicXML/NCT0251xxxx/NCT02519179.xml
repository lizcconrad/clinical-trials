    <textblock>
      The objective this research is to conduct a within-subject, experimental study that will
      describe mothers' feeding practices during typical bottle-feeding conditions and will examine
      whether removal of visual cues related to the amount of milk/formula in the bottle will alter
      these feeding practices. The investigators hypothesize that mothers will show higher levels
      of infant-directed feeding practices and lower levels of mother-directed feeding practices
      when using opaque, weighted bottles compared to when using standard, clear bottles. The
      investigators also hypothesize that infants will consume less breast milk or formula when fed
      from opaque, weighted bottles compared to when fed from standard, clear bottles.
