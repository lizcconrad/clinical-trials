      Phase II multicenter, Canadian only study - open to 25 subjects. Study open to subjects with
      steroid-refractory or dependent chronic graft vs host disease.

      Series of 6 aphereses and 28 re-infusions over 24 weeks. Primary endpoint is FFS at 24 weeks.
      Primary objective is to measure the efficacy of CARE (Continuous Alloreactive T-Cell
