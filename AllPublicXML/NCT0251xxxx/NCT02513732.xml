      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of XIENCE Xpedition
      Everolimus-Eluting 2.25mm Stent in real world practice in Japanese hospitals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on Good Post-marketing Study Practice (GPSP) regulation, general patient population
      with ischemic heart disease who are eligible for treatment with XIENCE Xpedition
      Everolimus-Eluting 2.25mm Stent will be registered, with no particular inclusion/exclusion
      criteria, and may be eligible for angiographic follow-up at eight months and clinical
      follow-up at one year.

      The XIENCE Xpedition 2.25 mm stent is composed of the stent identical to the stent of the
      XIENCE PRIME SV Stent.Therefore, the data collected from the PMS will be pooled with data
      collected from the ongoing XIENCE PRIME SV PMS for analysis.

Alternatively, contrast material clears from a segment distal to a stenosis noticeably more slowly than from a comparable segment not preceded by a significant stenosis; Grade 3: Anterograde flow into the terminal coronary artery segment through a stenosis is as prompt as anterograde flow into a comparable segment proximal to the stenosis. Contrast material clears as rapidly from the distal segment as from an uninvolved, more proximal segment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Patient informed consent is required for registration of this PMS. In cases where
             patient informed consent (or providing some type of information) is required for PMS
             per the participating site policy, the Sponsor will cooperate as needed.

          -  If it is known at the time of index procedure that the patient is not able to return
             for the 8-month follow-up visit for angiogram and for the 1-year clinical follow-up,
             then the patient should not be registered in the PMS.

          -  Patients who are attending or will attend other PMS with invasive medical procedure
             will not be registered.

          -  Patients who are treated by XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent will be registered.

               -  The observations will be compiled on a per-patient basis even if multiple XIENCE
                  Xpedition 2.25mm stents are implanted during the index procedure.

               -  A patient whose side-branch is treated by XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent can be
                  registered. In such a case, main vessel should be treated by XIENCE Xpedition.

               -  The observations will not be compiled on a per-patient basis if a patient is
                  treated by XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent overlapped with other stents for
                  bail-out purpose.

               -  Additional revascularization procedures as a part of adverse event treatment and
                  planned staged procedures will not be considered as another registration, or
                  adverse events.

               -  A patient who is treated, but failed to be implanted by XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm
                  stent and finally treated by other devices only (No XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent
                  are implanted) must also be registered. In such a case, only the stent
                  information, device deficiency information and reportable adverse events related
                  to the Xpedition stent, if any, are required to be captured. Follow-up of the
                  patient who does not receive any XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent is not required.

          -  A patient may have another lesion(s) that may be treated by larger diameter (≥ 2.5mm)
             stent(s). In such a case, treatment by XIENCE Xpedition is preferable. Lesion(s)
             treated by other than XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent is not considered as the target
             lesion.
