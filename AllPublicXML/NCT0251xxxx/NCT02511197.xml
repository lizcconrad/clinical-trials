    <textblock>
      This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to
      investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 in lung
      injury (LI) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) patients. A single dose of nearly 111 MBq
      68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 (≤ 40 µg NOTA-PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into patients with LI/PF.
      Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.

    <textblock>
      The αvβ3-integrin is a transmembrane heterodimeric receptor that mediates cell-cell and
      cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. The αvβ3-integrin plays a pivotal role in promoting and
      sustaining angiogenesis and fibrosis. Cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide is
      the key integrin recognition motif that can strongly bind to the αvβ3-integrin, which makes
      the RGD-based peptides hold a promise for imaging and treatment of diseases characterised
      with angiogenesis and fibrosis including LI and PF.

      Animal study in bleomycin induced lung fibrosis showed good uptake ratio of 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2
      in lung vs background. For interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2, an
      open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT study was designed to investigate safety and diagnostic
      performance of 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 in patients with LI or PF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

          -  Males and females, ≥18 years old.

          -  Characteristic clinical signs, symptoms and laboratory tests suggesting the diagnosis
             of LI/PF.

          -  The diagnosis of IPF is based on The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
             criteria for diagnosing LI/PF. They rely on a combination of clinical, radiological,
             operative and histological findings, in addition to results of other laboratory tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females planning to bear a child recently or with childbearing potential.

          -  Renal function: serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL (270 μM/L).

          -  Liver function: any hepatic enzyme level more than 5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to IV radiographic contrast.

          -  Patients not able to enter the bore of the PET/CT scanner.

          -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time because of cough, pain, etc.

          -  Inability to complete the needed examinations due to severe claustrophobia, radiation
             phobia, etc.

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable other medical disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance.
