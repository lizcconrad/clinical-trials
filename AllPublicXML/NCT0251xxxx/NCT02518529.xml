  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, multicenter study to assess 250µg/0.2ml G17DT injection at weeks 0, 2 and 6. At
      or after week 20 and up to and including week 44. Subjects who raised antibodies to G17DT
      were given an additional dose of 125µg/0.1ml or 250µg/0.2ml G17DT between weeks 20-44 (study
      duration 52 weeks).

          -  Male or female patients over 18 years of age.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of at least four months.

          -  Karnofsky index for performance status of &gt;70%

          -  Patients must have given written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Gastric or junctional surgery within three weeks of baseline (week 0) or gastric or
             junctional surgery anticipated in the study period.

          -  History of other malignant disease within the previous five years, except
             non-melanomatous skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

          -  Previous use (within the six weeks prior to the screening visit of the study),
             concomitant use, or anticipated use (up to week 16), of chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

          -  Previous use (within the six weeks prior to the screening visit of the study),
