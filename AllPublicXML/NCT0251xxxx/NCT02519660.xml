  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Needle-related procedures are among the most common sources of pain and distress for children
      in the health care setting. More than 50% of children reported pain during these procedures.
      The necessity for pain management during these procedures is well established. Topical
      anesthesia has been shown to be effective in managing needle-related pain. Eutectic mixture
      of local anaesthetic (EMLA) cream is the topical anesthetic most used. The application of
      this mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine reduce pain during needle procedures in children. To
      be effective EMLA cream must be applied for at least 60 minutes before needle procedure. This
      is the major limitation for its use in emergency settings.

      Ralydan patch is a drug delivery system designed to release local anaesthetics (lidocaine and
      tetracaine) through the skin. There is evidence of pain relief after 30 minutes from its
      application. Only one randomized controlled trial compared the two topical anaesthetics in
      children during venipuncture and showed that Ralydan patch led to superior analgesia than
      EMLA cream, even if in this study the two anaesthetics were applied only for 35 minutes
      before needle procedure. No differences were found in success rate of the procedure and vein
      visibility. In adult patients, Ralydan and EMLA were equally effective in pain relief after
      60 minutes from application.

      To the best of the investigators' knowledge there is no published study that compared needle
      procedure success rate in children and pain relief effectiveness of lidocaine/tetracaine
      patch and lidocaine/prilocaine cream, at time of their maximum analgesic effect.

      The aim of this study is to compare Ralydan patch and EMLA cream at time of their maximum
      analgesic effect (30 minutes vs 60 minutes), regard to needle procedure success rate at the
      first attempt and pain relief in children.
