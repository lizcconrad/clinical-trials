    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate technetium-99m (99mTc) pertechnetate produced by a
      cyclotron as a replacement for 99mTc pertechnetate obtained from a generator containing the
      parent isotope Molybdenum-99 (99Mo). 99mTc pertechnetate is currently used in nuclear
      medicine departments across the country. 99Mo is produced by a number of ageing nuclear
      reactors across the world and severe shortages of the isotope have occurred in the past few
      years. Cyclotron-produced 99mTc offers an alternative decentralized production method on a
      regional basis. Since the manufacturing process is different, the safety and efficacy of
      cyclotron-produced 99mTc pertechnetate must be evaluated in human subjects to enable its
      routine clinical use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  WHO performance status 0-2

          -  Older than the age of majority in the province where the study is performed, and be
             able to consent to the project

          -  Ambulatory and able to lie supine for the duration of the examination.

          -  Able and willing to return for a subsequent visit within 7 days to undergo a repeat
             examination and participate in a follow-up phone call to monitor for adverse events.
