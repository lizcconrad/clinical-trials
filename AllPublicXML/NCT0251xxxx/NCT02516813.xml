  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MSC2490484A or M3814 is an investigational drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of
      subjects with locally advanced tumors. The main purposes of this study are to determine the
      safety, the tolerability and the efficacy of MSC2490484A in combination with radiotherapy and
      in combination with chemoradiotherapy (Radiotherapy + cisplatin).

          -  Subjects currently receiving (or unable to stop using prior to receiving the first
             dose of study drug) medications or herbal supplements known to be potent inhibitors of
             CYP3A or CYP2C19 must stop at least 1 week prior to taking MSC2490484A. Subjects
             receiving potent inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C19 must stop at least 3 weeks prior to
             taking MSC2490484A. Those receiving drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A with a narrow
             therapeutic index as judged by the Investigator (and after optional consultation with
             the Sponsor) must stop at least one day prior to taking MSC2490484A.
