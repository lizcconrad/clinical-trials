  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether sitagliptin (Januvia is the brand name for
      sitagliptin) reduces inflammation and immune activation markers in HIV-infected men and women
      when compared to a placebo (inactive medication like a dummy pill). The study evaluated
      whether taking 100 mg of sitagliptin by mouth daily for 16 weeks is safe and effective for
      HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who do not have diabetes. Sitagliptin is
      a medication that is used to treat people with diabetes (high blood sugar) but also may
      reduce inflammation in the body.

      ACTG A5346 is a phase II, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, trial of
      sitagliptin 100 mg vs. placebo for 16 weeks followed by a 4-week post-intervention follow-up.
      A5346 studied whether sitagliptin reduced plasma concentrations of sCD14 in HIV-infected men
      and women ≥18 years of age who were on suppressive ART with HIV-1 RNA below the limit of
      quantification at screening and for at least the prior 48 weeks. Participants were randomized
      1:1 to Sitagliptin arm vs. Placebo arm, and were stratified by screening CD4 count (100-350
      vs. &gt;350 cells/mm^3) and statin use (on statins vs. not on statins).

    <time_frame>Week 0, week 15, week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Level of CD4+ T-cell activation was determined by measuring the percentage of cells that expressed both the activation marker CD38+ and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+.
The endpoint is measuring the change from week 0 to week 15 (week 15 - week 0) and change from week 15 to week 20 (week 20 - week 15).
Data for cellular markers are not available as of December 2017. These data are based on immunology assays which were tested in batch to minimize variability. Due to batch testing, shipment of samples for testing could not begin until after the study follow-up completion, which was 1 month after the primary complete date. Please note that these secondary outcomes were not included in the primary analyses. There are many outcomes in this study and the immunology lab had to give priority to the assays planned to be included in the primary manuscript. Results will be entered once the data is complete and analyzed.</description>

        <description>Level of CD4+ T-cell activation was determined by measuring the percentage of cells that expressed both the activation marker CD38+ and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+.
The endpoint is measuring the change from week 0 to week 15 (week 15 - week 0) and change from week 15 to week 20 (week 20 - week 15).
Data for cellular markers are not available as of December 2017. These data are based on immunology assays which were tested in batch to minimize variability. Due to batch testing, shipment of samples for testing could not begin until after the study follow-up completion, which was 1 month after the primary complete date. Please note that these secondary outcomes were not included in the primary analyses. There are many outcomes in this study and the immunology lab had to give priority to the assays planned to be included in the primary manuscript. Results will be entered once the data is complete and analyzed.</description>
