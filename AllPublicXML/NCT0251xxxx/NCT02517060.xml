  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators measure brain responses of healthy participants while they perform
      evaluation tasks inside the fMRI. For each task the participants were primed with tactile
      stimuli. Results should demonstrate engagement of sensorimotor brain regions after priming,
      hence confirming embodiment theories.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain responses of healthy participants were recorded with functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI). While being scanned participants were asked to recommend punishments similar
      to judges or juries for perpetrators across different scenarios. In addition, participants
      were primed before reading the scenario by using different materials. Based on recent
      theories about &quot;embodied cognition&quot; and extralegal factors investigators hypothesize that
      those primes may influence the harshness of punishments recommended by the participants. If
      those processes engage sensorimotor cortices, the results would strongly support theories of
      embodied cognition.

      The results would help the investigators to understand the neural correlates of priming
      processes. These unconscious complex processes of perception may be important for hospital
      patients. Thus, beneficial haptic experiences during the hospital stay may contribute to
      successful recovery.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to examine neural correlates for embodied cognitions. We use an fMRI-approach to test if healthy participants are prone to non-conscious tactile priming effects during evaluation processes. Investigators measure the outcome by examining BOLD Response in the sensorimotor cortices (Maximum Peak in Primary somatosensory Cortex, SI). BOLD Responses will be analyzed using the Software SPM 8.</description>

    <description>1. We examine if tactile priming leads to systematic behavioral changes for evaluation processes. During the fMRI participants were asked to read scenarios and subsequently perform evaluation processes on a likert scale 0 to 5 (0 = mild punishment; 5 = hard punishment) .</description>
