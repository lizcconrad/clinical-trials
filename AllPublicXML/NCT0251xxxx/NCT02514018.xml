    <textblock>
      The re-activating nature of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) may allow life long boosting when
      used as a vaccine vector in conjunction with HIV to generate durable immunity systemically
      and at the mucosa. This study aims to characterize mucosal immunity before and after
      vaccination with a commercial live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine with respect to
      immune activation state, mucosal homing properties and VZV-specific effector immune responses
      in healthy women at low risk for HIV acquisition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An ideal HIV vaccine should be able to induce an effector specific immune response at the
      mucosal site which serves as the portal of HIV entry. The use of a persistent replicating
      viral vector such as Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) has great potential to assemble this
      specific response. Live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus has been used as a vaccine
      worldwide for over 25 years and has a well-described safety profile. However, its
      immunogenicity data in the African population are lacking.

      The general objective of this study will be to measure the magnitude and kinetics of the
      effector immune response and immune activation induced by live-attenuated varicella-zoster
      virus vaccine in a population of Kenyan women. Specifically, the study will measure immune
      activation in both cervical and rectal mucosae in the context of VZV-effector responses after
      vaccination and compare the observed immune activation in mucosal tissues and in blood.

      A total of 44 healthy women in Nairobi, aged 18-50 years will be recruited into the study,
      after obtaining their written informed consent. Eligibility to participate in the study will
      depend on results of laboratory tests, review of medical history, physical examination and
      answers to questions about HIV risk behaviours.

      The study will assess immune responses to both immediate and delayed administration of
      live-attenuated virus varicella-zoster vaccine in VZV-seropositive individuals. Participants
      will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Group 1 will receive a single dose of the vaccine at
      day 0 and Group 2 at day 84. The participants will be followed for a period of 9-12 months
      after receiving the vaccine.
