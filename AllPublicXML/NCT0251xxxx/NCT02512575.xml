  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human (FIH), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single
      ascending dose sequential group study in healthy male subjects. The objectives are to study
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effects on glucose homeostasis
      (pharmacodynamics) of AZD9567, an oral differentiated non-steroidal selective glucocorticoid
      receptor modulator (SGRM). The study will also assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of prednisolone 60 mg in comparison with high
      doses of AZD9567 and placebo.

      This is a Phase I, first-in-human (FIH), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single
      ascending dose sequential group study in healthy male subjects. The objectives are to study
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effects on glucose homeostasis
      (pharmacodynamics) of AZD9567. Additional exploratory variables (Inflammation biomarkers, ECG
      modelling and taste assessment) will also be evaluated. The study will also assess the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of prednisolone 60 mg
      in comparison with high doses of AZD9567 and placebo. The study will be conducted at a single
      study centre with a planned number of subjects of up to 72 healthy males, aged 18 to 55
      years.

             considered by the investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc
             interval changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the
             protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy.

          -  Prolonged QTcF &gt; 450 ms or family history of long QT syndrome.

          -  PR(PQ) interval shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there
