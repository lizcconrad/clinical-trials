  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of combined dextroamphetamine
      (Dexedrine) and transcranial direct current stimulation with melodic intonation therapy for
      treatment of aphasia after stroke. The target population is patients with chronic speech
      deficits due to a left hemisphere non-hemorrhagic stroke. Findings from this proposed project
      will help in the design of future larger studies.The safety phase will use cross-over,
      placebo controlled and single-blinded design. 10 participants with post stroke chronic
      non-fluent aphasia will undergo two experiments. To study the safety and effect of combined
      dextroamphetamine, tDCS and MIT therapy the study will use a parallel-groups, randomized,
      sham and placebo controlled, and double-blinded design in which 48 participants with post
      stroke chronic non-fluent aphasia will be randomly assigned to receive either 1)
      dextroamphetamine therapy with active stimulation, 2) placebo medication with active
      stimulation, 3) dextroamphetamine therapy with sham stimulation or 4) placebo medication with
      sham stimulation for the same duration.

      The safety phase will use cross-over, placebo controlled and single-blinded design. 10
      participants with post stroke chronic non-fluent aphasia will undergo two experiments. In the
      experiment 1, the subjects will receive 10 mg dextroamphetamine, 1.5 mA anodal tDCS to right
      inferior frontal gyrus (right Broca's area), and melodic intonation therapy. The two
      experiments of one time intervention will be separated by 1 week of washout and when the
      subjects come back for experiment 2, any later side effects will be evaluated. In the
      experiment 2, the subjects will receive placebo medication with anodal tDCS to right IFG
      (Broca's area) and melodic intonation therapy. During the experiments, thirty minutes before
      stimulation, participants in the active drug experiment (n=10) will take 10 mg
      dextroamphetamine per oral -experiment 1- and participants in the placebo drug experiment
      will take placebo pill per oral -experiment 2-. During the 20 minute stimulation phase, the
      participants (n=10) will receive anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) on ipsilesional right inferior frontal
      gyrus (Broca's area). All participants will simultaneously receive melodic intonation therapy
      for duration of an hour during and after 20 minutes of stimulation.

      To study the safety and effect of combined dextroamphetamine, tDCS and MIT therapy the study
      will use a parallel-groups, randomized, sham and placebo controlled, and double-blinded
      design in which 48 participants with post stroke chronic non-fluent aphasia will be randomly
      assigned to receive either 1) dextroamphetamine therapy with active stimulation, 2) placebo
      medication with active stimulation, 3) dextroamphetamine therapy with sham stimulation or 4)
      placebo medication with sham stimulation for the same duration. The subjects from the
      previous step of the study will be asked to participate to this step. Thirty minutes before
      stimulation participants in the active drug groups, group 1 (n=12) and group 3 (n=12) will
      take dextroamphetamine 10 mg per oral and participants in the placebo groups, group 2 (n=12)
      and group 4 (n=12) will take placebo pill per oral. During the 20 minute stimulation phase,
      the participants in the active stimulation groups, groups 1 (n=12) and 2 (n=12) will receive
      anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) on right inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), and participants in the
      sham control groups, group 3 (n=12) and group 4 (n=12) will receive sham stimulation. All
      participants will simultaneously receive melodic intonation therapy for duration of an hour
      during and after 20 minutes of stimulation. Treatment will be administered at an intensity of
      5 sessions per week for 2 weeks.
