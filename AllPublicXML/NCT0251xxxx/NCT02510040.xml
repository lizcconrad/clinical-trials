    <description>In the convergence insufficiency group, the primary outcome will be symptom success at the 10-week and 12-month visit, defined as improvement of CI Symptom Survey (CISS) score of at least 9 points and an outcome score of &lt;21 points.

In the small-angle hypertropia group, the primary outcome will be symptom success at the 10-week and 12-month visit, defined as diplopia &quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot; both in primary position at distance and in reading position on the diplopia questionnaire.</description>
