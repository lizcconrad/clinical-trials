      A follow-on, two-year open-label extension study of ganaxolone as add-on therapy in adult
      patients with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 2-year, open-label continuation for those patients benefiting from ganaxolone
      treatment after completing Protocol 1042-0603.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Ganaxolone missed its primary endpoint in the double-blind portion of the 1042-0603 study. Due
    to this outcome Marinus discontinued this extension study.

             frequency over the last three 28-day periods in study 1042-603 as compared to the
             baseline of study 1042-603.

          -  Subjects whose daily study drug compliance in Study 1042-0603 was 90% or greater, and
