  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the way the antidepressant concentration (amount of
      medication) in the blood changes due to the physiological changes in the body (i.e., changes
      in metabolism, hormones and body fluid) during pregnancy and postpartum and the impact of
      genetic factors on the degree of these changes. Changes in antidepressant concentration are
      important to monitor, as decreases in antidepressant concentration may lead to less than
      therapeutic drug levels, which may cause an increase in mood symptoms or recurrence of
      depressive episodes. Increases in antidepressant concentration have the potential to lead to
      increased side effects. The study team is hoping to better understand the course of these
      changes across pregnancy and postpartum and how an individual's genetic makeup impacts these
      changes with the goal of developing guidelines to optimize antidepressant treatment of
      pregnant women.

      The overarching goal of this NICHD-funded U54 Obstetric-Fetal Pharmacology Research Center
      study is to develop evidence to construct guidelines for the optimal use of selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants in pregnant women. The progressive
      changes in plasma SSRI and metabolite concentrations across pregnancy and after birth will be
      determined in an observational study. Serial evaluations of depressive and anxiety symptoms
      and side effects will be obtained to evaluate their association with plasma concentrations at
      monthly intervals during pregnancy and twice post-birth. To assess the subjects' metabolic
      phenotypes, subjects have the option to receive a probe drug cocktail, which will be given to
      evaluate the activities of enzymes involved in antidepressant metabolism during the third
      trimester (when activity change is maximal) compared to the non-pregnant state after birth.

      Additionally, the study team will investigate the impact of genomic variability on
      inter-individual differences in SSRI dosing, plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamics
      during pregnancy, with a focus on genes involved in the metabolism and elimination of SSRIs,
      drug transporters responsible for SSRI access to the central nervous system, and genes
      encoding critical SSRI targets involved in therapeutic efficacy.

      Finally, the study team will determine the maternal-fetal plasma concentrations and
      pharmacogenetic characteristics associated with neonatal SSRI abstinence syndrome. Maternal
      and fetal genotypes will be assessed for their relationship to SSRI drug concentrations and
      neonatal abstinence syndrome.
