  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanical ventilation strategy has changed over years worldwide. Several international
      researches have been conducted to study the association of the use of mechanical ventilation
      with clinical outcomes. In this prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional survey, the
      practice of mechanical ventilation among patients with severe brain injury will be
      investigated in 70 intensive care units in China.
