  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of
      three different formulations of ranibizumab delivered via RPDS implant compared with the
      standard of care (SOC) intravitreal (ITV) injections of ranibizumab, in participants with
      subfoveal neovascular AMD.

          -  Demonstrated response to prior ITV anti-VEGF treatment

          -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
             (ETDRS) charts of 20/20-20/200 Snellen equivalent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with ITV anti-VEGF agents other than ranibizumab within 1 month prior to the
             randomization visit in either eye

          -  Study eye treatment with ITV anti-VEGF agents other than ranibizumab within 1 month
             prior to the randomization visit

          -  History of laser photocoagulation, Visudyne®, ITV corticosteroid injection, vitrectomy
             surgery, submacular surgery, device implantation, or other surgical intervention for
             AMD in the study eye

          -  Prior participation in a clinical trial involving anti-angiogenic drugs, other than
             ranibizumab, in either eye within 2 months of the randomization visit

          -  Subretinal hemorrhage in the study eye that involves the center of the fovea

          -  Subfoveal fibrosis, or atrophy in the study eye

          -  Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in either eye due to other causes, such as ocular
             histoplasmosis, trauma, or pathologic myopia

          -  Uncontrolled ocular hypertension or glaucoma in the study eye

          -  History of glaucoma-filtering surgery, tube shunts, or microinvasive glaucoma surgery

             consent

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of ranibizumab or placement of the Implant, that might affect
             interpretation of the results of the study or renders the participant at high risk of
             treatment complications

          -  Use of oral corticosteroids

          -  Current treatment for any active systemic infection

          -  Use of anticoagulants, anti-platelets (other than aspirin), or medications known to
             exert similar effects

          -  Active malignancy within 12 months of randomization

          -  History of allergy to fluorescein

          -  Previous participation in any non-ocular (systemic) disease studies of investigational
