  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a behavioral teacher program
      addressing symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in the classroom.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Most behavioral teacher programs involve intensive and expensive teacher trainings by health
      care specialists, which may limit successful large-scale implementation. This behavioral
      program, on the contrary, involves a self-containing manual that does not require expert
      training in order to increase the likelihood of successful implementation (if proven
      effective). The aim was to investigate the program's effects on behavioral, socio-emotional
      and school functioning in primary school children.

      Methods:

      Children with ADHD symptoms were randomly assigned at school level to the intervention
      condition (receiving the program during 18 weeks) or control group (not receiving the program
      but who were allowed to receive care as usual).

      Measures to assess program's effectiveness:

        -  Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD-symptoms and Normal Behavior,

        -  Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire

        -  Social Skills Rating Scale

        -  Spence Children's Anxiety Scale

        -  Classroom Observation Code

        -  Actigraphy

        -  Sociometric measures (peer nomination and peer rating)

        -  Dutch arithmetic test (Tempo-Test-Rekenen)

        -  reading test (Drie-Minuten-Toets) and writing test (PI-dictee).

      Additional measures:

        -  Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Block Design and Vocabulary; used to estimate
           IQ);

        -  Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire and several
           neuropsychological computer tasks
