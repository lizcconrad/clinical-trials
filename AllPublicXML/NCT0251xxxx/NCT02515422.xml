      Aim: To assess the analgesic efficacy of subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine, either alone
      or as an adjuvant to bupivacaine, following CS and to compare their effects on postoperative
      pain scores and opioid consumption.

      Methods: Included patients were allocated to four treatment groups using computer-generated
      randomization number chart as follows; Group 1 (Ketamine, n=30) received subcutaneous
      infiltration of ketamine, Group 2 (Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of
      bupivacaine 0.5%, Group 3 (Ketamine+Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of
      ketamine+bupivacaine 0.5% and Group 4 (Placebo, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of
      placebo (0.9% saline solution). Patients, anesthetist, surgeon, and other medical and nursing
      staff were blinded to the contents of the medications. VAS scores at resting and on coughing
      and analgesic consumptions were compared.

      the Group 1 (Ketamine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of ketamine 1 mg/kg
      (Ketalar®, 10 mL inj., 50 mg ketamine hydrochloride/ml, Pfizer Drug Company, USA). The Group
      2 (Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of 20 mL (100 mg) of bupivacaine
      0.5% (Marcaine®, 20 mL inj. 5 mg bupivacaine hydrochloride/ml, AstraZeneca Drug Company,
      Turkey). The Group 3 (Ketamine+Bupivacaine, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of
      ketamine 1 mg/kg (Ketalar®) plus subcutaneous infiltration of 20 mL (100 mg) of bupivacaine
      0.5% (Marcaine®). The Group 4 (Placebo, n=30) received subcutaneous infiltration of 30 mL
      placebo (0.9% saline solution). All medications were diluted with sterile 0.9% saline
      solution to 30 ml solutions in the similar volume and shape syringes and were infiltrated
      subcutaneously along the skin wound edges and close to the fascia prior to skin closure.
      There were four separate syringes which were prepared by an anesthesiology technician for
      four different treatment groups labeled G1, G2, G3 and G4 containing the ketamine,
      bupivacaine, ketamine plus bupivacaine and normal saline solution. Patients, anesthetist,
      surgeon, and other medical and nursing staff were blinded to the contents of the medications.
