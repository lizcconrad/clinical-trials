  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endovascular therapy prevailed in nearly all regions of peripheral artery disease over
      open surgery techniques. However, in treatment of the common femoral artery vascular surgery
      is still the gold standard of therapy. One-year patency rates are between 90% and 95%. Today,
      only in selected cases an endovascular procedure for common femoral artery diseases is
      recommended.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of directional atherectomy
      and drug-coated balloon angioplasty over vascular surgery in common femoral artery lesions in
      a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial.

      Multicenter, prospective, randomized study to be conducted in centers in Europe. A total of
      260 subjects will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either
      directional atherectomy and drug coated balloon angioplasty (optional with
      stentimplantation), and surgical endarterectomy for treatment in symptomatic
      (Rutherford-Becker class 2 to 4) common femoral artery disease. All subjects will undergo
      repeat duplex-ultrasound measurements 6, 12, and 24 months to assess the primary endpoint of
      Binary Restenosis. Follow-up visits are scheduled 6, 12, and 24 months.
