  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anthocyanins are the most common polyphenols in berries and red wine, along with other
      flavonoids, phenolic acids, minerals and vitamins. Anthocyanins are extensively metabolized
      and they are transformed into glucuronides and phenolic acids. The investigators have
      recently shown that the acute consumption of blueberries leads to an increase in
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation measured as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in young male
      volunteers. There were significant correlations of these effects with the plasma
      concentration of phenolic acids and anthocyanin metabolites. Therefore, the present study
      aims at understanding to which extent the anthocyanins contained in berries are related with
      positive effects in endothelial function. A large part of the absorbed anthocyanin circulate
      in the blood in as methyl, glucuronyl and sulfate metabolites, as well as phenolic acids. The
      formation of these metabolites begins right as early as 2h after consumption due to
      metabolism at the small intestine and a second plasmatic peak occurs around 6h due the
      metabolism of colonic bacteria. Whether and which metabolites are associated with biological
      effects and the mechanisms underlying this effect remains unclear.
