  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition caused by gastrointestinal immune system
      dysregulation and affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Differences in
      intestinal bacteria exist between IBD patients and healthy controls, but the role of
      intestinal bacteria in the development and treatment of IBD remains largely unknown. Fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of gastrointestinal bacteria from a healthy
      donor to a patient with altered microbial diversity with the intent of restoring a normal
      bacterial balance. Most studies focus on its use in treating Clostridium difficile (CDI), an
      infection characterized by dysbiosis. Given the role of dysbiosis in IBD, the investigators
      hypothesize that FMT may be beneficial in IBD. The purpose of this study is to prospectively
      examine the safety of FMT in the management of ulcerative colitis (UC).

    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with significant
      morbidity and mortality. Current therapies remain limited by side effects and loss of
      response over time, and there is an ongoing need for new therapies. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT), which has proven to be safe and effective in the management of
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been proposed as a therapy for UC. There have been
      studies examining the role of FMT in UC, but they have shown mixed results, and have not
      examined the underlying immunologic and microbial changes to explain how and why FMT works
      from specific donors and in certain recipients. Furthermore, no studies have examined the
      long-term safety of FMT in patients with UC. This proposal aims to examine: (a) the short-
      and long-term safety of FMT in patients with UC, (b) the efficacy of FMT as a therapy for
      mild-moderate UC, and (c) the microbial and immunologic changes that occur after FMT, to help
      understand how and why it works in this group of patients.

    <description>Patient information regarding adverse events and safety of FMT for UC will be collected throughout the study period, including day 0, weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 24, and then every 6 months until 36 months post-FMT. Throughout the study period, patients will be assessed for safety with questions regarding general well-being (such as &quot;how have you been feeling?&quot;), as well as specific questions to evaluate for occurrence of adverse events. Patients will also be questioned regarding stool form and frequency, presence of abdominal pain, fevers and subjective well-being.</description>
