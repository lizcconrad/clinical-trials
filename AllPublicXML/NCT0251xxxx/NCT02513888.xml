    <textblock>
      PREVENT-WIN study has three components.

      The work plan will have the following S&amp;T components. Component 1: Cross-sectional Study

      Cross-sectional study will be of 1.5 years where 400 women from rural will be screened
      randomly for the vitamin D deficiency and its determinants including duration of sun
      exposure.

      Component 2: Prospective Study

      This open-label randomized placebo-controlled trial would be done in 150 pre-diabetic women
      with vitamin D deficiency. The women will be recruited from cross-sectional study, out
      patient department and health camps and they will be followed up for 2 years. The women will
      be randomized into two groups; lifestyle modification counseling along with intervention with
      either vitamin D or placebo. The levels of vitamin D and blood glucose will be assessed
      periodically (every 6 months). In those having recurrent vitamin D deficiency, the course of
      vitamin D will be repeated. At the end of the study, incidence of T2DM in both groups will be
      compared.

      Component 3: Information Education and Communication (IEC) Activities:

      There is a paucity of IEC material on vitamin D deficiency in women residing in rural areas.
      IEC material will be developed and IEC activities through various modes like lectures,
      workshops, group discussions, leaflets/booklets distribution and audio video media shows
      (Hindi and English) will be used for educating health professionals, Medical and paramedical
      workers and various village level health functionaries like, Multi purpose workers, anganwadi
      workers, Accredited Social Health Activist under National Rural Health Mission of Government
      of India (ASHA). Besides this, Self Help Groups (SHGs) and women will be told about the
      benefits of balance diet, dietary intake of calcium, vitamin D, benefits of sun exposure and
      adverse health effects of vitamin D deficiency.
