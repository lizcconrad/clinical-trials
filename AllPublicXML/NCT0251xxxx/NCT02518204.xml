  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the concurrent validity between the Brain
      Performance Test (BPT) subtests and corresponding conventional in-person neuropsychological
      assessments (NP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-site, randomized, counterbalanced, two-period, two-sequence, validation
      study of the online, unsupervised Brain Performance Test (BPT). Over the course of 14 days,
      participants will complete two in-clinic visits during which they will complete both the BPT
      and in-person neuropsychological assessments (NP).
