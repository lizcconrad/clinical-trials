  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Profound multiple disabilities also called in French polyhandicap are defined by the
      combination of a deep mental disability and severe motor deficit with extreme restriction of
      autonomy. Life in institution for people with profound multiple disabilities induces
      emotional and educative deficiency and often conducts to behavioral disorders. These
      behavioral disorders also impact on quality of life and feelings of caregivers. An intensive
      multimodal educative program proposed to patients with profound multiple disabilities can
      improve their psychic well-being, reduce chronic pain and improve also quality of life and
      feelings of caregivers. The intensive multimodal educative program will be compared to the
      usual practice of educative program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with profound multiples disabilities needs particular follow-up with education, care,
      communication and socialization.

      Our hypothesis is that an intensive multimodal educative program of 5 hours a week during 12
      months compared to the usual practice of 1 hour a week conducts to the reduction of
      behavioral disorders and improves the quality of life and feelings of caregivers.

      This study is multicenter, controlled, randomized in two parallel groups and open-labelled
      comparing usual practice of educative program and intensive educative program during 12
      months.

      The evolution of predominant behavioral disorder and quality of life and feelings of
      caregivers is evaluated at inclusion (M0), six months after (M6) and twelve months after
      (M12).
