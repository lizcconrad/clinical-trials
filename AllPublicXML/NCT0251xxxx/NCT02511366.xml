  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The appearance of intact macronutrients in the small intestine induces an intestinal brake; a
      negative feedback mechanism from different parts of the intestine to the stomach, the small
      intestine and to the central nervous system. These processes inhibit food processing,
      appetite sensations and food intake, and furthermore they increase feelings of satiety and
      satiation. Several studies showed that intraileal infusion of nutrients resulted in a
      reduction in food intake. However only acute effects were investigated in these studies and
      thus far it is not known whether repetitive (intermittent) infusion results in adaptation to
      repeated exposure and, thus, a lowered ileal brake response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Based on medical history and previous examination, no gastrointestinal complaints can
             be defined.

          -  Age between 18 and 65 years. A higher age comes with a higher chance of comorbidities.
             These could influence our study outcomes and therefore this age range was chosen.
             Furthermore, we think this study would be too invasive for subjects over the age of
             65. This study will include healthy adult subjects (male and female). Women must be
             taking contraceptives.

          -  BMI between 18 and 25 kg/m2)

          -  Weight stable over at least the last 6 months (â‰¤5% weight change)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe cardiovascular, respiratory, urogenital, gastrointestinal/ hepatic,
             hematological/immunologic, HEENT (head, ears, eyes, nose, throat),
             dermatological/connective tissue, musculoskeletal, metabolic/nutritional, endocrine,
             neurological/psychiatric diseases, allergy, major surgery and/or laboratory
             assessments which might limit participation in or completion of the study protocol.
             The severity of the disease (major interference with the execution of the experiment
             or potential influence on the study outcomes) will be decided by the principal
             investigator.

          -  Use of medication, including vitamin supplementation, except oral contraceptives,
             within 14 days prior to testing

          -  Administration of investigational drugs or participation in any scientific
             intervention study which may interfere with this study (to be decided by the principle
             investigator), in the 180 days prior to the study

          -  Major abdominal surgery interfering with gastrointestinal function (uncomplicated
             appendectomy, cholecystectomy and hysterectomy allowed, and other surgery upon
             judgement of the principle investigator)

          -  Dieting (medically prescribed, vegetarian, diabetic, macrobiological, biological
             dynamic)

          -  Pregnancy, lactation

          -  Excessive alcohol consumption (&gt;20 alcoholic consumptions per week)

          -  Smoking

          -  Blood donation within 3 months before the study period

          -  Self-admitted HIV-positive state

          -  Evidence of casein or hypersensitivity
