  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of anti-angiogenesis drugs has led to renewed enthusiasm in lung cancer
      treatments. Apatinib, also known as YN968D1, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which selectively
      inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and also represents mild
      inhibition to PDGFR, c-Kit and c-src tyrosine kinases. It is an orally bioavailable, small
      molecule agent which is thought to inhibit VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration and
      proliferation thus blocking blood vessel formation in tumor tissues. Previous studies have
      identified that apatinib was well tolerated at doses below 750mg daily. In phase I/II study,
      investigators reported an objective response rate of 68%. In a phase III trial conducted in
      advanced pretreated gastric cancer, the median overall survival was significantly prolonged
      in the apatinib group compared with placebo group. Thus, in this trial, the investigators aim
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in previously treated advanced
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
