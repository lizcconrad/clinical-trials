    <textblock>
      This Pharmacokinetic (PK) study is going to provide supplemental PK data for supporting
      bipolar Phase III study for New Drug Application (NDA) filing according to regulatory
      requirement. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the PK of lamotrigine
      following repeat dosing of lamotrigine dispersible tablet in healthy Chinese subjects. This
      study consisted of Screening Phase (Days-14 to 0), Open-label Phase (Days 1 to 51) and
      follow-up Phase (10-17 days after last dosing). After signing the informed consent and
      confirm the eligibility, subjects will start dosing with lamotrigine 25 mg dispersible tablet
      once daily at Day 1 and remain at this dose level for two weeks (Days 1-14), then will be
      titrated to 50 mg once daily at Day 15 and last for weeks 3-4 (Days 15-28), and then titrated
      to 100 mg once daily at Day 29 during weeks 5-6 (Days 29-42). The total duration of the study
      will be approximately 10 weeks including screening and follow-up phase.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PK profile will be assessed by AUC (0-tau[24 hours]); Cmax; and accumulation ratios (Rcmax and Ro) following single and repeat dosing of lamotrigine dispersible tablet</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 14, 15, 28, 29, 42 and 44 to 51</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Days 1, 14, 28, and 42 before dosing (pre-dose) and at 0.5,1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after administration. Other blood samples will be taken at 1 and 3 hours post dose on Day 15, and at 2 and 4 h post dose on Day 29. Additional blood samples will be taken at 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 and 216 hours after the administration of last dose on Day 42. Area under the concentration-time curve for a dose interval (AUC [0-tau{24 hours}]); observed maximum concentration (Cmax); and accumulation ratios (Rcmax and Ro) will be determined from the serum concentration-time data. Accumulation ratio will be calculated as follows: Ro = AUC(0-24) of Day14/AUC(0-24) of Day 1; and Rcmax = Cmax of Day14 / Cmax of Day 1</description>
