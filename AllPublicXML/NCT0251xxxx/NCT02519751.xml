  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Creatine (methyl-d3) dilution (D3-creatine) is a novel technique for the estimation of muscle
      mass. The method uses a dose of deuterium-labelled creatine to determine total skeletal
      muscle mass via estimation of total body creatine pool size.The aim of this study is to
      compare estimates of total body skeletal muscle mass by D3-creatine dilution method and whole
      body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in an athletic population.

    <description>Every participant will be orally administered with 60mg of D3 Creatine in a fasted state in a non-gelatin capsule. Creatine supplemented throughout the study will be administered in the following doses-0.03, 0.035, 0.04, 0.045 g.kg.Lean mass/day, increasing on weekly basis. Final dose of 0.05 g.kg.Lean mass/day is then maintained throughout the study.</description>
