  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized double blind control trial. All patients undergoing upper abdominal, thoracic,
      gynecologic or orthopaedic surgeries at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali,
      Kigali, Rwanda will be invited to participate. Enrolled patients will receive subcutaneous
      ketamine (or placebo) administered immediately after surgery, the evening after surgery, and
      every 12 hours thereafter for a total of 5 injections at a dose of 1mg/kg. The primary
      outcome will be a reduction in mean Pain Scores using parametric statistical analysis to
      discriminate significance. Pain will be measured using an 11-point numerical rating scale.
      Secondary outcomes will be the presence of significant side effects. This trial is a
      partnership between the University of Saskatchewan and the National University of Rwanda with
      ethics approval from each institutions ethics board.
