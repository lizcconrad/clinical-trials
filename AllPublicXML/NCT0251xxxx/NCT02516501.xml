      Type of study: Pilot / phase I trial

      Study purpose To assess the impact of a dietary intervention during radio(chemo)therapy (RCT)
      on body composition changes

      Trial Treatment Patients will be split into a control group and intervention group 1. If
      willing to undertake a ketogenic diet for the duration of radiotherapy, patients are entered
      into intervention group 2.

        -  Group 1: On irradiation days irradiation after overnight fast + ketogenic breakfast
           consisting of 50-250 ml betaquick® (vitaflo, Bad Homburg, Germany) and 5-15 g Master
           Amino Acid Pattern (dr. reinwald healthcare gmbh+co kg, Schwarzenbruck, Germany).

        -  Group 2: Complete ketogenic diet plus 5-15g Master Amino Acid Pattern/day

        -  Control: No dietary intervention.

        -  All groups: Weight measurements and bioimpedance analysis (BIA) once per week, routine
           blood parameters and quality of life (QoL) questionnaire before, during and after RCT

      Planned accrual

        -  15 patients with colorectal and mammary tumor plus 5 patients with H&amp;N cancer in
           intervention group 1

        -  15 patients with colorectal and mammary tumor plus 5 patients with H&amp;N cancer in control
           group

        -  Minimum 5 patients of each tumor entity in intervantion group 2 Total: n ≥ 85 patients

      Study procedure

        1. Inclusion and full written informed consent.

        2. Baseline BIA measurement and blood work

        3. RCT with weekly BIA assessments; at least one blood withdrawal ± concurrent dietary
           intervention

    <description>This is a composite measure of several parameters obtained from the bioimpedance scale (mBCA 515, seca Germany). Body weight and composition derived from bioimpedance analysis will be assessed at least once per week. Body composition is composed of fat mass, fat free mass, total body water, extracellular water and intracellular water.</description>

    <measure>Phase angle</measure>
    <time_frame>5-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The phase angle is a raw parameter of bioimpedance analysis and will be tracked weekly at a total of 19 frequencies (1, 1.5,2,3,5,7.5,10,15,20,30,50,75,100,150,200,300,500,1000 kHz).
