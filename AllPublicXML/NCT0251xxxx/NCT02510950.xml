  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early clinical development paradigm for chemotherapeutic agents has significantly
      influenced the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines. However, there are major
      differences between these two classes of therapeutics that have important implications for
      early clinical development. Specifically, the phase 1 concept of dose escalation to find a
      maximum-tolerated dose does not apply to most therapeutic cancer vaccines. Most therapeutic
      cancer vaccines are associated with minimal toxicity at a range that is feasible to
      manufacture or administer, and there is little reason to believe that the maximum-tolerated
      dose is the most effective dose.

      In a recent article from the biostatistics literature, Simon et al. write that &quot;the initial
      clinical trial of many new vaccines will not be a toxicity or dose-ranging trial but rather
      will involve administration of a fixed dose of vaccine … in most cases the dose selected will
      be based on preclinical findings or practical considerations. Using several dose levels in
      the initial study to find the minimal active dose or to characterize the dose-activity
      relationship is generally not realistic&quot;.

      Consistent with these recommendations, the general philosophy of the phase 1 clinical trial
      is to facilitate a prompt preliminary evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of the
      personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The proposed clinical trial will test a
      fixed dose of vaccine. There is considerable experience with the synthetic long peptide
      vaccine platform. The synthetic long peptide vaccine platform has an excellent safety
      profile, and the optimal dose appears to be based on practical considerations (solubility of
      the peptide). The dose to be tested in the proposed clinical trial is consistent with other
      similar cancer vaccine trials that have been recently completed or are currently ongoing. The
      sample size (n=10) will provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the safety and
      immunogenicity of the vaccine.
