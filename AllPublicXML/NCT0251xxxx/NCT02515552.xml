  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a complex chronic illness affecting 6-12 million Americans. Self-management
      strategies play a key role in reducing symptoms and maintaining functioning. The proposed
      project offers a web-based self management tool that enables FM sufferers to identify
      significant linkages between their personal symptom levels and their personal self-management
      efforts over time in order to plan their own optimal approach to disease management.

      This Phase II project will complete development of the SMART (Self-Monitoring and Review
      Tool) Log program for symptom management and health promotion in FM and evaluate its efficacy
      in a large web-based trial that will closely emulate its planned application in Phase III.
      The SMARTLog program is an interactive web-based self-monitoring and feedback intervention
      that employs proprietary statistical analysis procedures to give the user personally
      optimized guidance on behavioral, lifestyle and coping strategies that yield effective
      symptom reduction for that individual. The program incorporates longitudinal collection and
      analysis of the individual's self-monitoring data followed by delivery of personalized
      feedback derived from those same personal data. The program helps FM sufferers discover and
      monitor linkages between specific personal health-related behaviors and management strategies
      and their symptom levels over time. Feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I by very high
      retention rates, ratings of satisfaction and perceived relevance, evidence of impact of
      utilization on improved well-being over the use period, and qualitative data indicating
      strong interest in continuation with the program.

    <description>Study applicants who consented and completed the application to participate in the Fibromyalgia Wellness Project. From that point forward all subjects used the intervention program to at whatever frequency they chose voluntarily. It was recommended subjects complete a SMARTLog at least three times per week for at least three months.</description>
