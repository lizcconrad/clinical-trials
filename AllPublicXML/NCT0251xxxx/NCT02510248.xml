  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, 3-part study
      in which the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered AL-704 will be
      assessed in healthy adult subjects and in adult subjects with CHC infection.

      Part 1: Healthy adult subjects will receive one of 5 single ascending oral doses (SAD) of
      AL-704 ranging from 100 mg to 1,500 mg (Cohorts 1 to 5). Within each cohort subjects will be
      randomized to receive either AL-704 or placebo (n=8 per cohort; 6 assigned to AL-704 and 2
      assigned to placebo), in a fasted state.

      The planned dose-escalation scheme may be changed based on the emerging PK and safety data.
      Two additional cohorts (Cohorts 6 and 7) may be enrolled for evaluation of additional doses
      at the discretion of the Sponsor and Investigator, based on the emerging pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile, and the presence of an acceptable safety profile.

      Part 2: To assess the food effect on pharmacokinetics, 8 healthy subjects from one full Part
      1 cohort who received a single dose of AL-704 or placebo in a fasted state, will receive the
      same single dose of AL-704 or placebo in a fed state in Part 2 after a washout period of 7-14
      days (depending on PK results). It is expected that Cohort 3 of Part 1 (600 mg dose) will be
      selected, however this depends on the evaluation of available PK and safety data from Part 1
      of the study.

      Part 3: The following cohorts of 10 adult subjects each, with CHC infection, will be
      evaluated. Subjects with CHC genotype 1 infection (Cohorts 8 to 10) and subjects with CHC
      genotype 3 infection (Cohort 11) will be randomized to receive AL-704 or placebo for 7
      consecutive days (n=10 per cohort, 8 assigned to AL-704 and 2 assigned to placebo) in a fed
      state. The treatment is anticipated to be administered in a once daily dose regimen or a
      twice daily dose regimen. The dose and dose regimen to be administered will be determined by
      the Sponsor depending on the PK and safety outcomes of previous cohorts.

             Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically
             significant. This determination must be recorded in the subject's source documents and
             initialed by the Investigator.

          -  Subject with CHC infection included in Part 3 of the study, must be otherwise healthy

             if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not
             clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under
             study. This determination must be recorded in the subject's source documents and

             weight of 50 kg in both populations. No more than 25% of patients in any cohort may be
             enrolled with a BMI â‰¥30 kg/m2.

          -  Female subject must be of non-childbearing potential.

          -  Female subject, except if postmenopausal, should have a negative serum pregnancy test

          -  Documentation of HCV infection for longer than 6 months and determination of genotype
             1 or 3 HCV infection at screening. In case of discrepancy between previously
             documented geno- or subtype and the geno- or subtype determined at screening, the
             eligibility results will be used to determine eligibility.

          -  HCV RNA viral load â‰¥105 IU/mL using a sensitive quantitative assay

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history or current clinically significant medical illness (except for

          -  CHC infection in subjects in Part 3 of the study) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in
             administering study drug to the subject or that could prevent, limit, or confound the
             protocol-specified assessments. This may include but is not limited to renal
             dysfunction (calculated creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min at screening),
