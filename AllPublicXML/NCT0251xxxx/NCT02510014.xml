  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, open-label, long-term safety study in which approximately 600 subjects
      diagnosed with opioid use disorder will be enrolled. Following a screening period, all
      subjects will receive run in SUBOXONE sublingual film followed by an initial injection of
      open-label high dose (300 mg) RBP-6000. The RBP-6000 monthly injection dose can be adjusted
      to low dose (100 mg), and back to high dose, based on the medical judgment of the
      Investigator. Subjects will participate in the study for either 6 or 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 600 subjects diagnosed with opioid use disorder will be enrolled; approximately
      300 subjects who completed the randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled study NCT02357901
      (RB-US-13-0001) ('roll-over' participants), and approximately 300 subjects who did not
      participate in study RB-US-13-0001 ('de novo' participants). Following informed consent and
      completion of screening procedures, all subjects will receive SUBOXONE sublingual film,
      titrated to response.

      After 4-14 days of SUBOXONE sublingual film treatment, subjects will be evaluated for
      enrollment into the study. Eligible subjects will receive 300 mg RBP-6000 as an initial dose,
      followed by monthly injections of 100 mg or 300 mg RBP-6000, based on the medical judgment of
      the investigator.

      Subjects who participated in study RB-US-13-0001 ('roll-over' participants) will receive
      monthly injections for up to 6 months. Subjects who did not participate in study
      RB-US-13-0001 ('de novo' participants) will receive monthly injections for up to12 months.

      At all injection visits continuous electrocardiogram recordings and pulse oximetry will be
      collected prior to injection and at least 4 hours after injection. Subjects will return to
      the clinic every 1-4 weeks for laboratory tests, complete study questionnaires, adverse event
      and injection site assessments.

    <measure>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 49 (De novo arm); Day 1 to Week 25 (Roll-over arm)</time_frame>
    <description>TEAE=any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity after dispensation of the study drug and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= a marked limitation in activity. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline to End of Study (Weeks 25 and 49) in Vital Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 predose) End of Study: Week 49 (De novo arm); Week 25 (Roll-over arm)</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs include
systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
respiratory rate (breaths/minute)
weight (kg)
body mass index (kg/m^2)
waist-to-hip ratio
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection of RBP-6000 on Day 1.</description>

    <measure>Shifts in Suicidality Using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) From Baseline to Most Severe Assessment During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screening visit, days -21 to -15), End of Study: Week 49 (De novo arm); Week 25 (Roll-over arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS asks questions of study participants regarding whether they had suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior since the last visit using the electronic version of the scale. Only the most severe assessment is reported in this summary. Participants who experienced suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior are only summarized in the suicidal behavior since behavior is more severe than ideation.
C-SSRS baseline version was completed during the screening visit. C-SSRS 'since-last-visit' version was completed weekly for the first month and at least every month until the end of the study.
Shift table category titles are structured as: baseline category/treatment category. The category 'No Suicidal Ideation or Behaviour' has been abbreviated as 'No Suicidal I or B'.</description>

    <measure>Worst Local Injection Site Pain From Injections as Measured by Participant-Reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>De Novo Subjects: Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 197, 225, 253, 281 and 309 Roll-over Subjects: Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141</time_frame>
    <description>Injection site pain as measured by participant-reported VAS. The participant-reported VAS for injection site pain was measured on a 100 mm scale with 'no pain' at 0 mm and 'strongest pain ever' at 100 mm (total scale of 0-100). Participants marked where along the scale reflected their localized injection pain.
The injection site pain VAS scores were obtained (after the completion of the injection) within 1 minute and at 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes (+- 5 minutes). The timing of the injection site pain VAS should have been measured from the end of the injection.
Data represents the worst pain recorded for each participant across all injections and all VAS records. The mean value is presented.
De Novo subjects were given injections on Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 197, 225, 253, 281 and 309.
Roll-over subjects were given injections on Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) at End of Study (Weeks 25 and 49)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 predose), End of Study: Week 49 (De novo arm); Week 25 (Roll-over arm)</time_frame>
    <description>COWS is an 11-item instrument used to assess signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The score is the sum of the responses for a total range of 0-48. The COWS is commonly used by clinicians treating patients with buprenorphine to monitor the severity of withdrawal. COWS scores below 5 are considered not indicative of withdrawal. Scores from 5 to 12 are considered mild withdrawal; from 13 to 24 moderate withdrawal; 25 to 36 moderately severe withdrawal, and 37-48 severe withdrawal. Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of withdrawal symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Baseline value is reported as an observed actual value. Weeks 25 and 49 represent change from baseline values.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) at End of Study (Weeks 25 and 49)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 predose), End of Study: Week 49 (De novo arm); Week 25 (Roll-over arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) contains 16 symptoms whose intensity the participant rates on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) for a full scale of 0 (no withdrawal symptoms) to 64 (extreme withdrawal symptoms). Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of withdrawal symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Baseline value is reported as an observed actual value. Weeks 25 and 49 represent change from baseline values.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the Percentage Abstinence Collected From Week 1 Through End of Study (Weeks 25 and 49)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly during Month 1, Every other week from Month 2-6, Monthly from Month 7-12. De novo arm stopped at Week 49. Roll-over arm stopped at Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' self-reported illicit opioid drug use from the timeline followback (TLFB) interview and results from the urine drug screens (UDS) for opioids were combined into a single endpoint. Opioids assessed included codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, opiates, oxycodone, and oxymorphone (by UDS) and amphetamine/methadone, buprenorphine, methadone, and opioids in the TLFB.
Data represent the count of participants at various percentage abstinence levels. Abstinence was defined as urine samples being negative for opioids AND negative self-reports (obtained from Timeline Followback (TLFB) interviews) for illicit opioid use. The endpoint was based on visits in which paired urine samples and self-reports were expected for each subject as specified in the schedule of events. All missing reports for opioids were considered nonnegative.</description>

        <title>Shifts in Suicidality Using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) From Baseline to Most Severe Assessment During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS asks questions of study participants regarding whether they had suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior since the last visit using the electronic version of the scale. Only the most severe assessment is reported in this summary. Participants who experienced suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior are only summarized in the suicidal behavior since behavior is more severe than ideation.
C-SSRS baseline version was completed during the screening visit. C-SSRS 'since-last-visit' version was completed weekly for the first month and at least every month until the end of the study.
Shift table category titles are structured as: baseline category/treatment category. The category 'No Suicidal Ideation or Behaviour' has been abbreviated as 'No Suicidal I or B'.</description>

        <title>Worst Local Injection Site Pain From Injections as Measured by Participant-Reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>Injection site pain as measured by participant-reported VAS. The participant-reported VAS for injection site pain was measured on a 100 mm scale with 'no pain' at 0 mm and 'strongest pain ever' at 100 mm (total scale of 0-100). Participants marked where along the scale reflected their localized injection pain.
The injection site pain VAS scores were obtained (after the completion of the injection) within 1 minute and at 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes (+- 5 minutes). The timing of the injection site pain VAS should have been measured from the end of the injection.
Data represents the worst pain recorded for each participant across all injections and all VAS records. The mean value is presented.
De Novo subjects were given injections on Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 197, 225, 253, 281 and 309.
Roll-over subjects were given injections on Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) at End of Study (Weeks 25 and 49)</title>
        <description>COWS is an 11-item instrument used to assess signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The score is the sum of the responses for a total range of 0-48. The COWS is commonly used by clinicians treating patients with buprenorphine to monitor the severity of withdrawal. COWS scores below 5 are considered not indicative of withdrawal. Scores from 5 to 12 are considered mild withdrawal; from 13 to 24 moderate withdrawal; 25 to 36 moderately severe withdrawal, and 37-48 severe withdrawal. Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of withdrawal symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Baseline value is reported as an observed actual value. Weeks 25 and 49 represent change from baseline values.</description>

        <description>The Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) contains 16 symptoms whose intensity the participant rates on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) for a full scale of 0 (no withdrawal symptoms) to 64 (extreme withdrawal symptoms). Negative change from baseline values indicate a lessening of withdrawal symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to subcutaneous injection on Day 1. Baseline value is reported as an observed actual value. Weeks 25 and 49 represent change from baseline values.</description>

        <description>Participants’ self-reported illicit opioid drug use from the timeline followback (TLFB) interview and results from the urine drug screens (UDS) for opioids were combined into a single endpoint. Opioids assessed included codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, opiates, oxycodone, and oxymorphone (by UDS) and amphetamine/methadone, buprenorphine, methadone, and opioids in the TLFB.
Data represent the count of participants at various percentage abstinence levels. Abstinence was defined as urine samples being negative for opioids AND negative self-reports (obtained from Timeline Followback (TLFB) interviews) for illicit opioid use. The endpoint was based on visits in which paired urine samples and self-reports were expected for each subject as specified in the schedule of events. All missing reports for opioids were considered nonnegative.</description>
