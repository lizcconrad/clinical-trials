    <textblock>
      The scientific goal of this experiment is to evaluate changes in balance control in response
      to microgravity during reactive balance tasks. For that purpose, kinematic and neuromuscular
      parameters under microgravity are compared to normal gravity conditions. To induce postural
      responses among the test subjects, an electromagnetic maneuverable postural platform will be
      used in order to randomly elicit perturbations. Postural reactions will be quantified by
      means of mechanical and electromyographic data. In Addition, peripheral nerve stimulation
      will be used to assess the spinal excitability by means of H-reflex recordings. H-reflex
      measurements were chosen as they allow reliable information about inhibitory and facilitatory
      mechanisms taking place at the spinal level.
