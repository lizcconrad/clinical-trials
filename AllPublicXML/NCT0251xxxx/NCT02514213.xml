      This is a phase I, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of INO 5150
      alone or in combination with INO-9012 when delivered intramuscularly (IM) followed by
      electroporation (EP) in men with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

      Phase I, open label study of INO-5150 (DNA plasmids encoding prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)) alone or co-administered with INO-9012 (IL-12
      plasmid) delivered intramuscularly followed by EP using the CELLECTRA®-5P device in adult
      males with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer following definitive local therapy (e.g.
      prostatectomy, external beam radiation, or brachytherapy). Four injections will be
      administered to approximately 60 eligible subjects who consent to participate in the study.
      Subjects will be monitored for safety and immunogenicity through Week 72.
