    <textblock>
      Allergic patients especially those undergoing de-sensitization treatment have an altered
      immune responsiveness. The investigators aim to find out whether this influences immune
      responses to primary and booster vaccinations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic patients generally have an altered immunologic profile (Th2 bias), and allergic
      individuals undergoing de-sensitization treatment display an increased production of immune
      supressive cytokines. The investigators measure humoral and cellular immune responses to
      routine vaccination (TBE booster) in allergic patients with and without de-sensitization
      treatment to determine whether allergy negatively influences vaccine induced immune responses
      and protection.
