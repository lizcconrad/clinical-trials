    <textblock>
      Currently, two ICU delirium prediction models are available: the PRE-DELIRIC model and the
      early prediction model (E-PRE-DELRIC). However, the use of these prediction models is not yet
      implemented as standard in clinical practice, as it is unknown which delirium prediction
      model can best be used to predict delirium in ICU patients.Therefore the main aim of this
      study is to compare the performance of the PRE-DELIRIC model and the E-PRE-DELRIC model.

    <textblock>
      Delirium often occurs in ICU patients and is associated with negative consequences, requiring
      prevention. A prediction model facilitates the identification of those patients at risk for
      delirium and therefore need prevention the most. At present, two ICU delirium prediction
      models are available. First the PRE-DELIRIC model was developed. This recently recalibrated
      model reliably predicts ICU patients' risk for delirium within 24 hours after ICU admission.
      Because a relevant number of patients develops delirium during the first 24 hours after ICU
      admission, and prevention ideally should be deployed as soon as possible, the investigators
      developed the 'early prediction model' (E-PRE-DELIRIC) which reliably predicts delirium
      immediately after ICU admission. To implement a delirium prediction model in clinical
      practice, one needs to know which model best can be used. Currently, the use of a delirium
      prediction model is not implemented as standard in clinical practice, as this information is
      unavailable. Therefore the main aim of this study is to compare the (predictive and clinical)
      performance of the PRE-DELIRIC model and the E-PRE-DELRIC model.
