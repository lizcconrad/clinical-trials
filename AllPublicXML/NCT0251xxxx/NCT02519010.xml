      Comparative randomized, single dose, two-way crossover open-label study to determine the
      bioequivalence of Amlodipine / valsartan from Amlodipine/Valsartan 10/160 film coated tablets
      (Pharmacare, Palestine) and Exforge 10/160 film coated tablets (Novartis Pharma, USA).

      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, Area under cover (AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ ) Secondary
      Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for
      transformed (with the 90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and
      AUC0→∞ and for untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e. The confidence intervals of
      logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within
      80.00-125.00%.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
