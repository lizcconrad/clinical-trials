      To determine the optimal time for the Tenofovir treatment of anti-Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
      during the pregnancy among women with chronic HBV infection and high HBV DNA load. This is a
      randomized, open-label, three-arms, parallel-controlled clinical trial. Pregnant women with
      high HBV load and normal liver function will be treated with tenofovir during the middle or
      late stage of pregnancy, started from 24th gestational week, 28th gestational week and 32th
      gestational week through 1 month postpartum, respectively. The HBV DNA load at 40th
      gestational week of mothers, the intrauterine HBV infection rate of infants will be compared
      across the three groups.

      Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate is a American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy
      class B drug. To determine the optimal time for the tenofovir treatment during the pregnancy
      among women with chronic HBV infection and high HBV DNA load. Pregnant women with high HBV
      DNA load and normal liver function at second trimester will be randomized into three
      treatment groups at the 20th week of gestation and treated with tenofovir from 24 weeks, 28
      weeks and 32 weeks to 1 month postpartum, respectively. The blood will be drawn at 24 weeks,
      28 weeks, 32 weeks, 36 weeks and the delivery, respectively and the HBV DNA load and liver
      functions will be tested. The status of HBV infection for infants will be observed at 1st
      month, 7th month and 12th month after the babies were delivered. The HBV DNA load at 40th
      gestational week of mothers, the intrauterine HBV infection rate of infants and safety
      outcomes will be compared across the three groups.
