  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if a symptom questionnaire used for adults at MD
      Anderson can be improved to better understand the symptoms experienced by 13-17 year old
      patients with cancer.

      Interviews and Questionnaires:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to provide some personal
      information, such as your education level and if you are currently attending school. This
      information will either be collected from your medical record or a member of the study staff
      will ask you.

      You will complete a questionnaire about your symptoms. You may also be asked to take part in
      an interview about the symptom questionnaire that will be digitally recorded by the
      interviewer. During the interview, you will be asked if the questionnaire was easy to
      understand and complete, and if you think there are any other questions that should be
      included. You will then be asked to complete 2 more questionnaires about your health status
      and your quality of life. The study staff will use your opinions and questionnaire responses
      to decide if changes should be made to the symptom questionnaire. It should take about 15-30
      minutes to complete the questionnaires and the interview.

      All interviews will be conducted in a private area in either the ambulatory pediatric
      adolescent clinics or in the hospital. The private area may be different, based on which
      types of rooms are available (for example, an exam room, conference room, or a
      single-occupancy hospital room), but it will always be a closed private space with only you
      and a member of the research staff present.

      In order to understand how symptoms change during treatment, the research staff may ask you
      to complete the symptom questionnaire for a total of 7 times. The first 2 times will be done
      1 day apart. The following 5 times will be done approximately 1 week apart. It will take
      approximately 5 minutes to complete the symptom questionnaire each time. The first time you
      complete the questionnaire you may also be asked to take part in an interview about the
      symptom questionnaire that will be digitally recorded by the interviewer. During the
      interview, you will be asked if the questionnaire was easy to understand and complete, and if
      you think there are any other questions that should be included.

      You may complete the questionnaires in the clinic, over the phone, or online. The study staff
      will tell you which method you will use to complete the questionnaires. If you are asked to
      take part in an interview, the interview will be conducted in a private area in either the
      ambulatory pediatric adolescent clinics or in the hospital. The private area may be
      different, based on which types of rooms are available (for example, an exam room, conference
      room, or a single-occupancy hospital room), but it will always be a closed private space with
      only you and a member of the research staff present.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation in this study will be over after you have completed the
      questionnaires and interview.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 105 participants will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Part 1: Adolescent participants complete the MDASI (adolescent version). Study staff then conduct interview regarding the symptom questionnaire. After the interview participants complete the EQ-5D and a single-item quality of life (QOL) questionnaire.
Part 2: MDASI (adolescent version) administered twice, one day apart, to assess test-retest reliability. MDASI (adolescent version) then administered at 5 additional time points, each a week apart. Participants also complete the EQ-5D and a single item quality of life question only after first MDASI (adolescent version) completion. First 20 participants are interviewed by study staff regarding the symptom questionnaire.</description>
