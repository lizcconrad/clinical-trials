  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To join established study put on by Addition Technologies, Inc. in the surgical implantation
      of asymmetrical INTACS segments to treat myopia and astigmatism in patients with keratoconus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of asymmetrical corneal inserts to reduce or eliminate myopia and astigmatism in patients
      with keratoconus, who are no longer able to achieve adequate vision with their contact lenses
      or spectacles, so that their functional vision may be restored and the need for corneal
      transplantation may potentially be deferred.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  21 years of age, or older

          -  have experienced a progressive deterioration in their vision, such that they can no
             longer achieve adequate functional vision on a daily basis with contact lenses, or
             spectacles.

          -  have clear central corneas

          -  have a corneal thickness of 450 microns or greater at the proposed incision site

          -  have corneal transplantation as the only remaining option to improve their visual
             function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  under 21 years of age

          -  have not experienced a progressive deterioration in their vision, such that they can
             no longer achieve adequate functional vision on a daily basis with contact lenses, or
             spectacles.

          -  do not have clear central corneas

          -  do not have a corneal thickness of 450 microns or greater at the proposed incision
