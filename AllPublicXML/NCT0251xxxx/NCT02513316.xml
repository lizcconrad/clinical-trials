      Study I: CROMIS-2 (AF) Prospective cohort study of patients anticoagulated after
      cardioembolic stroke An observational inception cohort study (n=1425) of patients throughout
      the United Kingdom (UK) - (79 hospitals) started on best practice oral anticoagulant (without
      prior use) for presumed cardioembolic ischaemic stroke due to non-valvular AF with follow up
      for the occurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and ischaemic stroke for an average of
      two years. The main baseline exposures (risk factors of interest) are the presence of
      cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and genetic polymorphisms in
      candidate genes with potential functional relevance to ICH risk.

      Study II: CROMIS-2 (ICH) Observational and genetics study of intracerebral haemorrhage The
      investigators will also recruit 600 patients admitted to participating centres with ICH (with
      a target of at least 300 anticoagulant-related ICH cases) and collect DNA to increase the
      power of the genetic studies. The investigators will collect clinical and imaging data from
      these ICH cases to investigate risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH
      compared to non anticoagulant-related ICH.

      Background Over the last decade, increasing use of oral anticoagulants to prevent
      cardioembolic ischaemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF) in an ageing population has
      led to a five-fold increase in the incidence of anticoagulant-related intracranial
      haemorrhage (ICH) - a rare but unpredictable and catastrophic complication. Cerebral
      microbleeds (CMBs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may predict ICH risk, as may genetic
      polymorphisms influencing brain small-vessel integrity or anticoagulation stability.

      Aims To establish the value of CMBs and genetic factors in predicting symptomatic ICH
      following best practice oral anticoagulation to prevent recurrent ischaemic stroke due to AF.

      Methods CROMIS-2: Study I (AF) - Prospective, multicentre, inception cohort study in 1425
      patients with ischaemic stroke due to AF started on best practice oral anticoagulation.
      Patients will have genetic testing and standardized MRI including Gradient recalled Echo
      (GRE) at baseline, with follow-up by postal questionnaire (and clinical assessment or medical
      records surveillance after suspected events), and where possible there will be an in person
      clinical assessment at 2 years. The investigators will compare the rate of symptomatic ICH
      between CMB and CMB-free patients and test for associations with plausible candidate genes.
      The investigators aim to develop and validate a risk model to predict symptomatic ICH
      following best practice oral anticoagulation to prevent recurrent ischaemic stroke due to AF.

      CROMIS-2: Study II (ICH) - An observational study of ICH investigating genetic, clinical and
      radiological risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH. The investigators will
      recruit patients admitted to participating centres with ICH (with a target of at least 300
      anticoagulant-related ICH cases) and collect DNA to increase the power of the genetic
      studies. The investigators will collect clinical and imaging data from these ICH cases to
      investigate risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH compared to non
      anticoagulant-related ICH.

      Expected outcomes A successful predictive model for ICH risk after best practice oral
      anticoagulation for AF will help to determine whether genetic or CMB screening should be used
      in clinical practice and future trials. New genetic, clinical and radiological risk factors
      associated with anticoagulant-related ICH will be identified.

        Study I: CROMIS-2 (AF) Prospective cohort study of patients anticoagulated after
        cardioembolic stroke Study I (AF): 1425 patients from UK centres. All eligible patients
        with first or recurrent ischaemic stroke and TIA in whom it is decided that best practice
        oral anticoagulant treatment is to be commenced.

        Study II (ICH): The investigators will recruit 600 patients treated at participating
        hospitals with ICH. Of these patients, 300 ICH cases will be related to anticoagulant use.
        The investigators will also recruit at least 300 ICH cases not related to anticoagulant use
        during the study period. Patients seen in outpatient clinics or from existing databases may
        also be recruited, at centres where these are available.
