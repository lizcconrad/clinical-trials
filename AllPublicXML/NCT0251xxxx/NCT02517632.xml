    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the impact of exercise in a cardiac
      rehabilitation program on functional capacity, clinical markers, quality of life and
      biomarkers in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.

      The present study consisted in a randomized clinical study conducted at the Evandro Chagas
      National Institute of Infectious Disease (INI), located on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. INI is a
      national reference center for treatment and research in infectious diseases and tropical
      medicine in Brazil, which follows a large cohort of patients with Chagas disease, all of them
      diagnosed by two simultaneously positive serological tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      and indirect immunofluorescence). Patients included in the study are randomly divided in two
      groups: intervention and control groups. Safety analysis will be performed by monitoring any
      symptoms presented during data collection and follow-up study.

      One of the potential risks that the patient may experience during the study is a noninvasive
      test that will be performed on a treadmill in a controlled environment, with the possibility
      of the appearance of symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, dizziness, with minimal
      chances of occurring complications of difficult clinical control. Except for the blood test
      and the cardiopulmonary exercise test, the other tests to be performed are non-invasive and
      do not bring any risk to the participant's health. Will be collect 10 ml of blood which will
      be stored for up to five years for biomarker assessments.

      During the exercise sessions, patients will be clinically monitored for decompensation, need
      for hospitalization and suspend or end the participation on the study. All cases will be
      individually assessed to determine the reversibility of the clinical status. Those cases will
      continue to be followed by the assistant staff, offering all the clinical support available
      in INI.
