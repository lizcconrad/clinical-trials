      This study aims to investigate and compare the intervention effects of combining exercise and
      cognitive training (either sequentially or simultaneously in a dual-task paradigm) in elderly
      with mild cognitive impairment. The investigators hypothesize that (1) both sequential and
      dual-task training can induce greater improvements in the outcome measures than single mode
      of training; (2) the improvement in cognitive functions and other outcomes may differ between
      the groups.

      Background and study aims:

      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or minor neurocognitive disorder is a syndrome defined as an
      intermediate stage between cognitively intact and clinically diagnosed dementia. The
      age-adjusted prevalence of MCI in Taiwan is approximately 18%, while women have higher
      prevalence for MCI than men. The progression rate from MCI to dementia ranges from 10 to 15%
      each year, and over 50% of the MCI population will develop into severe cognitive impairment
      or dementia in 5 years. Therefore, early detection of the individuals who manifest MCI and
      provide appropriate interventions may help reduce the burden of their caregivers and the
      medical expenses of the health-care system. Previous studies found that cognitive training or
      exercise has emerged as an important therapeutic approach for individuals with MCI. However,
      the intervention effects of combining exercise and cognitive training remain to be
      determined. Furthermore, whether exercise and cognitive training should be administered in
      sequential order or simultaneously is an important question to pursue. The overall goal of
      this study is to determine and compare the intervention effects cognitive training, exercise,
      and combining cognitive and exercise training in individuals with MCI.

      Who can participate? Individuals with MCI.

      What does the study involve? The participants will receive a total of 36 training sessions,
      and each session will contain 90 minutes of training. Training frequency will be 2-3 times
      per week for 12-18 weeks. All participants will received pretreatment test, post treatment
      test, and a 6-month follow-up test.

      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? The possible benefits include
      improvement in cognitive, physical, and daily functions. There are no risks for
      participating.

      Where to conduct the study? The investigators anticipate recruiting a total of 80
      participants from geriatric day care centers and nursing homes from multiple cities in
      Taiwan.

    <measure>Change scores of Stroop test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (an expected average of 3 months), follow-up (up to 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop test will be used to assess the processing speed, inhibition, set-shifting, and selective attention abilities. The participants will be tested under 2 conditions: congruent and incongruent conditions. In the congruent condition, the color ink of a word is consistent with the written color name; while the color ink differs from the written color name under the incongruent condition.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Dual-task test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (an expected average of 3 months), follow-up (up to 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The dual-task tests will be assessed to determine the ability for an individual to perform 2 tasks simultaneously. The investigators will assess the dual-task performance during walking and performing box and block test. The results of the dual-task tests will provide information regarding to whether the 2 tasks compete for the same class of neural resources or one of the tasks can be carried out automatically.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of Timed up and go (TUG) test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (an expected average of 3 months), follow-up (up to 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test will be used to assess the mobility and dynamic balance ability. The participants will be required to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, then walk back to the chair, and sit down. The time to complete the TUG test has been shown to be a good indicator to detect potential fallers and frail elderly (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). The test-retest reliability of TUG on individuals with cognitive impairment was excellent (Blankevoort, van Heuvelen, &amp; Scherder, 2013).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (an expected average of 3 months), follow-up (up to 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal fluency tests will be used to evaluate the semantic memory of the participants. The participants will be instructed to say as many words as possible from a given category (i.e., fruit or animal) in 1 minute. The validity, reliability, and normative performance of verbal fluency tests have been well-established (Harrison, Buxton, Husain, &amp; Wise, 2000).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, posttest (an expected average of 3 months), follow-up (up to 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) will be used to measure the memory and cognitive functions of an individual. The WAIS and WMS have high reliability and validity, and are often used to differentiate individuals with memory or cognitive deficits and those with intact cognitive functions. In addition, WAIS and WMS could be used to assess cognitive improvements after an intervention or treatment (Iverson, 2001).</description>

    <description>Useful field of view (UFOV) is the visual area over which useful information could be obtained at a quick glance without eye or head movements. This UFOV will be assessed with the BrainHQ program. The UFOV will assess the abilities of visuomotor processing speed, divided attention, and selective attention (Ball, Edwards, &amp; Ross, 2007).</description>

The participants will be asked to stand up from a standardized chair and then sit down as many times as possible within 30 seconds. The feasibility and reliability of using CST in people with cognitive impairment have been established to be good (Blankevoort et al., 2013).</description>
