    <textblock>
      Background: Association between periodontal disease (PD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) has been widely studied and the aspiration of periodontal pathogens is one of
      the most accepted causal mechanisms for pulmonary exacerbation. Bronchiectasis is clinically
      quite similar with COPD, including chronic administration of antibiotics, increased systemic
      inflammation and relatively similar clinical symptoms, but for the time being; there are no
      studies that have correlated this condition to PD. This study will evaluate if the scaling
      and root planning (SRP) associated with photodynamic therapy improves periodontal clinical
      parameters, halitosis, and the quantity of microorganisms associated with exacerbation of
      bronchiectasis in saliva, subgingival periodontal microenvironment, sputum and nasal lavage
      at baseline, after 3 months and one year of SRP. Methods/Design: Ninety patients with chronic
      periodontal disease and bronchiectasis will be enrolled in the study and they will be treated
      as follow:G1 control (n = 30) - supragingival scaling (SS) and dental hygiene orientation
      (DHO); G2 experimental (n = 30) - SRP + DHO; G3- experimental (n = 30) - SRP + PDT + DHO. The
      quantification of bacterial groups commonly associated with exacerbation of bronchiectasis (P
      aeruginosa, S. aureus) and periodontal diseases (P. gingivalis), will be evaluated in
      periodontal pockets, saliva, nasal lavage and sputum by quantitative PCR at baseline 3 months
      and one year after the SRP. G1 patients will receive SRP upon completion of the
      investigation. If the mean depth of probing of this group worsen (&gt; 1mm) at 3 months they
      will be excluded from the study, treated (SRP) and the data will be described. Discussion:
      The results of this protocol will determine the efficacy of periodontal treatment in
      decreasing the total amount microorganisms in saliva periodontal pocket, sputum and nasal
      lavage, the most probable niches of bronchiectasis exacerbation, and reducing local
      inflammation and halitosis after 3 months and one year. It is expected an higher improvement
      in all parameters measured over 3 months and 1 year for G3

In G1, all participants will receive supragingival treatments by an experienced specialist with universal curettes and ultrasound. Supragingival treatment will be performed above the gingival margin. The simulation of using photodynamic therapy (PDT) will be performed with laser turned off. No antibiotics and oral antiseptics will be prescribed.</description>

    <description>Arm description: G3 - experimental group - (n = 30) DHO +SRP + PDT with methylene blue
In G3, periodontal treatment and photodynamic therapy (PDT) will be performed. The scaling and root planing will be performed identical as G2. The PDT will be administered in periodontal pockets &gt; 4mm. Methylene blue will be applied in the deep of periodontal pockets. After 5 minutes of application the red laser diode (λ = 660 nm) will be applied with output power of 100 mW with 90 seconds of exposure, i.e. 9J in each point. Applications will be held in six sites around the tooth in all teeth. To finalize, 1 minute of irradiation in scan around each tooth and rinsing with saline solution to remove the photosensitizer</description>
