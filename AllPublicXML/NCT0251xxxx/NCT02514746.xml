    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the persistence of the Japanese encephalitis (JE) antibody
      response in previously vaccinated children. The proposed study is a phase 4 open-label trial
      enrolling up to 818 Bangladeshi children who had previously participated in a lot to lot
      consistency study (JEV05) of JE live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine (CD-JEV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants previously immunized with CD-JEV (Clinical Trials identifier: NCT01567865,
      JEV05) will have serum collected three and four years after initial vaccination to assess
      long-term immunogenicity. Four years after receiving the initial dose of CD-JEV, eligible
      participants will be vaccinated with a second subcutaneous dose of CD-JEV to assess the
      antibody response.

      Participants will be monitored for safety for 28 days following receipt of the booster dose.
