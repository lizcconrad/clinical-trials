  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In accordance with national guidelines surgical repair of rotator cuff tear is the first-line
      strategy only in young patients, depending on tear size, fatty infiltration of rotator cuff
      muscles and articular status. In appropriate situations, a satisfactory result is expected in
      more than 80% of cases with a very good long-term outcome. On the other hand, the first-line
      strategy in older patients is conservative as the main objective is the treatment of pain and
      stiffness of the shoulder which can be achieved at least in the short-term with general and
      local medications and physiotherapy. In addition, poor prognostic factors such as massive
      tears and muscle fatty infiltration or atrophy, are more frequently present in those
      patients, leading to poor results of surgical treatment and a high risk of iterative tear
      after repair.

      Because of a lack of evaluation, there is currently no identified prognostic factor of
      medical treatment and on the other hand no clinical situation in which a surgical repair is
      mandatory. Therefore, investigator designed this study as an observatory with the follow up
      of patients with a symptomatic rotator cuff tear treated conservatively.
