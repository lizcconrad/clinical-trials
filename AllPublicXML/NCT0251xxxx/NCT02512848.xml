  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to collect endometrial sampling with Li Brush among target population who
      have risks for endometrial neoplasm, then Fractional curettage should performed with these
      participants, investigators intend to compare the pathological diagnosis results of cytology
      and fractional curettage to evaluate the sensitivity of Li Brush and investigators expect
      that the brush can be used for screening of endometrial cancer in the postmenopausal period
      in the clinic.

      Investigators screen the suitable participants according to the inclusion and exclusion
      standards, and then collect their endometrial sampling with Li Brush. Pathologists will help
      to decide the cytology obtained by Li Brush and histology diagnosis of the endometrial
      sampling. Comparing the pathological diagnosis results of cytology and histology,
      investigators want to prove the feasibility of cytology diagnosis of endometrial cancer in
      the postmenopausal period, as the same time, investigators intend to evaluate the possible
      factors that affecting the precision of Li Brush for endometrial cancer in the postmenopausal
      period.
