    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a type of kidney replacement therapy for patients with chronic
      kidney disease where the peritoneal membrane is used to filter the blood. Exposure to PD
      fluid results in scarring of the peritoneal membrane and increased blood vessel growth. This
      condition can progress even when peritoneal dialysis is stopped. Therefore, the investigators
      hypothesize glucose in the dialysis fluid may result in DNA modifications called epigenetic
      changes. These changes modify how genes are expressed and how cells function. The
      investigators want to study these epigenetic changes and the effect on peritoneal membrane
      scarring, blood vessel growth and peritoneal membrane function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable evidence that epigenetic changes in effector cells underlie the
      progressive nature of fibrogenic diseases. The investigators have developed an ex-vivo
      mesothelial cell culture system based on work by Aroeira and colleagues. Ex vivo cell
      cultures were treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-AZA for 72 hours. Overall,
      the investigators found that 11 of 14 patients' cells showed an increase in the
      E-Cad/alpha-SMA ratio with treatment to 5-AZA, indicating a return to a more epithelial-like
      phenotype and supporting an epigenetic mechanism of progressive fibrosis. The investigators
      hope to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with glucose exposure and peritoneal
      membrane solute transport in PD patients.

      The investigators will take the peritoneal effluent from an overnight dwell from patients
      within one month of initiation of dialysis. The overnight effluent is centrifuged and the
      pellet is washed and cells are grown in DMEM medium. At confluence, cells are passaged into 2
      flasks then taken for DNA and RNA. At 12 months, a second overnight peritoneal effluent
      sample will be obtained. The investigators will also gather demographic data (patient's age,
      diabetes, occurrence of peritonitis, cumulative PD prescription including total glucose
      exposure, use of icodextrin, and the results of a peritoneal equilibrium test carried out for
      clinical purposes between 3 and 12 months from the start of peritoneal dialysis). The
      investigators will use whole genome DNA methylation analysis to assess epigenetic changes in
      mesothelial cells from incident PD patients.

    <description>DNA methylation pattern will be measured after 12 months of glucose exposure compared with a baseline sample. Gene expression will be measured by Genome wide methylation analysis. In the incident patients, a within-subject analysis will be carried out between the naive and 12 month cell culture sample. Gene expression analysis will be performed with the statistical software R and &quot;BioConductor&quot;, a collection of tools for gene expression analysis. Gene-level summaries from Human HT-12 BeadChip data will be generated using the widely used Bioconductor package lumi, which includes background correction, variance stabilization and normalization of expression data. The Linear Models for Microarray Analysis (LIMMA) package of Bioconductor will be used for differential expression analysis.</description>

    <measure>DNA methylation and solute transport</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will correlate changes in DNA methylation with solute transport measured by a peritoneal equilibrium test and peritoneal glucose exposure. Solute transport is calculated from the dialysate to plasma creatinine ratio which is obtained from the peritoneal equilibrium test.</description>
