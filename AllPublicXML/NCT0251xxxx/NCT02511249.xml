  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While perinatal ischemic stroke is the most frequent form of childhood stroke, early
      determinants of outcome remain poorly understood. Two main structural biases limit the
      accuracy of most studies: heterogeneity of the population and short follow-up.

      Perinatal ischemic stroke includes several conditions that differ in pathophysiology and
      timing of occurrence. Yet, it is not surprising that risk factors and outcome depend
      primarily on the type of stroke. Age at evaluation also plays a major role after a neonatal
      insult. Even though the original lesion is static and focal in perinatal stroke, its
      consequences grow over time within the maturing brain and affect all fields of
      neurodevelopment.

      The objective of the AVCnn study was to delineate the determinants, clinical and imaging
      presentation, mechanism, and long term outcome of a category of perinatal stroke (neonatal
      arterial ischemic stroke: NAIS). This led to the AVCnn cohort, which now gives us the
      opportunity to regularly monitor a large cohort of children having suffered an NAIS.

      Between November 2003 and October 2006, a cohort of one hundred symptomatic term newborns
      with AIS confirmed through early brain imaging has been constituted.

      Regular contacts with the families and their local physician have been maintained since
      enrollment. In 2010, families were asked through postal mail to participate in the 7 years
      assessment (AVCnn7ans). Those who accepted were contacted by phone by the coordinators of the
      study during the months preceding the child's seventh birthday and invited to attend a
      presentation in person of the current project. This evaluation took place face-to-face for a
      whole day in a medical setting close to the family residence. The evaluation team included a
      neuropsychologist, a speech therapist and either a pediatric neurologist or a pediatric
      physical and rehabilitation medicine practitioner.
