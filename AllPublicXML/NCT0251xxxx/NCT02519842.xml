  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fosaprepitant (MK-0517)
      plus ondansetron versus ondansetron alone for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea
      and vomiting (CINV) in pediatric participants scheduled to receive chemotherapeutic agent(s)
      associated with moderate or high risk of causing emesis (vomiting), or chemotherapy agent(s)
      not previously tolerated due to vomiting. The primary hypothesis is that a single dose of
      fosaprepitant in combination with ondansetron provides superior control of CINV compared to
      ondansetron alone as measured by the percentage of participants with a Complete Response (no
      vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medications) in the delayed phase (&gt;24 to 120
      hours) following initiation of emetogneic chemotherapy in Cycle 1.

  <detailed_description>

      In Cycle 1, participants will receive double-blind study drug (fosaprepitant plus ondansetron
      with or without dexamethasone OR placebo to fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with or without
      dexamethasone). Upon completion of Cycle 1, participants may have the option to continue for
      up to 5 additional open-label cycles, receiving fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with or
      without dexamethasone.

    <description>Complete Response was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication following the initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1. A vomiting episode was specified as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes were separated by the absence of emesis and retching for at least one minute. The date and time of each vomiting episode was recorded by participants in diaries at the time of occurrence. The percentage of participants with no vomiting and no retching episodes in the delayed phase, defined as the time period of &gt;24 to120 hours post initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 1, was calculated.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not it is considered related to the study drug. A statistical analysis was performed for Tier 2 AEs in Cycle 1 to compare the percentage of participants who received fosaprepitant regimen and experienced at least 1 Tier 2 AE compared with the percentage of participants in the control regimen. The Tier 2 endpoint included broad clinical and laboratory AE categories consisting of the percentage of participants with any AE, drug-related AE, serious AE, and AEs that are both drug-related and serious. Tier 2 AEs were not pre-specified as events of interest and inclusion in the Tier 2 analysis required that at least 4 participants in any treatment group exhibited the AE.</description>

A vomiting episode was specified as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes were separated by the absence of emesis and retching for at least one minute. The date and time of each vomiting episode was recorded by participants in diaries at the time of occurrence. Rescue medication was permitted to alleviate symptoms of established nausea or vomiting; but not as preventive medication. The percentage of participants with no vomiting and no retching episodes in the overall phase, defined as the time period of 0 to 120 hours post initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 1, was calculated.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced a Complete Response During the Delayed Phase (&gt;24 to 120 Hours Post Initiation of Chemotherapy) in Cycle 1</title>
        <description>Complete Response was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication following the initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1. A vomiting episode was specified as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes were separated by the absence of emesis and retching for at least one minute. The date and time of each vomiting episode was recorded by participants in diaries at the time of occurrence. The percentage of participants with no vomiting and no retching episodes in the delayed phase, defined as the time period of &gt;24 to120 hours post initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 1, was calculated.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced a Complete Response During the Delayed Phase (&gt;24 to 120 Hours Post Initiation of Chemotherapy) in Cycle 1</title>
          <description>Complete Response was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication following the initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1. A vomiting episode was specified as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes were separated by the absence of emesis and retching for at least one minute. The date and time of each vomiting episode was recorded by participants in diaries at the time of occurrence. The percentage of participants with no vomiting and no retching episodes in the delayed phase, defined as the time period of &gt;24 to120 hours post initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 1, was calculated.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not it is considered related to the study drug. A statistical analysis was performed for Tier 2 AEs in Cycle 1 to compare the percentage of participants who received fosaprepitant regimen and experienced at least 1 Tier 2 AE compared with the percentage of participants in the control regimen.

Tier 2 AEs were not pre-specified as events of interest and inclusion in the Tier 2 analysis required that at least 4 participants in any treatment group exhibited the AE.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced No Vomiting, Regardless of Rescue Medication Use, During the Overall Phase (0 to 120 Hours Post Initiation of Chemotherapy) in Cycle 1</title>
          <description>Vomiting was assessed, regardless of rescue medicine use, following the initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1. A vomiting episode was specified as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes were separated by the absence of emesis and retching for at least one minute. The date and time of each vomiting episode was recorded by participants in diaries at the time of occurrence. Rescue medication was permitted to alleviate symptoms of established nausea or vomiting; but not as preventive medication. The percentage of participants with no vomiting and no retching episodes in the overall phase, defined as the time period of 0 to 120 hours post initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 1, was calculated.</description>
