        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Signed informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health
             information

               -  Age ≥18 years

               -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

               -  Serum HbA1c ≥ 5.5% and ≤10% within 12 months of randomization. (It is important
                  to be certain that the patients in the READ-4 Study have diabetes, which will
                  suggest that the macular edema is secondary to diabetes. The American Diabetes
                  Association has suggested that a HbA1c ≥ 5.5% may suggest the presence of
                  diabetes mellitus.)

               -  Have diabetic macular edema (DME) with central subfield thickness of ≥ 310
                  microns on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).

               -  Retinal thickening secondary to diabetes mellitus involving the center of the
                  fovea (centered-involved macular edema).

               -  Best corrected visual acuity score in the study eye of 20/32 to 20/400 inclusive
                  (Snellen equivalents using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
                  protocol at a distance of 4 meters). If both eyes are eligible, the investigator
                  will select the eye to be enrolled as the study eye. There is no specific visual
                  acuity requirement for the fellow eye at time of study eye enrollment. However,
                  if the fellow eye is to receive ranibizumab, it must have an entry visual acuity
                  of 20/32 to 20/400 inclusive (Snellen equivalents using the Early Treatment
                  Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol at a distance of 4 meters) at the
                  time of the initial treatment.

               -  In the opinion of the investigator, decreased vision in the study eye is due to
                  foveal thickening from diabetic macular edema (DME) and not from other obvious
                  causes of decreased vision.

                  (IUD))

               -  If a non-sterile male, commitment to the use of effective contraception (birth
                  control) for the duration of the study is necessary.

        Exclusion Criteria:
