    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled study to evaluate the effect of providing prescribing
      feedback that includes individual patient data to General Practitioners (GP) in Scotland on
      high risk or low quality prescribing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study makes use of data held in the Prescription Information System (PIS), the national
      database available to national health service (NHS) health boards in Scotland, on all
      prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists which include the unique patient identifier
      for Scotland (CHI).

      The design is a two parallel arm cluster randomised trial with general practices as the unit
      of randomisation to whom the feedback intervention is directed, and outcomes measured at
      patient level. Both arms receive the same active interventions but focused on different
      topics, with each acting as control to the other.

      The primary outcome in the asthma arm is a composite of measure of potentially high-risk
      asthma prescribing (multiple short acting beta-agonists or single agent long acting
      beta-agonists both in the absence of inhaled corticosteroid therapy).

      The primary outcome in the urinary tract infection antibiotic arm is a measure of repeated
      use of single (likely long-term prevention) or multiple (repeated treatment courses) urinary
      tract infection antibiotics.

      Within the feedback, alongside the patient-level analysis, there will be action-orientated
      messages to guide the GP practice.

      GP practices will get the reports three times at six-monthly intervals.

    <description>Prescription Data Feedback to GP Practices - practices will be fed back data for people with presumed asthma who have either been dispensed more than 12 short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilators in the last 12 months who are not concurrently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (poor asthma control with inadequate prevention) or been dispensed a long-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator as a single agent in the last 12 months who are not or are only infrequently concurrently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (potentially harmful prescribing). To minimise inclusion of people with COPD, patient aged 35 years and older prescribed long-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilators will be excluded.
Practices in the bronchodilator arm are controls for the antibiotic experimental arm (below).</description>

    <description>Prescription Data Feedback to GP Practices - number of women in the GP practice aged 12 years and older dispensed more than 6 courses of urinary tract infection (UTI) antibiotics in the last year. UTI antibiotics are defined as trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, co-trimoxazole, quinolones and cefalexin.
Practices in the antibiotic arm are controls for the bronchodilator experimental arm (above).</description>
