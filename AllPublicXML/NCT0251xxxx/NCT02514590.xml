  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the Stimwave Spinal Cord
      Stimulator (SCS) System for treatment of chronic pain utilizing high frequency (10,000 Hz)
      waveforms in comparison to traditional stimulation settings.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized study in which subjects will receive a
      Freedom SCS System and be randomized 1:1 to receive either HF (10,000 Hz) or LF (5 Hz to 1500
      Hz) stimulation parameters. Enrollment will continue until 80 responders at end of trial have
      been identified. A description of the Freedom SCS System can be found in Appendix A.

      Subjects will have chronic back or back and leg pain refractory to standard medical treatment
      associated with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). Subjects will be randomized into either
      the test (high frequency) or control (low frequency) group for a 6-month period after a
      maximum one-month trial period. At the end of 6 months follow-up, all subjects will assess
      the outcomes of their appointed therapy and continue with long-term use of the system.

      Stimulators will be placed at the following sites to target the painful area:

        -  High Frequency (HF) Group: Epidural Space midline covering vertebrae levels T8 through
           T11 (one stimulator placed at the top of T8 and the second stimulator placed at the
           middle of T9).

        -  Low Frequency (LF) Group: Epidural Space covering vertebrae level determined by
           paresthesia mapping for painful area.
