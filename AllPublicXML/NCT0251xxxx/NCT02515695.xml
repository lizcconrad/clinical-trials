    <textblock>
      Phase I study aiming at:

        -  assessing the absolute bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile, and dose
           proportionality of interferon beta-1a (HSA-free solution in pre-filled syringes) after
           i.v. and s.c. administration as well as the pharmacodynamic profile to create the link
           with available surrogate markers investigated with both formulations used clinically,
           lyophilisate with HSA (HSA+) and solution without HSA (HSA-);

        -  gathering further information on safety and tolerability of interferon beta-1a over dose
           range,including local and systemic tolerance, body temperature, vital signs, and a
           battery of exploratory sickness behavior tests.

    <description>All 12 subjects participated in 4 periods, receiving 4 different doses of interferon beta-1a from 2 of the 4 possible pairs of treatments.
The number of treatment sequences was limited to 6 and the subjects were randomized among the 6 sequences, as one male and one female per sequence. Thus 6 subjects received each dose. The washout period between two injections (Day 1 of subsequent periods) was of 7 days or more.</description>
