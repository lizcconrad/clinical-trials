    <textblock>
      This study measured the impact and cost-effectiveness of a low-cost, non-monetary incentive
      (&quot;mama kit&quot;) on rural facility delivery rates in Zambia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clustered randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of providing a package of
      childcare items (a cloth, baby diaper, and blanket) to women conditional upon delivering at a
      facility on facility delivery rates in rural Serenje and Chadiza Districts in Zambia.
      Facilities were randomized to either provide the intervention or not. Facility-level
      antenatal care (ANC) and delivery registers were used to measure the percentage of women
      attending antenatal care who delivered at a study facility during the intervention period.
      Results from the trial were then used to model the cost-effectiveness of mama kits at-scale
      in terms of cost per death averted.

    <description>A low-cost non-monetary incentive (mama kit) was provided to all women who delivered at the facility between June 1, 2013 - Aug 31, 2013. Women were told about the intervention during ANC, and safe motherhood groups in the community promoted the intervention in the catchment areas of the treatment facilities.</description>
