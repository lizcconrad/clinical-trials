  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of using mobile technology for:

        1. Implementing the recommendations of the Antenatal and postnatal mental health: clinical
           management and service guidance NICE guideline for recognising depression (i.e., Whooley
           questions followed by a validated screening instrument such as the Edinburgh Postnatal
           Depression Scale) during pregnancy using iPad Air tablets in the waiting area of general
           practices, midwifery services, or hospitals during antenatal clinics; and

        2. Using a bespoke app running on pregnant women's own smartphones to monitor mood and
           symptoms of depression throughout pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of our first aim, we will assess the psychometric properties of the Whooley
      questions, by comparing the answers given to these questions against the scores obtained on
      the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and we will manipulate the survey questionnaire
      layout of the Whooley Questions and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in order to
      ensure that this survey design choice does not affect data quality. As part of our second
      aim, we will compare two prospective sampling protocols on patient compliance and engagement
      with the app.

      We will use a parallel, randomised control trial study design. Participation in each part of
      the study (i.e., iPads in antenatal clinics, or app running on own handset) will be
      independent from each other. Those participants consenting to get involved in the part of the
      study assessing the use of iPads in antenatal clinics will be randomly assigned to complete
      (i) an app version of the Whooley questions and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in
      which the questionnaires are presented using a scrolling layout (i.e., App screening -
      Scrolling), or (ii) an app version of the Whooley questions and the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale in which the questionnaires are presented using a paging layout (i.e., App
      screening - Paging).

      Participants consenting to get involved in the part of the study assessing the use of an app
      running on participants' own devices will be randomly allocated to one of two sampling
      protocols: (i) a prospective sampling protocol of 6 months consisting of the Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale and 5 momentary questions related to mood; or (ii) a prospective
      sampling protocol of 6 months consisting of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.

      We will utilise a block randomisation procedure (with blocks of 4) to generate our allocation
      sequence. Random numbers will be generated using Stata 13.0. Researchers conducting
      participant recruitment will not be involved in this randomisation procedure in order to
      avoid recruitment bias.

    <description>This will be the time elapsed (in seconds) between the participants starting to read the basic instructions on how to complete the survey questionnaires and the participant completing the EPDS. These actions will be indicated by participants pressing the Start button on the device screen and when a message acknowledging that they have completed the survey questionnaires is displayed on the device screen. This component will be broken down further into the individual survey questionnaires that participants will be required to complete (i.e., personal demographic information, Whooley questions, and EPDS). In addition, we will account for the time that participants spend experiencing problems, distractions or making requests for help or clarification.</description>

    <description>A complete record will be defined as one in which no question was left unanswered. Leaving unanswered questions will not be possible due to the implementation of validation procedures. Therefore, data completeness will be indicated by the breakoff rates.</description>

    <intervention_name>Whooley Questions</intervention_name>
    <description>The Whooley questions are a case-finding instrument for depression in primary care. This 2-question instrument screens for depressed mood and anhedonia that have been present during the past month. Respondents are required to answer Yes or No to each of these questions. An affirmative answer to any of them should be followed by further assessment, including the use of a validated screening instrument or referral to a general practitioner or a mental health practitioner.</description>

    <intervention_name>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale</intervention_name>
    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item self-administered survey that screens for symptoms such as feelings of guilt, sleep disturbance, reduced energy levels, anhedonia and suicidal ideation that have been present during the 7 days preceding its administration. Each question is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 points. Overall scores between 10 and 12 points suggest increased risk for depression; scores of 13 points or above indicate that the diagnostic criteria for major depression disorder have probably been met. In addition, item 10 deals with suicidal thoughts. The EPDS is a valid and reliable tool for identifying women at risk of depression, both during pregnancy and postpartum, and is sensitive to changes in the severity of depression over time.</description>
