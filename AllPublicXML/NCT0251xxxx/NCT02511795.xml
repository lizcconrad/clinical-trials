      The purpose of this Phase 1b, multi-centre, dose escalation study is to find the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AZD1775 combined with olaparib in patients with refractory solid
      tumours

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, multi-centre study of AZD1775 combined with olaparib administered orally
      in patients with refractory solid tumours, or as combination therapy for relapsed small-cell
      lung cancer (SCLC). There are 2 parts to the study:

      Part A: Dose Escalation Part B: Dose Expansion

      In Part A, patients with refractory solid tumours will be assessed for safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD 1775 when combined with olaparib. Different dose levels will
      be administered to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      The dose expansion part (Part B) will further explore the safety, PK, and preliminary
      efficacy of the AZD1775 RP2D and dosing schedule for the treatment of patients with SCLC who
      previously had a confirmed response (either a Complete Response or Partial Response) to
      first-line platinum therapy and then relapsed. Patients who progressed whilst on
      platinum-containing therapy (platinum refractory) are not permitted to enter the study..

      An olaparib pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study will precede the combined treatment with AZD1775
      and olaparib for all patients in Part A. In the sub-study single agent olaparib will be given
      orally BID for 3 or 5 consecutive days and venous blood samples will be collected on Day 3 or
      Day 5 as appropriate for assessment of the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of single agent
      olaparib. Patients will experience a short gap in treatment (approximately 4-5 days) between
      Day 3 or Day 5 of the olaparib PK sub-study and Cycle 1 Day 1 of the combination treatment.

      Patients will continue to receive treatment with AZD1775 and Olaparib until disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met.

             leukaemia or features suggestive of MDS/AML.

         15. Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months as defined
             by New York Heart Association (NYHA) ≥ Class 2.

             Unstable angina pectoris Congestive heart failure Acute myocardial infarction
             Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication Significant
             ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with chronic rate controlled
             atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities are eligible)

         16. AZD1775 should not be given to patients who have a history of Torsades des pointes
             (TdP) unless all risk factors that contributed to TdP have been corrected.

         17. Mean resting corrected QTc interval using the Fridericia formula [QTcF]) ≥ 470 msec
             for female patients and ≥ 450 msec for male patients from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs)
             performed 2-5 minutes apart at study entry or congenital long QT syndrome. .

         18. Pregnant or breastfeeding.

         19. Serious known active infection at the time of enrolment, or another serious underlying
             medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive study
             treatment.

         20. Presence of other known active invasive cancers.

         21. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with protocol.

         22. Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (&lt; 3
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

         23. Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         24. Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or non-leukocyte depleted whole blood
             transfusion within 120 days of genetic sample collection will exclude patients from
             the pharmacogenetic portion of the study. If a patient declines to participate in the
             optional exploratory pharmacogenetic research, there will be no penalty or loss of
             benefit to the patient. The patient will not be excluded from other aspects of the
             study.
