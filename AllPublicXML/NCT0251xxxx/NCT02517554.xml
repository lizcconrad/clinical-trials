      The goal of this research is to evaluate the relative advantage of remote counseling over
      usual care in community health practices without access to genetic services. We will evaluate
      ability of remote telemedicine, referred to going forward as TeleGenetic services (phone or
      videoconferencing), to increase uptake of genetic testing and identification of genetic
      carriers compared to usual care. Secondly, we will evaluate the advantages of
      videoconferencing over telephone for delivery of remote genetic services and the short-term
      and longitudinal outcomes of TeleGenetic services in socio-demographically diverse patients
      in community practices.
