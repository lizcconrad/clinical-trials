      Background:

        -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and/or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are tumors of
           abnormal B cells that often affect elderly patients. Studies have identified critical
           factors required for the growth of CLL cells. First, CLL cells survive because they
           receive signals through the B-cell receptor. Second, CLL cells benefit from interactions
           with other cells, especially T cells.

        -  Survival signals through the B-cell receptor can be reduced with ibrutinib, which is a
           pill taken daily by mouth. Ibrutinib has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
           Administration to treat CLL patients.

        -  T cells that interact with CLL cells can be removed by fludarabine, which is a drug
           given by vein and has been widely used to treat CLL. By adding a short course of
           fludarabine, we hope to complement the action of ibrutinib and restore a healthier
           immune system.

      Objectives:

      - To determine if ibrutinib and a short course of fludarabine can be used safely and
      effectively to treat CLL or SLL.

      Eligibility:

        -  Diagnosed with CLL or SLL requiring treatment

        -  No prior treatment for CLL or SLL

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Not pregnant or breast-feeding women

        -  Adequate kidney and liver function

      Study Design:

        -  This is a phase II study of 32 patients.

        -  Participants will be screened with blood tests and physical exam for eligibility.

        -  Eligible participants will be treated with ibrutinib and a short course of fludarabine;

             -  Treatment is given in cycles. Each cycle is defined as 28 days. Treatment continues
                as long as it is effective and safe for participants.

             -  Ibrutinib is taken by mouth starting on the first day of cycle 1. Ibrutinib is
                continued daily.

             -  Fludarabine is given through vein on the first five days of cycle 3 and 4 only.
                Each infusion takes approximately 30 minutes.

             -  Participants will also take drugs that prevent infections and other complications.

        -  Participants under treatment will have clinic visits with tests including:

             -  Medical history

             -  Physical exam

             -  Blood and urine tests

             -  CT and PET scans: They will lie in a machine that uses a computer to take serial
                images of the body.

             -  For the PET scan, a radioactive sugar is injected into a vein for clear
                visualization of the body.

             -  EKG: To assess heart rhythm.

             -  Bone marrow and lymph node biopsies

        -  Participants should avoid grapefruit, Seville oranges, and grapefruit juice during the
           study. They also should avoid any live vaccines.

      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and/or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are tumors of B
      cells that often affect elderly patients. While the cause of CLL is still unclear, studies
      have indicated critical factors required for the tumor cells. First, CLL cells grow and
      survive because they receive signals through the B-cell receptor (BCR); and second, CLL cells
      benefit from interactions with other cells, especially T cells.

      The stimulation through the BCR can be reduced with ibrutinib, which is an oral drug that
      selectively inhibits Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK). In clinical trials, ibrutinib
      demonstrated safety and high response rates in patients with high-risk disease. Ibrutinib has
      gained FDA approval as a treatment for CLL patients with 17p deletion and for those who had
      at least one prior therapy. However, single-agent ibrutinib has limitations; the drug does
      not eliminate all the tumor cells and, with time, the tumor cells may become resistant.
      Therefore, combination of ibrutinib with other drugs could be beneficial. Here we chose
      fludarabine because it is a well-tolerated drug that has been used widely to treat CLL. Also,
      fludarabine can kill both malignant B cells and T cells that support the growth of leukemia
      cells. With this approach we hope to restore healthier immune system.

      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib combined with fludarabine.
      This protocol is intended for previously untreated CLL patients. Ibrutinib will be given
      daily until disease progression or intolerable side effects occur. Fludarabine will be given
      only in cycles 3 and 4.
