    <textblock>
      A Phase 1a, randomized, placebo controlled, two-way crossover study is to determine the
      effect of inhaled MMI-0100 compared to placebo following LPS challenge on inflammatory
      markers.

      The purpose of this Phase 1a, randomized, placebo controlled, two-way crossover study is to
      determine the effect of inhaled MMI-0100 compared to placebo on inflammatory markers
      following 5 days once daily (qd) dose of MMI-0100 or placebo administered by inhalation. On
      Day 5 of each treatment period, subjects will be challenged with inhaled LPS.
      Pharmacokinetics and biomarkers will be conducted at selected timepoints.

             compromise the results or interpretation of the study

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal value or physical finding that may interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results or constitute a health risk for the subject if
