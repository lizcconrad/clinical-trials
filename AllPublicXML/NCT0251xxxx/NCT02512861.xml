    <textblock>
      All pediatric patients who undergo cardiac surgery require analgesic medications for
      postoperative pain control and many require sedation to facilitate comfort with cares.
      Parasternal infiltration of local anesthetic for nerve blocks is a simple option to
      postoperative analgesia. The investigators hypothesize that Bupivacaine, a parasternal nerve
      block administered in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery will reduce the
      requirement of Opioids and other pain medications as well as decrease postoperative pain
      scores. This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Subjects are
      randomized to receive either 0.25% Bupivacaine or normal saline following their
      cardiothoracic surgery.

    <textblock>
      One of the most challenging struggles in clinical practices in pediatric cardiac intensive
      care units is the provision of optimal and safe postoperative analgesia and sedation. All
      pediatric patients who undergo cardiac surgery require analgesic medications for
      postoperative pain control and many require sedation to facilitate comfort with cares.
      Parasternal infiltration of local anesthetic for nerve blocks is a simple option to
      postoperative analgesia. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic that can be injected into the
      intercostal spaces on each side of a sternotomy to induce nerve block.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of Bupivacaine as a nerve block in
      children undergoing cardiothoracic surgery will reduce postoperative pain medication use and
      decrease postoperative pain scores. The investigators hypothesize that the administration of
      Bupivacaine bilaterally into the posterior intercostal spaces on each side of a sternotomy
      following cardiothoracic surgery will reduce the requirement of pain medications as well as
      decrease postoperative pain scores.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, control study. Subjects are randomized into
      two arms: those who receive 0.25% Bupivacaine and those who receive placebo (normal saline).
      Subjects receive 1 milliliter per kilogram up to 20 kilograms, then 0.5 milliliters per
      kilogram up to 50 kilograms of study drug.

      Subjects are followed for 5 days postoperatively, then on day of discharge. Pain medication
      administered and FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) scores are recorded daily
      for 5 days.
