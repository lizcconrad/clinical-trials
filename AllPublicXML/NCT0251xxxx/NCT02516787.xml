    <textblock>
      Alongside a well-known physiological deconditioning, such as a decrease in muscle mass or
      bone demineralization, extended stays in weightlessness also cause cognitive dysfunction.
      However, the studies on this subject during space missions short or long term could not
      determine how these cognitive dysfunction resulted from a direct effect of weightlessness or
      a stress-related effect.

      Analysis of electro-encephalography (EEG) using a standardized mapping method is used to
      study the changes of operation of the cerebral cortex as the near infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS) is a reflection of changes in the cerebral hemodynamics. Their combined use is a
      relatively simple and economical method for studying brain changes in an environment where
      the normal brain imaging techniques can not be used.

      The main objective of this experiment is to evaluate the alterations in brain cortical
      activity and brain oxygenation level induced by micro- and hypergravity conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  healthy volunteers (men or women),

          -  aged from 18 to 65,

          -  affiliated to a Social Security system and, for non-French resident, holding an
             European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)

          -  who accept to take part in the study,

          -  who have given their written stated consent,

          -  who already participated in parabolic flights (even in the same campaign)

          -  All subjects will pass a medical examination similar to a standard aviation medical
             examination for private pilot aptitude (JAR FCL3 Class 2 medical examination). There
             will be no additional test performed for subject selection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons who took part in a previous biomedical research protocol, of which exclusion
             period is not terminated,

          -  Persons with prior serious injuries to their head

          -  Persons who take any medication or drugs influencing their central nervous system or
             cognitive performance

          -  Pregnant women.
