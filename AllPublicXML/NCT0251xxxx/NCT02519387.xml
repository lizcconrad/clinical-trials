  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, open-label and single-arm study of patients with non-malignant pain due
      to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, low back pain and joint/muscle pain, who were not
      responding to non-opioid analgesics. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of
      buprenorphine transdermal patch for pain control among these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine transdermal (BTDs) is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic. Earlier studies have
      shown BTDs to be non-inferior to an oral codeine-paracetamol combination and
      prolonged-release tramadol, in terms of pain control as well as sleep quality. BTDs is
      registered for use in Malaysia but the scientific data on efficacy and tolerability among
      Malaysians was not available. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of BTDs among Malaysian patients.

      Patients eligible for entry into the study were adults aged ≥ 40 years who met the inclusion
      criteria and qualified from baseline screening and liver function test (LFT) assessment. The
      study excluded patients who met the exclusion criteria and failed prior the LFT assessment.
      Patients received an initial dose of 5 mg BTDs after qualifying on the baseline screening and
      LFT test. The dose could be up-titrated to a maximum of BTDs 20mg (2 X 10 mg) to achieve
      stable pain control.

      There were six visits during the three-month study period. At visit 1, patients received 5mg
      of Sovenor® as initial treatment dose. Visit 2 occurred 7 days after the first visit; visit 2
      and visit 3 were dose titration visits. Visit 4 and visit 5, were for assessment purposes.
      Primary treatment efficacy was measured during each visit with additional assessments of
      patients' sleep quality and quality of life, while physicians' and patients' treatment
      satisfaction assessed during the final visit. Safety was measured by monitoring the
      occurrence of adverse events (AEs).

    <time_frame>Baseline,3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BS-11 (Box score-11) pain score was the main efficacy outcome measured in this study. The scores at baseline (Visit 1) and Visit 6 (3 months from baseline visit) are reported.
BS-11 is an 11-point scale measuring pain intensity. It ranges from 0 to 10, whereby 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst imaginable pain. Subjects selected a number based on the pain intensity they were feeling at that time.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sleep Quality as Determined by the 8-item Global Sleep Quality Assessment (GSQA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will evaluate the degree of their sleep disturbance due to pain and improvement in quality of sleep using the GSQA questionnaire comprising of 8 questions, at baseline (Visit 1) and Visit 6 (3 months from baseline visit).
The scores at baseline and Visit 6 are calculated for the following 8 items with scores of:
Trouble falling asleep due to pain -- on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is never and 10 is always
Need for pain medication to sleep -- as above
Need for sleep medication to sleep -- as above
Awakened by pain at night -- as above
Awakened by pain in the morning -- as above
Pain affecting partner's sleep -- as above
Rate own sleep quality -- on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very good and 5 is very poor

        <title>Change in Box Scale-11 (BS-11) Pain Score</title>
        <description>The BS-11 (Box score-11) pain score was the main efficacy outcome measured in this study. The scores at baseline (Visit 1) and Visit 6 (3 months from baseline visit) are reported.
BS-11 is an 11-point scale measuring pain intensity. It ranges from 0 to 10, whereby 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst imaginable pain. Subjects selected a number based on the pain intensity they were feeling at that time.</description>

The scores at baseline and Visit 6 are calculated for the following 8 items with scores of:
Trouble falling asleep due to pain -- on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is never and 10 is always
Need for pain medication to sleep -- as above
Need for sleep medication to sleep -- as above
Awakened by pain at night -- as above
Awakened by pain in the morning -- as above
