      The aim of this phase 2 study is to demonstrate that KIR-ligand mismatched haploBMT with
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide will improve progression free survival in poor risk multiple
      myeloma patients.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new treatment modality, the
      KIR-ligand mismatched haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploBMT), for poor risk
      multiple myeloma (MM) patients. MM is a malignancy of plasma cells that usually resides in
      the bone marrow. Despite new treatment modalities that have been introduced in the last
      years, MM is still an incurable disease for most patients and median survival for the younger
      patients (&lt;65) is about 5 years. MM can be treated by several disease modifiers - classical
      chemotherapy, high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT),
      immunomodulators like thalidomide and lenalidomide, and drugs like bortezomib that interact
      with relevant intracellular pathways of malignant plasma cells. Though these treatment
      modalities have improved overall survival and quality of life, patients are not cured.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with MM &lt;60 years.

          -  Poor prognosis MM patients, permissive for KIR-ligand mismatch and with a KIR-ligand
             mismatched haploidentical donor. Poor prognosis is based on:

               -  Patients with early disease recurrence (within 12 months after first ASCT) or

               -  Patients after a minimum of three lines of chemotherapy (including high dose
                  therapy followed by ASCT rescue therapy) or

               -  Poor risk based on the cytogenetic profile.

          -  Written informed consent

          -  No HLA identical related or 10/10 matched unrelated donor

          -  Permissive for KIR-ligand mismatch

          -  Responsive after reinduction therapy

          -  Measurable disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Patients with an full matched (10/10) donor, who will enroll in the HOVON 96 study

          -  Active uncontrolled infections

          -  Uncontrolled CNS involvement by the malignant disease

          -  Severe cardiovascular disease (arrhythmias requiring chronic treatment, congestive
             heart failure or symptomatic ischemic heart disease)

          -  Severe pulmonary dysfunction (CTCAE grade III-IV)

          -  Severe neurological or psychiatric disease

          -  Significant hepatic dysfunction (serum bilirubin or transaminases â‰¥ 3 times upper
             limit of normal)

          -  Significant renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min after rehydration)

          -  History of active malignancy during the past 5 years with the exception of basal
             carcinoma of the skin or stage 0 cervical carcinoma

          -  Any psychological, familial, lingual, sociological and geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule

          -  Breast-feeding female patients.
