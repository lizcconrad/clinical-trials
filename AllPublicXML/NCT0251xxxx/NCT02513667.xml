  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an, open-label, two-cohort protocol designed to evaluate the activity of targeted
      therapy and SABR in ALK positive lung adenocarcinoma.

      Cohort A will evaluate the combination in ALK-inhibitor naïve patients. Cohort B will
      evaluate the combination in patients who have received treatment with one prior ALK
      inhibitor.

      Ceritinib will be administered to the patient until disease progression by RECIST 1.1,
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of the trial for any other
      reason including death.

      The primary focus of this protocol is identifying response in ALK+ lung cancer patients.
      Patients with Ventana assay and Vysis FISH probe positive tumors will be treated. Evidence of
      ALK gene rearrangement will also be considered eligible for the trial.

      Primary Objective:

      Cohort A: Superiority of ceritinib + SABR median PFS compared to historical control of 10
      months (expected to be 20 months)

      Endpoint:

      Cohort A Median PFS defined as time from initiation of ceritinib until disease progression by
      RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of the trial for
      any other reason including death.

      Primary:

      Cohort B: Superiority of ceritinib + SABR median PFS compared to historical control of 7
      months.

      Endpoint:

      Cohort B: Median PFS defined as time from initiation of ceritinib until disease progression
      by RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of the trial
      for any other reason including death.

      Secondary:

        -  Report Overall survival Overall survival

        -  Report Time to 2nd SABR Time from start of systemic therapy to first day of second
           course of SABR

        -  Report Time to 3rd SABR Time from start of therapy to first day of third course of SABR

        -  Report proportion of patients CR/PR/stable disease at 6 and12 months Number of patients
           with CR/PR/stable disease for 6 and 12 months after initiation

      Safety:

      -Demonstrate safety of ceritinib followed by SABR Describe toxicity and adverse events (CTCAE
      v.4) compared to historical controls.

             positive hCG laboratory test.

         12. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and agree to continue for 3 months after the last dose of study
             treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female
                  subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
                  for that subject.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

             In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior
             to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
             not of child bearing potential.

         13. Sexually active males unless they agree to use a condom during intercourse while
             taking drug and agree to continue for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.
             Male patients for 3 months should not father a child in this period. A condom is
             required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug
             via seminal fluid.

         14. Patient has a history of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase or lipase that
             was due to pancreatic disease.

         15. Patient has other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.

         16. Patient has had major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic)
             within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment or has not recovered from side
             effects of such procedure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and mediastinoscopy
             will not be counted as major surgery and patients can receive study treatment ≥1 week
             after these procedures.
