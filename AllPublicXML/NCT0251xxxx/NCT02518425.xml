      In a retrospective analysis of already existing clinical assessment data from patients with
      functional voice disorders the following aspects will be sampled, encoded and analysed:
      Outcomes pre and post treatment of

        1. subjective voice symptoms measured by Voice Handicap Index (VHI-9i),

        2. perceptual voice symptoms according to Grading-Roughness-Breathiness-Asthenia-Strain
           Scale (GRBAS Scale),

        3. instrumental acoustic analysis parameters Jitter (%), speaking voice profile: mean and
           range of speaking pitch and intensity, max. intensity and mean pitch of calling voice,
           singing voice: min./max. and range of pitch and intensity, maximum phonation time,
           Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI).

    <description>Instrumental acoustic parameters are determined by a computer-assisted analysis of voice recordings. In the present study the following parameters are measured before and after voice therapy: Jitter % (deviation of fundamental frequency), mean and range of speaking pitch and intensity, maximum intensity and mean pitch of calling voice, minimum and max. and range of pitch and intensity of the singing voice, and the composite measure Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI).</description>
