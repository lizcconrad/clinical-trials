  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the anti-angiogenic effect of
      bevacizumab measured by CTP as a predictive marker for efficacy measured by progression-free
      survival (PFS) in mCRC patients under first-line bevacizumab-containing,
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      So far, CTP has provided non-invasive imaging of tumor biological response to anti-angiogenic
      and vascular targeting agents in a number of clinical trials with increasing clinical
      application. CTP can be examined with a variety of commercially available CE-certified CT
      scanners and imaging post-processing is possible with commercially available CE-certified
      software from different vendors, too. In several studies, anti-angiogenic effects have been
      detected with CTP but further evidence for its clinical validation has to be proven in
      clinical trials.

      Changes in tumor vasculature measured by CTP will be correlated to the clinical efficacy
      parameters progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate, thus identifying a
      group of patients who profit most from the anti-angiogenic treatment.
