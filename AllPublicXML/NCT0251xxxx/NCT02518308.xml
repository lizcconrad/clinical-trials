  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
      intervention works in reducing anxiety in patients who have undergone treatment for
      gynecologic cancer but no longer have any sign of disease. Gynecologic cancer is cancer of
      the female reproductive tract, which includes the cervix, endometrium, fallopian tubes,
      ovaries, uterus, and vagina. Side effects from treatment for these cancers may include
      anxiety, fatigue, depression, and sexual function changes. Mindfulness training uses
      meditation and yoga to help patients focus on breathing, bodily sensations, and mental
      awareness. This may help decrease patients' stress and anxiety and improve their quality of
      life, and may also help their immune system.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 Arms.

      ARM I (INTERVENTION): Patients undergo an 8-week MBSR course, comprising weekly 2.5 hour
      classes and one 6-hour Saturday class at week 6 or 7. The MBSR program involves instruction
      in mindfulness meditation and yoga, and gives homework assignments involving practicing the
      well-being techniques taught in class. Patients are required to record and report time spent
      on home practice in a journal daily, and receive a weekly reminder to report their home
      practice.

      ARM II (WAIT-LIST CONTROL): Patients do not participate in the intervention, but are given
      the option to be placed on a waitlist for the MBSR course and may complete it within 6 months
      after the final study visit.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 8 weeks (at completion of study) and 5
      months (3 months from study completion).
