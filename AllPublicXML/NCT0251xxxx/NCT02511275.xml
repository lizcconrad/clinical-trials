  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery plays a central role in kidney cancer management being the only therapy that offers
      the possibility of healing the patients. Currently, the partial nephrectomy is a standard
      technique because it meets the principle of nephron sparing surgery. A partial nephrectomy
      requires a control of the renal blood flow using a clamp, which can be parenchymal or
      vascular (pedicular). In France, most of the centers use pedicular clamping. It is well
      established that this technique results in warm ischemia of the entire healthy parenchyma and
      can lead to permanent kidney damages. Currently, no study evaluated the impact of parenchymal
      clamping on the healthy parenchyma.

      The aim of the investigators study is to evaluate the nephrotoxicity of the healthy
      parenchyma due to parenchymal clamping during partial nephrectomy. This assessment will be
      done through a microdialysis technique. The microdialysis probe is directly implanted in the
      healthy unclamped parenchyma and will allow us to measure in real time, during the surgery,
      the biological changes related to anaerobic metabolism of renal interstitial space. All those
      measures will be completed by urinary and plasmatic assessments. Oxidative stress will be
      assessed using four markers of tubular viability : Interleukin 18 (IL18), Kidney Injury
      Molecule-1 (KIM-1), Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C and four
      parameters of anaerobic metabolism : lactate, pyruvate, glycerol and glucose.

      This is a prospective pilot study limited to 10 patients included over 12 months. Depending
      on the results, it will be further developed by a second study comparing parenchymal with
      pedicle clamping.

    <description>Renal microdialysis is an innovative and promising technique in the monitoring of renal ischemia. Its sterile nature enables intraoperative use to give us real-time reflection of the in situ metabolism. In Patients who participated in clinical research with this microinvasive technique, no complications including bleeding has been reported.</description>
