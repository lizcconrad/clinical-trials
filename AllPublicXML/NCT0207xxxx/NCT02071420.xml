      Our objective in this pilot study is to test the combined effect of a) replacing office
      workers' sedentary workstations with active workstations (LifeBalance Station) and b)
      optimizing computer workstation ergonomics on daily occupational sedentary time,
      cardiometabolic risk factors, musculoskeletal symptom health outcomes and work productivity.

      Primary Aim: To compare the effects of providing sedentary employees with seated active
      workstations in combination with an ergonomic intervention and regular motivational emails
      (experimental group) against the ergonomic intervention and regular emails only (active
      control group) on occupational sedentary behavior over 16 weeks.

      Hypothesis: The addition of a seated active workstation will result in significant reductions
      in daily occupational sedentary time compared to the active control group.

      Secondary Aims: To compare the effects of the experimental group against the active control
      group on secondary measures of cardiometabolic disease risk factors, musculoskeletal
      discomfort, cognitive function and work productivity.

      Hypothesis 1: The experimental group will result in reduced cardiometabolic disease risk,
      musculoskeletal discomfort and work limitations compared to the active control group.

The monitor will be worn on the right ankle and will be worn for 5 working days during all non-bathing hours. The outcome measure will be change in occupational activity (average counts/work day) from baseline to 16 weeks. The measure will be calculated as follows: 16 weeks value - baseline value.</description>

Email Intervention: Participants of both arms will receive three emails per week for 16 weeks. Messages will be consistent with what they hear in the ergonomic intervention (e.g., encourage taking breaks from sitting at work and adjusting posture to be in line with ergonomic principles).

          <title>Change in Occupational Physical Activity From Baseline to 16 Weeks</title>
          <description>Occupational physical activity (primary outcome) will be measured objectively with the GENEActiv physical activity monitor. The monitor will be worn on the right ankle and will be worn for 5 working days during all non-bathing hours. The outcome measure will be change in occupational activity (average counts/work day) from baseline to 16 weeks. The measure will be calculated as follows: 16 weeks value - baseline value.</description>

          <description>This group will receive the seated active workstation intervention, the ergonomic intervention and the email intervention for 16 weeks.
Active Workstation Intervention: Participants in the experimental group will receive a seated active workstation at their work setting for 16 weeks.
Ergonomic Intervention: Participants of both arms will receive a face to face ergonomic workstation optimization intervention. This consultation will take 30 minutes to complete and will be performed at the participant's actual work station.
Email Intervention: Participants of both arms will receive three emails per week for 16 weeks. Messages will be consistent with what they hear in the ergonomic intervention (e.g., encourage taking breaks from sitting at work and adjusting posture to be in line with ergonomic principles).
