  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many tumor cells, in contrast to normal cells, have been shown to require the amino acid
      glutamine to produce energy for growth and survival. To exploit the dependence of tumors on
      glutamine, CB-839, a potent and selective inhibitor of the first enzyme in glutamine
      utilization, glutaminase, will be tested in this Phase 1 study in patients with advanced
      hematologic malignancies.

      This study is an open-label Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 in subjects with hematological
      tumors. Patients will receive CB-839 capsules orally two or three times daily. The study will
      be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study to identify the recommended Phase
      2 dose and will enroll patients with advanced and/or treatment-refractory Non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (NHL), Multiple Myeloma (MM), or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM)

      In Part 2, all patients will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose. This part will enroll
      patients with advanced and/or treatment-refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), Multiple
      Myeloma (MM), or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM). All patients will be assessed for
      safety, pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration of drug), pharmacodynamics (inhibition of
      glutaminase), biomarkers (biochemical markers that may predict responsiveness in later
      studies), and tumor response.

      As an extension of Part 2, a cohort of patients with relapsed and refractory MM will be
      enrolled to receive low dose dexamethasone and CB-839. A second cohort of patients with
      relapsed or refractory disease following at least 2 prior treatment regimens will be enrolled
      to receive CB-839 in combination with standard-dose pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone
      to further evaluate this triple combination.
