  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and pidilizumab
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back
      (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Biological therapies, such as
      lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from
      growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pidilizumab, can block cancer growth by blocking the
      ability of cancer to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide with pidilizumab may work better in
      treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and efficacy of CT-011 (pidilizumab)
      in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid) and assess efficacy in terms of overall response
      rate in patients with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and pidilizumab intravenously
      (IV) over 2 hours on day 3. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
