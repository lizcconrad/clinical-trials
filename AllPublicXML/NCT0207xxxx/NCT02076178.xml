    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase IIa, randomized, multi-site, two-arm, double-blinded study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and acceptability of GSK1265744 long acting injectable formulation
      (744 LA) in adult male subjects. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the injectable
      agent, 744 LA (800 milligrams (mg) dose administered at three time points at 12 week
      intervals) through Week 41 in HIV-uninfected men. Eligible participants will be randomized in
      a 5:1 ratio to receive 744 LA or matching placebo. Participants will receive daily oral 744
      (30 mg tablets) or matching placebo for 4 weeks during the Oral Phase of the study, followed
      by a one week washout period. Following safety lab assessments from the Oral Phase,
      participants will enter the Injection Phase and receive Intramuscular (IM) injections of 744
      LA or placebo at three time points at 12 week intervals. IM injections will consist of 800 mg
      of 744 or a matching control

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 10 centers in United states. Participants who received study medication are being followed for 52 Weeks following their last injection while those in placebo group were followed until all participants completed Week 41. The first subject’s first visit was 27-Mar-2014 and the last subject’s last visit was 15-May-2015.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 205 participants were screened of which 78 participants were not randomized. The remaining 127 participants were randomized to the study treatment who entered the oral and injection phase. Out of this, one participant randomized but withdrawn consent prior to treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Vital signs measurements were performed for SBP and DBP following 5 minutes of rest. Baseline was defined as the first injection at Week 5 for the injection phase. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline value at Week 17, Week 29 and Week 41.</description>

        <title>Plasma Pharmacokinetic Assessment for Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve Over the Dosing Interval [AUC(0-tau)] in the Injection Phase</title>
        <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected starting on the first day of the First Injection Phase prior to the injection. At each injection visit a blood sample was collected prior to the injection at Week 5, Week 17 and Week 29, 1 Week post-injection at Week 6, Week 18, and Week 30, and 12 Week post-injection at Week 17, Week 29, and Week 41. The sample collected 12 Week following each injection served as the pre-dose sample for the subsequent dosing interval. Two additional samples were collected 4 and 8 Week after the first injection (Week 9 and Week 13), and 1 additional sample was collected 6 Week following the second and third injections (Week 23 and Week 35). Assessment was carried out for AUC(0-tau) a measure of the amount of drug available at target tissue (in plasma) for a fixed dosing interval (i.e.12 hours).</description>

Following safety laboratory assessments from the Oral Phase, participants entered the Injection Phase and received IM injections of cabotegravir or placebo at 3 time points at 12 Week intervals (Week 5, Week 17, and Week 29). The IM injections consisted of 800 mg of cabotegravir.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected starting on the first day of the First Injection Phase prior to the injection. At each injection visit a blood sample was collected prior to the injection at Week 5, Week 17 and Week 29, 1 Week post-injection at Week 6, Week 18, and Week 30, and 12 Week post-injection at Week 17, Week 29, and Week 41. The sample collected 12 Week following each injection served as the pre-dose sample for the subsequent dosing interval. Two additional samples were collected 4 and 8 Week after the first injection (Week 9 and Week 13), and 1 additional sample was collected 6 Week following the second and third injections (Week 23 and Week 35). Assessment was carried out for tmax defined as the time to the maximum observed plasma concentration and t½ defined as the time taken for the concentration of drug in the blood to decrease by half of the original amount.</description>

        <description>The median BMI was 26 kilogram per meter square. Plasma pharmacokinetic assessments were performed for AUC (0-tau) by BMI, either above or below the median BMI (50 percent upper and lower, where upper summary included all participants with BMI greater than or equal to the median BMI of the population and lower summary included all participants with BMI below the median BMI). Assessments was also performed for AUC (0-tau) by needle length (1.5 inch and 2 inch). Needle length and BMI were correlated in that the longer needle was recommended for participants with BMI greater than 30 kilogram per meter square.</description>

        <title>Plasma Pharmacokinetic Assessment for Ctau and Cmax by Demographic Factor BMI and Needle Length in the Injection Phase</title>
        <description>The median BMI was 26 kilogram per meter square. Plasma pharmacokinetic assessments were performed for Ctau and Cmax by BMI, either above or below the median BMI (50 percent upper and lower, where upper summary included all participants with BMI greater than or equal to the median BMI of the population and lower summary included all participants with BMI below the median BMI.
). Assessments was also performed for Ctau and Cmax by needle length (1.5 inch and 2 inch). Needle length and BMI were correlated in that the longer needle was recommended for participants with BMI greater than 30 kilogram per meter square.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants received daily oral cabotegravir 30 mg tablets for 4 Week during the Oral Phase of the study, followed by a 1 Week washout period, to assess for safety and tolerability prior to receiving cabotegravir injections. Following safety laboratory assessments from the Oral Phase, participants entered the Injection Phase and received IM injections of cabotegravir or placebo at 3 time points at 12 Week intervals (Week 5, Week 17, and Week 29). The IM injections consisted of 800 mg of cabotegravir.</description>

        <title>Plasma Pharmacokinetic Assessment for Tmax and t½ by Demographic Factor BMI and Needle Length in the Injection Phase</title>
        <description>The median BMI was 26 kilogram per meter square. Plasma pharmacokinetic assessments were performed for tmax and t½ by BMI, either above or below the median BMI (50 percent upper and lower, where upper summary included all participants with BMI greater than or equal to the median BMI of the population and lower summary included all participants with BMI below the median BMI). Assessments was also performed for tmax and t½ by needle length (1.5 inch and 2 inch). Needle length and BMI were correlated in that the longer needle was recommended for participants with BMI greater than 30 kilogram per meter square.</description>

Following safety laboratory assessments from the Oral Phase, participants entered the Injection Phase and received IM injections of cabotegravir or placebo at 3 time points at 12 Week intervals (Week 5, Week 17, and Week 29). The IM injections consisted of 800 mg of cabotegravir.</description>

        <description>Acceptability of cabetogravir injections was assessed number of participants who had severe ISRs and ISR symptom. ISR examination for severity included an assessment of pain, pruritis, warm to touch, bruising, discoloration, erythema, swelling, induration and bump events. Common ISR Symptoms for Injection Phase included pain, erythema, nodules and any other ISRs with greater or equal to five participants. Data has been presented for the injection phase (W5-W41) by grades and needle length.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced Maximum Clinical Chemistry Including Liver Chemistry and Hematology Toxicities in the Oral Phase by Grades</title>
        <description>The severity of clinical chemistry including liver chemistry and hematology toxicities was graded according to the DAIDS table for grading the severity of adult and pediatric AE Version 1.0, December 2004; Clarification August 2009. The DAIDS displays events as Grades 1-5 based on this general guideline: Grade 1, mild; Grade 2, moderate; Grade 3, severe; Grade 4, potentially life threatening. Data for maximum clinical chemistry and hematology toxicities for oral phase (Day 1 upto Week 4) by grades have been presented.</description>
