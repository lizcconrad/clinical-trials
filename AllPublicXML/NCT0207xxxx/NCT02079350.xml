  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the negative impacts of colloid solutions with high molecular weight on renal
      functions, combination of lower molecular weight colloid varieties with crystalloid solutions
      and its use during intraoperative period have been subject to current research. Since the
      first liver transplantation, pre-or post-transplantation renal problems are still among the
      main causes of mortality and morbidity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of
      fluid replacement solutions used intraoperatively on renal functions in elective living-donor
      liver transplantation.This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital and all
      patients were informed and gave written consent. Participants were patients scheduled for
      elective living-donor liver transplantation. Patients with normal renal function were
      randomly allocated to infusion with 6% HES 130/0.4 (HES Group) and 4% Gelofusine (GEL Group).
      Blood samples were obtained before induction of anesthesia (baseline), at the end of the
      operation, and postoperative days 1 and 4. Different eGFR formulas using creatinine (MDRD,
      CKD-EPI, and Cockraud Gault) were used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rates.
