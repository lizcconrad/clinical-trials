    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced hematologic malignancies that
      harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where
      cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is
      a dose expansion phase where four cohorts of patients will receive AG-120 to further evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose. Anticipated
      time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

             based on local or central evaluation.

          -  Subjects must be amenable to serial bone marrow biopsies, peripheral blood sampling,
             and urine sampling during the study.
