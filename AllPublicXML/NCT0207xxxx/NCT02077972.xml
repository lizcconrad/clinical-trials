  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combat-related post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become an increasingly pressing
      public health problem in the United States following the overseas wars of the last decade.
      Rates of PTSD have skyrocketed in the military and among veterans, leading to increased rates
      of suicide, impairment on the job and off, and behavioral changes that negatively affect not
      just the veteran, but also his or her family. Although effective medication and psychotherapy
      treatments exist for combat-related PTSD, many individuals suffering with PTSD do not
      adequately respond to currently available treatment options, highlighting the need to develop
      and test new interventions for the disorder. To address this pressing clinical issue, the
      investigators will conduct a pilot study to determine if Whole Body Hyperthermia (WBH)
      reduces symptoms in adults suffering from combat-related PTSD. The investigators plan to
      recruit a sample of 10 medically healthy individuals with combat-related PTSD who will
      receive a single session of WBH to determine if this single session improves PTSD symptoms
      and, if so, whether this improvement will last at least 2 weeks. To do this, the study will
      include basic clinical and psychiatric assessments immediately before and one and four weeks
      after WBH. Because sleep is so often impaired in PTSD, the investigators will measure at-home
      sleep patterns for a week prior to and a week following the WBH session using sleep diaries
      and a wristwatch actigraphy device. Given scientific evidence from our research group that
      WBH may improve depression, the investigators anticipate that it may also be of benefit or
      adults suffering from combat-related PTSD.

      The investigators will direct a clinical trial of Whole Body Hyperthermia (WBH) for treatment
      of PTSD related to combat exposure. Although the investigators have not yet studied WBH for
      PTSD, the investigators have data indicating that WBH is effective for the acute treatment of
      major depression (MDD). Given the high overlap of symptoms between PTSD and Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD), as well as the fact that most people with PTSD also meet criteria for MDD,
      the investigators have reasons for expecting that WBH may also be of benefit for PTSD. The
      primary objective of the proposed study is to determine if WBH produces improvement in core
      PTSD symptoms, just as it appears to do in MDD. Indeed, in preliminary studies, a single
      exposure to WBH resulted in a downward shift in body temperature and a decrease in depressive
      symptoms as measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (known as
      the ADS in Germany where this study was conducted) 5 days later. In addition, following
      exclusion of one patient with bronchopulmonary inflammation that did not show a decrease in
      body temperature following treatment, a correlation between the shift in body temperature and
      ΔADS approached statistical significance. These preliminary data are consistent with previous
      studies showing that 1) patients with seasonal affective disorder in winter during depression
      have blunted thermoregulatory cooling but have thermoregulatory cooling that is similar in
      efficiency to control subjects after successful antidepressant response to phototherapy (the
      retina has direct projections to DRVL serotonergic neurons), 2) ECT increases the circadian
      amplitude of core body temperature, and decreases mean core body temperature, particularly
      during the nighttime thermoregulatory cooling period, and 3) thermoregulatory cooling, as
      evidenced by the number of active sweat glands in depressed patients, increases upon clinical
      recovery, but not earlier, following ECT. the investigators hypothesize that these
      relationships in preliminary data and in previous studies are due to dysfunction of the
      afferent signaling arm of the thermoregulatory system in MDD, specifically the warm afferent
      system projecting to the LPB and, secondarily, to the DRVL/VLPAG and DRI subsets of
      serotonergic neurons that have been implicated in anxiolytic and antidepressant actions,
      respectively, and to normalization of warm afferent signaling following treatment. Again,
      given the high degree of overlap between PTSD and MDD, the investigators expect that WBH may
      confer therapeutic benefits in PTSD as it appears to do in MDD.

      This clinical trial will only include individuals with PTSD (i.e. no normal controls) in
      order to determine whether there is a significant effect of a single treatment with WBH
      administered in an open manner on PTSD symptoms. Based on our data from patients with MDD,
      the investigators expect that if WBH has an effect on PTSD symptoms, this will be apparent
      immediately after the treatment and will persist for at least a week. Therefore, the
      investigators will assess PTSD symptoms prior to and a week following a single treatment with
      WBH.

      Useful preliminary results were obtained from a pilot study comparing mildly to severely
      depressed patients receiving hyperthermic treatment (N=11) to depressed patients receiving
      psychotherapy as usual (N=3). Baseline scores on the German language ADS depression scale
      were similar for the two groups (mean=30.64, sd=9.18, N=11, vs. mean =32.33, sd=17.04, N=3).
      Raw change on the ADS was significantly greater for the hyperthermia group (mean=-11.91,
      sd=6.55, N=11, vs. mean=-1.33, sd=4.51, N=3; t=2.60, df=12, P=0.023), resulting in a very
      large standardized treatment difference (Cohen d) of 1.69 (95% CI=1.00 - 2.48). Percent
      change was also significant (mean=-39.4, sd=18.9, N=11, vs. mean=-8.6, sd=17.0, N=3; t=2.54;
      df=12, P=0.026), for a Cohen d of 1.66 (95% CI=0.93 - 2.39). The percentage of the
      hyperthermia vs. psychotherapy group achieving a clinical response (&gt;50% reduction from
      baseline) was 27.3% vs. 0%, and the percentage achieving at least a partial response (&gt;25%
      improvement) was 81.8% vs. 33.3%. These data suggest that our proposed sample size of 10
      individuals with combat-related PTSD should be sufficient to identify a potential therapeutic
      effect, assuming that such an effect would be of similar magnitude to the effect seen in MDD.

    <description>The Whole Body Hyperthermia system uses water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) heat radiation. The rise in the body's core temperature is correspondingly rapid and well-tolerated. There are two phases of the thermal challenge, 1) Irradiation phase during which the patient lies recumbent with his/her head positioned outside the tent. The wIRA irradiators are arranged above the exposed upper part of the body; and 2) heat retention phase during which the patient lies in the chamber with the walls of the tent positioned to retain heat. Core body temperatures will be raised to those comparable to a mild fever 37.8-38.5°C.</description>
