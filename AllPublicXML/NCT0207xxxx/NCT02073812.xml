  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RPX7009(beta-lactamase inhibitor) is being studied in combination with a carbapenem (RPX2014)
      to treat bacterial infections, including those due to multi-drug resistant bacteria.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide spread of resistance to antibiotics among Gram-negative bacteria, particularly
      members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of
      hospital acquired infections. In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine
      carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable
      threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents.

      Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem (RPX2014) plus a new
      beta-lactamase inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine beta-lactamases,
      including KPC. This Phase 1 study will assess the pharmacokinetics of intravenous RPX2014 and
      RPX7009 in plasma and epithelial fluid.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult males and/or females, 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive) at the time of
             screening.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 30 (kg/m2) and weight between 55.0 and 100.0 kg
             (inclusive) at the time of screening.

          3. Medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results (e.g., laboratory
             profiles, medical histories, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examination) as
             deemed by the PI.

          4. Non-tobacco/nicotine-containing product users for a minimum of 6 months prior to Day
             1.

          5. Voluntarily consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of significant oncologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic,
             renal, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic,
             neurological, or psychiatric disease.

          2. Positive urine drug/alcohol testing at screening (or Day -1).
