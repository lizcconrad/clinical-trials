  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies of cancer stem cells (CSC) involve the inoculation of cells from human tumors
      into immunosuppressed mice, preventing an assessment on the immunologic interactions and
      effects of CSCs. In this study, the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced
      by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinct murine tumors after their
      inoculation into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic
      and more effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective
      antitumor immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which
      bound to CSCs, resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were
      capable of killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed
      antibodies and T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring antitumor
      immunity.

      To assess the feasibility of generating CSC-loaded DC vaccines for clinical use, the
      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with Pancreatic
      Cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the PBMCs of the
      Pancreatic Cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate ALDHhigh and ALDHlow
      tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the Pancreatic Cancer patient using a similar protocol
      as investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-Pancreatic Cancer CSC immunity
      induced by Pancreatic Cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of Pancreatic Cancer CSCs by
      antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with Pancreatic Cancer CSC-DC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas. The site of the primary lesion should be confirmed endoscopically,
             radiologically, or surgically to be in the pancreas.

             2. Patients must be deemed unresectable due to involvement of critical vasculature,
             adjacent organ invasion, presence of metastasis, or other medical condition making
             surgical resection unfavorable.

             3. Patients must have a primary or metastatic lesion measurable in at least one
             dimension by RECIST criteria within 4 weeks prior to entry of study .

             4. More than 4 weeks must have elapsed from the time of major surgery or completion of
             the last dose of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, investigational therapy and patients
             must adequately recover from these effects.
