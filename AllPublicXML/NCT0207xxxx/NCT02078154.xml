      Measurement of D-Di (D-Dimer) levels using the in-vitro diagnostic reagent STA® - Liatest®
      D-Di and STA® - Liatest® D-Di PLUS in plasma samples from patients diagnosed with Deep Vein
      Thrombosis (DVT) Data from this study may be used in conjunction with data from the
      prospective study entitled &quot;STA® - Liatest® D-Di - Exclusion of Venous Thromboembolism

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population tested will be recruited from ambulatory outpatients (presenting
             at the emergency unit or outpatient clinic) suspected of having DVT.

          -  Patient is &lt; 80 years old.

          -  Patient presenting at least one of these symptoms indicative of proximal DVT: leg
             pain, tenderness (discomfort through palpation), leg swelling and /or edema,

          -  Patient has confirmed proximal DVT by imaging

          -  Low or moderate Wells score

          -  Patient provides written informed consent to participate in the sample collection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient presenting with a condition that may be associated with increased D-dimer
