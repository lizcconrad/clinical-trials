    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two surgical
      techniques for the treatments of proximal extremity humeral fractures and fractures luxation
      in three o four fragments of Neer's classification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proximal extremity humeral fractures present high prevalence. It's estimated about 10% of all
      fractures. Their incidence is 6,6/1000 people-year and this amount increases from 40 years
      old. The majority are successfully treated with immobilization and rehabilitation. The
      surgical treatment is recommended in case of displacement. In elderly population with
      fractures types three or four of Neer's classification there is no consensus on which
      technique is the best surgical option. Classically hemiarthroplasty has been widely performed
      as a reconstruction method but its outcomes in old patients are unclear due to the bad bone
      quality and joint features. Recently some authors recommend the reverse arthroplasty in
      patients over 70 years old . The aim of this study is to compare the results between
      Hemiarthroplasty and reverse arthroplasty in patients over 70 years old. As far as the
      investigators are concerned there's no published studies like this.
