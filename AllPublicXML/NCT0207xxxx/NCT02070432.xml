      This study will investigate the tolerability, recommended dose and pharmacokinetics of LUZ11
      following photodynamic therapy (PDT) of patients with advanced head and neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LUZ11 is a new photosensitizer for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of solid tumors, such as
      head and neck cancer. PDT with LUZ11 involves the intravenous administration of LUZ11
      followed by irradiation of the target tumor with laser light of an appropriate wavelength.
      The light causes the drug to react with oxygen, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      locally and induces tumor cells death and damages the blood vessels of the tumor thus
      preventing it from receiving nutrients.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the tolerability of LUZ11 following single
      ascending doses of LUZ11. The secondary objectives of this study are to explore the LUZ11
      dose that has anti-tumor effect following photoactivation and to determine LUZ11
      pharmacokinetics.

    <description>Study consists of two phases, in each participant:
Dose-finding phase with sequential periods in which single-ascending doses of LUZ11 will be titrated up to a dose that shows to be effective following photoirradiation of small spots of tumor surface.
Final PDT session with the previously identified individual effective dose.</description>
