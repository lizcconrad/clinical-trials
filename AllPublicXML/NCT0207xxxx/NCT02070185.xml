  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to study, in 8-11 year old children, the influence of energy density
      conditioning on liking for new flavored beverages and on caloric adjustment after the
      beverage consumption. The stability of the energy conditioning was evaluated after a period
      without exposure and after an extinction period during which the energy density of the
      beverages was changed.

    <description>During this study, children were exposed to 2 flavored sweetened beverages: a high energy version (HE: 150kcal) and a no energy version (NE: 0kcal).
During a 4-wk conditioning period, children were exposed either 2 times to each beverage.
After a 3-wk stability period without exposure, children were exposed 3 times to both beverages in which the association between the flavor and the energy density had been switched (4-wk extinction period).</description>
