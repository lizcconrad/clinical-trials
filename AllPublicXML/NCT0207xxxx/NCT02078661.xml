      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 0.25% PG101 and 1.0% PG101 topical gel suspension
      compared to placebo when administered two times daily for 14 days in subjects diagnosed with
      dry eye syndrome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The topical product PG101 is expected to be efficacious in treating the symptoms of dry eye
      such as discomfort, dryness, grittiness, burning, stinging, photophobia, lid friction, mucus
      discharge and hyper-tearing. Two concentrations (0.25% and 1.0%) are included in the study to
      determine if there is a dose response effect.
