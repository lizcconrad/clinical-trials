      The main purpose of this study is to improve the diagnostics of celiac disease and reduce the
      need for invasive endoscopic studies in children. Further, the investigators aim to
      investigate the natural history and risk of complications in children with celiac disease or
      gluten sensitivity and to create a large scientific database.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of celiac disease is on a steep rise in Western countries, but due to difficult
      diagnosis the majority of patients remain unrecognized. Undiagnosed celiac disease causes
      incremental burden to the health care and predisposes to severe complications. On the other
      hand, increasing screening in at-risk groups of celiac disease frequently detects
      seropositive subjects with no obvious symptoms and/or still normal small-bowel mucosal
      morphology. At present the natural history and benefits of an early diagnosis in such
      individuals is poorly known. Further, the endoscopic demonstration of the small-intestinal
      damage required for the diagnosis is unpleasant, expensive and often misleading. New
      serology-based diagnostic criteria have been suggested but prospective data is lacking. Aims
      of the present study are to improve the diagnostic yield and accuracy of the current
      diagnostic methods and to develop novel non-invasive methods and biomarkers for early
      detection of celiac disease. In addition, the investigators will evaluate natural history of
      celiac disease in screening-detected asymptomatic children and in those with positive
      serology but normal histology, and form a large database for future clinical and
      translational studies. The study and patient collection are to be conducted at the pediatric
      clinics in Finland and in Romania. All children referred due to suspicion of celiac disease
      or gluten sensitivity will be asked to participate to the study. Patient samples and clinical
      information are collected during the routine visits and the study does not include any
      additional visits or endoscopies. The total duration of the study is 10 years but data will
      be analyzed on-line.
