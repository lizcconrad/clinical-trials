  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: High intensity training of challenging tasks with many repetitions is a key
      factor for regaining motor function after stroke. Novel virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation
      systems provide the potential to increase intensity and offer challenging and motivating
      tasks. The efficacy of VR systems has not been demonstrated yet in sufficiently powered
      studies.

      Methods: In 5 participating rehabilitation centers patients in the subacute phase after
      stroke will be randomized to either a group receiving 4 weeks of VR training in addition to
      conventional arm training or a group receiving dose-matched and therapist attention-matched
      conventional arm-training.

      Hypothesis: VR training is more effective in improving arm motor function than conventional
      arm training in the subacute phase after stroke.

      Background: Approximately two thirds of patients with stroke experience impaired arm motor
      function, which compromises independence in activities of daily living, occupational areas
      and quality of life. High intensity training of challenging tasks with many repetitions are
      key factors for regaining motor function after stroke. Novel virtual reality (VR)
      rehabilitation systems provide the potential to increase intensity and offer challenging and
      motivating tasks. The efficacy of VR systems has not been demonstrated yet in sufficiently
      powered studies.

      Methods: In this study 120 patients in 5 participating Norwegian, Danish and Belgian
      rehabilitation institutions will be randomized to either a group receiving VR training in
      addition to conventional arm training or a group receiving dose-matched and therapist
      attention-matched conventional arm-training. During a period of 4 weeks the patients will be
      offered additional 4-5 training sessions weekly of 45-60 minutes duration by a
      physiotherapist or an occupational therapist. Arm motor function, dexterity and independence
      in daily life activities will be evaluated at baseline, post and 3 months follow-up
      assessments with the Action Research Arm Test, Box and Blocks Test and the Functional
      Independence Measure. Patient satisfaction and therapist satisfaction with the implementation
      of a new technology based rehabilitation system will also be assessed with questionnaires and
      interviews.

      Objective: The objective of the VIRTUES trial is to study the effectiveness and acceptance of
      a novel VR training approach. The study will provide evidence-based knowledge of new virtual
      reality based treatment strategies to clinicians, patients and health economists.
