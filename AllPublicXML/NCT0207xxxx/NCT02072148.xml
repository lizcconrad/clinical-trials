  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, patients with Human Papilloma Virus Positive Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma (HPVOPC) are curable, young and will live for prolonged periods. They are at high
      risk for long-term toxicity and mortality from therapy. While the long-term consequences of
      chemotherapy and surgery for head and neck cancer are relatively constrained, high-dose
      radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) substantially impact on local tissues and organ
      function and result in a significant rate of late mortality and morbidity in patients.
      Studies are now being designed to reduce the impact of RT and CRT for patients.

      Patients with intermediate stage HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer will be screened for poor
      prognostic features and undergo robotic surgery. Patients in whom pathology demonstrates good
      prognosis features will then be followed without postoperative radiotherapy. Patients with
      subsequent recurrence will be treated with either surgery and postoperative radiotherapy or
      postoperative chemoradiotherapy alone. Patients with poor prognostic features (ECS, LVI, PNI)
      will receive reduced dose radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy based on pathology. It is
      expected that over 50% of patients treated with surgery will have had a curative treatment
      and will avoid radiation therapy entirely and long-term survival will not be changed by
      withholding radiation therapy to good prognosis patients after surgery. There are exploratory
      biomarkers of risk of recurrence that will be collected and studied.

      There are currently few trials examining the role of de-escalation using surgery alone in
      intermediate and early T-stage HPV related disease. New surgical techniques have broadened
      the range of patients capable of achieving a complete resection and the functional outcomes
      in such patients are outstanding. Furthermore, the sensitivity of HPVOPC to chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy raise the possibility that delayed or salvage treatment in early stage patients
      would be highly effective, would result in similar survival outcomes and radiotherapy could
      be applied to a much smaller population then current standards call for. Looked at from a
      different perspective, the need for post-operative radiotherapy in this younger, HPV+ and
      more functional population has not been validated in clinical trials to date.

The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck (MDASI-HN) module is a validated instrument that provides a brief measure of the symptom distress experienced by the head and neck cancer patients as a result of their disease and/or treatment. This symptom burden instrument was closely associated with the severity of radiation-induced mucositis.
The MDA Xerostomia and Dysphagia questionnaires are radiotherapy/head and neck cancer directed questions which have a robust, validated assessment the specific concerns of swallowing and salivary function in head and neck cancer treated patients.</description>
