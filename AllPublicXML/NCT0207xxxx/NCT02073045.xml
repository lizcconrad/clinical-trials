    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies intensive education in increasing understanding of
      lymphedema in patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery. Lymphedema is the build-up of
      fluids in the arm (or other extremity) after surgery. Providing written educational handouts
      and verbal education on the risk factors and symptoms of lymphedema may improve patients'
      ability to identify symptoms of lymphedema after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the patient's increased knowledge of lymphedema signs/symptoms after education.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The participant may detect lymphedema signs/symptoms at an early stage by having a
      pre-surgery comparison of bilateral upper extremities (BUE) circumferential measures to the 3
      month post-surgery measures.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a five question survey, designed by the Occupational Therapy staff, as
      an instrument to assess a patient's knowledge of lymphedema signs/symptoms before surgery. An
      Occupational Therapist (OT), Physical Therapist (PT), and/or Certified Lymphedema Therapist
      (CLT) provide written handouts to participants on the pathophysiology, signs, symptoms, and
      treatment of lymphedema. Participants repeat the survey at 3 months post-surgery. BUE
      circumferential measurements are also collected before surgery and at 3 months post-surgery.
