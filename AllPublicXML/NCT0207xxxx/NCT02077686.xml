    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized prospective trial with a 6-month follow up. A newly
      developed treatment and education module will be tested compared to a waiting-list control
      group. The module covers the topic &quot;diabetes and travel&quot;. Primary outcome variable is
      diabetes-specific empowerment regarding diabetes and travel. Secondary outcome variables are:
      diabetes-related distress, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, self-care
      behavior, and glycemic control.

      The module consists of one lesson (duration: 90 minutes). The module is derived from the
      empowerment approach and is based on the previously evaluated education and treatment program
      for type 1 diabetes: PRIMAS (NCT01220557). The module is designed as a group session held by
      a trained diabetes educator. Patients are randomized either to the immediate participation in
      the module or to the control group. Control group is a waiting-list control group. Patients
      in this waiting-list control group get the education after the completion of the 6-month
      follow-up.

    <description>Based on the treatment and education programme PRIMAS a problem-specific education module regarding &quot;Diabetes and Travel&quot; was created. The module covers specific and detailed aspects of the topic &quot;travel&quot; such as insulin adaption to intercontinental flights, dealing with exotic food, and treatment goals during vacation. With this module, a more comprehensive education of patients with specific interest is possible.</description>
