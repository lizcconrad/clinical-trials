  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early initiation of enteral feeding, achievement of full enteral feeding and cessation of
      parenteral nutrition are extremely important in the very premature infant. This way it is
      possible to achieve good post-natal growth and developement while minimizing the metabolic
      and infectious complications of parenteral feeding.

      There isn't much information in literature regarding the impact of enteral feeding on
      intestinal blood flow and intestinal regional oxygenation in the preterm infant. There is
      also no consensus regarding the best regimen of delivering the enteral nutrition - bolus
      feeding or continuous feeding.

      The aim of our study is to compare the intestinal regional oxygenation before and after two
      feeding regimens - bolus feeding and continuous feeding - in clinically stable preterm
      infants born before 32 weeks gestation. The evaluations will be performed using NIRS
      technology (Near Infrared Spectroscopy).

      The study may help to assess which feeding regimen is gentler to the immature intestines
      (i.e. alters less the splanchnic blood flow and oxygenation) and therefore the preferred way
      to feed preterm infants.

      The aim of our study is to compare the intestinal regional oxygenation before and after two
      feeding regimens - bolus feeding and continuous feeding - in clinically stable preterm
      infants born before 32 weeks gestation. The evaluations will be performed using NIRS
      technology (Near Infrared Spectroscopy).

      The investigators intend to assess 20 clinically stable, appropriate for gestational age
      preterm infants, born before 32 weeks of gestation and receiving full enteral feedings at
      least 1 week prior to enrollment with no signs of feeding intolerance.

      All 20 participants evaluated constitute the 2 study groups:

        1. Group 1 = Bolus feeding - before and after one bolus feeding

        2. Group 2 = Continuous feeding - before and after one continuous feeding.

      The study may help to assess which feeding regimen is gentler to the immature intestines
      (i.e. alters less the splanchnic blood flow and oxygenation) and therefore the preferred way
      to feed preterm infants.
