      Description of new transcriptional profiles associated with risk of relapse and
      identification of specific sites of relapse in non-small cell lung cancer, toxicity and
      resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy in completely resected non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      -  A first blood sample will be taken during the week before the operation. A second blood
           sample will be taken 4 to 8 weeks after the operation. And in case of relapse, a third
           sample will be taken. These samples are going to be stored in the collection of
           biological resources of Angers.

        -  Concerning the biopsy of the resected NSLCL, it will be sent to the collection of
           biological resources of Angers for conservation directly next to the surgery.
