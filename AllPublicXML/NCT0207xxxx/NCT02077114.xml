    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether a vaccine containing a small fragment of the
      protein IDO, which may be present in cancer cells and cells of the immune system, is safe to
      use in combination with either Ipilimumab or Vemurafenib in the treatment of malignant
      melanoma that has metastasized.

    <description>Reactivity towards epitopes nested within the sequence of the peptide used for vaccination, will be assessed in T cells from peripheral blood, obtained at the specified sample times. Reactivity will be assessed using ELISpot technology, where secretion of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha is measured during in vitro stimulation with the peptide used for vaccination. In addition to this, combinatorial coding with fluor chrome conjugated HLA tetramers are used to enumerate precursor frequency of CD8 T cells specific for epitopes within the peptide sequence</description>

               2. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1

               3. ECOG performance status ≤ 2

               4. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases allowed (treatment with systemic

                  treatment, and use effective contraception during treatment and up to 26 weeks

                  intrauterine devices, depot injection of progesterone, subdermal implantation (eg
                  Implanon), hormonal vaginal ring and transdermal patch.

        All patients must meet all inclusion criteria in the treatment group they belong to.

        Inclusion criteria Vemurafenib and peptide vaccine

          1. Histologic confirmed stage III (non-operable) or stage IV melanoma with BRAF V600
             documented mutation

          2. Patients should be fully recovered from any previous systemic or topical treatment for
             metastatic malignant melanoma

          3. Adequate haematological, renal and hepatic function:

               -  Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9 / l

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 5.6 mmol / l

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper normal limit

               -  AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 times upper normal limit (≤ 5 times upper normal limit if it is
                  considered that an increase due to liver metastases)

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper normal limit

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times upper normal limit (≤ 5 times upper normal limit
                  if it is considered that an increase due to liver metastases)

        Inclusion criteria Ipilimumab and peptide vaccine

          1. Histologic verified stage III (non-operable) or stage IV malignant melanoma

          2. Patients previously treated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy can be included, unless this
             treatment is stopped due to lack of efficacy or side effects

          3. There must be at least 21 days since last systemic treatment of malignant melanoma and
             the patient must be free of side effects from this treatment. After palliative
             radiotherapy elsewhere than in the brain, treatment with Ipilimumab and peptide
             vaccine can be initiated, without a 21 day break. When radiotherapy is used for brain
             metastases, treatment, however, can only be initiated when the patient is not
             dependent on prednisolone.
