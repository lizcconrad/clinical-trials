    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies an imaging technique known as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging (DCE MRI) in identifying the presence of pancreatic cancer. DCE MRI is a
      procedure that takes detailed pictures of functional and structural properties inside the
      body using magnetic field and radio frequency pulses. These pictures may help identify
      underlying malignancy in patients at high risk or active malignancy in patients who have
      undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the ability of DCE MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients at
      high risk for hereditary pancreatic cancer.

      II. Assess the ability of DCE MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients
      with cystic lesions of the pancreas.

      III. Assess the ability to DCE MRI to accurately predict tumor margins in patients who have
      undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In each of the three groups listed above clinical factors associated with the presence of
      pancreatic cancer will be analyzed; in addition, disease free survival and overall survival
      will be analyzed in each group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.

      ARM I (High-risk for familial or hereditary pancreatic cancer): Patients undergo DCE MRI for
      up to 3 scans.

      ARM II (Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMN)): Patients undergo DCE MRI prior to
      surgery.

      ARM III (Unresectable pancreatic cancer): Patients undergo DCE MRI before and after
      neoadjuvant therapy.
