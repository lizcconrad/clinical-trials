      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Histologically confirmed GBM or World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV variants
             (gliosarcoma, glioblastoma with oligodendroglial features, or giant cell
             glioblastoma).

          -  Uneqivocal evidence of a first tumor recurrence or progression on the initial
             treatment regimen (prior to enrollment on this study), consisting of surgical
             intervention (biopsy and/or resection), radiation, and temozolomide chemotherapy, as
             assessed by MRI or CT scan of the brain with or without contrast within 14 days prior
             to the start of SL-701. If receiving corticosteroids, the dose must be stable or
             decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. Patients unable to undergo MRI
             because of non-compatible devices can be enrolled, provided CT scans are obtained and
             are of sufficient quality. For each patient, the same imaging technique should be
             performed throughout the study, for purposes of assessing tumor response or PD.

          -  For patients who have undergone resection of recurrent or progressive tumor prior to
             study enrollment, the following conditions must apply:

               -  Recovery from the effects of surgery.

               -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for
                  eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease
                  post-operatively, an MRI should be performed:

                    -  No later than 96 hours (h) in the immediate post-operative period; or

                    -  At least 4 weeks post-craniotomy (7 days for stereotactic biopsy), within 14
                       days prior to the start of SL-701, and on a corticosteroid dosage that has
                       been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days.

          -  Patients who have not had resection of recurrent or progressive disease must have
             measurable disease.

          -  At least 56 of the approximately 76 patients treated must have measurable disease,
             defined as at least one, contrast-enhancing lesion measuring at least 1 cm in 2 planes
             (axial, coronal, or sagittal).

          -  No evidence of hemorrhage on the baseline MRI or CT scan other than those that are
             Grade ≤ 1 and either post-operative or stable on at least two consecutive scans.

          -  Recovery from prior therapy toxicity, defined as resolution of all treatment-related
             adverse events (AEs) to Grade ≤ 1 or pre-treatment baseline (except alopecia and
             lymphopenia).

          -  At least 12 weeks from prior radiotherapy to the start of SL-701 unless there is new
             enhancement outside of the radiation field or unequivocal histopathologic evidence of
             recurrent tumor.

          -  No chemotherapy or investigational agent for at least 3 weeks prior to the start of
             SL-701, with at least 6 weeks of elapsed time from last dose of nitrosoureas.

          -  Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 positive.

          -  A tumor tissue sample is provided for immunohistochemical analysis of relevant
             antigens, immune markers and potential prognostic factors. Preferably a paraffin block
             or 10-12 unstained slides will be submitted prior to study entry. Patients for whom
             tumor samples are unavailable or inadequate are permitted to participate in the study;

             within 3 days prior to the start of SL-701 treatment.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential and sexually active male patients must agree
             to use an acceptable form of contraception for heterosexual activity (ie, oral

             contraceptives, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of their sexual partner(s) for &gt; 40 days
             before Screening, during the study, and for 60 days after the last dose of study drug.
             Men should not donate semen during the study and for 60 days after the last dose of
             study drug.

          -  Female patients without childbearing potential (spontaneous amenorrhea for &gt; 12 months
             or surgically sterilized by tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy &gt;
