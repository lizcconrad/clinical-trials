  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may have application in a
      promising tool for identification of myocardial inflammation in patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy (DCM).Therefore, the purpose of the study is to confirm the hypothesis of the
      fixation of FDG in non cardiomyocyte cells in a number of patients with DCM, to specify the
      frequency and describe the different binding profiles in comparison with MRI data.

      Patients will perform an ethologic evaluation of a non ischemic DCM with in a cardiac MRI.

      All patients will have with in 4 weeks after the MRI a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. A
      high fat and low carbohydrate diet and an heparin injection will be prescribed to patients
      before this FDG PET.

      Patients will be identified as FDG+ or FDG -. The clinical status of the patient will be
      completed by a 12 months evaluation.
