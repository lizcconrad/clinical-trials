  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological interventions for cancer patients have been tested and found to reduce stress
      and improve quality of life. These interventions have been tested at academic medical centers
      but have not been available for use by community mental health professionals. One such
      intervention is the Biobehavioral Intervention (BBI), developed by Professor Barbara L.
      Andersen and colleagues at Ohio State (OSU). Current funding has enabled the investigators to
      train mental health professionals from across the country to deliver the BBI at their
      institution. Recently diagnosed cancer patients who are participating in the BBI group at
      these institutions may participate in a research study completing self report measures asking
      about psychological and behavioral outcomes (for example, mood, stress, diet and physical
      activity). The investigators hypothesize that individuals participating in the intervention
      will report improvements in outcomes, such as reduced stress and improved mood, reduced
      symptoms of the disease and treatment, etc., after completing the intervention and continue
      to report these improvements up to 6 months after the group ends. OSU will coordinate this
      data collection project but information about participating sites is listed in
      http://clinicaltrials.gov.

Each institution involved in this study will implement the core techniques of the C2H-D Intervention but may alter the format somewhat to meet their patient population needs (e.g., shorten hourly 18 week intervention into 2-hour 9 week intervention).</description>
