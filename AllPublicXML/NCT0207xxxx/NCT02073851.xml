    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. The patient meets indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure.

          3. The patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations.

          4. The patient, or legally authorized representative, has been informed of the nature of
             the study, agrees to its provisions and has been provided written informed consent,
             approved by the appropriate Medical Ethics Committee (EC).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement via the trans-axillary,
             subclavian, or direct aortic route

          2. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year
             following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to index procedure per site standard
             test.

          3. Patients with known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours
             preceding the index procedure (according to definition) or AMI &gt; 72 hours preceding
             the index procedure and creatine kinase and creatine kinase fraction have not returned
             to normal limits at the time of procedure.

          4. Patients who are currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset
             AMI, such as nitrate-unresponsive prolonged chest pain.

          5. Patients with impaired renal function (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [Estimated
             Glomerular Filtration Rate] &lt;30, calculated from serum creatinine by the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula).

          6. Patients with torturous/unsuitable anatomy as related to major cerebral arteries in
             the aortic arch that may interfere with device deployment or remain deployed.

          7. Patients with a platelet count &lt;100.000 cells/mm³ or &gt;700.000 cells/mm³ or a white
             blood cell &lt;3000 cells/mm³ within 7 days prior to index procedure.

          8. Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom
             anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, or will refuse
             transfusion.

          9. Patients who have received any organ transplant or are on a waiting list for any organ
             transplant.

         10. Poor fluoroscopic visualization due to obesity or other medical reason

         11. Hypotension requiring iv/ia medication or other therapy such as resuscitation and
             defibrillation

         12. Patients with known other medical illness or known history of substance abuse that may
             cause non-compliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is
             associated with a life expectancy of less than one year.

         13. Patients with a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin,
             heparin/bivalirudin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, nitinol, stainless steel alloy, latex,
             and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

         14. Patients with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the
             prior 6 months.

         15. Patients with an active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within
             the prior 6 months.

         16. Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock.

         17. Patients with severe peripheral arterial disease that precludes the delivery sheath
             vascular access.

         18. Patients with severe calcification/atheroma, friable or mobile atherosclerotic plaque
             in the aortic arch

         19. Patients with contraindication to cerebral MRI.

         20. Patients going through unprotected (cerebral embolization) cardiovascular procedure
             prior, during or post transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure, before the
             post-procedure diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging evaluation

         21. Patients who have a planned treatment with any other investigational device or
             procedure during the study period.
