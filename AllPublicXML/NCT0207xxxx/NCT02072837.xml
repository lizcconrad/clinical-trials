  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we studied lipoprotein abnormalities-related variables as risk factors for the
      development of cardiovascular disease in patients on renal replacement therapies.We studied
      96 dialyzed patients, 62 males and 34 females, on mean age 62.1 years old and 24 healthy
      controls.We concluded that metabolic acidosis activating the inflammation and lipoprotein
      oxidation influences the dyslipidemia and cardiovascular morbidity of patients on renal
      replacement therapies.Dialysis adequacy was positively associated to cardioprotective
      HDL.Peritoneal dialysis holds a better acidosis level and lower oxidized lipids than
      hemodialysis modalities.

      Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture in the peritoneal dialyzed patients and control
      group in a twelve hours fasting state.In hemodialyzed patients blood was drawn just before
      the start of the mean weekly dialysis session also in a twelve hours fasting state from the
      vascular access.

      All samples were received once at baseline time ( in the start of the study ). Peripheral
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures were calculated as an average of 10 measurements
      during a renal replacement treatment month in the starting time of the study.

      Also, electrocardiographic examination, echocardiography and the calculation of
      ankle-brachial blood pressure index became once in the start of the study.

        We studied 96 dialyzed patients at Nephrology Department of &quot;Laiko, University General
        Hospital of Athens&quot; and Renal Unit of &quot;Diagnostic and Therapeutic Center of Athens Hygeia
        SA&quot;. 62 males and 34 females participated in this study.The treatment modalities which were
        applied were : regular haemodialysis (HD, n=34), predilution haemodiafiltration (HDF, n=42)
        and peritoneal dialysis (PD, n=20).
