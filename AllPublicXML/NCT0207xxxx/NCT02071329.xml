    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and immunogenicity
      of an influenza A vaccine (vaccine: FP-01.1), as compared to placebo, in healthy volunteers
      following a dose of influenza A virus.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to further investigate the safety and tolerability of FP-01.1 in
      healthy subjects and to explore the effect of prior vaccination with Vaccine FP-01.1 (250
      μg/peptide) or placebo on the incidence, severity and duration of the signs and symptoms of
      influenza and the magnitude of viral load in nasal secretions and duration of viral shedding,
      after challenge with an A/California/H1N1 2009 influenza virus, in healthy male and female
      subjects. The study will also be used to provide additional information on the immunological
      responses (both humoral and cell-mediated immune [CMI] responses) following Vaccine FP-01.1
      treatment and to investigate potential markers for protection against influenza A infection.
