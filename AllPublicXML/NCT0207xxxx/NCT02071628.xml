    <textblock>
      This study is designed for validation of in-vitro platelet aggregation assay using human
      blood in healthy volunteers. 32ml blood, 2ml for complete blood count test and 30ml for
      platelet aggregation assay, was collected from ten subjects, respectively.

      Preparation of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP):

        1. Collect human blood using 21g butterfly syringe and dilute 9:1 into 3.8% sodium citrate
           vacutainer vials.

        2. Prepare platelet rich plasma (PRP) by centrifuging blood at 100 x g for 15 minutes at
           room temperature. Using a plastic transfer pipette, carefully transfer and combine PRP
           from multiple vacutainer tubes (if required) into a 15 mL conical tube.

        3. PRP is removed re-centrifuge remaining blood in vacutainer tubes at 2000 x g for 15
           minutes at room temp. to obtain platelet poor plasma (PPP). Transfer PPP to 15 mL
           conical tube.

        4. Measure platelet count in combined PRP using Z1 Coulter Particle Counter or similar
           product. Adjust platelet count to a final concentration of 300,000 +- 10,000 platelets
           in PRP using PPP.

      Aggregation Measurement:

      Aggregation is measured using a model 490-X Chrono-Log Aggregometer or similar product. PPP
      is used as a reference to establish 100% optical transmission.
