  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II trial to assess the biological activity (in a sub-cohort using
      a Simon two-stage Phase II design) and toxicity of Artichoke Whole Phytocomplex Concentrate
      (WPC). The objective of the study is to explore the potential for a non-toxic phytocomplex
      extract from the artichoke plant as a chemoprevention agent.

      In individuals exposed to asbestos and affected with asbestosis or asbestos-related benign
      pleural disease, and therefore at increased risk of mesothelioma, the investigators will
      evaluate whether the treatment with the commercially-available Artichoke Whole Phytocomplex
      Concentrate (Artichoke WPC) for 90 days will decrease mesothelin serum levels.

      Although the investigators have general information on toxicity in humans, the investigators
      will monitor and assess the potential toxicity of Artichoke WPC in this patient population.

      In addition to mesothelin, the investigators plan to evaluate the effects of Artichoke WPC on
      serum microRNAs (miRNAs). The use of miRNAs as minimally-invasive biomarkers has opened new
      opportunities for the diagnosis of cancer. A number of studies have addressed the potential
      association of disregulated miRNA profiling and benign asbestos-related disease and
      mesothelioma. Thus, the investigators will evaluate serum miRNA profiling before and after
      treatment with Artichoke WPC.

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome is based on the reduction in serum concentration levels of mesothelin, measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention for subjects in the efficacy sub-cohort (i.e. for subjects who had elevated mesothelin levels at baseline). A positive outcome will be declared if the biomarker shows a reduction of 25% or more of its baseline value over the 90-day treatment period. For each study subject, mesothelin serum levels for both the baseline and final blood draws will be determined at the same time and in the same batch. This will assist in minimizing the technical variability of the assessments.</description>
