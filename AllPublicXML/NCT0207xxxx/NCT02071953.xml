  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change in color matching of restoration.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 18 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The restoration's color will be assessed for matching with adjacent teeth and stability of color matching over time. Assessments will be done to the following criteria:
A= Restoration matches adjacent tooth structure in shade and/or translucency. B= Mismatch in shade and/or translucency is within normal range of tooth shades.
C= Mismatch in shade and/or translucency is outside normal range of tooth shades.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change in marginal discoloration</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 18 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The margin of the restoration will be assessed for discoloration according to the following criteria:
A= No visual evidence of marginal discoloration. B= Marginal discoloration present but has not penetrated in a pulpal direction. C= Marginal discoloration has penetrated in a pulpal direction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change in marginal integrity.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 18 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The integrity of the restoration's margin will be assessed according to the following criteria:
A= Explorer does not catch or slight catch with no visible crevice. B= Explorer catches and crevice is visible but no exposure of dentin or base. C= Explorer penetrates crevice and defect extended to amelo-dentinal junction. D= Restoration is fractured, mobile, or missing in part or in toto.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change in presence of secondary dental caries (cavities).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 18 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of the presence of secondary dental caries (cavities) will be performed according to the following criteria:
A= No caries present. D= Caries present associated with the restoration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change in presence of restoration fractures (localized or bulk).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 18 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The restoration will be assessed for the presence of fractures according to the following criteria:
A= Smooth restoration surface with no irregularities. B= Slightly rough or pitted restoration surface. Can be refinished. C= Deeply pitted or grooved (not related to anatomy) restoration finish. Can not be refinished.
D= Restoration surface is fractured or flaking.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change in post-operative sensitivity.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 18 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will be interviewed to assess post-operative sensitivity according to the following criteria:
A= No sensitivity. B= Mild sensitivity. C= Moderate sensitivity with no restoration replacement required. D= Sever sensitivity. Replacement of restoration is required.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change in surface condition of restoration.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 18 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The condition of the surface of the restoration will be assessed according to the following criteria:
A= Restoration is continuous with existing anatomic form. B= Restoration is discontinuous with existing anatomic form but missing material is not sufficient to expose dentin or lining.
C= Sufficient restorative material is lost to expose dentin.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change in gingival inflammation index.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 18 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The condition of the patient's gingiva will be assessed according to the following index:
0 = Normal gingiva.
= Mild inflammation, slight change in color, slight edema, no bleeding upon probing.
= Moderate inflammation, redness; edema and glazing; bleeding upon palpation.
= Severe inflammation, marked redness and edema, ulceration, tendency to spontaneous bleeding.</description>
