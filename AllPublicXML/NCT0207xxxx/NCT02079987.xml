  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a new way of helping patients after they leave
      the Emergency Room (ER) improves their quality of life. The purpose is also to find out if
      the new way of helping decreases ER use.

      Emergency Room (ER) subjects who agree to participate in this study will be asked to complete
      a survey about their health, health care and quality of life. Subjects will also be asked for
      some basic personal information such as their age, race, gender, employment and marital
      status. Investigators will review the electronic medical record for information about
      subjects' health conditions and the triage severity score assigned by the ER nurse.

      Subjects who decide to participate in the study will also be randomly assigned, much like the
      flip of a coin to receive either a new way of educating patients (the Care Transition
      Intervention) or usual care.

      This means if subject receives the new way of educating, a patient advocate will visit the
      subject at home one or two days after the ER visit. The patient advocate will talk with the
      subject about following up with a regular, personal doctor and symptoms to look out for. The
      patient advocate will help the subject understand their medicines and help the subject make a
      personal health record. The patient advocate will also tell the subject about the Area Agency
      on Aging, also called Elder Options. If the subject receives usual care, the subject will not
      receive a visit from the patient advocate or hear about the Area Agency on Aging but will be
      given discharge instructions from the ER nurse and doctor.

      If the subject receives the new way of educating (the Care Transition Intervention), the
      patient advocate will call the subject at least 3 times after the ER visit. The patient
      advocate will talk with the subject about the same items listed above. If the subject
      receives usual care, the patient advocate will not call. The subject has a 1 in 2 chance of
      receiving the new way of educating and a 1 in 2 chance of receiving usual care.

      All subjects will be asked to complete a phone survey with 60 days of their ER visit. This
      survey will ask the subject about their health, satisfaction with healthcare and quality of
      life. All subjects will be asked to give informed consent for the study investigators to
      record Medicare Claims to determine how many ER visits, hospital admissions and doctor office
      visits the subject had in the 60 days after the study ER visit.

      Some subjects will also be asked if they are willing to give a separate interview. During
      this interview, the investigators will ask about what happened when the subject was in the
      ER. The investigators will also ask about how things went after the ER visit. If the subject
      was in the group with the new way of educating, the investigators will ask about this as
      well. This interview will be audio-recorded.
