  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators compare three stimulants to each other. The effects of these
      agents on cognitive performance (eg, attention and memory) and on the brain are being
      measured. The hypothesis is that stimulants will have a positive effect on cognitive
      performance.

      Each study participant will receive once a placebo and once methylphenidate or modafinil or
      caffeine. Methylphenidate (also known as Ritalin ®) is a drug that is used in the treatment
      of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents and adults.
      Modafinil ( Vigil ®) is a drug used in the treatment of narcolepsy (sleeping sickness). In
      the study. These substances are given in the study only once and in the dosages in which is
      also used for the treatment of the above diseases. In the case of caffeine , the dosage
      corresponds to two cups of coffee.
