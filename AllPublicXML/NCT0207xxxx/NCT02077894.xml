      Objective: The objective of this study is to identify genetic causes of inherited eye
      conditions through whole exome or whole genome sequencing. This includes identifying
      mutations in known genes or novel genes for recognized conditions, as well as identifying
      mutations in novel genes for previously uncharacterized genetic conditions involving the eye.

      Study Population: We plan to recruit 310 participants, to include both probands with an eye
      condition under study and unaffected family members. Ideally unaffected family members will
      be parents of a proband.

      Design: Participants will be recruited through other pre-existing NIH protocols, such as the
      NEI Evaluation and Treatment protocol (08-EI-0169), the NEI Screening protocol (08-EI-0102),
      and the Genetics of Uveal Coloboma protocol (13-EI-0049). Self-referred patients or patients
      referred by an outside clinician will be screened for eligibility under a pre-existing NIH
      protocol. Phenotyped patients eligible for participation and their unaffected family members
      will undergo genetic counseling and will provide a blood sample for exome or genome
      sequencing. Biological relationships will be confirmed prior to exome or genome sequencing.
      Sequence data will be analyzed for primary variants associated with the proband s eye
      condition and incidental findings, as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics
      guidelines. All sequence variants deemed clinically relevant will be validated in a
      CLIA-certified laboratory and the results will be returned to the participant in-person.

      Outcome Measures: This is an etiologic study that will generate molecular information about
      previously-recognized conditions for which participants did not have a molecular diagnosis,
      as well as molecular information for previously uncharacterized conditions involving the eye.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

               1. Participant is affected with an eye condition under study, or is a family member
                  of an affected individual who will be informative for WES/WGS analysis and
                  interpretation.

               2. Participant or legal guardian of participant understands and signs the informed
                  consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Participants who cannot comply with study procedures are ineligible.

          2. Participants who are minors or participants who are adults and are decisionally
             impaired are ineligible if they do not have a legal guardian who can consent and make
             decisions on their behalf. Documentation of legal guardianship must be provided for
             decisionally impaired adults.

          3. Participants who are minors and under joint custody are ineligible if parents are in
             disagreement about study participation.

          4. Prospective participants or their legal guardians who, based on the judgment of the
             team, appear to have impaired ability to understand and appropriately use complex
             medical and genetic information, or to cope with potentially life altering medical
             information, will be ineligible.
