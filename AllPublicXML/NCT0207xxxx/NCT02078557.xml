    <textblock>
      This study will assess multiple doses of MK-8892 administered to participants with pulmonary
      hypertension &quot;out of proportion&quot; (PHOOP) and heart failure with reduced left ventricular
      ejection fraction (rEF). It is hypothesized that generally safe and well tolerated multiple
      doses of MK-8892 will achieve a true reduction from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance
      (PVR) greater than 12%.

    <description>Starting dose of 1 mg daily (oral); the dose may be titrated up on the 8th, 15th, and 22nd day of treatment to 2 mg, 3 mg, or 4 mg, respectively, for the duration of the study (28 days) as tolerated. For participants who reach one or more of the down-dosing criteria, there is an opportunity to decrease the dose back to a previously well-tolerated dose level, or to Â½ of the starting dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pulmonary hypertension (out of proportion, PHOOP) and heart failure with reduced left
             ventricular ejection fraction (PHOOP/rEF)

          -  If female, cannot be pregnant or breastfeeding. Females of reproductive potential must
             agree to agree to use (and/or have their partner use) two (2) acceptable methods of

             is administered

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &lt;=35 kg/m^2 and and &lt;=18 kg/m^2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary pulmonary arterial hypertension or veno-occlusive disease (WHO Group 1), or
             pulmonary hypertension secondary to other causes (WHO Groups 3 -5) including but not
             limited to autoimmune disease, connective tissue disease, and Eisenmenger syndrome
