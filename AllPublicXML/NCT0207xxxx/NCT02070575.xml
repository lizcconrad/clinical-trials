  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a new blood test looking at PSA and a group of
      PSA related proteins in a patient's blood can indicate which men after surgery with a rising
      PSA could benefit from treatment, and/or indicate which men are at higher risk for recurrence
      before initial treatment is given.

    <description>This study is planned to determine the kallikrein panel of 200 patients presenting with biochemical recurrence (PSA ≥ 0.05ng/ml) after radical prostatectomy prior to any additional therapy or minimum post 1 year additional therapy.</description>

    <description>Venous blood will be collected in an EDTA Vacutainer tubeup to 10 mL and will be immediately put on ice. This sample may be drawn as a stand-alone blood draw. Samples will be centrifuged at 1900g (3000-3200 RPM) for 15 Minutes and the serum aliquoted into freezer vials and stored at -80°C until analysis. In addition patients who have not received treatment for biochemical recurrence after their first draw are eligible for subsequent draws to determine the reproducibility of the test over time.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients treated with radical prostatectomy that develop a rising serum PSA ≥
             0.05ng/ml and have not received any kind of additional therapy.

          -  Patients who have had additional therapy post radical prostatectomy are eligible for
             this study if ≥1 year has passed since treatment and the patient develops a rising
             serum PSA ≥0.05ng/ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous additional therapy for prostate cancer, less than 1 year ago

          -  No evidence of rising PSA

          -  Patients unwilling to undergo venesection
