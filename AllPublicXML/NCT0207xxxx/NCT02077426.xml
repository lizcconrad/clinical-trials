      The aim of this study is to determine whether heart failure patients can tolerate a
      four-weeks of a new exercise training regimen that targets peripheral tissues (Regional
      Specific Training Stimulus-RSTS) and has been show to produce significant benefits in aerobic
      capacity and strength in healthy subjects aged 70+years who were at risk for losing
      functional independence.

    <measure>Senior Fitness Test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Senior Fitness Test is a previously validated battery of 6 physical tasks of daily living used to assess strength, flexibility and endurance in order to detect and predict future limitations in functional capacity. The test is designed to evaluate physical fitness domains including upper-body strength (Arm Curl), lower-body strength (Chair Sit-Stand), upper and lower body flexibility (Back Scratch and Chair Sit and Reach), balance and coordination (8 foot Up and Go), and endurance (Six Minute Walk).</description>

    <description>The RSTS protocol was designed to focus on specific peripheral muscle groups without imposing a significant cardiorespiratory strain. Each exercise involved contractions with moderate load but with an extended duration of up to six minutes. Eight specific exercises were performed to target all major muscle groups and enable the routine to be completed within 60 minutes including warm-up, rest periods and stretching between exercises, and cool down exercises</description>
