          -  The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive chronic
             myelogenous leukemia in either CP or AP. Accelerated phase will be defined as disease
             having 1 of the following: ≥15% to &lt;30% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow;

             peripheral blood or bone marrow; platelet count &lt;100x109/L unrelated to therapy; or
             clonal evolution.

          -  The patient has either failed, demonstrated intolerance, or a combination of prior
             failure and intolerance, to prior treatments with at least 2 tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors (TKI's). Failure of TKI treatment may either be primary (never achieved a
             response) or secondary resistance (loss of response).

          -  TKI treatment failure will be defined as 1 of the following:

               -  no CHR by 12 weeks (whether lost or never achieved)

               -  no partial cytogenetic response by 24 weeks (ie, 1 to 35% Ph-positive) (whether
                  lost or never achieved) no major cytogenetic response by 52 weeks (ie, ≤35%
                  Ph-positive) (whether lost or never achieved)

               -  progressive leukocytosis, defined as increasing white blood cell (WBC) count on
                  at least 2 consecutive evaluations, at least 2 weeks apart and doubling from the
                  nadir to ≥20000/μL or absolute increase in WBC by ≥50000/μL above the
                  post-treatment nadir

          -  Intolerance to TKI therapy will be defined as 1 of the following:

               -  grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity that does not resolve with adequate
                  intervention

               -  grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting more than 7 days, or a documented inability
                  to sustain the TKI therapy because of recurrent grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity
                  with re-initiation of the same therapy

               -  any grade 2 or greater toxicity that is unacceptable to the patient

          -  Patients must have completed all previous anticancer therapy for at least 2 weeks
             prior to the first planned dose of omacetaxine, except as noted below, and must have
             fully recovered from side effects of a previous therapy.

          -  In patients with rapidly proliferating disease, hydroxyurea may be administered before
             study entry, if clinically indicated, to control disease. In such cases, complete
             hematologic response (CHR) must be sustained for at least 4 weeks for accelerated CML,
             and at least 8 weeks for chronic phase CML, following the discontinuation of
             hydroxyurea, to be considered as a CHR.

          -  Patients may receive anagrelide for up to 28 days (in countries where the product is
             registered). Leukapheresis is allowed up to 24 hours prior to the first treatment
             cycle with omacetaxine.

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic and renal function as evidenced by bilirubin 2.0
             times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) or lower, alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) and asparate aminotransferase (AST) 3 times the ULN or lower, serum creatinine
             1.5 times the ULN or lower. Patients with nonclinically significant elevations of
             bilirubin up to 5.0 g/dL (85500 μmol/L) due to known or suspected Gilbert's disease

          -  Patients are men or women at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to any
             study related procedure.

          -  The patient must take precautions to not become pregnant or produce offspring. Women
             must be of non-childbearing potential (surgically sterile or postmenopausal for at
             least 12 months, confirmed by follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;40 IU/L) or agree to
             use a medically accepted method of contraception for the duration of the study and 90
             days after treatment. Men must be surgically sterile or agree to use a medically
             accepted method of contraception for the duration of the study and 90 days after
             treatment. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, barrier method with
             spermicide (excluding cervical cap and sponge), intrauterine device (IUD), or
             steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in conjunction
             with a barrier method.
