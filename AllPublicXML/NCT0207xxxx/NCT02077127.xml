  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) remains poorly understood.
      Recent studies have implicated that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is associated
      with diabetic microvascular or macrovascular complications. However, the relationship between
      SNP polymorphism c.2518A/G in the MCP-1 gene with diabetic retinopathy remains controversial.
      In the present study, we evaluated the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      in the MCP-1 gene with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) in Chinese
      population from Southern China with type 2 diabetes.

      The association between polymorphism of MCP-1 c.2518A/G and DR had been reported in Japan and
      Korea, but their opinion were inconsistent. However there is no report in China so far. This
      study was designed to clarify the relationship of polymorphism of MCP-1 c.2518A/G with type 2
      diabetes with or without DR. The relationship between MCP-1 c.2518A/G and different stage of
      DR has also been studied.This article proved that the MCP-1 c.2518G/G genotype is a
      susceptibility gene for DR in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, especially the High-risk PDR.
      There is no association with DME and c.2518G/G.
