        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have been diagnosed the disease of neuropathy pain arising from diabetic
             peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, traumatic/surgical nerve injury,
             incomplete spinal cord injury, or trigeminal neuralgia and if they have a mean weekly
             pain score of at least 4 on the 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) of the Short-Form
             McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) completed a screening / baseline period before
             randomization. Additional disease-specific inclusion criteria are listed in Table 1.

          -  Subjects must be 20 years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, lactating or of childbearing potential not using effective

          -  Subjects who have a clinically significant or unstable medical or psychiatric
             condition.

          -  Subjects who are known of hypersensitivity to Gabapentin.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Subjects who have received nerve blocks or acupuncture for pain relief within four
             weeks before a screening / baseline period.

          -  Subjects who have the presence of chronic pain other than the target pain being
             studied (unless the chronic pain is in a different body region than the target pain
             and its intensity is not greater than that of the target pain).

          -  Subjects who have received nondrug therapies or any special procedures for the relief
             of the target pain within two weeks before a baseline visit.

          -  Subjects who are using the following agents within 30 days prior to screening:
             antidepressants, opioids, other anticonvulsants, local anaesthetic injections or any
             investigational drug.
