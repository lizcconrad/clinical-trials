    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the genetic variants that are associated with higher
      risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity can contribute towards developing a predictive
      algorithm comprising both clinical and genetic factors to select patients who should avoid
      treatment with anthracyclines.

      Hypothesis of this study is certain functional variants in genes that encode for metabolizing
      enzymes and/or targets in the doxorubicin pharmacology pathway may increase the risk of
      doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Doxorubicin is one of the cornerstone therapies in adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage
      breast cancer. Cumulative doses of 240mg/m2 (4 cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) and
      300mg/m2 (6 cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) are typically administered in the
      adjuvant setting, which is associated with &lt;1% chance of severe cardiotoxicity, and are thus
      considered 'safe dose ranges'. However, Blanco et al recently reported childhood cancer
      survivors with the CBR3 (a metabolizing enzyme of doxorubicin) V244M homozygous G genotypes
      to be at increased risk of cardiomyopathy following exposure to anthracyclines doses as low
      as 101-150mg/m2, suggesting that there is no safe dose threshold for individuals with certain
      genotypes. We have previously studied several genes in the doxorubicin pharmacology pathway,
      including CBR1, CBR3, and AKR1C3, and found correlation between functional variants in CBR3
      and AKR1C3 with doxorubicin-induced myelosuppression. The CBR3 G allele is present in about
      50-60% of the Singapore population, and we postulate that these common variants may similarly
      modify the risk of anthracyclines-induced cardiomyopathy in adult breast cancer patients.
      Post-treatment echocardiography is not routinely performed in patients who complete adjuvant
      anthracyclines-containing chemotherapy. We believe that some of these high-risk individuals
      may have subclinical reduced left ventricular ejection fraction that may in the future
      increase the risk of congestive cardiac failure in the presence of other risk factors (eg
      hypertension, anemia, serious infection, etc). Identifying these individuals could therefore
      be important as early treatment with ACE inhibitors may improve cardiac function. Confirming
      the correlation between genetic variants including the CBR3 V244M can also help to develop a
      predictive algorithm in the future to identify patients in whom anthracyclines should be
      avoided.

    <description>Breast cancer patients who received at least one cycle of doxorubicin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy for treatment of early stage breast cancer at least 12 months ago and who had a pre-doxorubicin echocardiography done at NUHS will be enrolled. Study subjects will donate one sample of blood (20ml) for genetic and biomarker studies related to breast cancer and anthracyclines pharmacodynamics. An echocardiography will be performed to measure left ventricular ejection fraction, and compared with the subject's pre-doxorubicin echocardiography done at NUH. Correlative analysis will be performed between genetic variants and left ventricular ejection change.</description>
