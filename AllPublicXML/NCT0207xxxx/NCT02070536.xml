  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current clinical prediction scores for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have
      limited positive predictive value. No studies have evaluated predictive kinetics of plasma
      biomarkers and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) polymorphisms in a broad
      population of critically ill patients or as an adjunct to clinical prediction scores.

      The main objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the predictive values of plasma
      soluble RAGE levels for the onset of ARDS in a high risk population of patients admitted to
      the intensive care unit (ICU).

      One of the investigators goals is to improve early identification of patients at risk for
      ARDS in order to better implement preventive stategies prior to ARDS development.

      The primary outcome is the occurrence of ARDS during the first week after admission to the
      ICU.

      BACKGROUND :

      ARDS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Only few
      pharmacological treatments are available, with limited evidence of efficacy.

      The development of efficient preventive stategies is limited by the investigators inability
      to predict which patients are likely to develop ARDS. The Lung Injury predicition Score
      (LIPS) has been developed to identify patients at high risk for ARDS, but its predictive
      value remains limited.

      The receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is now identified as a marker of
      alveolar type I cell injury. RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that acts as
      a multiligand receptor which is involved in propagating inflammatory responses. Plasma levels
      of sRAGE are correlated with clinical and radiologic severity in ARDS patients.

      The investigators main objective is to assess the predictive values of plasma sRAGE and
      esRAGE levels, as well as their evolution over the first 24 hours after admission, for the
      onset of ARDS in high risk patients.

      The secondary objectives are to :

        -  to evaluate the predictive value of RAGE polymorphisms (_429 T/C, _374 T/A, 2184 A/G,
           Gly82Ser) for the onset of ARDS

        -  to evaluate the predictive value of maximal plasma levels of RAGE soluble forms for the
           onset of ARDS

        -  to test the relationship between RAGE polymorphisms and plasma sRAGE and esRAGE levels

        -  to test whether serial sRAGE measurements would improve the discrimination of the LIP
           Score or not

        -  to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma levels of RAGE soluble forms for : duration
           of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU and 30-day mortality.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE :

      The purpose of this prospective observational study is to test the values of RAGE
      polymorphism and soluble forms plasma levels for ARDS prediction in high risk ICU patients
