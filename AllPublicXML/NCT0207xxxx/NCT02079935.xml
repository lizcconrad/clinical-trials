  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Eating disorders&quot; includes anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating and other
      specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). Common to all is the intensively occupation to
      control food intake, body image and body weight. Most people with this kind of disorder don't
      reach for professional help, or there may be more than 4 years before they do. Cognitive
      behavior therapy is the foremost method of treatment of eating disorders, but up to 30-50% of
      the patients don't respond to this. The investigators find it important to identify science
      based alternatives of therapy, as this may reduce the health concern, and broaden the choice
      of therapy methods. A former study by Sundgot-Borgen et al in 2002, found guided physical
      activity to reduce symptoms of bulimia nervosa just as good as the traditional cognitive
      therapy.

      The primary objective of the project is to see whether the combination of physical exercise
      and dietary therapy is more effective in treating eating disorders, than cognitive therapy.

      Secondly, the investigators want to see whether there are any differences with regard to the
      individual satisfaction of treatment method, and to associated costs. Interviews with a
      sufficient number of participants from the PED-t arm to meet data saturation criteria, and
      all theraphists in the new treatment offer, will give uniqe insight to experiences with the
      treatment method and the delivery of treatment.

      Subjects are recruited through primary doctors, social media and newspapers, and will be
      included continuously by screening interviews. There will be a randomization into two
      treatment groups (cognitive behavior, or physical activity and nutrition education) to be
      followed for 16 weeks. Each week includes one meeting of group therapy (90 minutes) and
      homework related to treatment, and for 4 weeks midway there will be two therapy meetings pr
      week (a total of 20 meetings). Post tests are planned at week 17, and at 6, 12, and 24 months
      after treatment.

      Participants reqruited during ongoing treatment groups are placed on a waitlist, serving as
      controls to the treatment groups.
