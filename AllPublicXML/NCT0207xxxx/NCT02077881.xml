    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is designed to efficiently identify the regimen limiting toxicity (RLT)
      and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of the immunotherapeutic agent
      indoximod when administered in combination with standard of care chemotherapy gemcitabine
      plus nab-paclitaxel in subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. All subjects
      will receive the same standard gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel regimen, plus indoximod in
      doses increasing from 600 mg twice daily to, potentially, 1200 mg twice daily.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II trial designed to evaluate the combination of the immunotherapeutic
      agent indoximod and the standard of care chemotherapy gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in
      subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The phase 1 portion is designed to
      identify the regimen-limiting toxicity (RLT) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the
      combination. The phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the potential efficacy of this
      combination. All subjects will receive the standard 28-day gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel
      regimen. Twice daily oral indoximod will be administered concurrently in continuous 28 day
      cycles.

      In the phase 1 portion, dose escalation of indoximod will begin at 600mg/day and potentially
      escalate to 1200mg/day. There will be no intra-subject dose escalation. Regimen-limiting
      toxicity will be considered as those toxicities related to indoximod that significantly limit
      the administration of the backbone chemotherapy gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. The period
      for determination of dose-limiting toxicities will be the initial 28 days of treatment. The
      recommended phase 2 dose will include an assessment of toxicities that occur at later time
      points.

      Once a RP2D is determined, the phase 2 portion of the study will be initiated. In both phase
      1 and phase 2, every 2 cycles subjects will have repeat imaging to assess response. Corollary
      biomarkers will be assessed at the same interval as will PET-CT after the 1st 8 week cycle.
      Up to 18 patients will be enrolled in the phase 1 portion of the study and 80 patients will
      be enrolled in the phase 2 portion.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic
             adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The definitive diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma will be made by integrating the histopathological data within the
             context of the clinical and radiographic data. Patients with islet cell or
             neuroendocrine neoplasms are excluded.

          -  Initial diagnosis of metastatic disease must have occurred ≤8 weeks prior to entry in
             the study.

          -  Patient has one or more metastatic tumors measurable per RECIST 1.1 by CT scan ≤4
             weeks prior to entry into the study (or MRI, if patient is allergic to CT contrast
             media). Patients cannot have nodal metastases alone even if such nodal metastases are
             formally considered M1 disease

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female, and ≥18 years of age.

          -  If a female patient is of child-bearing potential, as evidenced by regular menstrual
             periods, she must have a negative serum pregnancy test (β-hCG) documented within 7
             days prior to the first administration of study drug.

          -  The effects of indoximod on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because indoximod may affect maternal immune tolerance of the fetus, sexually
             active women of child-bearing potential must agree to use two forms of contraception
             (hormonal and barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation. Use of contraception or abstinence should
             continue for a minimum of 1 month after completion of the study. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             discontinue the study drug and inform her treating physician immediately. Also men
             should be discouraged from fathering children while on treatment.

          -  Patients must have received no previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or
             investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease.

          -  Prior treatment with gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel in the adjuvant setting is
             allowed, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since completion of the last dose and
             no lingering toxicities are present.

          -  Patients cannot have received any other immunomodulatory therapies (including
             vaccines) as treatment for this or any other cancer.

          -  Platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 (75 × 10^9/L)

          -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥9 g/dL.

          -  Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at Baseline (obtained ≤14 days prior
             to randomization):

          -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 × upper limit of normal range (ULN), unless liver
             metastases are clearly present, then ≤5 × ULN is allowed

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ULN, patients with known Gilbert's syndrome allowed up to 3x ULN.

          -  Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for

             as demonstrated by prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within
             normal limits (±15%). If the patient is on coumadin we suggest switching the patient
             to a low molecular weight heparin product including enoxaparin (Lovenox) and
             fondiparinux (Arixtra), but if not feasible then INR must be ≤ 3.

          -  Patient has no clinically significant abnormalities in urinalysis results (obtained
             ≤14 days prior to randomization).

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70.

          -  Patients should be asymptomatic for jaundice prior to Day 1.

             cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible. Patients with other
             malignancies are eligible if they were cured by surgery alone or surgery plus
             radiotherapy and have been continuously disease-free for at least 3 years.

          -  Patient has active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring
             systemic therapy.

          -  Patient has known historical or active infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis
             C.

          -  Patients with any active autoimmune disease (i.e. psoriasis, extensive atopic
             dermatitis, asthma, IBD, M.S., uveitis, vasculitis), chronic inflammatory condition,
             or any condition requiring concurrent use of any systemic immunosuppressants or
             steroids for any reason would be excluded from the study. Any patient with an
             allo-transplant of any kind would be excluded as well. This would include those with a
             xenograft heart valve to avoid the potential risk of any immune reaction causing
             valvular degeneration. Mild-intermittent asthma requiring only occasional beta-agonist
             inhaler use or mild localized eczema will not be excluded.

             of their excipients.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
