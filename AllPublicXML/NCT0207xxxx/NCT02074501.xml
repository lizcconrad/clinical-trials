  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: More than 42% of older people (aged +65) have a stroke and most of them require
      some type of help to self-care at home. Informal caregivers have reported different types of
      need and have shown dissatisfaction with technical and emotional support delivered by
      community health teams. Furthermore, empowering informal caregivers who care after older
      stroke survivors is an important challenge, preventing them from negative outcomes such as
      burden, anxiety and depression or loss of physical function or hospitalization in older
      people.

      Objectives: This pilot study aims to implement and evaluate the impact of an intervention
      based on training and telephone support delivered to informal caregivers who care after older
      people post-stroke.

      Setting: Community health units in Northern Portugal region. Design/Methods: This single
      blinded randomized trial will be delivered by a community nursing team to informal caregivers
      1 week, 1 and 3 months after a hospital discharge.

      Study outcome(s): The primary outcomes will be informal caregivers´ empowerment. Secondary
      outcomes will include burden and health quality of life in caregivers; functionality,
      hospital readmission and institutionalization of older people stroke survivors, measured 1
      and 3 months after intervention.

      Results/Conclusion: Data collection started in February and will be concluded in August 2014.
      First results will be published at the beginning of 2015. The InCARE programme will be the
      first pilot in informal caregivers study ever conducted in Portugal. It will highlight new
      ways to support caregivers who take care of older people after a stroke. If successful, this
      study will be translational and it will also allow to disseminate the results in Portugal and
      abroad and implement it as best practice.
