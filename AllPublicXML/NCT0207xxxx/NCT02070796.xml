  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to establish Bioequivalence (BE) of 2 different
      formulations of the 2 mg/24 hr (10 cm^2) Rotigotine transdermal patches in Chinese subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bioequivalence will be concluded if the 90 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) for the ratio
      Treatment A/Treatment B are fully included in the acceptance range from 0.8-1.25 for AUC(0-t)
      and AUC, and within the acceptance range from 0.7 to 1.43 for Cmax.
