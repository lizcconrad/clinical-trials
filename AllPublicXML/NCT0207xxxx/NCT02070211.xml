  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present trial is to investigate the effects of omega-3 PUFAs in
      individuals aged 12-26 years with 22q11DS at ultra-high risk for developing a first episode
      of psychosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will use a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study
      design. Eighty individuals aged 12-26 will be randomly assigned in two treatment conditions
      (40 in each arm) at the Department of Neuroscience, Children Hospital Bambino Gesù, Rome,
      Italy. Randomisation will be arranged by the Clinical Trials Department of the same hospital.
      Participants will receive 4 capsules (2 in the morning; 2 in the evening) for a period of 12
      weeks. The active treatment is a supplement of yellow gelatine 0.625 g capsules containing
      concentrated marine fish oil. The daily dose of 4 capsules will provide approximately 700 mg
      of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n3), 480 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n3), and 7.6
      mg of Vitamin E. Vitamin E is added as an antioxidant to fish oil capsules to stabilize
      highly unsaturated fatty acids. Participants will receive either 4 capsules of 0.7g marine
      fish oil or 4 capsules of 0.7g of paraffin oil (which is not absorbed by the gastrointestinal
      tract) per day. The daily dose of omega-3 PUFAs is based on our previous trail (Amminger et
      al., 2010).

      All patients will receive standard treatment, which includes management by a psychiatrist or
      resident psychiatrist and non-neuroleptic pharmacotherapy as clinically indicated.
      Specifically, Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) embedded within case management will be
      administered. The CBT will be based on the models developed at the PACE Clinic in Melbourne,
      in the EDIE trial, and in Cologne, as these have proven to be effective in RCTs. The number
      of sessions delivered will be captured for each client. In addition, fidelity will be
      monitored by therapists rating their own sessions on an established checklist of therapeutic
      interventions. Any additional psychosocial interventions delivered will also be documented.
      The case management component will consist of therapists addressing current interpersonal and
      social issues and providing practical help. 6 - 20 CBCM sessions will be provided within the
      first 6 months.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Omega-3 PUFAs have a positive effect on clinical course and outcome in UHR+22q11DS
           individuals

           Specifically that at 12 months follow-up:

             -  The transition to psychosis rate is significantly lower in the omega-3 PUFA group

             -  Ratings on CAARMS, PANSS, MADRS, GAF improve significantly more in the omega-3 PUFA
                group

             -  Neuropsychological functioning is significantly better in the omega-3 PUFA group.

        2. Lipid metabolism characteristics described in schizophrenia will be more prevalent in
           individuals who make transition to psychosis

             -  Reduced omega-3 PUFAs and reduced nervonic acid (Amminger et al., 2011) and
                increased PLA2 activity at baseline characterize individuals who develop psychosis

             -  PLA2 activity will significantly decrease pre/post treatment in the omega-3 PUFA
                group

    <measure>The primary outcome measure for this study is the transition to psychosis rate measured by the Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental States (CAARMS) (Yung et al., 2005),</measure>
    <time_frame>The time frame for the first outcome measure will be over the 12-month follow-up period.</time_frame>
    <description>Transition to psychosis is operationally defined, based on the CAARMS (Yung et al., 2005) criteria: 1./Abnormal thoughts held with delusional intensity occurring every day for one week or longer; 2./True hallucinations in any modality occurring every day for one week or longer; or 3./Formal thought disorder to the degree of incoherence and/or loose associations occurring every day for one week or longer</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome measures are the transition to psychosis rate measured by the CAARMS, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>These scales will be performed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>These instruments are widely used clinical scales for psychotic patients and guarantee standardized assessment when used with interview guides and operationalized anchor points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side effects of therapeutic interventions will be assessed using the UKU side effect rating scale (Lingjaerde et al., 1987).</measure>

    <description>In accordance with Bilder et al. (2000) assessments will cover following neuropsychological functions: (1) memory (spatial short term memory, spatial working memory, visuospatial paired associate learning, pattern recognition, spatial recognition, delayed matching to sample), (2) executive, (3) attention, (4) language, (5) motor, (6) visuospatial.</description>

    <measure>Blood samples: EDTA blood in standard glass tubes (no plastic tubes because of artifacts for omega-3 PUFA analysis)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be collected and centrifuged as soon as possible at 1500g for 15 minutes. inPLA2 sample: 1 tube (5ml) EDTA blood: Plasma, buffy coat and the top 2 mm of RBCs will be aspirated and frozen. Omega-3 PUFA sample: 1 tube (10ml) EDTA blood: second wash step required. Samples will be frozen at -80 degrees Celsius.</description>
