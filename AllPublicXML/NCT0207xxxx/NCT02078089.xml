  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, Phase Ib dose escalation study of Oxcarbazepine with
      morphine in patients with refractory cancer pain. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the
      safety and toxicity of the combination of Oxcarbazepine plus morphine. The secondary
      endpoints are improving pain control, reduce morphine use and improve the quality of life.

    <description>Patients must be on stable or increasing doses of greater than or equal to 180 mg of morphine sulfate per day. Morphine is taken orally for 42 days.
In addition to Morphine, patients will also receive oral Oxcarbazepine 150 mg, every 12 hours, for 2 weeks, then increase the dose to 300 mg, every 12 hours, for 2 weeks and then increase the dose to 450 mg, every 12 hours, for the final 2 weeks. Patients will take oral tablets of oxcarbazepine for a total of 42 days.</description>
