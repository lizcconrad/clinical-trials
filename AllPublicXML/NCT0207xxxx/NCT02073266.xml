  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study was to compare the macular hole closure and visual acuity
      gain following vitrectomy using SF6 gas tamponade with 7 days of face-down positioning versus
      C3F8 gas tamponade with 14 days of face-down positioning.

      The secondary purpose was to report, in each group, the cumulative incidence of cataract
      development 1 year following macular hole surgery and the proportion of complications (*).

      ((*) hypertony, hypotony, retinal tear, retinal detachment and endophthalmitis) This
      prospective randomized study examined a 3 year period. The first patient was included in
      January 2010 and the last in November 2011. The 12-month follow-up spread out from March 2011
      to December 2012. The first group included 31 patients who had undergone macular hole surgery
      using SF6 gas and who were advised to stay in face-down position for 7 days postoperatively
      (SF6 group). These patients were compared to 28 patients who had undergone macular hole
      surgery with C3F8 gas and who were advised to maintain a face-down position for 14 days.
      Patients in both groups underwent vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling, and
      fluid-gas exchange using either SF6 or C3F8.

      Preoperative data included the characterization of the hole with Optical Coherence Tomography
      (OCT), the best correct visual acuity (VA) recorded in number of letters using the Early
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, classification of the cataract according
      to the LOCS III and the intraocular pressure IOP. Postoperative data included OCT
      confirmation of the closure at 6 weeks and 1 year, 1 year's best corrected VA recorded in
      number of letters (EDTRS chart) and determination of cataract development and extraction as
      needed.

    <description>The first group included 31 patients who had undergone MH surgery using SF6 gas and who were advised to stay in face-down position for 7 days postoperatively (SF6 group). Patients in both groups underwent 25 G pars plana vitrectomy, ILM peeling, fluid-air exchange followed by air-gas exchange with SF6 or C3F8. The internal limiting membrane was coloured with trypan blue or indocyanine green in equal proportion in both groups.</description>
