  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No more than 56% of subjects at the Robley Rex Louisville Veterans Administration Medical
      Center (VAMC) prescribed boceprevir-based triple therapy, will complete Hepatitis C (HCV)
      treatment as prescribed. Of patients who did not complete therapy, the primary reasons for
      discontinuation were side effects (48%) and non-adherence (32%). An intervention is needed to
      improve the treatment completion rate in subjects so they can achieve the high SVR rates
      noted in SPRINT-2 and RESPOND-2

      This protocol is a Phase II Open Label Clinical Trial of a technology-based application
      &quot;On-Plan&quot; (OP) which is expected to improve adherence to boceprevir-based triple therapy in
      subjects with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C infection compared to historical controls from
      the University of Louisville. OP uses a combination of smart phone and computer-based social
      support to correct non-adherence and manage side effects as well as contingency management
      (positive reinforcement) when patient-reported compliance is documented by pill counts and/or
      electronic compliance monitors. 52 consenting subjects prescribed boceprevir-based triple
      therapy for chronic genotype 1 HCV according the U.S. prescribing information will be
      enrolled and all will receive the OP application. A Simon's two stage procedure will be
      utilized to minimize risk while preliminary efficacy/safety data are collected on this
      innovative &quot;app&quot; for HCV therapy.

    <description>The percentage of patients completing treatment weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 will be compared to historical controls treated with boceprevir-based triple therapy from our institution. In subjects not completing therapy as prescribed the reasons for discontinuation will be characterized including non-adherence and side effects and also compared to the historical controls.</description>

    <measure>Virologic response</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Virologic response to therapy will be determined at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24; as well as at the end of treatment (EOTR) and 12 and 24 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12 and SVR24) and compared to historical controls. For these comparisons, subjects will be placed into appropriate subgroups (treatment naïve, relapsers, and non-responders). The percentage of subjects completing the entire course of therapy as initially prescribed will also be compared to historical controls. The percentage of subjects fulfilling the 80/80/80 rule will also be determined and their virologic outcomes determined although direct comparison with historical controls for these endpoints are our institution cannot be determined.</description>
