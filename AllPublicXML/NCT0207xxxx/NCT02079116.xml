  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes after a meal challenge, measured by Single Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and statistical parametric mapping.</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes after a meal challenge (time of radiopharmaceutical injection)</time_frame>
    <description>Using 99m technetium ecd radiopharmaceutical, this study aims to detect rCBF differences between SPECT images performed after a meal challenge composed by 60 grams of fat and water and also after a challenge constituted by only water (control), both ingested orally. This approach is performed in a group of 10 people with obesity and also in 10 people without obesity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood levels mean differences within both groups, with and without obesity and across these groups, of hormones and metabolites by multiplexed assay using luminex technology and spectrophotometry, respectively.</measure>
    <time_frame>60 and 30 minutes before, at the time and 30 and 60 minutes after the radiopharmaceutical injection.</time_frame>
    <description>This study looks for mean differences of blood levels within and across groups with and without obesity. The metabolites and hormones/cytokines measured are, respectively: glucose and triacylglycerols (measured by spectrophotometry), insulin, leptin, amylin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha, active ghrelin, peptide yy (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) (multiplexed assay using luminex).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resting energy expenditure (REE) and body composition measurements by indirect calorimetry and electrical bioimpedance, respectively.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours before SPECT acquisition.</time_frame>
    <description>This study also aims to measure and compare the REE by indirect calorimetry with a Quark (Cosmed, Italy) calorimeter and the body composition by Byodinamics 450 (Biodynamics Corp., United States) within the two groups and across them.</description>
