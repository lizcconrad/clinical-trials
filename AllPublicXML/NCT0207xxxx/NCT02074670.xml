    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential reorganization in the sensorimotor
      cortex in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients after Body Weight Supported Treadmill Training
      (BWSTT) associated with conventional motor rehabilitation. The investigators hypothesized
      that training with weight bearing associated with conventional motor rehabilitation will be
      able to reorganize the brain.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ASIA C or D and the ability to cooperate with instructions of the motor
             task required. The motor task was to perform ankle plantar flexion and toe flexion and
             fingers and thumbs movement of the both sides; they also had to be able to fulfill the
             general conditions necessary for an MRI exploration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrollable spasticity-induced body movements were excluded from the
             study.
