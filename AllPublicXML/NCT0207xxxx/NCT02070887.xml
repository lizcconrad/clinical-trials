      The overall aim of this observational study is to investigate the impact of COMT inhibition
      on homocysteine metabolism, vascular physiology and correlates of neurodegeneration in PD
      patients with certain COMT genotype. It is designed to evaluate effect size of Hcy lowering
      to secondary outcome parameters. Assessment of outcome parameters will be rater-blinded or
      computer-based.
