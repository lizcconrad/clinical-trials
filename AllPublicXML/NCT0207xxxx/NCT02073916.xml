  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-center study will assess the safety and tolerability of combining
      trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) to Lapatinib and Abraxane in patients with metastatic
      HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will receive Abraxane on Day 1 of each 1-week cycle and
      T-DM1 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Patients with take Lapatinib orally daily. Anticipated
      time on study treatment is up to 12 weeks for patients metastatic breast cancer, until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Subjects may continue on treatment past
      12 weeks if responding to study treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Trastuzumab Emtansine in combination with
      Abraxane and Lapatinib at different dose levels. The investigators are proposing in this
      phase Ib study to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Trastuzumab Emtansine in
      combination with Lapatinib plus Abraxane in metastatic Her2 over-expressed breast cancer.

      The investigators hypothesize that combining antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-emtansine
      and lapatinib together with Abraxane will improve clinical efficacy by affecting both PI3K
      and ERK1,2 MAPK pathways.
