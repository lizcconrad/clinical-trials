    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to look at the relationship between lifestyle
      factors and cancer-related outcomes, such as the risk of the disease coming back, patient
      quality of life, physical functioning, and bodily reactions (such as hormones and immune
      function).

      Baseline Visit:

      If you are found to be eligible and you agree to take part in this study, you will come in to
      the clinic for the baseline study visit, which will take place before your first radiation
      therapy visit. During the baseline visit, you will be asked to fill out questionnaires about
      your sleeping habits, how you have been feeling, diet, exercise, and the general quality of
      your life. This should take about 60-80 minutes. You will be given a hand held computer to do
      this unless you prefer a paper copy. All follow-up questionnaires will be delivered
      electronically, but you can be given paper copies if needed. You will be asked to create a
      username and password for use on the password-protected study website. All information you
      enter into this website is encrypted and stored on institutional servers to protect your
      privacy. You will be able to use this website to contact the study staff, access information,
      schedule appointments, and so on. You will be taught how to use the website in your first
      orientation visit and any technical support will be available upon request.

      You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test to measure the electrical activity of your
      heart), a body composition scan (called a dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scan) to
      measure your body-fat level, a brief 30-second strength tests of both your upper and lower
      body, and fitness testing (which is performed on a treadmill or stationary bike). This should
      take up to 90 minutes total. Women who are able to become pregnant will have a urine
      pregnancy test performed before the DEXA scan. A DEXA scan has about 1/10 the radiation dose
      of a standard x-ray. If you are prescribed a DEXA by an outside physician or for some other
      reason are getting a DEXA, please let us know as to avoid excess scans. If you are pregnant,
      you will not have DEXA scans.

      At every study visit, your height and weight will be measured and any swelling in your arms
      will be measured with a device called a perometer. This device uses a sensor to measure the
      size of your arm. Your arms will be measured one arm at a time. You will insert your arms
      into a tube-like structure as the sensor slides up and down. This will take only a few
      minutes and is will not cause any pain.

      Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for tests to measure hormones and your immune
      system responses. This should take about 15 minutes. You will need to fast for 12 hours
      before this blood draw. You will be provided with healthy snacks after your blood draw.

      Saliva Testing:

      The day after your baseline visit (the day you enrolled), you will be asked to provide saliva
      samples to measure the level of cortisol (a stress hormone). These saliva samples will be
      collected 4 times a day for 3 days in a row. You will be asked to collect the samples when
      you first wake up, about 45 minutes later, about 10 hours after waking, and then at bedtime.
      To collect each saliva sample, you will chew on a cotton ball for a few seconds and then put
      the cotton in a small plastic tube. You will write down the times at which you took these
      samples. You will then mail the samples back to MD Anderson in postage-paid envelopes that
      will be provided to you. The tubes will also be provided at no cost to you. These saliva
      samples will be destroyed after being studied.

      Fitness Testing:

      You will also wear an accelerometer (a pedometer-like instrument that records activity)
      clipped to your waistline, for 5 days. The accelerometer will record information about your
      movements.

      Dietary Assessments:

      Within 2 weeks of your consent date, you will be contacted by telephone on 3 random days for
      a dietary recall. A trained nutritionist employed by the Arizona Cancer Center Behavioral
      Measurements Assessment Laboratory will be making this call and will ask you about the foods
      and beverages you have consumed in the last 24 hours. You do not need to change anything
      about the way you eat for this, and you will not know exactly when they will call. You will
      receive a phone call from study staff if they are unable to reach you.

      Study Groups:

      After your baseline visit, you will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups:

        -  Group 1 will take part in a Comprehensive Lifestyle Change Program that consists of
           intervention sessions (described below).

        -  Group 2 will take part in the Assessment-Only Program and only take part in the
           follow-up visits (described below).

      Neither you nor the study staff can choose which group you are assigned to.

      Intervention Sessions (Group 1 Only):

      If you are assigned to Group 1, you will first attend an orientation visit where you will get
      to know everyone who will work with you during the study. Here you will learn how to use the
      website, schedule your own appointments, and log your behaviors in the website. You will then
      have 3-5 days of intervention sessions per week over the course of your radiation treatment.
      The sessions will offer a variety of instruction and counseling including: nutritional
      coaching (one session per week); behavioral therapy (one session per week); yoga and
      meditation practice (2 sessions per week); resistance training (2 sessions per week); and a
      weekly meal sharing and cooking class. You will also be scheduled for a grocery store tour.
      Each session will take between 1 and 3 hours, depending on that day's combination of
      activities. Each session will include up to 5 study participants and a session leader, but
      some sessions may be conducted one-on-one. All counseling sessions will be done one-one-one.

      You will also be asked to participate in 30-60 minutes of supervised and/or unsupervised
      aerobic exercise up to 6 days a week. If you choose to participate in classes at a local gym,
      for which we will offer memberships, this will count toward your aerobic training. We will
      also provide transportation from the clinic if needed.

      After the end of radiation therapy, you will also have either phone or computer-based
      meetings up to 1 time a week for 6 months, and then 1 time a month for 6 more months with the
      study psychologist. The meeting times are on a flexible schedule. If you do not have a
      computer and/or internet access, these will be provided to you while you are on study.

      You will have 2-hour face-to-face meetings at all of your follow-up appointments during the
      first year after completing radiation therapy.

      You will be assigned a study coach for each part of the intervention program:

      Physical activity: A coach will work with your individual fitness level to create an exercise
      program for you. Coaching on strength training may be done during or after you finish
      radiation therapy, and you will be given a pedometer and elastic workout bands to help you
      practice at home. You will be provided with a gym membership at no cost for up to one year
      after radiation therapy is over, and you will work with community-based coaches. You will
      also be given a voucher for a local athletic shoe store. After you finish radiation therapy,
      you will be contacted at least once a week by your outside-community coach. You will be asked
      to use your profile on the study website to track your exercise.

      Diet/Nutrition: You will work with a dietician every week to learn how to shop and cook
      during radiation therapy. You will be asked to use your profile on the study website to track
      your eating habits. You will be given cookbooks and a blender along with recipes for the
      blender and kitchen items such as a magnet, grocery tote bag, and water bottle.

      Mind-body practice: You will meet once a week with a mind-body instructor. During these
      meetings, you will be instructed in a seated meditation and a movement-based practice. You
      will be asked to use your profile on the study website to track your mind-body practice. You
      will be given a yoga mat to facilitate your practice.

      Social support/social network: You will meet with a psychologist once a week during radiation
      treatment. You will take part in cognitive behavioral therapy to help support the behavior
      changes. You will receive a welcome box including helpful items such as a journal, along with
      the book Anticancer. During this therapy, the psychologist will work with you to help you
      recognize the barriers that may keep you from changing your behavior, so that you can
      understand how to develop new habits. Although the psychologist will be calling you once you
      have completed your treatment, you can request to have additional consults with any one of
      the study personnel at any time you would like. You will also have an opportunity to
      voluntarily participate in a Facebook group for program members and staff only, designed to
      increase sharing of information, recipes, experiences, etc. If you choose to belong to this
      virtual group, you can communicate with others in the program in addition to staff members.

      Smoking cessation counseling (if needed): If you smoke, you will be offered smoking cessation
      treatment from the MD Anderson's Tobacco Treatment Program.

      Intervention sessions will be recorded in order to protect you and ensure the program is
      delivered as safely and effectively as possible. If there is any video recording, it will be
      only to capture your instructor. Most recordings will only be audio and will again be
      directed at your instructor or counselor. Once the recordings have been reviewed they will be
      destroyed.

      We may use and publish testimonies, quotes, or program experiences as part of future
      publications, books, and other media outlets such as radio programming and newsletters, but
      your name will not be associated with the quote unless we get separate authorization from
      you. This authorization will be obtained using MD Anderson's institutional HIPAA
      Authorization form.

      Follow-up Visits After Finishing Radiation Therapy (Both Groups):

      At the end of radiation treatment, at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the end of radiation
      treatment, and then once a year for up to 3 years after that, you will be asked to return to
      the clinic for follow-up visits. These visits will take place at the same time as your
      medical follow-up visits at MD Anderson.

      During these follow-up visits, the following tests will be performed for all participants:

        -  You will fill out a set of questionnaires and fitness measures that was very similar to
           the ones you filled out at baseline. You will be asked to fill out questionnaires about
           your sleeping habits, how you have been feeling, your diet and exercise habits, and the
           general quality of your life. This will take about 60-80 minutes to complete.

        -  You will also have an ECG that will take no more than 20 minutes to complete.

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure hormones and your immune system
           responses. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw.

        -  You will be asked to provide 4 saliva samples a day for 3 days in a row. You will follow
           the same process as you did for the baseline saliva samples.

        -  You will wear an accelerometer 24 hours a day for 5 days in a row to collect the same
           data as before.

        -  You will be receiving 3 calls within 2 weeks of each timepoint for your dietary recalls.

      After completing the questionnaires, saliva sample collection, and accelerometer
      participation, you will return all materials to the research staff, using a prepaid mailing
      envelope. If you fill out the questionnaires electronically, these do not need to be printed
      and returned.

      You will have follow-up DEXA scans to measure body composition at the end of your radiation
      treatment, and then 6, 12, and 24 months later. Women who are able to become pregnant may
      have urine pregnancy tests before each DEXA scan. If you are pregnant, you will not have DEXA
      scans during your pregnancy.

      Length of Participation:

      Your participation on this study will be over about 5 years after the end of radiation
      therapy.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 150 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
