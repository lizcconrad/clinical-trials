  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a web
      application for first-time DWI offenders that will provide them with an age-appropriate brief
      motivational intervention (BMI) to motivate them to reduce their drinking and a cognitive
      behavioral intervention (CBI) for to help them achieve and maintain abstinence. The goal is
      to reduce heavy drinking and consequently the risk for future drunk driving.

      The specific objectives of this Phase II are:

        -  Completing the development of the Right Turns prototype based on feedback from the Phase
           I pilot study participants. This includes: providing more structure and guidance as
           participants work in the Tool Box section of the program; simplifying the content of the
           Tool Box; further R&amp;D in the text messaging feature for 2nd and 3rd tier cellular
           providers; implement a customized pdf report function for progress reports from the
           program to users' probation officers (under control of the user); developing a follow-up
           component and outcome reports; and revising the videos in the Tool Box to reflect
           greater diversity and a younger population of drinkers.

        -  Conducting a randomized clinical trial of the program with first time DWI/DUI offenders
           who are recruited locally, collecting follow-up data, analyzing the data, and reporting
           the results.
