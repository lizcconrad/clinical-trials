  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the bioavailability (the extent to which a medication
      becomes available to the body) of subcutaneously (under the skin using a needle) administered
      sirukumab and to compare the pharmacokinetics of sirukumab administered subcutaneously using
      a pre-filled syringe fitted with the UltraSafe Passive™ Delivery system (PFS-U) with the
      SmartJect™ Autoinjector (PFS-AI) in healthy male participants.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), parallel-group (each group of participants will be
      treated at the same time), multicenter; single-dose study. Approximately 138 participants
      will be randomly allocated in a 3:3:3:7:7 ratio to 1 of the 5 treatment groups as follows:
      Group 1 (a single intravenous infusion of 100 mg sirukumab), Group 2 (a single subcutaneous
      [SC] injection of 50 mg sirukumab with PFS-U), Group 3 (a single SC injection of 50 mg
      sirukumab with PFS-AI, Group 4 (a single SC injection of 100 mg sirukumab with PFS-U), and
      Group 5 (a single SC injection of 100 mg sirukumab with PFS-AI). Randomization will be
      stratified by body weight (50.0 kg to &lt;70.0 kg, 70.0 kg to &lt;85.0 kg, 85.0 kg to 100.0 kg).
      Participants will be hospitalized in the study unit for administration of study drug and will
      be discharged after completion of all scheduled assessments on Day 5. Participants will be
      required to return to the study unit for outpatient visits on Days 6 and 7, followed by
      weekly/biweekly outpatient visits, and then a safety follow-up for a total of 13 weeks after
      study drug administration. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events,
      physical examination, vital signs, injection site and infusion reactions, electrocardiogram,
      and clinical laboratory tests. The maximum study duration for each participant will be 120
      days.
