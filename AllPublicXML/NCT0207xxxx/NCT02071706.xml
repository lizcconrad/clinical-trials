        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must have a clinical indication for a PET/CT exam

          2. Subject must be at least eighteen (18) years of age; and

          3. Female subjects that are determined to be non-pregnant by a physician investigator or
             are demonstrated non-pregnant by negative urine pregnancy test administered within the
             24 hour period before PET/CT imaging; and

          4. Subject must be able to hear and understand instructions without assistive devices;
             and

          5. Subject must provide written informed consent; and

          6. Subject has the necessary mental capacity to understand instructions, and is able to
             comply with protocol requirements; and

          7. Subject is able to remain still for duration of imaging procedure (approximately 60
             minutes total for PET/MRI); and

          8. Subject must be able to participate in a PET/MR imaging session within 2 hours of
             concluding their PET/CT exam and within 4 hours of PET radiotracer administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have any axial diameter larger than 55 cm; or

          2. Subjects with a weight greater than 227 kgs; or

          3. Subjects that have metallic/conductive or electrically/magnetically active implants
             without MR Safe or MR Conditional labeling, with the exception of dental
             devices/fillings, surgical clips, and surgical staples determined to be safe for MRI
             scanning by a physician investigator; or

          4. Subjects that have implants with MR Unsafe labeling; or

          5. Subjects that have implants labeled as MR Conditional by the manufacturer for which
             the allowable conditions are not expected to be achieved by the MR/PET environment or
             scan protocol ; or

          6. Subjects who have a contraindication to MRI according to the screening policy of the
             participating site
