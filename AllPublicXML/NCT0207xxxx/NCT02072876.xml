  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of stroke has increased by 100% in the last four decades in developing
      countries like Pakistan. Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is the most frequent
      causative subtype of ischemic stroke in the world including Pakistan. ICAD is progressive
      narrowing of the arteries at the base of the brain due to atherosclerosis. After a stroke
      from ICAD, recurrence rate is highest in any sub-type of stroke, up to 28% with limited
      therapeutic options. Therefore, it is imperative to delineate the determinants of
      asymptomatic ICAD prior to stroke. Investigators hypothesized that there is at least a 20%
      difference in the proportion of clinical, life-style (dietary, physical activity, obesity,
      smoking and stress/depression), and socio-economic predictors of asymptomatic ICAD than those
      with no ICAD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major emerging cause of adult disability and the 3rd leading non-communicable
      cause of mortality in the world . With half of the world's population living in Asia, stroke
      epidemiology and its risk factor determination is important globally. The changes in
      population demographics and continuing industrialization in Asia have also led to a change in
      the epidemiology of stroke sub-types . Among the ischemic stroke sub-types, Intracranial
      Atherosclerotic disease is now emerging as the most prevalent vascular cause of stroke with
      high prevalence in Asian, African and Hispanic individuals .

      Patients with ICAD are at a significant risk for recurrent stroke, with a risk as high as 25%
      in the first two years . Rate of recurrent stroke also varies by the location of the affected
      artery. Risk factor management is extremely important for the primary and secondary
      prevention of stroke in Asia as it is in Western countries. With the changing demographics
      and relatively fewer cost effective treatment modalities available, particularly for resource
      poor countries like Pakistan, it is imperative to delineate the clinical as well as lifestyle
      risk factors at an earlier asymptomatic stage to prevent future life-threatening
      consequences.

      Therefore the primary objective of this study is to determine the clinical, lifestyle,
      dietary and psycho-social determinants of asymptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic disease
      (ICAD) and its other associated Brain MRI findings namely brain volume reduction, silent
      brain infarcts, and peri-ventricular hyper intensities in clinically normal adults with ICAD
      on MRI Brain.

    <description>This was defined as any artery (Internal Carotid Artery ICA, Middle Cerebral Artery MCA,Anterior Cerebral Artery ACA,Posterior Cerebral Artery PCA, Basilar Artery BA, and Vertebral Artery VA) having &gt;25% stenosis on MRA. An internationally standardized ( WASID) equation was used to calculate the degree of stenosis.
Percent stenosis= [1- (Dstenosis/D normal)*100], where D Stenosis is the diameter of the artery at the site of the most severe stenosis, and D normal= diameter of the proximal normal artery.</description>
