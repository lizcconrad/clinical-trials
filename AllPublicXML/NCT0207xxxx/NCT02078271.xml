  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WHO has urged all developing countries to develop programmes to improve complementary-feeding
      (CF) practices because of their importance for optimal growth, development and health of
      infants and young children While supplementation programmes and/or highly-fortified
      &quot;super-foods&quot; have limited success in improving CF-practices in disadvantaged environments,
      population-specific food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG), based on locally-available foods
      and requires minimal changes to local food pattern, will enhance the chances of programme
      success.

      Our previous study was able to identify the need for, potential and finally develop FBDG for
      CF of 6-8mo and 9-11mo infants using combined linear-and-goal programming approach (LP
      approach). This research is therefore being made to support the next phase of the study i.e.
      to assess the efficacy of FBDG, for improving CF/dietary-practices and growth in &lt;24mo
      children (window of opportunity). As growth and development is inter-related, home-based
      stimulation will be included in this trial to see the effect on child development. While
      studies have shown that stimulation at early age benefits children through their late
      adolescence; evidence from Indonesia is lacking. This study therefore aims to see the effect
      on growth and development of community trial using food-based dietary guideline and
      stimulation. It is expected that findings from this study will provide scientific evidence as
      the basis for program formulation.
