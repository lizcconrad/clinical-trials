  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-part, single center, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 4-sequence, 4-period
      cross-over study will compare the bioequivalence of three test alectinib capsule formulations
      with the reference capsule formulation in healthy adult participants. All participants in
      both fasted (Part 1) and fed (Part 2) conditions of the study will receive each of 4
      treatments: Treatment A (alectinib with 50 percent [%] sodium lauryl sulfate [SLS]
      [reference]), Treatment B (alectinib with 25% SLS [test]), Treatment C (alectinib with 12.5%
      SLS [test]), and Treatment D (alectinib with 3% SLS [test]) in a randomized sequence. Each
      treatment will be given as a single 600 milligrams (mg) oral administration in an upright
      position on Day 1 in a fed or fasted condition, followed by a 10-day washout period.

        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

          <description>AUC(0-last) is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the time of last measured concentration. AUC is a measure of the plasma concentration of the alectinib and RO5468924 (major pharmacologically active metabolite of alectinib) over time. The molecular weight adjusted M/P ratio (RO5468924/alectinib) for AUC(0-last) is presented.</description>
