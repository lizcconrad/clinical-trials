  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well eltrombopag olamine works in improving the recovery of
      platelet counts in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing induction (the first
      treatment given for a disease) chemotherapy. Platelet counts recover more slowly in older
      patients, leading to risk of complications and the delay of post-remission therapy.
      Eltrombopag olamine may cause the body to make platelets after chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I.To determine whether eltrombopag leads to early platelet recovery in older AML patients (≥
      60years) who attain morphologic remission on day 14 (range, day 14-17) bone marrow assessment
      following remission induction chemotherapy (IC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on megakaryopoiesis - median time to reach platelet
      count ≥50,000 /μL and ≥100,000 /μL, number of days of platelet transfusion, rates of platelet
      transfusion-independence and the median time to reach platelet transfusion independence.

      II. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on the rates of clinically significant bleeding
      events (CSBE).

      III. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on erythropoiesis the median time to red blood
      cell transfusion independence.

      IV. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on granulopoiesis- the time taken to reach an
      absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 500 /μL. V. To determine the safety and tolerability of
      eltrombopag in AML patients undergoing remission IC - incidence and severity of
      eltrombopag-related adverse events. VI. To determine rates of complete remission (CR), rates
      of partial complete remission (CRp), time to attain CR, and time to initiation of
      postremission consolidation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) until platelet counts reach
      ≥50,000/uL or for 8 weeks, whichever comes earlier. Treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.

             leukapheresis (for cytoreduction of highly elevated white blood cell counts) is
             permissible. Those AML patients who initially receive treatment with all-trans
             retinoic acid (ATRA) for presumptive diagnosis of APL but if APL is ruled out in final
