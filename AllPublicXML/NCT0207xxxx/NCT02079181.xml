      This clinical trial studies the safety and drug distribution of the radioactive drug,
      2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-5-methyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (fluorine F 18 d-FMAU
      [18F-FMAU]), for imaging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in
      patients with advanced cancers. A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of
      radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed,
      computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Because cancer
      cells often take up more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer
      cells in the body. PET/CT using the drug fluorine F 18 d-FMAU, may help find cancer and find
      out how far the disease has spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the radiation dosimetry of 18F-FMAU in humans, confirm absence of adverse
      events in humans from intravenous (i.v.) injection of 18F-FMAU for PET imaging, and
      characterize the incidence of circulating metabolites of 18F-FMAU in humans.

      II. To simply find out whether there is any visual uptake change of 18F-FMAU in tumors
      post-therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorine F 18 d-FMAU IV followed by PET/CT prior to start of cancer
      treatment. Patients may undergo 2 additional scans at one week prior to second course of
      chemotherapy and after completion of cancer treatment depending on cancer type.
