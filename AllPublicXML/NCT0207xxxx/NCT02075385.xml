      General Objective: To evaluate the swallowing results of speech pathologist rehabilitation of
      advanced oropharynges, larynx and hypopharynx cancer patients during neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      and radiotherapy concomitant to chemotherapy.

      Methods and Casuistic: Randomized clinical trial phase II. 80 patients with advanced
      oropharynges, larynx and hypopharynx cancer diagnoses from Barretos Cancer Hospital, which
      had the proposal of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy combined with
      chemotherapy. Patients are randomized on two groups: control group and speech pathology
      therapy group

      To evaluate and compare the swallowing and life quality swallowing on a group undergoing to
      speech pathology therapy (intervention) and a control group (no intervention).
