  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib at different
      dose levels in combination with decitabine and the effectiveness of ruxolitinib in
      combination with decitabine in patients with accelerated or blast phase Myeloproliferative
      Neoplasm (MPN), which is a group of diseases of the bone marrow in which excess cells are
      produced. Ruxolitinib is a drug that is approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for
      the treatment of patients with advanced forms of myelofibrosis. It inhibits the Jak proteins
      that are often abnormal in MPN. A recent clinical study showed that ruxolitinib treatment
      could put some patients with this disease into remission. Decitabine is a chemotherapy,
      approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), that has been used to treat acute
      leukemia. It works in some patients, but most patients with accelerated and blastic MPN do
      not respond to treatment. Ruxolitinib and decitabine will be combined in this study to find
      out what dose of the two medicines are safe together. Using Ruxolitinib in combination with
      Decitabine is experimental. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad
      it has on the patient and the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At this time, there is no standard medical treatment for MF-BP or MF-AP. The investigators
      believe that the combination of ruxolitinib and DEC is a candidate approach to the treatment
      of MF-BP/MF-AP that is worthy of exploration based on both the current understanding of the
      biology of disease and emerging preclinical data. The molecular pathogenesis of MPN and
      progression to blast phase is almost certainly due to a complex combination of gene mutations
      (JAK2V617F, MPL) and epigenetic alterations (IDH1/2, IKZF1, EZH2, TET2) that culminate in the
      emergence of leukemic clones. Recent evidence indicates that the JAK2V617F protein can
      localize in the nucleus and influence global DNA methylation patterns which may lead to
      genomic instability and disease progression. The inhibition of JAK-STAT mediated cell
      proliferation and survival in conjunction with the reversal of DNA hypermethylation of tumor
      suppressor genes would be predicted to have at least an additive if not synergistic effect in
      inducing apoptosis of cells belonging to the malignant myeloid clone. Correlative studies
      conducted within a trial of Private and Confidential MPD-RC 109 Ruxolitinib + Decitabine
      combination JAK2 inhibitor and DMNT1 inhibitor in patients with MPN-BP would explore the
      effect on methylation status of various gene promoters as well as the influence on gene
      expression of chromatin related proteins and ultimately leukemic cell survival. The
      sequential administration of a JAK2 inhibitor followed by a DNMT inhibitor would also
      potentially serve to overcome the JAK2-independent effects of epigenetic lesions that lead to
      MPN-BP. In addition, a murine model of leukemic transformation has been described. In this
      model, bone marrow obtained from Tp53 null mice is retrovirally transduced with Jak2V617F,
      and transplanted into donor C56BL/6 mice. The transplanted mice develop an MPN which
      progresses to AML. In vitro drug studies utilizing bone marrow from these leukemic mice have
      demonstrated that exposure to decitabine or ruxolitinib inhibits colony formation in a
      methylcellulose colony-forming assay. Importantly, the combination of decitabine and
      ruxolitinib in this assay significantly reduces colony formation when compared to either drug
      alone (Rampal et al. ASH 2012 oral abstract 808) thus providing pre-clinical evidence for the
      combination study proposed here.

    <description>In phase I, increasing doses of ruxolitinib in combination with decitabine at a dose of 20 mg/m2 daily intravenously over 5 days. An initial dose of ruxolitinib of 10 mg orally twice daily is anticipated with planned, dose escalations of 15 mg orally twice daily, 25 mg orally twice daily and 50 mg orally twice daily. The dose can also be de-escalated to 5mg orally twice daily if dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed at the initial 10mg dose. Patients will receive ruxolitinib as a single agent for the first 7 days followed by the administration of decitabine on day 8 for a total of 5 consecutive days. Patients will continue ruxolitinib at the assigned dose through the first cycle and may reduce the dose for specified toxicity beginning with the second cycle. Patients in Phase II will start at the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with decitabine at a dose of 20 mg/m2 daily intravenously over 5 days.</description>

Decitabine treatment may be deferred for up to 2 weeks to allow recovery from non-hematologic toxicity during the first 6 cycles and up to 2 weeks thereafter for hematologic toxicities as well. The first treatment cycle will last 35 days and will be the evaluable period for DLTs and RPTD determination for patients enrolled in the phase I portion only. Subsequent treatment cycles will be 4-6 weeks in duration as defined by decitabine administration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Accelerated phase MPN as defined by 10%-19% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone
             marrow and evidence of dysplastic marrow features with a concomitant diagnosis of
             essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
             or a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia as defined by 20% blasts in the blood or

             deemed by the investigator to be due entirely to accelerated or blastic phase MPN and
             not due to another comorbidity.

          -  Acceptable pre-study organ function during screening as defined as: Total bilirubin &lt;
             1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) unless due to Gilbert's disease or
             hemolysis, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5

             and for the duration of study participation. Should a female subject become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform the
             treating physician immediately.

          -  Have had chemotherapy or investigational therapy, with the exception of hydroxyurea,
             within 4 weeks of study entry. Previous treatment with either ruxolitinib or
             decitabine as single agents will not exclude eligibility. Previous stem cell
             transplant will also not exclude eligibility as long as other inclusion/exclusion
             criteria have been met.

          -  Patients with acute myelofibrosis are excluded.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to hepatitis, human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects receiving combination antiretroviral
             therapy, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Other medications, severe acute/chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or
             laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation
             of study results, that in the judgment of the Investigator would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
