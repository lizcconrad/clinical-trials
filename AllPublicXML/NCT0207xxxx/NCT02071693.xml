      To retrospectively investigate the relationship between the Cholinergic Pathways
      Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS) score and the change of cognitive status of Parkinson's
      disease (PD) patients after bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS).

      In this observational study, we will retrospectively analyze 38 PD patients who received
      bilateral STN DBS in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University during the year
      of 2008-2012. All patients will be evaluated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part
      III(UPDRSIII) before and after operation. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) in the on medication condition pre-operation and on stimulation on
      medication condition post-operation. The follow-up time points are one week pre-operation and
      6, 12, 24 months post-operation. Before operation, white matter hyperintensities（WMHs）in the
      cholinergic pathways will be determined on a 3.0 Tesla MRI, using the visual rating scale of
      Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS). A correlation analysis will be conducted
      to investigate the relationship between CHIPS score and the change of cognitive status of PD
      patients after bilateral STN DBS retrospectively.
