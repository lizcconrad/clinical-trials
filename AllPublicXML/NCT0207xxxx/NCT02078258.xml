  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we test whether a two-week 8-session attention bias modification (ABM)
      training could reduce depressive symptoms relative to placebo controls in adolescents with
      major depressive disorder at posttraining and follow-ups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common health problem in adolescents. Attentional bias has been theorized to
      play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of depression, suggesting that reduction of
      such biases may treat symptoms of depression. Recent studies have shown that attention bias
      modification(ABM) training could reduce depressive symptoms in both dysphoria and previously
      depressed patients.To test the effectiveness of ABM training on the treatment of depressive
      symptoms in adolescents, we designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in
      depressed adolescents.

    <description>Participants complete 8 sessions of dot-probe task attention bias modification training (ABMT) during a two-week period. ABMT is a modified dot probe task, in which a probe always appears in the location of neutral stimulus after the two stimuli (i.e. one is the depressive cue and the other is neutral) were simultaneously presented. In the ABMT,the probability that a probe appears in the location of neutral is 90%, and correspondingly,in the location of depressive stimuli is 10%. Each session consists of 320 trials, and the time to complete a training session is approximately 20 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants complete 8 sessions of placebo training(PT) during a two-week period. Placebo training is a classic dot-probe task, in which a probe appears after either of the locations that the two stimuli (i.e. one is the depressive cue and the other is neutral) were presented, with the same frequencies. In the PT condition, each session also consists of 320 trials, and the time to complete a PT session is approximately 20 minutes as well.</description>
