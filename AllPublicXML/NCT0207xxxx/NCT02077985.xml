  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to collect information that will support a later clinical trial
      on the effectiveness of a specially adapted dental environment for children who have
      difficulty tolerating oral care in the dental clinic. We hypothesize that adapting the
      sensory environment in the dental office by modifying the sounds, sights, smells and tactile
      experiences will result in decreased anxiety, increased cooperation, and fewer behavior
      problems for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders, and to a lesser extent for typically
      developing children especially those who have dental anxieties. This has the potential
      contribute to increased child comfort as well as safer, more efficient, and less costly
      treatment for a large population, as potentially more than one-fourth of all children may
      benefit from a sensory adapted dental environment.

      The goal of this R34 NIDCR Planning and Pilot Data Grant is to collect information to support
      a later clinical trial on the effectiveness of a specially adapted dental environment for
      children who have difficulty tolerating oral care in the dental clinic. Within this project,
      two groups of children were studied: children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and
      typically developing children, including those who are over-reactive to sensory stimulation.
      Commonly, such children exhibit anxiety and negative behavioral reactions when confronted
      with experiential aspects of dental visits such as exposure to bright fluorescent lighting,
      touch in or around the mouth, or the texture and smell of various oral care products. We
      pilot tested a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) to examine its effect on reducing
      anxiety and behavioral problems among the targeted groups of children. The SADE intervention
      includes such adaptations as dimmed lighting, exposure to soothing music, and application of
      a special vest which provides deep pressure sensations that are calming. If our preliminary
      assessment produces promising results, we will later more comprehensively test the
      intervention in a full-scale randomized clinical trial, which will be supported by a U01
      award.

      The specific aims of the R34 grant are to promote the ability to conduct the future trial by:

        1. Developing a manual for the SADE intervention and assessing the intervention's
           feasibility.

        2. Collecting preliminary data on the intervention's effectiveness and potential
           cost-savings.

        3. Pilot testing the recruitment strategy and assessment battery that will be used in the
           anticipated trial.

        4. Developing the system of documents and data management for the future trial.

        5. Generating the proposal for the U01 award to conduct the planned trial.

      Research participants were 45 ethnically diverse children aged 6-12 years, 22 with ASD and 23
      who are typically developing. Each child underwent two dental cleanings four months apart:
      dental cleaning in a standard dental environment and dental cleaning in the sensory adapted
      environment. For each group of children (i.e., ASD and typically developing), these two
      conditions were compared in their effects on anxiety and negative behavioral reactions, as
      measured by videotape coding, psychophysiological indices, and various rating scales.

    <time_frame>Recorded continuously for three minutes prior to cleaning, through duration of cleaning (approximately 10-45 minutes), and for three minutes at end of cleaning for each dental cleaning.</time_frame>
    <description>Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a non-invasive measure of the ability of the skin to conduct an electrical current, which increases when the sympathetic &quot;fight or flight&quot; nervous system is activated during times of stress. EDA was analyzed in two ways in this study to investigate physiological stress/anxiety: (1) tonic skin conductance level (SCL) and (2) frequency of non-specific skin conductance responses (NS-SCR).</description>

    <measure>Children's Dental Behavioral Rating Scale (CDBRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Videorecorded throughout dental cleaning (approximately 10-45 minutes); coded during first five minutes of dental prophylaxis.</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Dental Behavioral Rating Scale (CDBRS) evaluates overt distress behaviors exhibited by children in the dental office. The child's behavior is videotaped during the dental cleaning; the first five minutes of prophylaxis are coded from the video data at a later date. Coding included marking the presence or absence of three distress behaviors (mouth movement, head movement, forehead movement) and the presence or absence and the severity of two distress behaviors (whimper/cry/scream, verbal stall or delay) during each one-minute interval of the five minute video. Significant inter-rater reliability by two trained raters on a sample of children with and without ASD was obtained. The raw score (0-45) was converted, via Rasch analysis, to a scale score of 1-100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of hands used to restrain child</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded throughout the dental cleaning (approximately 10-45 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of hands required to restrain the child during the dental cleaning experience was also utilized as a measure of uncooperative behavior. This variable was recorded on researcher notes during the dental cleaning and was verified using the videotape of the dental cleaning. Scoring included presence/absence as well as the number of hands used for restraint purposes during the cleaning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frankl Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at the end of each dental cleaning (approximately 10-45 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The Frankl Scale was completed by the dentist following the dental cleaning. This one-item Likert Scale ranges from 1 (definitely negative) to 2 (negative) to 3 (positive) to 4 (definitely positive). This assessment has high inter-rater reliability and moderate validity and has been used to measure the behavior of children with ASD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Anxiety and Cooperation Scale (A &amp; C Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at the end of each dental cleaning (approximately 10-45 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The Anxiety and Cooperation Scale (A &amp; C Scale) has been shown to assess children's anxiety, fear, and cooperation as rated by dentists, and has good established reliability and validity. Following a routine dental cleaning, the dentist rated overall patient behavior during treatment using a one-item Likert scale ranging from 0 (relaxed, smiling, demonstrates desired behavior, complies with demands) to 5 (out of control, loud crying, reverts to primitive flight responses, physical restraint required).</description>
