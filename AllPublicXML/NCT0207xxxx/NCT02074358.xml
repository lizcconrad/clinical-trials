    <measure>Pharmacodynamic (PD) Parameter: Adjusted Mean Change in Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) From Day 4 Pre-Infusion (PCC or Placebo) Baseline at Day 4, 30 Minutes Post Infusion of PCC or Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 at 3 hours post apixaban dose and prior to infusion (Pre-infusion Baseline), Day 4 at 30 minutes post infusion (PCC or Placebo)</time_frame>
    <description>ETP was evaluated using a Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA), a validated automated ex vivo assay performed on platelet-poor plasma samples and based on the automated, calibrated thrombin generation method: thrombin formation was triggered with recombinant tissue factor and phospholipids. Thrombin concentration in each sample was calculated over time by measuring the cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate in the context of a paired calibration sample. Dedicated software (Thrombinoscope, Thrombinoscope B.V., Maastricht, The Netherlands) performed the calculations and derived ETP as area under the curve from the resulting &quot;thrombogram&quot; curve. Pre-infusion baseline= sample on Day 4, 3 hours post apixaban dose (just prior to IV infusion of PCC or placebo). Samples on Day 4 were obtained at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3 hours post apixaban dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 21, 45, and 69 hours post infusion (PCC or Placebo) in each treatment period. ETP was measured as nanomolar*minute (nM*min).</description>

        <title>Pharmacodynamic (PD) Parameter: Adjusted Mean Change in Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) From Day 4 Pre-Infusion (PCC or Placebo) Baseline at Day 4, 30 Minutes Post Infusion of PCC or Placebo</title>
        <description>ETP was evaluated using a Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA), a validated automated ex vivo assay performed on platelet-poor plasma samples and based on the automated, calibrated thrombin generation method: thrombin formation was triggered with recombinant tissue factor and phospholipids. Thrombin concentration in each sample was calculated over time by measuring the cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate in the context of a paired calibration sample. Dedicated software (Thrombinoscope, Thrombinoscope B.V., Maastricht, The Netherlands) performed the calculations and derived ETP as area under the curve from the resulting “thrombogram” curve. Pre-infusion baseline= sample on Day 4, 3 hours post apixaban dose (just prior to IV infusion of PCC or placebo). Samples on Day 4 were obtained at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3 hours post apixaban dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 21, 45, and 69 hours post infusion (PCC or Placebo) in each treatment period. ETP was measured as nanomolar*minute (nM*min).</description>

          <title>PD Parameter: Adjusted Mean Change in Coagulation Parameters Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) From Day 4 Pre-Infusion (PCC or Placebo) Baseline at Day 4, 30 Minutes Post Infusion of PCC or Placebo</title>
          <description>Coagulation parameters were evaluated by Quintiles Laboratories Europe using an ACL TOP analyzer and Instrumentation Laboratory reagents [HemosIL(Registered) Recombiplastin 2G for PT and Synthasil for aPTT]. A second PT was also measured at Esoterix using a Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation analyzer and Diagnostica Stago reagents STA-Neoplastin CI Plus (Registered). Samples on Day 4 were obtained at 0 and 3 hours post apixaban dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 21, 45, and 69 hours post infusion (PCC or Placebo) in each treatment period. PT (Neoplastin CT+), PT (Recombiplastin 2G) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) parameters were measured in seconds.</description>
          <population>PD Population included all participants who received any study medication and had PD data available for at least the analysis-specified baseline and 30 minutes after the start of the study drug infusion. 1 participant who received a partial PCC dose (approximately 2 IU/kg) was excluded from this summary analysis.</population>

        <description>Anti-FXa activity was measured using a validated method at Esoterix Coagulation Laboratory (Englewood, CO) using the Diagnostica Stago Rotachrom (Registered) Heparin assay on a STA-Compact (Registered) analyzer. Samples on Day 4 were obtained at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 hours post apixaban dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 21, 45, and 69 hours post infusion (PCC or Placebo) in each treatment period. The results of this chromogenic assay were reported in low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) activity units per milliliter (U/mL), which are equivalent to international units per milliliter (IU/mL) with assay reportable range: 0.1 to 18.4 IU/mL.</description>

        <title>PD Parameter: Adjusted Mean Change in Coagulation Parameter INR From Day 1 Pre-Dose Apixaban Baseline at Day 4, 30 Minutes Post Infusion of PCC or Placebo</title>
        <description>Coagulation parameters were evaluated by Quintiles Laboratories Europe using an ACL TOP analyzer and Instrumentation Laboratory reagents [HemosIL(Registered) Recombiplastin 2G for PT and Synthasil for aPTT]. A second PT was also measured at Esoterix using a Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation analyzer and Diagnostica Stago reagents STA-Neoplastin CI Plus (Registered). Baseline was Day 1, 0 hour pre-dose apixaban. Samples on Day 4 were obtained at 0 and 3 hours post apixaban dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 21, 45, and 69 hours post infusion (PCC or Placebo) in each treatment period. INR was measured as a fraction</description>

          <description>Plasma samples for PK analysis were obtained on Day 4 at 0 hour (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hours post apixaban dose, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 hours post infusion (PCC or Placebo), and at 21, 45, and 69 hours post infusion (Days 5, 6, and 7) in each treatment period. PK parameters were derived from plasma concentration versus time. Concentration of apixaban was determined using a validated LC/MS/MS assay within the period of known analyte stability. Cmin was measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).</description>
          <population>Those participants who received any study medication and had adequate PK profiles were included; 1 participant who received a partial PCC dose (approximately 2 IU/kg) was excluded from this summary analysis.</population>

        <description>Single 12-lead ECGs were obtained at screening, Day -1 of Period 1, and Days 4 and 7 of each treatment period after the participant had been supine for at least 5 minutes. Pulse Rate (PR), Complex of Q, R, S waves (QRS), and contraction of ventricle between the beginning of the Q wave and end of the T wave (QT) were measured in milliseconds (msec). QT was corrected by the Fridericia method (QTcF) and measured in msec. Baseline was Day -1 of first treatment period. Crossover study: same participant with out of range ECG intervals could be reported in multiple arms.</description>
