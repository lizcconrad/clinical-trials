  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Cone Beam
      Computed Tomography (CBCT) compared to panoramic radiography prior to removal of third molars
      in reducing patient's morbidity. Adults having a close relationship between the mandibular
      canal and one or both lower third molars, as diagnosed from digital panoramic radiographs
      will be recruited for this randomised controlled trial. In one trial arm, patients will
      receive the standard digital panoramic radiograph prior to third molar surgery. In the second
      arm, subjects will undergo an additional Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) prior to third
      molar surgery.

      All patients require a postoperative visit one week after surgery to assess the outcome.
