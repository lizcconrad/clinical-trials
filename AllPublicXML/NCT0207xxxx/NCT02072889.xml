  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurements will be made between the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery using an
      ultrasound machine as the subjects is asked to move and position his or her neck in various
      positions.

      It is hypothesized that by movements of the neck the investigators can maximize the distance
      between the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery to decrease inadvertent cannulation
      of the carotid artery to improve patient safety

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be asked to participate in this trial if they are scheduled for surgery and
      they will have their neck repositioned in several ways using an ultrasound machine to measure
      the distance between the internal jugular vein and the carotic artery to determine maximal
      distance in order to insert a catheter prior to surgery
