  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the diversity of the biology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy in individual
      patients must be individualized. One of the tools for this is molecular-cytogenetic
      stratification. It divides patients into five categories (prognostic groups): Favorable,
      Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, Adverse and Very adverse risk. After remission proceedings
      are tailored depending on prognostic determined groups.

      Research of PALG group in the application in the second line regimen CLAG and CLAG-M proved
      high effectiveness of this treatment with low toxicity. Considering experience of PALG
      groups, it seems that the use of the schema CLAG early as the second induction therapy is a
      viable treatment option.

      Patients with AML with one of 5 prognostic categories based on modified cytogenetic-molecular
      stratification (European Leukemia Net Prognostic System - ENL)

      Favorable risk

      t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11 Mutated
      NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (NK) Mutated CEBPA (NK)

      Intermediate I risk

      Mutated NPM1 with FLT3-ITD (NK) Wild-type NPM1 and FLT3-ITD (NK) Wild-type NPM1 without
      FLT3-ITD (NK)

      Intermediate II risk

      t(9;11)(p22;q22); MLLT3-MLL cytogenic abnormalities other than favorable or adverse

      Adverse risk

      Inv(3)(q21q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21;q26.2); RPN-EVI1

      Very adverse risk monosomal karyotype (MK): -5 or del(5q); -7; abnl(17p); complex karyotype

      Goals:

        -  Evaluation of the impact of therapy tailored to the risk factors on outcome of AML
           patients aged ≤ 60.

        -  Evaluation of the possibility to improve the results of induction therapy through the
           use of early 2nd induction in patients with persistent leukemic infiltration of the bone
           marrow at the 14th day,

        -  Evaluation of the impact of the minimal residual disease (MRD) presence assessed by
           Immunophenotyping method, on the results of treatment of AML patients aged ≤ 60,

        -  Assessing the significance of monitoring the number of leukemic stem cells (LSC) in bone
           marrow and peripheral blood and their influence on clinical course and outcome of AML
           treatment,

        -  Assessment of the LSC determination usefulness in MRD monitoring in patients with AML,

        -  Evaluation of the prognostic significance of the expression of CXCR-4 on the surface of
           leukemic cells and their impact on the clinical course and outcome of AML - trying to
           select a group of patients who potentially would benefit from the use of
           chemosensitization with plerixafor,

        -  Evaluation of autologous HSCT effectiveness in consolidation therapy in AML patients
           from 3 following cytogenetic-molecular risk groups: Favorable, Intermediate I,
           Intermediate II,

        -  Comparison of the overall survive (OS) and leukemia-free survival after autologous and
           allogeneic HSCT in AML patients from Intermediate I and Intermediate II
           cytogenetic-molecular risk groups (biological randomization donor vs. donor).

    <description>Outcome measure after induction:
At +28 day after treatment or after full morphology recovery (if it occurs before the +28 day)
Complete remission, according to Cheson's CR criteria:
Lack of extramedullary infiltration,
Platelet count&gt; 100 G / L,
Neutrophil count&gt; 1.0 G / L,
Lack of blast cells in the blood,
Bone marrow blasts &lt;5% in the cytomorphology.
After induction treatment, patients are qualified for one of the pro-remission treatment options, which is associated with cytogenetic-molecular risk groups, according to the modification of the molecular ELN / MDACC.
Therapeutic decisions are being made according to cytogenetic-molecular stratification: Favorable, Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, Adverse and Very adverse risk.</description>

    <description>I induction cycle starts after complete remission (CR).
- After I consolidation, patients from Intermediate I an Intermediate II group (ELN prognostic system):
If compatible donor is present - allogeneic HSCT qualification after I or II consolidation. If compatible donor for allogeneic HSCT is not present - attempt to CD34+ mobilization for autologous SCT after II consolidation
- After I consolidation, patients from Adverse risk group (ELN prognostic system):
If compatible donor is present - immediate qualification for allogeneic HSCT.
- Finding a donor should be initiated in all patients, at the latest after the end of I induction. In the first place, it should be checked whether the patient has a donor family, if not - searching start for an unrelated donor. For patients with no compatible donor for allogeneic HSCT - need to start searching for an alternative donor</description>
