  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes at 30 days and 1 year (cardiac
      death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel
      revascularization (TVR), thrombosis of the device in patients who are undergoing angioplasty
      in myocardial infarction and in which bioabsorbable stent was implanted (BVS). Additionally,
      we will evaluate the acute recoil after implantation of bioabsorbable stents. A 24 months
      follow-up , by means of coronary angiography accompanied by QCA and assessment with
      intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS) and VH (virtual histology) is scheduled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug -eluting stents (drug eluting stents , DES) are currently used routinely in the
      course of coronary angioplasty ( percutaneous coronary intervention , PCI ) and have
      significantly reduced the incidence of adverse events during follow-up in the medium and long
      term .

      However, the persistence of the metal structure of these devices within the coronary artery
      over time adds no additional benefit but , on the contrary , it is potentially harmful
      because it may predispose to coronary thrombosis even after years of implantation, can alter
      the structure of the vessel for remodeling phenomena, can decrease a coronary vasomotion and
      reducing the possibilily of a future surgery. The recent development of new devices such as
      bioabsorbable vascular scaffold &quot; BVS &quot; release of antiproliferative drug ( everolimus ),
      could provide new clinical advantages especially in patients who are revascularized during
      acute myocardial infarction. These patients are at higher risk of MACE and stent thrombosis
      late .

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes conventional to 30 days and 1 year,
      such as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization(TLR ), target
      vessel revascularization (TVR ), thrombosis of the device in patients who undergo angioplasty
      in the course of acute coronary syndrome and in which it was implanted bioabsorbable stent (
      BVS ). The acute recoil after implantation of bioresorbable vascular scaffold will also be
      assessed Finally, a follow-up of 24 months we will conduct, by means of coronary angiography
      accompanied by QCA and IVUS with VH .
