    <textblock>
      Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT), in the forms of various yoga and meditative practices,
      has become increasingly prevalent due to an increase in awareness of the potential health
      benefits, and improvements in concentration that this training can provide to practitioners.
      In the present study, we investigate the role of Mind-Body Awareness Training (MBAT) in the
      initial learning of a sensorimotor (SMR) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).

      The PI's hypothesis is that MBAT will improve performance in SMR based BCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, we will test the PI's hypothesis that MBAT including yoga will improve the
      ability for subjects to concentrate on control the SMR thus improving the performance of BCI.

      Subjects will be recruited for short term MBAT and then undergo BCI training. The performance
      of subjects with MBAT will be compared with those without MBAT to test the hypothesis.
      Procedures involved include 6 weeks yoga classes with at least 3 classes per week, and a EEG
      brain noninvasive brain computer interface study.

    <description>During the course of the study over 5-10 weeks, we will quantitatively examine three main components of data: the proportion of subjects that achieve a pre-determined threshold of one-dimensional BCI competency as a time to event analysis, how subjects performed on average in each metric (accuracy, speed, etc.) over the course of the study (5-10 weeks), and subject learning over time during the course of study (5-10 weeks).</description>
