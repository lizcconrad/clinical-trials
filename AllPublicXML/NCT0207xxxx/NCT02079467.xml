  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the form of rehabilitation following
      primary total hip arthroplasty has an influence on patient satisfaction or functional
      performance in the eighteen weeks following surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care following total hip replacement is to restrict patient activity
      and range-of-motion with the goal of avoiding dislocation of the operative hip. These
      restrictions are commonly referred to as &quot;hip precautions&quot;. Several recent studies have
      demonstrated these precautions may be safely abandoned with no increased risk of dislocation
      when the surgery is carried through an anterior/lateral approach. Previous work has failed to
      address the issue of patient satisfaction and functional performance when patients are
      managed with an unrestricted rehabilitation protocol post-operatively. We propose a
      prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine whether an unrestricted postoperative
      rehabilitation protocol has an impact on patient satisfaction and functional performance
      following primary total hip arthroplasty.

    <description>The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) is a questionnaire containing 20 questions about a person's ability to perform everyday tasks. The LEFS can be used to evaluate the functional impairment of a patient with a disorder of one or both lower extremities.

    <description>Patients randomized to the control group will be managed with &quot;hip precautions&quot; immediately following surgery. They will weight bear on the operative joint as tolerated after surgery. They will be managed as per usual protocol post total hip arthroplasty. They will be transferred from the operative table with an abduction pillow between their legs and will be asked to keep this pillow between their legs while resting in bed and during sleep throughout their course in hospital. During physiotherapy treatments they will not flex the operative hip beyond 90 degrees, internally or externally rotate the operative hip more than 45 degrees, or actively adduct the operative hip past neutral.</description>
