    <description>Number of participants with adverse events. Continuous monitoring for adverse events. An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition - e.g. symptoms or abnormal results of an investigation - or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition (not relevant in this study). Per the subject description, adverse events will be reported as: mild, moderate or severe.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have symptom(s) of Peyronie's disease (pain, curvature or plaque)

          2. Be judged to be in good health, based upon the results of a medical history, physical
             examination, and laboratory profile

          3. Voluntarily sign and date an informed consent agreement approved by the Institutional
             Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). The subject must also sign an
             authorization form to allow disclosure of his protected health information (PHI). The
             PHI authorization form and informed consent form may be an integrated form or may be
             separate forms depending on the institution

          4. Be able to read, complete and understand the informed consent and various rating
             instruments in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to understand study goals and risks

          2. Inability to understand the informed consent

          3. Inability to achieve erection with or without PDE5 inhibitor use adequate for
             penetration if penile curvature is not a limiting factor

          4. Peyronie's disease symptoms greater than one year duration

          5. Chordee in the presence or absence of hypospadias Thrombosis of the dorsal penile
             artery or vein Infiltration by a benign or malignant mass resulting in penile
             curvature Infiltration by an infectious agent, such as lymphogranuloma venereum
             Ventral curvature from any cause Presence of an active sexually transmitted disease
             Known active hepatitis B or C Known immune deficiency disease or be positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          6. Has previously undergone surgery for Peyronie's disease

          7. Fails to have an erection which in the opinion of the investigator is sufficient to
             accurately measure the subject's penile deformity

          8. Has an isolated hourglass deformity of the penis (curvature caused by a plaque that is
             noncontiguous with the hourglass deformity may be treated)

          9. Has the plaque causing curvature of the penis located proximal to the base of the
             penis

         10. Has previously received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease
             administered by the intralesional route (including, but not limited to, steroids,
             verapamil, and the naturally occurring low molecular weight protein, interferon-Î±2b)
             within 3 months before the first dose of study drug or plans to use any of these
             medical therapies at any time during the study

         11. Has received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease administered by the
             oral (including, but not limited to, vitamin E [&gt;500 U], potassium aminobenzoate
             [Potaba], tamoxifen, colchicine, pentoxifylline, over-the-counter erectile dysfunction
             medications, or steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or topical routes (including, but
             not limited to, verapamil applied as a cream) within 3 months before the first dose of
             study drug or plans to use any of these medical therapies at any time during the study

         12. Has had extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the correction of Peyronie's
             disease within the 6- month period before screening or plans to have ESWT at any time
             during the study

         13. Has used any mechanical type device for correction of Peyronie's disease within the
             2-week period before screening or plans to use any these devices at any time during
             the study

         14. Has used a mechanical device to induce a passive erection within the 2-week period
             before screening or plans to use any of these devices at any time during the study

         15. Has significant erectile dysfunction that has failed to respond to oral treatment with
             phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors

         16. Has uncontrolled hypertension, as determined by the investigator

         17. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other significant medical
             condition, which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for
             enrollment in the study

         18. Is unwilling or unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study including
             completion of all scheduled study visits

         19. Has received an investigational drug or treatment within 30 days before the first dose
             of study drug

         20. Has a known systemic allergy to any H-100 component

         21. Has received any collagenase treatments within 30 days of the first dose of study drug
