  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done on day-5 postpartum or within the first 18 months postpartum (depending on which group subject belongs to). On the assessment day, the VAS will be administered before and after sad mood indcution and compared</time_frame>
    <description>VAS uses a 10-cm scale for participants to indicate the extent to which each of them feel happy or sad. The change in VAS before versus after sad mood induction is the change score in VAS. The change score on the day with active dietary supplement is compare to the change score of the subjects who have not received any supplement and have been recently recruited</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Profile of Mood States (POMS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done on day-5 postpartum or within the first 18 months postpartum (depending on which group subject belongs to). On the assessment day, the POMS will be administered before and after sad mood indcution and compared</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS contains 65 adjectives rated by participants on a 5-point scale. Six factors are derived that include tension, depression, anger, fatigue, vigor and confusion.</description>
