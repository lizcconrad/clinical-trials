      This randomized phase II trial studies how well transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) works
      compared with TACE plus radiation therapy in treating patients with end stage liver disease,
      liver tumors, or potential liver transplant candidates. TACE involves reaching up to the
      blood vessel that feeds the tumor through a catheter placed into the groin vessel. Once the
      physician has defined the vessel going to the tumor, chemotherapy is infused to the tumor and
      the vessel is blocked, maintaining the chemotherapy for longer time inside the tumor and
      stopping the blood flow that feeds the tumor. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a
      type of radiation therapy that delivers radiation to the tumor cells but does not harm normal
      liver cells. It is not yet known whether TACE is more effective with or without SBRT in
      treating liver tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine in patients with stage A to C hepatocellular carcinoma, if stereotactic body
      radiotherapy after TACE enhanced the response rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when
      compared to TACE alone at 3 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine in patients with stage A to C hepatocellular carcinoma, if TACE plus SBRT can
      achieve a downstaging rate of &gt;= 30% at 3 and 6 months.

      II. To determine the rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with SBRT for liver
      tumors.

      III. To determine the rate of local progression after SBRT. (Based on Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) IV. Number of patients who achieve liver
      transplantation. V. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms after the first loco-regional
      therapy with TACE.

      ARM I: Patients undergo TACE according to institutional standard with doxorubicin-eluting
      beads.

      ARM II: Patients undergo TACE as in Arm I and 3 or 5 fractions of SBRT given at least 48
      hours apart over 14 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months and then
      periodically thereafter.
