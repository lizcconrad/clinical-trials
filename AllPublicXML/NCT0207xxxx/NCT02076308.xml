  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disability of upper limbs due to neurologic and orthopedic disorder or injuries is commonly
      seen clinically. For example paralysis or paresis of upper limb due to stroke is relatively
      prevalent, and it may result in severe muscle weakness, pain, contracture, spasticity and
      disability. These patients need early and regular rehabilitation to regain their function and
      prevent unnecessary complications such as contracture and disuse atrophy. Proper
      rehabilitation is important but the challenge is also great. However, rehabilitation training
      is a very labor-intensive task in which one to one treatment is essential and that will
      restrict the number of patients served. Moreover, patients receiving home programs are
      difficult to supervise, resulting in reduced training effect and delayed functional recovery.
      In order to reduce related cost (including time, personnel, facilities, and expense, etc.) of
      rehabilitation in hospitals or clinics, this Robot research team had developed a prototype of
      upper-limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot and its related technology and human-robot
      interaction. This robot is used to serve the rehabilitation need of those patients suffering
      from upper extremities dysfunctions and also can provide careful designed therapeutic program
      of upper limbs including shoulder and elbow joint exercises. Its control software also
      provides a therapeutic management system with intelligence and ergonomic consideration. This
      work was funded by National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) since 2008 and has applied for
      both the U.S. and Taiwan (ROC) patents, where the latter has been approved in Nov. 2011. The
      clinical trial was firstly approved by Research Ethics Committee B of NTUH in 2009 and
      finally approved by Department of Health (DOH) in April 2011. This team had completed the
      clinical trial for healthy subjects and pre-clinical trial for stroke patients. Based upon
      this experience an innovative and intelligent SMART Robot Rehabilitation System for Frozen
      Shoulder Syndrome is proposed to prove its safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.

    <description>The DASH is a self-report questionnaire (30 items) that measures physical function and symptoms in people with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The questionnaire can be used to assess any or all joints in the upper limb. The questionnaire records symptoms as well as activity performance. The DASH includes two optional modules relating to Work or Sports/Performing Arts. A shorter version of the DASH, the QuickDASH is available. However, the DASH provides greater precision for monitoring individual arm pain and function and hence is recommended for use in the clinical setting.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Pain And Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.</description>
