    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease struggle to eliminate phosphate as the renal function
      deteriorates, which results in accumulation of phosphate in the body. This has been shown to
      increase the patients' risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Even with dialysis treatment
      the patients cannot excrete enough phosphate to reach phosphate balance. The patients are
      therefore recommended a very restrictive diet when they reach the dialysis stage. It is
      therefore important to find ways to prevent such accumulation of phosphate in the body as
      early in the disease process as possible, but without compromising the nutritional status.
      Because phosphate occurs naturally in many of our foods, such as meat, fish and dairy
      products, it is difficult to reduce the intake of phosphate, without also reducing the intake
      of energy and protein. Over the past couple of years there has been an increased focus on the
      use of phosphate containing additives in the food industry. A reduction in the intake of
      phosphorus containing additives may reduce the accumulation of phosphate in the body. This
      can be achieved by decreasing the intake of processed food products. Because it is also very
      time consuming and inconvenient for the patient to keep these strict diets, the patients have
      a reasonable claim to know which effects can be achieved by such diets. This will therefore
      seek to be further explored in the following study. The study is conducted as a randomised
      crossover trial in predialysis patients stage 3-4.
