  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent Canadian studies, public opinion polls and the Canadian Heart Health Strategy and
      Action Plan state that women's heart health is a key national priority; it should be
      addressed through improving heart health awareness and prevention, and reducing care
      inequities for women in general and younger women in particular. The investigators have
      developed an innovative and interactive mobile website based postpartum lifestyle
      modification program (regular physical activity and nutritional guidance), based on
      established national guidelines, to improve heart disease risk factors in women. The
      investigators will conduct a trial to determine if the mobile website based lifestyle
      modification program can be maintained and reduces a collection of risk factors, which
      occurring together, greatly increases the risk of developing heart disease. The investigators
      hypothesize that the interactive mobile website directing regular physical activity and
      personalized nutritional guidance, compared to standard postpartum care, will be motivational
      and result in a reduced modified metabolic syndrome z score at 8 months postpartum among the
      intervention group.

    <measure>Metabolic Syndrome Z Score</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the metabolic syndrome (MetS) z score, a continuous score of the five metabolic syndrome variables that make up the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III diagnostic criteria (waist circumference, blood pressure, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides and glucose). Differences between study arms will be compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the HIP Program; Percent of Workouts Completed</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to the HIP Program will be assessed based on the number of times a participant indicates using the mobile website that a prescribed workout has been completed. This outcome will only be measured in the intervention arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Biochemical Cardiovascular Risk Markers</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Differences between study arms for the following biochemical cardiovascular risk markers will be assessed at 32 weeks postpartum; lipid profile, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and urine microalbumin creatinine ratio.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anthropomorphic Measurements and Blood Pressure from Baseline at Midpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and weight from baseline measures at 6-8 weeks postpartum will be assessed at the midpoint of the program at 20 weeks postpartum. Differences between study arms will be compared.</description>

    <time_frame>32 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and weight from baseline measures at 6-8 weeks postpartum will be assessed at the midpoint of the program at 32 weeks postpartum. Differences between study arms will be compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anthropomorphic Measurements and Blood Pressure from Midpoint to Study Completion</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, weight, body mass index, hip circumference, and waist circumference from midpoint measures at 20 weeks postpartum will be assessed at the end of the program at 32 weeks postpartum. Differences between study arms will be compared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the HIP Program; Percent of Step Counting Completed</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to the HIP Program will be assessed based on the number of times a participant uses the mobile website to log their daily step count total. The number of times that the logged step count meets or exceeds the prescribed number of daily steps will also be assessed. This outcome will only be measured in the intervention arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the HIP Program; Percent of Dietary Logs Completed</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to the HIP Program will be assessed based on the number of times a participant uses the mobile website to enter the weekly dietary log. The number of times that the dietary log meets the prescribed intake for each of the Canada's Food Guide food groups will also be assessed. This outcome will only be measured in the intervention arm.</description>

    <intervention_name>HIP Program</intervention_name>
    <description>The entirety of the HIP Program is delivered through an interactive mobile website.
The physical activity portion of the program consists of daily step counting, prescribed aerobic activity, structured strength and toning workouts, and daily stretching. The program was designed by a local trainer, specializing in postnatal exercise, to increase gradually in intensity, while encouraging a more active lifestyle. The program is designed to be completed at home with minimal equipment.
The nutrition portion of the program consists of 16 video tutorials developed by a local Registered Dietitian and weekly diet logs. The video tutorials cover all aspects of healthy eating, from the basics of Canada's Food Guide, to smart snacking, to eating healthy over the holidays.</description>
