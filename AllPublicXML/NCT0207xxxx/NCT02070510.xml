    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the influence of
      oral semaglutide (NNC0113-0217) on the pharmacokinetics of lisinopril and warfarin in healthy
      subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged 18-75 years (both inclusive) at time of signing informed consent

          -  Body mass index 20.0-29.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

          -  A good general health based on medical history, physical examination, and results of
             vital signs, electrocardiogram and laboratory safety tests performed during the
             screening visit, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant or is of
             child-bearing potential and not using adequate contraceptive methods. Female of child
             bearing potential must use effective methods of birth control for the duration of the
             trial and for 5 weeks following last dose. Only highly effective methods of birth
             control are accepted (i.e. one that results in a less than 1% per year failure rate
             when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, and some intrauterine devices)

          -  History of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or other inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Hypertension (defined as sitting systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg and/or
             diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg). If white-coat hypertension is suspected at
             the screening visit, a repeated measurement is allowed

          -  Any blood draw in excess of 50 mL in the past month, or donation of blood or plasma in
             excess of 400 mL within the 3 months preceding screening
