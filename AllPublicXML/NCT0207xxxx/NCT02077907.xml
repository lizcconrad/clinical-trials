    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test and compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
      of four supplementary foods for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in normal
      programmatic settings in Sierra Leone. Study participants will receive one of four test foods
      varying in energy and nutrient density as well as amounts provided.

        1. Super Cereal Plus (SC+) at 800 kcal/d, 215 g/d (Control group)

        2. Super Cereal (SC) and oil and sugar at 998 kcal/d - 200 g SC and 20 g oil and 20 g
           sugar, per day

        3. Corn-soy Blend 14 (CSB14) and oil at 978 kcal/day - 150 g CSB14 and 45 g oil, per day

        4. Plumpy'Sup - 500 kcal/d, 92 g/d

      This will be a prospective, randomised, controlled effectiveness trial.

      Aims

        1. (Impact) To compare the effectiveness of four supplementary foods in the treatment of
           moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in normal programmatic settings in Sierra Leone.

        2. (Cost) To estimate the relative cost-effectiveness (marginal cost per child recovered
           from MAM, relative to comparison group, SC+) of implementing the feeding program using
           each commodity, taking into consideration costs of procurement/production and
           distribution

        3. (Process) To evaluate the determinants of effectiveness including: consumption
           adherence, preparation compliance, targeting/sharing of supplement, food components and
           preparation, adverse effects of foods, water contamination, hygiene and health
           behaviors, SES, food security, perceived barriers

      Outcomes

        1. Recovery from MAM

             1. Percent of children recovered from MAM (defined as achieving mid-upper arm
                circumference (MUAC) ≥ 12.5 cm by 12 weeks once)

             2. Percent default/non-response: children who do not recover after 12 weeks

             3. Percent relapse: children who become MAM again within 6 months of recovery

        2. Mean number of weeks to recovery

      Hypothesis The children with MAM fed Super Cereal and oil and sugar, CSB14 and oil or
      Plumpy'Sup will have similar recovery outcomes to those children fed Super Cereal Plus.

      Null: The children with MAM fed Super Cereal and oil and sugar, CSB14 and oil or Plumpy'Sup
      will have different recovery outcomes to those children fed Super Cereal Plus.
