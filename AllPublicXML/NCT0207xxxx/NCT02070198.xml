  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the progression in assisted reproductive technology (ART), poor ovarian response to
      controlled ovarian stimulation remains a challenge for clinicians and a source of distress
      for patients. Multiple strategies have been tried to overcome these obstacles. The increase
      of the gonadotropin administration have been associated with a very low pregnancy rate. The
      introduction of GnRH agonist protocol, which takes advantage of the initial rise in
      endogenous gonadotropins that follows the agonist administration in the early follicular
      phase and subsequently prevents a premature LH surge, with fewer cycle cancellations, have
      improved cycle parameters and increased pregnancy rate. Recently, GnRH antagonists were
      introduced in ART treatment. They are effective in preventing a premature LH surge and allow
      for a more natural recruitment of follicles in the follicular phase in a non suppressed
      ovary. However, the randomized studies comparing the efficacy of these two regimens reported
      conflicting and nonsignificant results. Moreover, more recently adjuvant therapies for COH
      such as growth hormone therapy or pyridostigmine, oral L-arginine, and transdermal
      testosterone failed to improve IVF outcomes. Recently, the new treatment option with
      corifollitropin alfa, able to keep the circulating FSH level above the threshold necessary to
      support multi-follicular growth for an entire week, in a GnRH antagonist protocol seems to
      have a potential beneficial effect in poor responders.

      The aim of this study is to compare long-acting FSH/GnRH antagonist with daily FSH/GnRH
      antagonist with short GnRH agonist protocol on IVF outcome in poor responder patients .
