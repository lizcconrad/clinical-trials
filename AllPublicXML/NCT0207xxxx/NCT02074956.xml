  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in
      five groups of healthy adult male and female subjects who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative,
      and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection. Since BCG-vaccinated individuals are the
      target population for which AERAS 404 might be indicated, AERAS 404 will be administered to
      individuals already vaccinated with BCG

      Sixty subjects will be sequentially enrolled into one of five study groups (i.e., Group 1,
      Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, or Group 5) with 10 subjects per group in Groups 1-4 and 20
      subjects in Group 5. Within each study group, subjects will be randomized to a treatment
      assignment of either AERAS-404 or placebo control at a ratio of 4:1 (Groups 1-4) or two
      different dose amounts of AERAS-404 or placebo control at a ratio of 9:9:2 (Group 5)
      administered by intramuscular injection on Study Day 0 and Study Day 56. The principal
      investigator will determine an appropriate interval between the vaccinations such that the
      entire group is not dosed at the same time. All subjects will receive the same treatment on
      Study Day 0 as they receive on Study Day 56. All subjects will be followed for safety and
      immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days. A total of eleven clinic visits are planned
      (excluding screening) for all subjects

    <measure>Safety profile of two injections of AERAS 404 at different dose levels of antigen and adjuvant.</measure>
    <time_frame>Total duration of study follow up for all subjects is 182 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be collected on subjects throughout their participation in the study. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events are captured 28 days post each vaccination. The safety profile of AERAS-404 will be summarized by treatment regimen. The number (percentage) of subjects with adverse events will be summarized by MedDRA system organ class (SOC), and preferred term (PT). Additional summaries will present the number (percentage) of subjects with adverse events by severity and by relationship to study vaccine.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity of two injections of AERAS 404 at different dose levels of antigen and adjuvant.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immunogenicity was evaluated from blood collected at Study Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 56, 63, 70, 84, and 182. For all subjects, a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was performed during screening and at Study Day 182</time_frame>
    <description>Intracellular cytokine staining will be used to assess immunogenicity. Immune response based on percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that produced one, two, or three cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and/or IL-2) in response to stimulation with one of 2 antigenic peptide pools (Ag85B and TB10.4) derived from and representing the entire amino acid sequences of the mycobacterial antigens Ag85B and TB10.4, respectively.</description>
