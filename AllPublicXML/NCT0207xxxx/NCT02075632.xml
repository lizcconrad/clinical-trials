  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study to evaluate whether participants follow the duration
      of use instructions for short-term use of alclometasone dipropionate in a population of
      participants with itchy skin conditions who would use OTC treatments for relief. The study
      population will be composed of two different cohorts: chronic condition sufferers (eczema or
      psoriasis) and participants who suffer from occasional itchy skin experiences (such as poison
      ivy, oak, sumac, insect bites, or skin irritations due to jewelry, cosmetics, detergents, or
      soaps) where an anti-itch medication would be used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 313 participants who are currently suffering from an itchy skin condition
      caused by eczema or psoriasis or any occasional itchy skin experiences will be enrolled into
      the study to get 250 participants who complete the study (at least 100 to each of the
      cohorts). After evaluation of the study criteria, the site staff will dispense product and a
      diary card to the subject to use over the next 14 days. At the end of the 14 days, each
      participant will come to the research site to return the remaining product and undergo the
      study termination interview with the Concentrics nurse via telephone. The study will be
      conducted in approximately 15 research sites located throughout the United States (US).
