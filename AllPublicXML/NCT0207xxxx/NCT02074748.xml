  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an observational &quot;change from baseline&quot; outcome measures design. Data is
      collected for the sake of evaluating treatment (fusion surgery) performed as standard medical
      care, but the investigator does not assign specific interventions to any participants in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>

      Device/fluoroscopy measurements of arch motion and questionnaire data will be acquired on 10
      women undergoing surgery for bunion, and 10 controls. Surgery will implant hardware to fuse
      (stabilize) the arch. Methods will evaluate the patient's problems associated with bunion and
      satisfaction with surgery, and assess the effectiveness of surgery in reducing motion of the
      arch. The hypotheses are that patients treated with surgery will demonstrate improvement in
      function, and that surgery will reduce motion of the arch postoperatively (posttest measures
      acquired 6 months after surgery), and in comparison to measures taken on a control group.

      The data collected will come from a comprehensive examination. Methods will include the
      measurement of arch motion made by an examiner using a device and a fluoroscopic gait
      examination procedure, and completion of two medical questionnaires. The fluoroscopic
      acquisition of the digital images will be analyzed across the specified time dimensions of
      the gait cycle.

      Device and fluoroscopy of measures of arch motion will be made at 2 time points on patients
      enrolled in this study: presurgery (baseline) and 6 months postsurgery. The questionnaire
      measurements of self-reported pain and function will be made at 4 time points: presurgery
      (baseline) and again at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postsurgery. Outcome measurements
      will be collected on control subjects at one time point only, on the day of their enrollment
      into the study.

      Prospective studies have not characterized outcomes in patients receiving this type surgical
      fusion as part of the corrective treatment for bunion. Results have potential to improve
      surgical treatment outcomes and, improve upon the current methods of fluoroscopic motion
      analysis.

    <measure>Fluoroscopy Examination of the Foot.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Outcome Measurement [presurgery (baseline) and again 6 months postsurgery]</time_frame>
    <description>Fluoroscopic examination will image the foot during the roll-over phase of the gait. The participant will step in slow motion in front of the fluoroscopic x-ray beam to record the change in the position of the arch at specified gait-event time dimensions. Image acquisition will be at 25 frames per second lasting no longer than 2 seconds. All participants will wear leaded clothing in accordance with a protocol approved by the Univ of Minnesota Department of Health and Safety, Radiation Protection Division.
Fluoroscopy &quot;change in outcome measures&quot; of arch motion will be made at 2 time points on all patients who participate: presurgery (baseline) and again 6 months postsurgery.
Fluoroscopy measures will be acquired on control subjects at one time point only, on the day of their enrollment into the study.</description>

    <description>Device measurement of arch motion will be acquired using the device built for this one purpose. Device measurements will be made on the both feet.
Device &quot;change in outcome measurement&quot; of arch motion will be made a 2 time points on all patients: presurgery (baseline) and again 6 months postsurgery.
Device measures of arch motion will be acquired on control subjects at one time point only, on the day their enrollment into the study.</description>

    <description>The Foot Function Index medical questionnaire has separate subscales that assess health in the multiple dimensions of pain, activity limitation, disability and stiffness. Level of pain will also be recorded on the standard 1-10 medical pain scale.
The &quot;change in outcome measures&quot; of the self-reported pain and function will be made at 4 time points on all patients who participate: presurgery (baseline) and again at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postsurgery.
Questionnaire measures will be acquired on control subjects at one time point only, on the day of their enrollment into the study.</description>

        Patients having bunion will be recruited from the surgical practice of the Co-I. The
        surgeon will screen the patients, and invite those to participate identified as having an
        unstable arch as a complication of bunion deformity.

        Controls will be recruited from the community, group matched for age. Controls must have
        normal foot posture and display no evidence of an unstable arch.
