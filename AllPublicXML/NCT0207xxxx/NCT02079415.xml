  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Saudi Arabia has been named by the International Diabetes Federation as among the top ten
      countries with highest prevalence of diabetes. Women are said to have overall prevalence
      twice that for men. With high birth rate in the country we decided to look at the impact of
      diabetic pregnancies on their off-springs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetics are followed regularly in diabetic outpatient clinics where dietary and medical
      management are offered. Diabetic pregnancies are managed by a team consisting of
      diabetologist, obstetrician, feto-maternal obstetrician and dietician.

      Management of these pregnancies depends on whether these women have pre-gestational or
      gestational diabetes. Very few diabetic women have exposure to preconceptual advice. For this
      reason we opted to find out the outcome of infants of diabetic mothers compared to those
      mothers who are essentially normal with no associated medical or obstetric disorders. Equally
      we wanted to see if there are differences in the outcome of infants born to pre-gestational
      and gestational diabetic mothers.
