          -  Refractory/Relapsed AML following no more than 2 prior therapies, or in previously
             untreated AML patients who are not candidates for standard therapy.

          -  High and very high risk MDS according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring

          -  Ongoing therapy with corticosteroids greater than 10 mg of prednisone or its
             equivalent per day. Inhaled and topical steroids are permitted

          -  Patients who are currently receiving hydroxyurea to control peripheral blood leukemic
             blasts and cannot be discontinued for at least 48 hours prior to obtaining PD

          -  Patients who are currently receiving treatment with prohibited medication and that
             cannot be discontinued at least one week prior to the start of treatment with LGH447
             monotherapy or LGH447 in combination with midostaurin

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy or other severe infection, including
             pneumonia, within 2 weeks before the first dose of LGH447 monotherapy or LGH447 in
