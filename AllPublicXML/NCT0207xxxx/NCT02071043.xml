  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer with para-aortic lymph node (PAN) involvement is regarded as advanced disease,
      and only chemotherapy is recommended from the guidelines. In unresectable cases, neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy could prolong survival if conversion to resectability could be achieved.

          2. Has para-aortic lymph node metastasis(PAN was defined as nodes in the region between
             the upper margin of the celiac artery and the upper border of the inferior mesenteric
             artery (stations no. 16a2/16b1))

          4. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.

          5. Adequate hematological function: Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 ×
             109/L and Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may be transfused to maintain or exceed this level).

             Adequate liver function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); AST
             (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 × ULN , ALP ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); ALB
             ≥30g/L。 Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 x ULN, and creatinine
             clearance ≥ 60 ml/min.

          6. Female subjects should not be pregnant or breast-feeding.

          7. No serious concomitant disease that will threaten the survival of patients to less
             than 5 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Serious concomitant disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or
             compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the
             investigator.

          2. History of another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of the following:

             Any previous palliative, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
             Prior treatment for locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.

          3. Any other metastatic disease will render patient ineligible according to AJCC staging
             manual(such as liver，lung，etc）.

          4. Active infection that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the
             patient's ability to tolerate therapy.

          5. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus with fasting blood sugar &gt; 18 mm. Second primary
             malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration for study
             enrollment.

          6. Unstable, persistent cardiac disease despite medicinal treatment, myocardial
             infarction within 6 months before the start of the trial

          7. Previous surgery on primary tumour; Prior palliative surgery (open and closure,
             passage operation)

          8. Any other type of tumour (e.g. leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma) or a secondary malignancy,
             excepting basal cell skin carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma in situ of the cervix
             which have already been successfully treated -
