      Parent Child Interaction Therapy Emotion Development (PCIT-ED) will be conducted with a
      sample of preschoolers who exhibit symptoms of depression compared to a wait list (WL)
      control after which participants will receive the active treatment. PCIT-ED is an expansion
      of PCIT, a well-known, widely used and proven effective treatment for preschool disruptive
      disorders. To address early disturbances of mood and affect, a novel ED module was added
      based on empirical data in emotion development. The ED module targets parent emotion learning
      skills with the goal of training the parent to serve as a more effective emotion teacher and
      coach to the child. The goal of the ED module is to enhance the child's capacity for emotion
      recognition and regulation or &quot;emotional competence.&quot; In order to test the efficacy of
      PCIT-ED, to estimate accurate effect sizes and to investigate mediators and moderators of
      treatment response participants will complete comprehensive pre-, interval, and
      post-assessments.

      Preschoolers over 3 will be offered the option of enrolling in an add-on
      electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imagery study, to investigate neural changes
      associated with PCIT-ED.

      Compared to those randomized to the WL, preschoolers who undergo PCIT-ED will show
      significantly increased rates of remission, greater reductions in MDD symptoms, and decreases
      in impairment; and will show significantly greater increases in emotional competence measured
      by the ability to accurately identify emotions in themselves and others and the ability to
      effectively regulate intense emotions. Compared to those on the WL, parents who undergo
      PCIT-ED will show significantly greater increases in emotion skill learning and reductions in
      MDD symptoms and parenting stress.

    <measure>Major Depressive Disorder Severity Score from the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia - Early Childhood (KSADS-EC)</measure>
    <time_frame>completion of therapy (average of 20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The K-SADS-EC is a semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to assess current and past episodes of psychopathology in children according to DSM criteria. Probes and objective criteria are provided to rate individual symptoms. Primary diagnoses assessed include: Major Depression, Dysthymia, Mania, Hypomania, Bipolar, Agoraphobia, Separation Anxiety, Simple Phobia, Social Phobia, Generalized Anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity, Conduct, Oppositional Defiant, Post-Traumatic Stress, and Adjustment Disorders. Revisions include adjusting/adding questions and threshold anchors reflecting developmentally appropriate symptom and diagnostic criteria for 3-6 year old children, removing sections less applicable to young children, editing probes to use parent-directed wording, and providing directions for clarifying symptom severity and genesis where necessary. The KSADS-EC was adapted from the KSADS-PL by Michael S. Gaffrey, Ph.D. and Joan L. Luby, M.D.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preschool Feelings Checklist-Scale (PFC-Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>completion of therapy (average of 20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PFC is a validated screening checklist with favorable sensitivity and specificity designed to capture preschoolers at high risk for MDD. The PFC-Scale, a 23 item measure adapted from the PFC, is a scale version of this measure designed and validated to capture changes in young child depression severity (similar to the Child Depression Inventory).</description>

    <measure>Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>completion of therapy (average of 20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The C-GAS is a clinician anchored measure of impairment due to depressive symptoms. It is on a 0-100 scale, with 0 being greatest and 100 being least impairment.</description>
