  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament repair using hamstring autograft in children is a painful
      orthopedic procedure. The current practice to provide analgesia for this procedure include
      femoral continuous perineural infusion and femoral single shot peripheral nerve block, along
      with perioperative opioids and NSAIDS both IV and orally. Since the use of opioids can be
      associated with adverse side effects, which include, but are not limited to nausea, vomiting,
      constipation, pruritus and respiratory depression, comparing the amount of opioid used with
      either analgesia delivery method is needed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial design is a prospective, randomized, open-label controlled, study. It is not
      possible to blind the treatment since a catheter must be left in place for the continuous
      infusion group.

      Subjects will be randomized to either the femoral shot/continuous peripheral neural infusion
      FS-CPNI group or femoral shot/sciatic single shot FS-SS group. After induction of general
      anesthesia, subjects will receive either a single shot or continuous nerve block. The
      protocol will not dictate the conduct of the general anesthetic.

      In the postoperative period, in addition to the standard monitoring in the recovery room, the
      numerical rating pain scale(NRS) scores of the patient will be recorded. The timing of the
      first rescue pain medication and total postoperative opioid and other analgesic medication
      administered during the hospital stay will be recorded. The patients will be followed in the
      hospital on the day of surgery (DOS) postoperatively until they are discharged home.

      After discharge the patients will be contacted by phone and/or email postoperatively on a
      daily basis for 72 hours to collect information regarding their use of pain medications
      (timing and dose), quality of analgesia based on the NRS pain scale, and incidence of side
      effects. If patients need to be admitted to the hospital postoperatively, their opioid use,
      pain scores and complications will be recorded while in the hospital.

      All the patients will be evaluated in the orthopedic clinic at two weeks, six weeks and six
      months to assess long term functional outcomes, pain scores and any signs of postoperative
      neurological deficits.

The analysis will be of the numerical rating scale (NRS) scores immediately on arrival (baseline) in the recovery room and then every 6 hours over the first 72 hours post-op in the 2 groups.</description>
