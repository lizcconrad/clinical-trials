      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate point accuracy of the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose
      Monitoring (GM) System interstitial glucose results against Reader capillary Blood Glucose
      (BG) reference using the Consensus Error Grid. During the course of the wear duration, the
      subject is required to test fingerstick glucose measurement at least eight (8) times a day
      for capillary reference glucose measurements and three in-clinic visits of a maximum 13 hours
      each for venous reference glucose measurements. With every reference measurement, the subject
      or study staff will perform a measurement on the System.

        Subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who require multiple daily insulin injections (MDI)
        or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). No more than 20 subjects will have
        HbA1c &gt; 8.5%, and no more than 20 subjects will have HbA1c &lt; 7% based on the subject
        screening.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Subject must have type 1 or type 2 diabetes for at least 2 years prior to enrollment.

          3. Subject must require insulin therapy through an insulin pump and/or multiple daily
             insulin injections (at least 3 injections daily) for at least 6 months prior to
             enrollment.

          4. Subject must be able to read and understand English.

          5. In the investigator's opinion, the subject must be able to follow the instructions
             provided to him/her by the study site and perform all study tasks as specified by the
             protocol.

          6. Subject must be available to participate in all study visits.

          7. Subject must be willing and able to provide written signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has known allergy to medical grade adhesive or isopropyl alcohol used to
             disinfect skin.

          2. Subject is pregnant, attempting to conceive or not willing and able to practice birth
             control during the study duration (applicable to female subjects only).

          3. Subject has skin lesions, scarring, redness, infection or edema at the application
             sites that could interfere with device placement or the accuracy of interstitial
             glucose measurements.

          4. Subject currently is participating in another clinical trial.

          5. Subject has donated blood within 112 days (3.7 months) prior to the beginning of the
             study activities.

          6. Subject has concomitant medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             could interfere with the study or present a risk to the safety or welfare of the
             subject or study staff. Such conditions include but are not limited to:

             â€¢ History of HIV, Hepatitis B or C

          7. Subject has a known medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             increase the risk of bleeding.

          8. Subject has X-ray, MRI or CT appointment scheduled during the period of study
             participation, and the appointment cannot be rescheduled for a time before study
             participation starts or after study participation ends.

          9. Subject is unsuitable for participation due to any other cause as determined by the
             Investigator.
