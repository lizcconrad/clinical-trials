  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are at much higher risk of death if the
      RV (right ventricle) is weak. The purpose of this study is to get a better understanding of
      the factors that determine RV adaptation and how the RV compensates on therapy. The
      investigator is also interested in how Remodulin (treprostinil) infused over a short period
      (approximately 48-72 hours) affects the patient's quality of life, medical care, and personal
      health behaviors.

      Treprostinil, also known as Remodulin, has been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration for use in the treatment of PAH. The investigator has been treating patients
      with Remodulin by rapid infusion (over 48 hours) for over 6 years. The investigator would
      like to establish this practice as safe and effective for the benefit of other centers that
      treat PAH.
