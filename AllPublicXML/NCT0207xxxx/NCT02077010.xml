  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage heart failure have significant symptoms (including fatigue and
      shortness of breath) which prevent them from being able to perform most activities of daily
      living. Milrinone is one of the inotropic medications that has been studied and used in the
      treatment of end stage heart failure. End stage heart failure patients awaiting a heart
      transplantation often have to be maintained on IV milrinone 24 hours a day through a chronic
      IV line. Two problems arise with this therapy. First, the IV line itself creates an
      opportunity for infection and blood clots, in addition to interfering with patient's quality
      of life. Second, patients may be exposed to higher levels of milrinone when given IV than are
      necessary for maintaining their heart's function.

      The investigators goal is to show that inhaled milrinone is equivalent to &quot;standard of care&quot;
      IV milrinone in improving heart and lung pressures in end stage heart failure patients (who
      respond to milrinone therapy) in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
      Patients who are sent for a right heart catheterization procedure by their cardiologist to
      determine if they require milrinone will be randomly chosen to be in the continuous IV
      milrinone group or the inhaled milrinone group after agreeing to participate in this study.
      Patients in the inhaled milrinone group will receive 60mg in 4ml of fluid inhaled by a jet
      nebulizer every 8 hours. Patients in the IV arm will receive a constant IV infusion rate.
      Both groups will have a standard-of-care repeat right heart catheterization procedure an
      average of 48- 96 hours after milrinone initiation to evaluate their response to milrinone.
      Afterward, all patients that respond will be placed on the standard of care IV milrinone for
      the duration of their therapy, as directed by their cardiologist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5.7 million Americans have heart failure, a leading cause of both morbidity and
      mortality in the United States. Heart failure was listed as a contributing cause in more than
      280,000 deaths in 2008 in the U.S. (1 in 9) and about half of patients diagnosed with heart
      failure die within 5 years. Patients with end stage heart failure have significant symptoms
      (including fatigue and dyspnea) which prevent them from being able to perform most activities
      of daily living. These patients often require repeated or prolonged hospitalizations for
      disease management which contributes significantly to the cost of heart failure for the
      United States (34.4 billion each year).

      Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, is one of the inotropic medications that has
      been studied and used in the treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure. Several
      studies have evaluated chronic intravenous (IV) inotrope use in end stage heart failure for
      palliation of symptoms as well as evaluated effect on cost through decreased hospital
      readmissions. Hauptman et al and Harjai et al demonstrated significant decreases in hospital
      costs due to reductions in days hospitalized and readmissions after initiation of inotropes
      including milrinone. However, the concern with IV milrinone use is the possibility of
      increased mortality associated with therapy despite improved hemodynamics (increased cardiac
      output, decreased filling pressures) and symptoms as was observed with chronic use of oral
      inotropes. The OPTIME-CHF study confirmed this concern regarding the use of IV milrinone by
      reporting increased mortality in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV
      ischemic heart failure without hemodynamic compromise as well as statistically significant
      increases in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias when using intravenous milrinone. For this
      reason, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology practice guidelines,
      recommend use of IV milrinone only for patients presenting with clinical evidence of
      hypotension associated with hypo-perfusion and elevated cardiac filling pressures in order to
      maintain systemic perfusion and preserve end-organ performance. Administration of chronic IV
      inotropes in heart failure patients with refractory symptoms is categorized as a class IIb
      indication (&quot;usefulness/efficacy is less well established by expert opinion&quot;).

      This is a prospective, dual center, drug-interventional, non-blinded, open-label, randomized
      controlled clinical trial. Anticipated number of patients enrolled in this study is n = 20
      (10 patients randomized to nebulized inhaled milrinone and intravenous milrinone groups).
      Patients with end stage HF, at the discretion of their treating cardiologist who ordered the
      initial right heart catheterization (RHC) for evaluation of HF therapy, are sent for right
      heart catheterization (RHC) to determine if inotropic therapy would be beneficial. If the
      treating cardiologist decides to initiate inotropic therapy based on current
      guideline-recommended therapies after RHC is performed, the patient will undergo
      randomization to either the intervention arm (inhaled milrinone) or the control arm
      (intravenous milrinone) prior to RHC. Randomization will be performed by randomized block
      design using a randomization tool embedded within a REDCAP secure database with 2 blocks.
      Because of the significant accumulation of milrinone in renal dysfunction, patients with a
      creatinine clearance less than or equal to 40ml/min, as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault
      equation using the serum creatinine prior to randomization, will be placed into a separate
      block from those with a creatinine clearance greater than 40ml/min.

      The investigators goal is to show that inhaled milrinone is equivalent to &quot;standard of care&quot;
      IV milrinone in improving hemodynamics in end stage heart failure patients (who respond to
      milrinone therapy) in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Change in patient
      hemodynamic measurements before and during treatment will be assessed by right heart
      catheterization hemodynamic variables (including right ventricle (RV) stroke work index,
      Cardiac output (CO), mixed venous oxygen saturation, pulmonary venous resistence (PVR), and
      systemic vascular resistence (SVR). Recognizing invasive hemodynamic studies are at the
      discretion of the treating physicians decision and may also be challenging to complete or
      deemed unnecessary in some patients, the primary endpoint will include 1) invasive
      hemodynamic criteria consisting of PA catheter measurement of &gt; 20% decrease in PCWP or &gt; 20%
      increase in Thermodilution or Fick Cardiac Index (CI) at time of second RHC compared to
      baseline measurements or; 2) centrally (ie: PICC access) measured SVO2 which will be used to
      determine Fick calculation of CI (a &gt;20% increase in CI will be required to meet primary end
      point compared to Fick CI from baseline) without need for PA catheter placement or; 3) in the
      absence of PA catheter placement and central access for SVO2 determination, a &gt; 30% decline
      in laboratory based BNP measurements compared to baseline BNP and an improvement of 15
      percentage points from baseline in the dyspnea visual analog scale (range 0-100) will also be
      considered to meet primary endpoint.
