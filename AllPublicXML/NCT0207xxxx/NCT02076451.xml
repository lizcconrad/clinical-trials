  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label study of DS-8273a to assess its safety and tolerability,
      identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose and/or Maximum Administered Dose, and assess its
      properties in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

      Up to 5 US sites are planned for participation in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose
      Expansion) in subjects with solid tumors or lymphomas.

             or current participation in other therapeutic investigational procedures.

          -  Prolongation of corrected QT interval by Fridericia's method (QTcF) at rest, where the
             mean QTcF interval is &gt; 450 ms for males and &gt; 470 ms for females based on triplicate
             electrocardiogram (ECG).
