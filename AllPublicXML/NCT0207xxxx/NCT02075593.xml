  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) fixed dose combination
      (FDC) tablet is being made available to women who become pregnant while participating in
      study ING117172. Continuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is key to both mother and the
      unborn fetus in order to maintain virologic suppression in the mother (thereby decreasing the
      risk for maternal disease progression), but also to reduce the risk of maternal-fetal
      transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to her unborn child. This study
      also offers the first opportunity to investigate the impact of pregnancy on DTG
      pharmacokinetics (PK). This is an open-label, single arm interventional study. The number of
      women that will be enrolled into this study cannot be established a priori, as unintended
      pregnancies cannot be determined in advance. The maximum number of women would include all of
      those women randomized to DTG/ABC/3TC FDC (approximately 237), though unintended pregnancies
      in all of these women would not be anticipated.

             cholesterol, low density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol). A single repeat test is
             allowed during the Screening period to verify a result.

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality observed in ING117172 or in any Screening laboratory
             assessments for ING200336, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude
             the subject's participation in the study.

          -  Hyperbilirubinemia of unknown etiology.

          -  Confirmed (with no more than 1 repeat evaluation) Grade &gt;= 2 urine protein (dipstick),
             serum creatinine, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate
             aminotransferase at the time of the screening lab.

          -  Subject has Creatinine Clearance of &lt;50 mL/minute via Cockroft-Gault method at the
             time of the screening visit
