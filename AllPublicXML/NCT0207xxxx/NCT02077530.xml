      Patients with metabolic syndrome living in Seoul area are included in this prospective
      registry for more than 10 years. All enrolled patients undergo thorough medical history
      survey. Enrolled patients will have coronary CT, 2D echocardiogram, treadmill test, pulse
      wave velocity, augmentation index, carotid intima-media thickness, and abdominal fat mass
      evaluation. Moreover, lipid profiles and inflammatory markers such as hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha,
      VCAM-1, ICAM-1, adiponectin, MMP-9 will be measured. All participants will repeat the test
