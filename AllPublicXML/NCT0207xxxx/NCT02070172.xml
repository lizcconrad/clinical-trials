    <textblock>
      Motion limitations have been previously reported in people with headaches originating from
      the neck/cervicogenic headaches. A test involving flexing and rotating the neck has been
      found useful to diagnose this type of headache. This observational study investigates this
      neck motion test when performed actively by the patient and passively by the examiner, then
      compares the results of motion attained.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical Range of Motion in degrees with the Flexion Rotation Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>Two versions of this test were examined. A motion analysis system was used to measure degrees of motion. The test was done in two ways on each subject. Subjects sat in a chair, looked downward, then rotated their head/neck each direction. Subjects laid on their back while an examiner lifted their head, then rotated it each direction (same motion as described for the active test in the previous sentence).
Within session reliability was also examined.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report questionnaire was completed by subjects prior to testing. It was not re-assessed as an outcome but rather used for baseline description of the subjects included in the study.</description>

      This study compares observation of neck range of motion measures during the flexion rotation
      test (combining neck flexion with neck rotation) in two groups of subjects, one group has
      headaches and one groups is a healthy, asymptomatic group.
