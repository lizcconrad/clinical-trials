    <textblock>
      Heart imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed insights into heart
      function and injury. The nature and significance of heart injury after a heart attack is
      incompletely understood. We propose a 'natural history' study of heart attack injury using
      contemporary MRI methods. In a large hospital in the West of Scotland, heart attack patients
      will be invited to have at least two MRI scans and also continue with life-long follow-up.
      The results from the MRI scans will be assessed with all of the other clinical information
      obtained at the time of the heart attack and during follow-up. The results of our study
      should provide new insights into heart attack injury and these results should help improve
      how heart attack patients should be treated.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed insights into soft tissue characteristics
      and this technique has particular value for imaging patients with acute myocardial infarction
      (MI). Recent advances in MRI have the potential to reveal new insights into the evolution and
      functional significance of myocardial injury and repair.

      Here, we will study at least 300 consecutive patients with acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) and
      focus on oedema, scar and bleeding in the heart using MRI in patients managed by emergency
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at 1.5 Tesla
      (MAGNETOM, Siemens Healthcare). MRI will be used to assess initial heart function and injury.
      Myocardial salvage and haemorrhage are prioritised outcomes. Novel MRI methods will also be
      used to quantify the extent of myocardial jeopardy representing the initial area-at-risk
      (AAR), and the nature of this injury (strain, haemorrhage). The MRI methods will include T1,
      T2 and T2* relaxometry (mapping). Secondly, we will assess coronary artery disease severity
      by angiography and coronary artery function at the time of the heart attack treatment using a
      pressure-sensitive coronary guidewire (St Jude Medical). This wire can be used instead of the
      usual coronary wire and can provide information on heart injury, which can be linked in turn
      to the MRI findings. All of this information will be linked with health outcomes in the
      longer term.

      We hypothesise that myocardial salvage, oedema, haemorrhage, and strain as revealed by MRI,
      have functional and prognostic significance. In all patients MRI will be performed at
      baseline (~day 2) and again at 6 months. In a subgroup of 30 patients, MRI will be performed
      on days &lt;12 hours, and days 2, 7-10 days and 6 months post-MI. A blood and urine sample and
      quality of life will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months post-MI. Clinical outcomes (e.g.
      rehospitalisation, death) will be assessed at the end of the study (minimum 1 year) and again
      during longer term follow-up (minimum 3 years, maximum 20 years) by electronic linkage
      through central National Health Service (NHS) and government health records in order to
      determine the long-term prognostic significance of our initial observations with angiography,
      MRI and the pressure wire. The main statistical analyses will be conducted by an independent
      trials unit statistician.

    <measure>Microvascular obstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline MRI scan</time_frame>
    <description>MVO is classified as present (central dark zone with a subendocardial or intra-mural distribution (binary)) and non-relevant (dots or nil) and quantified as a % of total left ventricular mass, after adjustment for the initial area-at-risk revealed by T2-weighted MRI. Late MVO is imaged by MRI 10 - 15 minutes after contrast administration. Late MVO should be preceded by abnormal first pass and early MVO on 1, 3, and 5 minute scans.</description>

    <description>The jeopardised area-at-risk on each axial image is defined as the percentage of left ventricular area delineated by the hyperintense zone on T2-weighted MRI with parametric maps. The initial area-at-risk will be assessed retrospectively with MRI ~2 days after initial hospitalisation for STEMI. Area-at-risk will be assessed with T2 and T1 mapping. The area-at-risk will be quantified by a semi-automatic detection method using a signal intensity threshold of &gt;2 standard deviations above a remote reference region.</description>

    <measure>Myocardial T1 time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and follow-up MRI at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The myocardial T1 relaxation time (ms) pre- and post-contrast will be estimated using a Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery method (MOLLI, Siemens Healthcare).

    <time_frame>Day 0 at initial hospital admission</time_frame>
    <description>The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) is a guidewire-derived measurement of coronary microvascular function. IMR = mean distal coronary pressure x mean transit time, measured during systemic hyperaemia induced by intravenous adenosine (140 ug/kg/min). Resting physiological parameters will also be measured.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported quality of life and health status will be assessed at baseline and during follow-up at 6 months. The Euroquol EQ-5D questionnaire will be used. Health-related quality of life will be related to other clinical information, including the MRI findings, and for estimation of quality-adjusted life years which is relevant for health economic assessments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recurrent myocardial infarction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical characteristics that might predict recurrent cardiac events in survivors of STEMI are uncertain. The risk of recurrent MI is clinically relevant since this risk is potentially modifiable by additional PCI, as observed in the Preventative Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction (PRAMI) trial (N Engl J Med 2013 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1305520).
The clinical predictors of recurrent MI, as revealed by contrast MRI at 6 months and recurrent adverse cardiac events during the longer term will be assessed. Recurrent MI may be fatal or non-fatal. The characteristics to be assessed at baseline will include clinical characteristics (e.g. age, diabetes), coronary artery disease characteristics (as revealed by quantitative coronary analysis and plaque characterisation), guidewire-derived parameters of coronary artery function, and MI characteristics as revealed by contrast-enhanced MRI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adenosine response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The response to intravenous adenosine as reflected by patient-reported symptoms and changes in heart rate and blood pressure will be prospectively assessed. Adverse events, such as abnormalities in heart rate and rhythm and bronchospasm, that might be associated with the adenosine infusion will also be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MACE</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Major Adverse Cardiac Events are defined as cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or hospitalisation for heart failure. The event definitions will follow the FDA guidelines (Hicks K et al 2010, 2012) and the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (Thygesen et al Eur Heart J 2012). Events will be reviewed by a cardiologist who is independent of the research team and who is blinded to the MRI results. MACE will be related to the clinical and MRI findings at baseline. The survival analysis will be performed at the end of the study and again after a minimum of 3 years follow-up in all participants. The longer term follow-up will be performed by electronic case record linkage to hospital, NHS and government records.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MACCE</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACCE) is the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, hospitalisation for TIA or stroke. The event definitions will follow the FDA guidelines (Hicks K et al 2010, 2012) and the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (Thygesen et al Eur Heart J 2012). THE MACCE events will be reviewed by a cardiologist who is independent of the research team and who is blinded to the MRI results. MACCE will be related to the clinical and MRI findings at baseline. The survival analysis will be performed at the end of the study and again after a minimum of 3 years follow-up in all participants. The longer term follow-up will be performed by electronic case record linkage to hospital, NHS and government records.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious adverse cardiovascular events.</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>All serious adverse cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, hospitalisation for unstable angina, hospitalisation for heart failure, implantable defibrillator implantation, hospitalisation for TIA or stroke, PCI, or CABG will be evaluated. Event definitions will follow the FDA guideline (Hicks K et al 2010, 2012) and the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (Thygesen et al Eur Heart J 2012). In order to understand the prognostic significance of the clinical and MRI findings, these baseline findings will be associated with the cardiovascular events. The events will be reviewed by a cardiologist who is independent of the research team and who is blinded to the MRI results. The follow-up analysis will be performed at the end of the study and again after a min 3 years follow-up. The longer term follow-up will be performed by electronic case record linkage to hospital, NHS and government records.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>All-cause death or heart failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All-cause death and hospitalisation for heart failure is taken to be prognostically important and mechanistically linked to impaired heart function and injury after STEM. Event definitions will follow the FDA guideline (Hicks K et al 2010, 2012). In order to understand the prognostic significance of the clinical and MRI findings, these baseline findings will be associated with the occurrence of death or heart failure. Implantation of a cardiac defibrillator for primary or secondary prevention in a post-MI patient will also be considered. The events will be reviewed by a cardiologist who is independent of the research team and who is blinded to the MRI results. The follow-up analysis will be performed at the end of the study and again after a minimum of 3 years follow-up in all participants. The longer term follow-up will be performed by electronic case record linkage to hospital, NHS and government records.</description>
