    <textblock>
      The successful re-opening of a blocked coronary artery has a beneficial effect on the further
      clinical course (e.g. improvement of clinical symptoms, improved quality of life, increased
      heart function, etc.). However, some types of blockages are more difficult to open by means
      of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a procedure which is commonly used for these
      kind of problems. This procedure makes use of a technique in which special wires, balloons,
      stents (metal or polymeric tube-like structures) and devices are utilized to re-open or
      revascularize a blockage in one of the blood vessels of the heart. This type of blockages are
      chronic total occlusions (CTO). CTOs have certain characteristics which impede the
      revascularization of the blood vessel.

      Nevertheless, remarkable progress has been achieved over the past few years in the area of
      CTO revascularization or CTO PCI. A large range of CTO dedicated materials, such as
      guidewires, guiding catheters, devices, balloons and stents, as well as different techniques
      have been developed. However, at present, reluctance to open CTOs still exists, due to the
      indications and outcomes of percutaneous revascularization as well as the technical
      difficulties which commonly arise during these interventional procedures. The presence of
      these difficulties results in suboptimal success rates worldwide (±70-80%), despite these
      many innovations.

      To increase these success rates and to make sure more interventional cardiologists will treat
      CTOs, a hybrid treatment algorithm has been developed with the materials (e.g. CrossBoss™
      catheter; Bridgepoint Medical, Inc.) and techniques, currently already available. The main
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of this hybrid algorithm as
      well as validating the efficacy of one of the materials (CrossBoss™ catheter), used in this
      algorithm. To be able to do this, data concerning the patients' demographics, CTO
      characteristics, procedure and outcome will be collected in the form of a registry. This
      registry will be performed in several European centra (Belgium, the Netherlands, United
      Kingdom, France). Since the study will only collect data and no intervention is performed,
      this will be an observational study. At regular time points, the data will be checked for
      errors or inconsistencies. To do this, site visits will be performed at pre-defined times.

    <description>Description: Success percentage of the hybrid algorithm and of those procedures in which CrossBoss™ and Stingray™ technologies are used (as a stand alone device or combined with other techniques) in CTO lesions according to the Japanese scoring system (J-CTO). Success is defined as successful revascularization, resulting in TIMI flow 3.</description>

    <description>Complications (either CrossBoss™/Stingray™ related or not): Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) during in-hospital stay (approximately 1-2 days) and at follow-up (first month after CTO PCI). MACE is common endpoint for death, Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) (according to ESC guidelines), non Q-wave MI (according to ESC guidelines) and target vessel revascularization. Other complications include target vessel failure (i.e. applies when target vessel is occluded at follow-up (first month after CTO PCI) but no revascularization has been considered), tamponade, perforation, bleeding requiring transfusion/surgery, peri-procedural infarction ((N-)STEMI) (according to ESC guidelines) and loss of side-branches.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject shows the presence of at least one coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO),
             either with or without the presence of one or more other diseased coronary arteries.
             This CTO must be located in a native coronary artery and have a visually estimated
             stenosis of 100%, corresponding with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow
             0. Following the operators judgment, this occlusion is present for more then 3 months.

          -  Subject will be/is treated percutaneously for one or more CTOs via the hybrid
             techniques.

          -  Subject (or legal guardian) understands the study requirements and the treatment
             procedures and provides written informed consent before any study-specific procedures
             are performed.

          -  Subject is willing to comply with all protocol-required follow-up evaluation (patient
             will be followed during 1 month after PCI procedure to assess any complications and
             clinical status).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The occlusion is considered to be less than 3 months present.

          -  Subject is treated via PCI without application of the hybrid algorithm and/or use of
             the CrossBoss™ and Stingray™ technology (Bridgepoint Medical, Inc.).

          -  Subject is participating in another investigational clinical trial that may cause
             non-compliance with the protocol or confound data interpretation.

          -  Subject intends to participate in another investigational clinical trial that may
             cause non-compliance with the protocol or confound data interpretation.
