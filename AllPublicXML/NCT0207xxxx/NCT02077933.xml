    <description>alpelisib is administered orally once a day on a continuous dosing schedule and dosed on a flat-fixed dose and not adjusted by body weight or body surface area, starting on Day 8 of Cycle 1 in the dose escalation and Day 1 of Cycle 1 in the dose expansion.
In the doublet dose escalation, the alpelisib starting dose is 300 mg. The alpelisib dose may be escalated or de-escalated, as needed.
In the triplet dose escalation part, the alpelisib starting dose is one dose level lower of the MTD as determined during the doublet escalation. The alpelisib dose may be escalated or de-escalated, as needed.
In the doublet dose expansion and triplet dose expansion (patients assigned to alpelisib, everolimus and exemestane), alpelisib is administered at the recommended dose determined in the dose escalation.
In the triplet dose expansion (patients assigned to alpelisib and exemestane), alpelisib is administered at a dose of 250 mg daily.</description>
