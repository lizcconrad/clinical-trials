      1. To evaluate the immune response to vaccines in infants of IBD patients treated with
           anti-TNF medications during pregnancy compared to infants of IBD mother not treated with
           anti-TNF medications.

        2. To evaluate the immune function of B and T cells at 3 months and one year of age in
           infants of IBD patients treated with anti-TNF medications during pregnancy compared to
           infants of non anti-TNF treated mothers.

      The secondary aims are to follow anti TNF drug levels in infants born to IBD patients treated
      with anti-TNF medications during pregnancy and to evaluate the risk of infections during the
      first year of life in this population, compared to children of IBD patients not treated with
      anti-TNF medications during pregnancy.

      Significance -The results of this study have the potential to change clinical practice of
      anti TNF treatment during pregnancy and the follow-up of infants born to these patients

        This is a multicenter prospective controlled trial. The study population includes infants
        born to mothers with IBD, divided into two groups: Study group- infants of IBD patients
        treated with anti-TNF during pregnancy. Control group- infants of IBD patients treated with
        non-anti TNF medications during pregnancy.
