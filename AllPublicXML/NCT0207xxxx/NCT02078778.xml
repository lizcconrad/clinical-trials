  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect on blood pressure of 3 months of treatment
      with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA).

      Hypothesis:

        1. Central 24-h blood pressure (BP) monitoring hedges day fluctuations in blood pressure
           more accurately than peripheral 24-h BP monitoring, because the measurement is painless
           and does not interfere with the patient / subject's activities during the daytime or
           nighttime sleep.

        2. Blood pressure is elevated in patients with OSA and falls during treatment with CPAP.

      3. The renal treatment of salt and water is abnormal in OSA, improved during treatment with
      CPAP.

      4. Quality of life improves during treatment with CPAP
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 patients with hypertension and moderate to severe OSA are treated with CPAP
      3 months to examine the treatment effect on blood pressure throughout the day, but especially
      nocturnal, renal treatment of salt and water, and quality of life.

      Before and after 3 months of CPAP treatment is made central and peripheral 24-h ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring, 24-h urine collection and blood samples.
