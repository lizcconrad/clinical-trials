  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inattention, hyperactivity
      and impulsivity, is an early onset, highly heritable, clinically heterogeneous, long-term
      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies. It affects
      5-10% of school-aged children worldwide (7.5% in Taiwan) and 2-4% of adults. Although the
      efficacy of medications for ADHD is well demonstrated in clinical trials, substantial numbers
      of patients fail to remain on therapy, and there is tremendous variability in tolerability
      and treatment acceptance. It is of great interest to identify biomarkers relating to
      medication response in ADHD. However, the procedure for obtaining central markers such as PET
      scan is invasive and expensive. Previous studies have found that mRNA expression of
      neurochemical markers in circulating blood can reflect the neurochemical levels in the brain.
      Further studies to identify peripheral biomarkers related to medication response in ADHD are
      warranted.

      Specific Aims:

        1. to examine the relationship between peripheral mRNA expression levels of dopamine
           markers (DAT1, DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and DRD5) and symptomatology of ADHD;

        2. to examine the relationship between peripheral mRNA expression levels of dopamine
           markers and neurocognitive endophenotypes of ADHD;

        3. to identify the specific dopamine markers of methylphenidate effects on the
           symptomatology of ADHD;

        4. to identify the specific dopamine markers of methylphenidate effects on the
           neurocognitive endophenotypes of ADHD.

      Subjects and Methods: We will recruit 120 drug-naïve ADHD patients, aged 7-18 in this 3-year
      project. The patients will receive methylphenidate, and the medication response will be
      assessed regularly within 12-week treatment period (Week 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12). The primary
      efficacy measure is the ADHDRS and CGI-ADHD-S. The secondary measures include the SNAP-IV,
      CBCL, CGI-ADHD-I, SAICA, and Family APGAR. Neuropsychological testing, including WISC-III,
      CPT, and CANTAB, will be performed. The blood sample will be collected, and the mRNA
      expression levels of dopamine markers (DAT1, DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and DRD5) hypothesized
      to influence medication effects risks for ADHD will be analyzed.

      Anticipated Results: Our study will identify peripheral dopamine biomarkers that can predict
      individual variability in symptomatology and neurocognitive functions following treatment
      with methylphenidate. The ability of peripheral biomarkers to predict response to
      methylphenidate administration can have important implications for personalizing the
      treatment for ADHD, allowing clinicians to predict which patients will receive greatest
      benefit from dopaminergic medications. The use of mRNA screening in dosing will provide a
      model for future drug development, in which outcome variability is assessed in subgroups of
      peripheral dopamine markers and not merely on the basis of treatment assignment. In addition,
      the findings of such approaches to identify the peripheral biomarkers on the drug response in
      this study should help us to extend our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of
      ADHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be outpatients who are between 7 and 16 years of age.

          -  Patients must have ADHD that meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) disease diagnostic criteria assessed by the
             investigator's clinical evaluation, as well as confirmed by the Chinese version of the
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age
             Children-Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E).

          -  Patients must have a Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) score &gt; 4
             at Visit 1.

          -  Patients must be psychotropic medication-naïve. Patients will be considered to be
             medication-naïve if they have never received medications specifically to treat ADHD.

          -  Patients must have laboratory results, including serum chemistries, hematology, and
             urine analysis showing no significant abnormalities and no clinical information that
             should preclude a patient's participation at study entry. A patient with a significant
             abnormal laboratory result may enter the study if, after appropriate medical
             evaluation, the result does not indicate a serious medical condition that in the
             investigator's judgment would preclude participation.

          -  Patients and parents (or legal representative) must have a degree of understanding
             sufficient to be able to communicate suitably with the investigator.

          -  Patients must be of normal intelligence in the judgment of the investigator. Normal
             intelligence is defined as achieving a score of 80 or more when IQ testing is
             administrated.

          -  Patients must have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep appointments
             for clinic visits and all tests, including neuropsychological testing and
             venipunctures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with current or past history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective Disorder,
             organic psychosis, bipolar I or II disorder, autism, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive
             developmental disorder. Other comorbid psychiatric disorders are not excluded if the
             ADHD symptoms are the primary source of impairment for the patient.

          -  Patients with a history of any seizure disorder (other than febrile convulsion) or
             patients who are taking anticonvulsants for seizure control.

          -  Patients have been at serious suicidal risk, determined by the investigator.

          -  Patients with a history of severe allergies to more than one class of medications or
             multiple adverse drug reactions.

          -  Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 3 months, or who are
             currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any described or over- the-counter
             medication in a manner that the investigator considers indicative of abuse.

          -  Patients with cardiovascular disease or other conditions that could be aggravated by
             an increased heart rate or increased blood pressure.

          -  Patients who are likely to need psychotropic medications apart from methylphenidate,
             including Chinese medicine or health-food supplements that have central nervous system
             activity.
