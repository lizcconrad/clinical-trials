  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if abatacept (Orencia) is effective in patients
      with primary biliary cirrhosis who do not respond adequately to standard treatment with
      ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, Urso, Ursodiol, Actigall).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, active treatment trial to assess the efficacy and safety of abatacept
      in subject with PBC who have had an incomplete biochemical response to UDCA. In this trial,
      20 subjects with PBC who have had an incomplete biochemical response to UDCA will be assigned
      to treatment with weekly subcutaneous injections of 125 mg of abatacept. The treatment phase
      of the study will last 24 weeks with an off-treatment follow up at Week 36.

      Inclusion criteria include:

        -  Confirmed diagnosis of PBC

        -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.67 times the upper limit of normal after 6 months of treatment
           with UDCA
