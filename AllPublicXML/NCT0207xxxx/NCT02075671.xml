  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is characterized by severe flushing
      (transient erythema), non-transient erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasia. Topical
      therapy is not always effective in treating symptoms of rosacea. Furthermore, rapid
      recurrence is common following the use of systemic antibiotics, resulting in the chronic use
      of these medications to control the disease. Although the exact pathogenesis of rosacea is
      unknown, treatment for this condition has been investigated based on its similarity to acne
      and photodamaged skin. Case reports have shown promising results in rosacea patients treated
      with methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL - PDT). Other than a case report which
      observed significant improvement of papules, pustules, erythema, and flushing following 5 -
      aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) treatment of a patient with rosacea, the
      role of ALA-PDT in the treatment of rosacea has not been reported.

      We have designed a pilot study investigating the efficacy of ALA-PDT in treating
      papulopustular rosacea. The objectives of the study are as follows:

      Primary objective:

        1. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules),
           erythema, and telangiectasia of rosacea as assessed by the Investigator's Global
           Assessment (IGA).

        2. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of
           rosacea as assessed by the Inflammatory Lesion Investigator's Global Assessment (ILIGA).

           Secondary objectives:

        3. To evaluate improvement of rosacea associated erythema as assessed by the Clinical
           Erythema Assessment (CEA) scale.

        4. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of
           rosacea as measured by a difference in inflammatory lesion count.

        5. To evaluate improvement of rosacea as assessed by the Patient Overall Assessment Scale.
