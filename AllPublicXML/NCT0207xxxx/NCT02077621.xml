  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PG2 has been approved in Taiwan to treat cancer-related fatigue for advanced cancer patients.
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PG2 on fatigue relief in
      patients undergoing palliative abdominal surgery for cancer. The secondary endpoints,
      including the length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, HRQL, inflammatory
      biomarkers, the duration of antibiotic therapy, mortality during the hospital stay, weight
      loss and body composition, will be evaluated among these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study. At least 40 evaluable
      patients who are scheduled for palliative abdominal surgery for cancer will be randomly
      assigned to the control or treatment group. Each group will have at least 20 patients and be
      treated as follows: 1) control group: patients will accept placebo 1 dose a day (POD-1)
      before surgery and 1 dose a day for 3 days after surgery (POD+0 to POD+2); 2) treatment
      group: patients will accept PG2 1 dose a day (POD-1) before surgery and 1 dose a day for 3
      days after surgery (POD+0 to POD+2).
