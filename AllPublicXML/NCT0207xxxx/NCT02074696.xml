  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the status of brain-derived neurotrophic factor brain
      (BDNF) and how the brain behaves in response to skill acquisition. Specifically we will
      investigate the relationship of the status of BDNF with cortical excitability changes and
      learning that occur during a motor training paradigm. We aim to 1) determine cortical
      excitability changes by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after
      training; 2) to determine finger tracking accuracy before and after training; and 3)
      determine the presence of BDNF polymorphism in each participant.

      We are testing healthy adults in this study, and eventually would like to apply to persons
      who have neurologic disorders such as stroke or dystonia. By applying a magnetic field to the
      outside of the head, electrical currents are produced within the brain that can stimulate
      brain tissue. Using TMS, the brain can be studied to gain a greater understanding of the
      mechanisms associated with cortical excitability in healthy and patient populations. There is
      limited knowledge of what influence genetic biomarkers such as BDNF have on cortical
      excitability changes within the cortex following learning. Studies have indicated that people
      without this certain gene are less likely to show changes in brain excitability during TMS
      and during motor learning than people with this gene

      Subjects and Design: A pretest/posttest design will be used. A convenience sample of healthy
      college students will be studied and will undergo an initial screening by the PI or
      Co-Investigators consisting of medical history and neurologic disorder review to assess
      safety and qualifications to participate.

      Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria: Inclusion criteria include ages between 18-45 years and no
      past history of psychiatric or neurologic disease. Exclusion criteria include subjects with
      any neuromuscular disorder that impairs upper extremity motion or seizure history. Subjects
      cannot be pregnant nor have indwelling metal or medical devices that are incompatible with
      TMS testing.

      With the subject seated in a supportive chair, the subject's skin will be cleaned surrounding
      the first doral interoseus belly and dorsum of the hand. Next small surface electromyographic
      (EMG) electrodes will be attached at the muscle belly and tendon. A ground electrode will be
      placed on the dorsum of the hand or wrist.

      Next, the threshold for TMS activation of the target muscle will be determined. To find the
      optimal position for activating the first dorsal interosseous muscle, we will use a 70-mm
      figure-eight TMS coil connected to a Magstim rapid magnetic stimulator. The coil will be
      handheld on the scalp over the approximate area of the primary motor cortex (M1) in the
      contralateral hemisphere to the recording electrode, and moved systematically to find the
      optimal position. Single-pulse magnetic stimuli will be delivered manually at approximately
      0.1 Hz starting at an intensity of 50% of the stimulator maximum. This level will be adjusted
      systematically until the resting motor threshold is found, defined as the minimum intensity
      required to elicit a motor evoked potential (MEP) &gt;50 ÂµV peak-to-peak in at least 5 of 10
      trials with the target muscle at rest. Various cortical excitability measures will be
      collected lasting approximately 20 minutes.

      Finger tracking/training will be provided for 30 minutes under the supervision of the PI or
      Co-I. Subjects will wear a finger electrogoniometer at the index finger metacarpophalangeal
      (MP) joint. Subjects will use flexion/extension movements of the respective joint to track
      waveforms on a computer screen. The training would consist of 30 blocks of tracking trials.
      Each block will consist of 3 trials. The protocol parameters for different blocks will differ
      in waveform, amplitude, frequency, trial duration, and joint position. For example, a square
      wave would involve a different movement pattern execution as opposed to a triangular wave.
      The waveforms may also differ on the forearm position to create &quot;stimulus-response
      compatible&quot; or &quot;stimulus-response incompatible&quot; conditions. For example, a stimulus-response
      incompatible joint position would involve extending and flexing the joint (finger MP or
      elbow) in the horizontal plane to produce cursor movements in the vertical plane. All these
      factors challenge the individual's capabilities to problem solve to achieve optimum learning.

      Following training and accuracy testing, cortical excitability measures will be collected
      again lasting approximately 20 minutes. Lastly, a saliva sample will be collected for genetic
      screening for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism. We will collect
      approximately 2 ml (less than one-half teaspoon) of saliva by asking the subject to spit into
      a tube. It may take up to 30 minutes to provide a saliva sample, however, most people
      typically require less time (approximately 5 minutes).

    <description>A computer quantified tracking performance measure in each test. This is a calculation of accuracy by using the equation: AI = 100(P-E)/P. Where E is the root mean square (r.m.s.) error between the target line and the response line, and P is the size of the individual's target pattern, calculated as the r.m.s. difference between the sine wave and the midline separating the upper and lower phases of the sine wave. The magnitude of P is determined by the scale of the vertical axis, which is the subject's range of finger motion. Therefore, the AI is normalized to each subject's own range of motion and takes into account any differences between subjects in the excursion of the tracking target. The maximum possible score is 100%. Negative scores occur when the response line is so distant from the target that it falls on the opposite side of the midline.</description>
