  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the short- and long-term effects of a 10-week
      walking program, based on the self-determination theory, in people with mental disorders. The
      investigators expect positive effects on:

        -  Physical fitness

        -  Physical activity

        -  Well-being (less feelings of anxiety, less feelings of depression) The investigators
           also expect underlying psychosocial processes to influence these effects.

      Framework: Previous research has shown beneficial health effects of a 10-week walking program
      in a senior organisation. Based upon the self-determination theory, similar results can be
      expected in people with mental disorders and could be highly relevant, given the fact that
      these people:

        -  Are often less active

        -  Have mental problems and often also comorbidities

        -  Are often socially isolated

      Participants: Psylos tries to recruit a convenience sample of at least 100 participants for
      an intervention group (which will undertake the walking program) and 80 participants for a
      control group. All of them have to sign an informed consent. Due to attrition, at least 60
      participants in the intervention group and 40 in the control group can be expected. A post
      hoc analysis, with detailed information about the variation in this population, may give
      additional information about the necessary power to obtain significant results.

      Data analysis: First there will be examined whether the participants in both groups are equal
      at baseline according to relevant parameters (due to the non-randomisation). Second, to test
      the main effects, the difference scores will be examined between both groups. If certain
      assumptions are met, by an unpaired t-test; if not, by a non-parametric test. Finally (if
      relevant), the underlying psychosocial processes will be examined by regression analyses.
