  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the effect of a community-based walking exercise
      program with detailed training, monitoring, and coaching (TMC) exercise components enhanced
      by community-based participatory research (CBPR) practices (TMC+) on the primary outcome of
      peak walking time (PWT) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that PAD patients randomized to the exercise
      program in the community setting incorporating TMC+ will improve walking ability compared
      with patients who receive the standard of care (exercise advice). Secondary hypotheses
      include a significant improvement in patient-reported outcomes, an improvement in functional
      ability or a significant increase in volume of physical activity for patients who complete
      community-based walking exercise when compared with patients receiving the standard of care.
      Exploratory hypotheses include a significant improvement in PWT for 1) patients receiving a
      combination of lower extremity endovascular therapy (ET) and community-based walking exercise
      or 2) open peripheral intervention and community-based walking exercise compared to patients
      who do not receive endovascular therapy or open intervention and receive only the standard of
      care.

    <description>The exercise therapy program with training, monitoring and coaching enhanced by community-based participatory research (CBPR) (TMC+) is a comprehensive approach to community-based walking exercise for improving PAD patient outcomes. The components of TMC+ are optimal training guidelines for patients (i.e., T), monitoring from both investigators and patient self-monitoring (i.e., M), coaching from investigators on how to improve patients' walking ability (i.e., C), and finally enhancements from CBPR practices (+).</description>
