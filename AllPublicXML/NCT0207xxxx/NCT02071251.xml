  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 500,000 surgical site infections occur annually in the US. These lead to worse
      patient quality of life, more outpatient and emergency room visits, readmissions and home
      services, with an estimated increase in costs of at least $3500 per complication. Surgical
      site infections are associated with increasing body mass index. There is limited and
      conflicting data of the utility of multiple surgical interventions to decrease the risk of
      surgical site complications. The investigators explored the effect of a prospective care
      pathway for closure of vertical abdominal wounds on patient's wound complications.

    <description>The primary outcome for our study was a wound complication within eight weeks of laparotomy. Wound complication was defined as seroma, hematoma, separation, or infection requiring additional medical and/or surgical management within eight weeks of laparotomy.</description>

    <description>The skin and subcutaneous tissues were incised using a scalpel or cutting electrocautery. Use of coagulation current on the skin or subcutaneous tissues was not allowed, except focally to attain hemostasis. At the conclusion of surgery, a 7mm Jackson-Pratt drain was placed below Camper's fascia, which in turn was closed with 3-0 plain catgut suture. The skin was closed with staples. Dressings were retained for at least twenty-four hours. Staples were to be retained for at least two weeks.</description>
