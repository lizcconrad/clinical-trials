  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of an investigational oximetry system to evaluate the triggering of the &quot;sensor off&quot;
      status with the marketed off-the-shelf sensors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Multi-functional Patient Monitoring PCBA is an electronic circuit board in the monitoring
      system that performs calculations.

      The study will evaluate the performance of the Sensor Off New Patient Monitoring system by
      exposing the sensor to an ambient light source, sensor slipping off the finger with the light
      emitter and detector facing each other or a sensor slipping off under a blanket.
