  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a cornerstone of management of acute respiratory failure, but
      MV per se can provoke ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), especially in acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS). Lung protective ventilation strategy has been proved to prevent
      VILI by using low tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg of ideal body weight and limiting plateau
      pressure to less than 30 cmH2O. However, heavy sedation or even paralysis are frequently used
      to ensure the protective ventilation strategy, both of which are associated with respiratory
      muscles weakness. Maintaining of spontaneous breathing may decrease the need of sedative drug
      and improve gas exchange by promoting lung recruitment.

      Pressure-targeted mode is the most frequent way of delivering after 48 hours of initiating
      MV. Three types of pressure-controlled mode are available in intubated patients: Biphasic
      Intermittent Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP), Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV),
      and Pressure-Assist Controlled Ventilation (also called BIPAPassist). They are based on
      pressure regulation but have the difference in terms of synchronization between the patient
      and the ventilator. The different working principle of these modes may result in different
      breathing pattern and consequently different in tidal volume and transpulmonary pressure,
      which may be potentially harmful. The investigators bench study with a lung model
      demonstrated higher tidal volume and transpulmonary pressure with the BIPAPassist over APRV
      despite similar pressure settings and patient's simulated effort. However, the impact of each
      mode on the delivered tidal volume and the transpulmonary pressure in spontaneously breathing
      mechanically ventilated patients is currently unknown. Their hypothesis is that when the
      investigators compare the three pressure-controlled modes, the asynchronous mode (APRV) will
      result in more protective ventilation strategy over the two other modes (BIPAP and
      BIPAPassist).
