    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two methods for reinforcement of the abdominal
      donor-site after breast reconstruction with the pedicled TRAM-flap. Reinforcement of the
      abdominal donor-site is performed, after randomization, with either a porcine derived
      biological mesh or a synthetic mesh. The patient and the investigator is blinded.

      The aim is to identify the most optimal method for reinforcement of the abdominal donor-site
      and thereby contribute to fast and complete rehabilitation of women undergoing breast
      reconstruction with the pedicled TRAM-flap after surgical removal of the breast tissue due to
      breast cancer, precursors to breast cancer or an increased risk of developing breast cancer
      and thereby following preventive removal of the breast tissue.

      The patients visit the outpatient clinic 4, 12 and 24 months after operation and abdominal
      wall function, the donor site morbidity, the frequency of postoperative complications, the
      aesthetic appearance of the reconstructed breast and the abdominal wall and costs are
      evaluated.
