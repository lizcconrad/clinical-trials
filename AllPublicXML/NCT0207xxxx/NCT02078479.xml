      The purpose of this study isto assess the efficacy of daily 10 sessions of rTMS over primary
      motor cortex in patients suffering from malignant neuropathic pain. Thirty four patients were
      divided randomly into 2 groups equally using closed envelops to undergo real (20 Hz, 10
      second, 10 trains with inter-train interval 30 second with total pulses 2000, intensity 80%
      of motor threshold over hand area of motor cortex) or sham rTMS (same parameters but with
      coil elevated and angled away from the head)every day for ten consecutive days (5 days/week).
      Patients were evaluated using a verbal descriptor scale (VDS), visual analog scale (VAS),
      Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs (LANSS) and Hamilton rating scale for
      depression (HAM-D) at baseline, after 1st, 5th, 10thtreatment session, and then 15 days and 1
      month after the end of treatment. ic pain.
