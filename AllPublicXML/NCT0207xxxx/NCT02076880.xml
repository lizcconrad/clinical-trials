  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive procedure based on the removal of a large part of the
      gastric fundus. According to a recent randomized study, weight loss and resolution of
      diabetes are comparable to that obtained after gastric by-pass (79.7 % versus 80.3%), but
      with a lower morbidity. The mechanisms involved in the rapid resolution of diabetes after
      sleeve gastrectomy remain poorly understood, as no specific study in patients with type 2
      diabetic obese are available. An increase in post- absorptive levels of Glucagon-like Peptide
      1(GLP-1), Peptide YY(PYY) and insulin has been reported, but in non-diabetic subjects mostly.
      The important caloric restriction in the early postoperative period indeed improves hepatic
      insulin resistance, regardless of weight loss. Specific metabolic and hormonal effects of
      this surgical procedure cannot be excluded.The aim of our study is to explore the early and
      late metabolic effects of sleeve gastrectomy in severely obese patients with
      non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. We will also evaluate insulin sensitivity, insulin
      secretion and incretin effect. We will include 14 obese patients with type 2 diabetes,
      considered eligible to bariatric surgery according to HAS criteria, and whose diabetes
      treatment involves only metformin, sulfonylurea and glinides. They will be randomized to a
      1-week caloric restriction period or no caloric restriction, immediately before surgery. Test
      meals with dosages of blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, adiponectin, leptin, GLP-1, PYY and
      ghrelin will be performed before and after caloric restriction, and 1 week, 3 month, 6 month
      and 12 month after surgery.
