  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the ability of GSK1278863 to increase the hemoglobin (Hgb)
      concentration, or maintain it within the target range, and the safety and efficacy of
      GSK1278863 over 16 weeks of treatment, in hemodialysis-dependent subjects with anemia
      associated with chronic kidney disease who are chronically hyporesponsive to rhEPO. The data
      generated will inform dose requirements for any chronic rhEPO hyporesponsive
      hemodialysis-dependent subjects included in future clinical trials. The study consists of a
      4-week rhEPO run-in period, a 16-week GSK1278863 treatment period and a 4-week Follow-up
      period.

             predominantly paced rhythm.

          -  Gender: Female and male subjects. Females: If of childbearing potential, must agree to
             use one of the approved contraception methods from Screening until completion of the
             Follow-up Visit OR, of non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females

             defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrea [in questionable cases a blood sample
             with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 23.0-116.3 milliinternational
             units (MIU)/milliliter (mL) (23.0-116.3 international units (IU)/liter (L)) and

             to use one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT
             during the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of

             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal

             examination finding that the Investigator considers would put the subject at
             unacceptable risk, or an unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures, or
             lifestyle and/or dietary restrictions outlined in the protocol.

          -  Pregnancy and lactation: Pregnant females as determined by positive serum human
             chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test or women who are lactating at Week -4 or during the
             trial.

          -  Laboratory eligibility criteria will be assessed according to the central laboratory
             result for the screening samples

          -  Subjects who fail screening may be rescreened as soon as the investigator feels they
             may have subsequently become eligible. However, an individual subject may not be
             rescreened more than twice. There is no predetermined amount of time required to wait
             to rescreen a previously ineligible subject. Exceptions are those failing on Hgb or
             folate who may rescreen in 4 weeks and those failing for Vitamin B12 where rescreening
             may occur in 8 weeks.

        <description>Transferrin saturation is measured in percentage, it is the ratio of serum iron and total iron-binding capacity, multiplied by 100. Baseline value for transferrin saturation is the pre-dose value on Day 1. Percent change is 100 times [exponential (log Week 16 value minus log Baseline value) -1].

        <description>Total iron-binding capacity is a medical laboratory test that measures the blood's capacity to bind iron with transferrin. Baseline value for total iron binding capacity is the last pre-dose value on Day 1. Change from Baseline in total iron binding capacity was calculated as the Week 16 value minus the Baseline value. Data has been presented for only those participants who were available at indicated time points.</description>

        <title>Maximum Observed Percent Change From Baseline in Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected on Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 4 (6-12 hours post-dose, then 1, 2 and 3 hours after first sample), Week 8 (pre-dose), Week 12 (pre-dose and 3 hour post-dose) and Week 16 (pre-dose) for VEGF measurement. The maximum observed percent change from Baseline in VEGF in the subjects was reported. Baseline value for VEGF is the last pre-dose value on Day 1. Percent change was calculated as 100 multiplied by exponential (log observed maximum value minus log Baseline value) minus 1. Participants who were available at the indicated time point were analyzed.</description>

After 4 weeks of treatment with GSK1278863, need for dose adjustment was evaluated at visits 4, 8 and 12, to maintain hemoglobin within the target range. Target range was defined as: Hgb Criteria of 10.0 to 11.5 g/dL. Data has been presented for only those participants who were available at indicated time points.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. GSK supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to the study terminating early, resulting in a sparse amount of data, selected parameters were not summarized.</limitations_and_caveats>
