  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the benefits and risks associated with the use
      of 2 treatment strategies to lower blood sugar in participants aged 65 and older with T2DM.
      One strategy is based on the use of oral and injectable medications that only reduce blood
      sugar (glucose) when it is high. The other strategy is based on non-glucose dependent agents.
      The trial will last up to 72 weeks for each participant.

    <time_frame>Baseline to last participant visit (up to 72 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Failed to reach and maintain HbA1c target, without clinically significant hypoglycemia, is defined as having 2 consecutive HbA1c &gt; upper limit of HbA1c target over 12 weeks starting from Week 24 for participants with HbA1c data beyond Week 24, or Week 24 HbA1c &gt; upper limit of HbA1c target for participants without HbA1c data beyond Week 24. Clinically significant hypoglycemia is defined as any severe hypoglycemia or repeated hypoglycemia interrupting participants activities or sleep and associated with blood glucose ≤3.9 millimole per liter (mmol/L), or repeated asymptomatic hypoglycemia associated with blood glucose &lt;3.0 mmol/L. Success is defined as lacking of failure.</description>

        <description>Failed to reach and maintain HbA1c target, without clinically significant hypoglycemia, is defined as having 2 consecutive HbA1c &gt; upper limit of HbA1c target over 12 weeks starting from Week 24 for participants with HbA1c data beyond Week 24, or Week 24 HbA1c &gt; upper limit of HbA1c target for participants without HbA1c data beyond Week 24. Clinically significant hypoglycemia is defined as any severe hypoglycemia or repeated hypoglycemia interrupting participants activities or sleep and associated with blood glucose ≤3.9 millimole per liter (mmol/L), or repeated asymptomatic hypoglycemia associated with blood glucose &lt;3.0 mmol/L. Success is defined as lacking of failure.</description>
