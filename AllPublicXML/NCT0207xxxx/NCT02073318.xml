      Purpose -To investigate whether older adults with dementia who have balance and gait problems
      can improve their balance and gait function after an individualized 4-week tasks-oriented
      balance training with sensory manipulation.

      Hypothesis

      -There is significant difference of Timed Up and Go Test, Berg Balance Scale, walking speed,
      30-s chair-stand test, Chair sit-and-reach test and Barthel Index between dementia patients
      who received tasks-oriented balance training and those didn't receive after 4-weeks training
      and one month follow-up.
