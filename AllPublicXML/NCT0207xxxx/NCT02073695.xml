  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research question:

      Do patients using a neutral rotation brace post surgery have improved functional outcome and
      external rotation of the shoulder compared to current best practice using a polysling holding
      the proximal humerus in internal rotation?

      Primary objectives:

      To compare post-operative functional outcome scores obtained at 6 weeks, 9 weeks, 3 months
      and 1 year. (Scores at 6 weeks and 3 months in clinical review and postal scores at 9 weeks
      and 1 year) between patients held in neutral versus current standard rotation. These will be
      compared to scores taken pre-operatively.

      Benefits:

      There may be no extra benefits to patients from this trial however the results from the trial
      will help improve treatment for future patients at this hospital, and others across the
      country.

      Risks/disadvantages:

      The operation is the same in both groups studied, the study is investigating the use of the
      two different slings. The post-operative treatment is also the same, and all patients on the
      trial will receive the same amount of physiotherapy. It isn't anticipated that there will be
      any additional risk from this trial.

    <description>Patients subjective assessment of pain and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) impairment. The Oxford Shoulder Questionnaire has been shown to correlate well with both the Constant Score and the SF36 assessment and to be sensitive to surgical intervention. The Oxford Shoulder Questionnaire accumulates to a total score with a maximum of value of 60, in which four pain related questions make up 33% of this total whilst the remaining 67% is derived from eight ADL related questions. The highest scores are attributed to the worst outcomes in the Oxford Shoulder Questionnaire</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Proximal humeral fractures requiring operative intervention with extramedullary plate

             to be held in internal rotation with a standard polysling to allow healing of the
             Pectoralis major tendon)
