      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two investigational ophthalmic solutions for
      reduction in ocular redness in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis.

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects attended 8 study visits, 5 of which included a 3-hour period of ragweed
      exposure in an Environmental Exposure Chamber. At the sixth visit, subjects received study
      product and began dosing for up to 9 days. The final visit was the final day of dosing.
      Participation in this study lasted up to 68 days.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Ocular Redness, Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Hour 10 [AUC (0-10)] at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 hours on Days 1 (baseline) and 7</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular redness ratings were collected for nasal and temporal areas of each eye and assessed by investigational center staff using a visual scale (ie, scored by comparing the subject's eye with a series of photographs) and graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extremely severe), 0.5 unit steps permitted. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule with unequal intervals as determined by the assessment time points. Change was calculated as AUC(0-10)[Day 7] - AUC(0-10) [Baseline]. Both eyes contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Ocular Itching, Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Hour 10 [AUC (0-10)] at Day 7</measure>

    <description>Ocular itching was assessed by the subject with both eyes rated together and scored on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (incapacitating itch with irresistible urge to rub). AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule with unequal intervals as determined by the assessment time points. Change was calculated as AUC(0-10)[Day 7] - AUC(0-10) [Baseline].</description>

        <description>Ocular redness ratings were collected for nasal and temporal areas of each eye and assessed by investigational center staff using a visual scale (ie, scored by comparing the subject's eye with a series of photographs) and graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extremely severe), 0.5 unit steps permitted. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule with unequal intervals as determined by the assessment time points. Change was calculated as AUC(0-10)[Day 7] - AUC(0-10) [Baseline]. Both eyes contributed to the analysis.</description>
