  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the optimal surgical approach (ventral vs dorsal)
      for patients with multi-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). There are no established
      guidelines for the management of patients with CSM, which represents the most common cause of
      spinal cord injury and dysfunction in the US and in the world.

      This study aims to test the hypothesis that ventral surgery is associated with superior Short
      Form-36 physical component Score (SF-36 PCS) outcome at one year follow-up compared to dorsal
      approaches and that both ventral and dorsal surgery improve symptoms of spinal cord
      dysfunction measured using the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association Score (mJOA). A
      secondary hypothesis is that health resource utilization for ventral surgery, dorsal fusion,
      and laminoplasty surgery are different. A third hypothesis is that cervical sagittal balance
      post-operatively is a significant predictor of SF-36 PCS outcome.

      Patients' images will be transmitted electronically (without identifying information) to a
      group of 15 CSM surgeon investigators for their expert opinion. They will provide their
      opinion on surgical strategy. Equipoise for randomization will be established using this
      spinal experts network polling mechanism.

      If randomized, the patient will be randomized to one of the two treatment approaches - either
      Ventral (front) (treatment A) or Dorsal (back) (treatment B) approach. If randomized to
      treatment A (front surgery), the patient will receive decompression/fusion from the front of
      the neck. If randomized to treatment B (dorsal/back surgery), then the patient and their
      surgeon will select which posterior procedure they will receive (either dorsal
      decompression/fusion or dorsal laminoplasty).

      Treatment A: Decompression/fusion from the front of the neck.

      Treatment B: Dorsal/posterior neck surgery (one of the two surgical procedures listed below):

      Dorsal decompression/fusion or dorsal laminoplasty (no fusion)

      Functional outcomes will be determined using well-known quantitative scales (SF-36, Oswestry
      Neck Disability Index (NDI), mJOA, and EuroQol-5D). These instruments will be administered
      pre-op, 3 months, 6 months, and at 1 year. Additionally, functional outcomes instruments
      (SF-36, Oswestry Neck Disability Index, and EuroQol-5D) will be collected annually at years
      2,3,4 and 5.

      Pre-op imaging will include a cervical MRI and cervical CT as well as cervical
      flexion/extension films and standing cervical-thoracic-lumbar-sacral x-ray . A cervical MRI
      will be performed at 3 months. At 1 year (randomized patients only) will undergo cervical
      flexion/ extension xrays and standing cervical-thoracic-lumbar-sacral x-ray . A cervical CT
      will be performed only if the Oswestry NDI score is &gt; 30.
