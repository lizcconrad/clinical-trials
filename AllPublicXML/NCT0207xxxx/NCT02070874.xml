  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in isolated rural settings often lack easy access to pain care and specialist
      services. Yet rural residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to be older; be
      in poorer overall health; suffer from more chronic or serious illnesses and disabilities; be
      uninsured or underinsured; and live in poverty. Telehealth is an emerging method of health
      care delivery that has been found useful and effective in many clinical settings and
      specialties. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and increase access to
      specialist care in rural settings. The investigators propose a cluster randomized clinical
      trial design to test the effects of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care pain-management
      program for 240 patients and 40 providers in rural health care settings. The proposed program
      will provide services to both patients and providers: Patients will conduct self-assessments
      and report pain and other symptoms via telehealth. Health care providers will receive
      telehealth-delivered case consultations that will include case management, evidence-based
      practice resources, and peer support. Providers and their patients will be randomly assigned
      to intervention groups, which receive the telehealth-enhanced palliative care pain-management
      intervention, or to control groups. The investigators primary aim is to compare patient
      self-reports of pain and quality of life in the intervention and control groups over 2
      months. Aim 2 is to examine, in the intervention and control groups over 2 months, providers'
      knowledge and attitudes regarding pain and perceived competence in treating pain. Aim 3 is to
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. The investigators will use
      mixed effects models with patients nested within providers to evaluate the effect of the
      intervention on study outcomes. Findings from this study will be instrumental in advancing
      telehealth and improving pain management and palliative care among underserved rural
      populations.
