    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and effectiveness, as measured by changes in
      pain, disability, patient satisfaction, and claudicatory symptoms, at 6 months following
      treatment with the Totalis™ Direct Decompression System or Sham Surgery in patients with
      lumbar spinal stenosis
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects suffering from symptoms of neurogenic intermittent claudication secondary to a
      radiographically-confirmed diagnosis of central canal stenosis, with or without mild or
      moderate lateral recess stenosis, at one or two levels from L1 to L5 who meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, including ≥6 months of non-operative management.

      Patients included in the clinical investigation will return for follow-up visits at 1 week
      for safety evaluation, and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months
      post-treatment to collect data for evaluation of safety and effectiveness.
