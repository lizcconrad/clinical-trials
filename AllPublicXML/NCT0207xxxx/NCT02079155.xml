  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial compares a recently developed technique, called robotic
      laparoendoscopic single-site radical prostatectomy (R-LESS RP), to the current standard of
      robotic technique for prostate cancer, robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in
      treating patients with newly diagnosed, locally confined prostate cancer. Both procedures are
      types of robotic radical prostatectomy, or the robot-assisted removal of the prostate though
      a small incision in the belly. In the standard approach, 4-5 small (1-2 cm) incisions are
      made in the lower abdomen to allow the insertion of robotic instruments. In the R-LESS
      technique, all instruments are inserted through a single incision. R-LESS RP is less invasive
      than RALP and may leave a smaller scar and cause less pain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pain and analgesic requirement of R-LESS RP compared to standard RALP.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to oral intake. II. Time to resume ambulation. III. Hospital stay, counted in whole
      days from the day of surgery to the day of discharge.

      IV. Perioperative parameters, including: operative time (defined as time elapsed from skin
      incision to placement of the final skin suture); estimated blood loss; additional ports;
      conversion to standard RALP (in R-LESS RP patients), or laparoscopic, or open surgery; length
      of stay.

      V. Intraoperative complications. VI. Postoperative complications, recorded according to the
      Clavien classification.

      VII. Body image perception, measured using the body image questionnaire (BIQ). VIII. Scar
      evaluation (at suture removal and at 6 month) by using a validated assessment tool, the
      Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.

      IX. Health related quality of life, measured as patients' perception of functioning,
      disability, and well-being related to the following eight concepts: physical functioning,
      role limitations caused by physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality,
      social functioning, role limitation caused by emotional problems, and mental health.

      X. Urinary continence, assessing the number of pads used daily. XI. Erectile Function,
      assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard RALP.

      ARM II: Patients undergo R-LESS RP.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Compared using the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Assessed at suture removal and at 6 months. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale consists of two scales: the observer scale and the patient scale. Both scales contain 6 items that are scored numerically. Each of the six items on both scales has a 10-step score, with 10 indicating the worst imaginable scar or sensation. The total score of both scales consists of adding the scores of each of the six items (range, 6 to 60). The lowest score, 6, reflects normal skin, whereas the highest score, 60, reflects the worst imaginable scar.</description>
