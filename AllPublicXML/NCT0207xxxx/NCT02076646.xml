    <textblock>
      A prospective, open-label, multi-center, Phase I/II dose escalation study in which cohorts of
      3-6 patients with metastatic melanoma will be assigned to receive escalating doses of L19-IL2
      in combination with a fixed dose of Dacarbazine.

      After definition of MTD and RD during the phase II part of this study, 60 patients with Stage
      IV M1a and M1b melanoma will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive open label the
      combination treatment at the RD (Arm 1) or DTIC monotherapy (Arm 2).
