      The aim of the proposed project is to identify an optimal implementation strategy using a set
      of evidence-based interventions that aim to increase early detection of breast, prostate, and
      colorectal cancer among African Americans as a model. These three interventions will be
      packaged and interwoven into a single branded project, Project HEAL (Health through Early
      Awareness and Learning) which will be delivered through trained Community Health Advisors
      (CHA) in African-American church settings. The implementation and sustainability will be
      evaluated using the RE-AIM Framework. Fourteen African American churches in Prince George's
      County, MD will be randomized to a traditional classroom training approach or an online
      training approach, in which the CHA training approach and level of technical assistance is
      varied (in-person classroom training of CHAs + monitoring/evaluation + technical assistance
      and training vs. online training of CHAs + monitoring and evaluation only, respectively). By
      varying the training methodology and level of technical assistance, we will be able to
      determine what level of technical assistance leads to successful implementation and
      sustainability. We will also identify church organizational capacity characteristics that
      lead to successful implementation and sustainability. The specific aims of this research are
      to: (1) Package the three interventions into a single branded project (Project HEAL), develop
      a local cancer screening resource guide, and pilot test the materials and training. (2)
      Implement Project HEAL in 14 churches in Prince George's County, Maryland. We will evaluate
      the implementation outcomes involving treatment fidelity and identify church organizational
      capacity characteristics that led to successful implementation. We will compare the two
      implementation strategies (traditional vs. online) to determine the optimal level of
      technical assistance necessary for successful implementation. (3) Evaluate the sustainability
      of Project HEAL over a two-year period of time. We will identify church organizational
      capacity characteristics that led to sustainability, and compare the two implementation
      strategies (traditional vs. online) to determine the optimal level of technical assistance
      for successful sustainability.
