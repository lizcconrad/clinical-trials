      The purpose of the study is to examine cognitive and brain function in stage I-III breast
      cancer patients who have undergone adjuvant systemic therapy (chemotherapy or chemotherapy
      plus anti-hormonal therapy) in comparison to a group of healthy controls.

      Our hypothesis is that systemic adjuvant therapy in the form of chemotherapy or chemotherapy
      and anti-hormonal therapy given to primary breast cancer patients can cause cognitive
      impairment. We hypothesize that the use of simultaneous PET/MRI will allow us to determine
      key regions in the brain that show metabolic, structural, and functional deficits in a
      semi-quantitative manner and reveal subtle changes that are often missed during
      neuropsychological tests due to the low sensitivity of neuropsychological batteries.

      Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women worldwide, with a lifetime risk of 7-8%
      in women and incidence rates ranging from 19.3-89.7 per 100,000 women in developing and
      developed countries. More than 1,383,500 cases of invasive breast cancer are estimated to be
      diagnosed worldwide,and approximately 1490 women were diagnosed to have breast cancer in
      Singapore every year. However, the mortality rates are lesser at 6-19 per 100,000 women
      because of the more favourable survival of breast cancer in high-incidence developed regions.
      In Southeast Asian Chinese 5-year overall survival is about 75.8%, although lower for Indians
      and Malays at 68% and 58.5% respectively. These improving outcomes are largely due to earlier
      detection and the availability of more successful treatment options. With rising prevalence
      of this disease and improving survivorship, the long term effects of current treatment
      options are becoming increasingly survivorship issues.An early Early Breast Trialists'
      Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analyses, reported that adjuvant chemotherapy produces an
      absolute 10-year survival improvement of 7-11% for those &lt; 50 years of age, and 2- 3% for
      those aged 50 -69 years. This benefit was most recently confirmed by an update which reported
      that adjuvant chemotherapy trials demonstrated recurrence and mortality reductions compared
      to no-chemotherapy trials.Hence, chemotherapy remains an important strategy in the adjuvant
      setting. However, several studies have reported reduced cognitive function in a proportion of
      breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, also known as the &quot;chemobrain&quot; effect. In
      these patients, cognitive impairments ranging from deficits in memory, attention,
      concentration, executive and psychomotor functioning to deficits in nearly all cognitive
      domains have been reported. Other studies however have disputed this association, and it thus
      remains unclear if cognitive impairment is indeed a potential risk of systemic treatment.
      There are a number of difference adjuvant chemotherapy regimens which comprise anthracyclines
      and/or taxanes in various regimens. An adjuvant regimen utilising weekly paclitaxel after
      standard doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide has been shown to improve disease-free and overall
      survival over 3-weekly taxanes given after the same standard anthracycline-based regimen In
      order to minimise heterogeneity, this study will only recruit patients utilising this
      adjuvant chemotherapy regimen.Anti-hormonal therapy has become a mainstay in the adjuvant
      treatment of hormone receptor-positive patients. Tamoxifen for 5 years reduces recurrence
      rates throughout the first 10 years (RR 0路53 during years 0-4 and RR 0路68 [0路06] during years
      5-9 [both 2p&lt;0路00001]; and breast cancer mortality by about a third throughout the first 15
      years. In addition, the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in post-menopausal breast cancers
      has been reported to confer a significant 2.9% decrease in recurrence compared with tamoxifen
      (9.6% for AI v 12.6% for tamoxifen; 2P &lt; .00001) and a non-significant absolute 1.1% decrease
      in breast cancer mortality (4.8% for AI v 5.9% for tamoxifen; 2P = .1) in a recent
      meta-analyses by Dowsett et al.Compared to chemotherapy, there is a relative paucity of data
      pertaining to endocrine therapy-induced cognitive changes. Nonetheless, there have been
      several pertinent studies examining datasets within the larger context of pre-existing large
      multicenter adjuvant hormonal therapy trials which are outlined below.A growing body of
      literature suggests that adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer may be associated with
      cognitive impairment, which may persist for years and can impair decision-making abilities
      and disrupt the ability of women to fulfill family, career, and community
      responsibilities.The magnitude of these deficits may be moderated by depression, anxiety,
      fatigue, concomitant medications, genetics, education, intelligence, and menopause.Studies
      associating cognitive changes with chemotherapy had been reported since the mid 1970s;but
      systematic research did not come about until the mid 1990's to early 2000's.However, early
      studies were limited by lack of a pre-treatment assessment, the importance of which is
      illustrated by a study by Wefel et al.This was one of the first prospective longitudinal
      studies comparing pre- and post-treatment cognitive measures. Although there were no mean
      differences between patients who received 5- fluorouracil/doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide (FAC)
      chemotherapy and normal controls, intra-individual analyses in patients demonstrated a 61%
      cognitive decline for learning, attention and processing speed. Without a baseline
      assessment, 46% of patients who had normal post-treatment scores would have their cognitive
      impairments missed, highlighting that cognitive dysfunctions can be subtle and small
      differences may be clinically significant. Furthermore, although acute cognitive changes
      during chemotherapy are common,long-term post-treatment cognitive changes seem to persist in
      only 17-34% of cancer survivors.Several additional longitudinal studies since then have
      assessed cancer or treatment-related cognitive difficulties using standard neuropsychological
      assessments.About 12-82% of patients had detected cognitive impairments in the domains of
      executive function, memory, psychomotor speed and attention, these being the most frequent
      measures affected. These studies used a variety of cognitive assessment tools and control
      groups, different treatment regimens and varying testing timepoints. A study comparing breast
      cancer patients, majority of which were exposed to adjuvant anthracycline and/or taxane-based
      chemotherapy, to those breast cancer patients who were chemonaive or healthy controls,
      reported the greatest deficits in processing speed and verbal ability domains for the
      chemotherapy-exposed group. Therefore, research is needed needed to look at the factors
      contributing to a decline and thereafter, a long-lasting impairment.Of interest, cognitive
      deficits have been detected in cancer patients pre-chemotherapy in several studies. For
      instance, Wefel et al described 33% of women in the current cohort exhibiting cognitive
      impairment even before systemic therapy.Another study reported a 23% impairment in cognition
      prior to adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy.These could be related to psychological
      variables such as stress, anxiety or depression, or to other factors such as differing
      socioeconomic, educational or intrinsic cognitive levels. Research is needed to look at the
      factors contributing to a decline and thereafter, a long-lasting impairment. These data also
      suggest that systemic therapy-associated cognitive changes need to be examined within the
      broader context of risk factors and biological processes associated with cancer
      development.Inclusion of assessments of confounding factors which could play a role in
      influencing cognitive function is vital. Fan et al in their study reported that fatigue,
      menopausal symptoms and cognitive were important adverse effects of chemotherapy that
      improved in most patient over a period of 1-2 years.In comparison, hormonal therapy had
      minimal impact on them. Self-perceived cognitive deficits may not be reflective of objective
      test scores and hence is interesting to evaluate. In a population-based study in Denmark
      consisting of women &lt;60 years old who received adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy or
      tamoxifen compared with healthy controls, it was shown that the patients were up to 3 times
      more likely than healthy controls to rate themselves cognitively impaired at 6 months,
      although neuropsychological tests did not reveal any evident or consistent pattern of
      cognitive change in any of the patient groups.Most clinical data on cognitive function and
      anti-hormonal therapy have been on selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) such as
      tamoxifen, although focus on aromatase inhibitors has been increasing in recent years. A
      substudy (designated the CoSTAR trial) pooled subjects from the pre-existing National
      Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR)
      randomizing women =35 years old with increased risk of breast cancer by Gail model evaluation
      to either tamoxifen or raloxifene.The substudy required women to perform an 83-minute
      standardized test battery covering multiple domains. Outcomes on cognitive testing were
      similar in both groups. In the landmark NSABP Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) which
      included 13,388 women at increased breast cancer risk, treatment with 5 years of tamoxifen
      resulted in a reduced risk of breast cancer by 49% relative to placebo.A separate report
      documented results of the P-1 Symptom Checklist assessment encompassing a few self-report
      domains spanning cognition, musculoskeletal pain, vasomotor symptoms, nausea, sexual
      problems, bladder problems, body image and vaginal symptoms.The cognitive assessment included
      questions related to concentration, forgetfulness, avoidance of social affairs, and tendency
      towards accidents. There was little difference in cognitive dysfunction between groups.
      Notably, for these 2 studies, evaluation was conducted during the period of active therapy.
      To address this issue, a study by Paganini-Hill et al in a population-based case-control
      study examined 1163 women between 55-75 years old diagnosed with primary breast
      cancer.Previous tamoxifen users were classified as short-term users (&lt;4 years) or long-term
      users (=6 years) and were compared with never users. Women who had used tamoxifen for 4-5
      years had more memory problems reported to their physician compared to never users (3.8% vs
      1.5%, p=0.04), especially for women currently on tamoxifen. However, no differences were seen
      among never and past users suggesting limited long-term sequelae. Even among the
      premenopausal population on tamoxifen, significantly lower processing speeds which appeared
      to interfere with executive functioning have been reported in a cross-sectional study
      comparing women on adjuvant tamoxifen to healthy controls.Clinical data on the effects of
      aromatase inhibitors on cognitive function are emerging. The largest dataset comes from the
      International Breast Intervention Study II (IBIS II) studying postmenopausal women at
      increased risk of breast cancer receiving either anastrozole or placebo for 5 years, testing
      being done at 0, 6 and 24 months. No differences in cognitive function between the 2 groups
      were detected. However the neurocognitive testing was done during the period of treatment as
      in other previously described studies and in a postmenopausal hypoestrogenic population. As
      such, the effects of AIs could have been blunted.In a substudy of the Anastrazole, Tamoxifen
      and Combined (ATAC) trial which recruited patients with localized breast cancer to adjuvant
      tamoxifen, anastrozole or combination therapy, 94 patients from the ATAC trial were compared
      to 35 non-cancer controls. Their mean length of study time was 36 months. The patient group
      was significantly impaired compared to the control group on measures of verbal memory
      (p=0.026) and processing speed (p=0.032). Comparisons between anastrozole and tamoxifen have
      been done in a cross-sectional and longitudinal study, both of which demonstrated the
      anastrozole exposed group experiencing worse cognitive impairments.There were poorer verbal
      and visual learning and memory in the study by Bender et al,44 while the prospective
      longitudinal study showed a nine-fold and five-fold increase in risk of cognitive decline in
      the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups respectively relative to healthy controls; the most
      common domains affected being processing speed and verbal memory.A neuropsychological
      substudy was carried out from the pivotal Tamoxifen and Exemestane Multinational (TEAM) trial
      which randomized patients to adjuvant exemestane for 5 years or adjuvant tamoxifen for 2.5-3
      years followed by exemestane for 2-2.5 years .The neuropsychological assessment was carried
      out pre-endocrine therapy and after a year of treatment, and included 80 tamoxifen and 99
      exemestane users. Interestingly, exemestane users did not perform statistically worse than
      healthy controls on any cognitive domain, but tamoxifen users had significantly worse verbal
      memory and executive functioning compared to healthy controls, and significantly worse
      information processing speed compared to exemestane users. However, it has been postulated
      that exemestane's mildly androgenic properties may ultimately preserve cognition.A recent
      cognitive testing report of the Breast International Group (BIG)1-98 study randomizing women
      to adjuvant monotherapy of tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years, or sequential therapy with
      letrozole followed by tamoxifen or vice versa revealed that women taking letrozole in the 5th
      year had better overall cognitive function than those taking tamoxifen (p=0.04).A significant
      improvement in composite cognitive function for both groups was observed in years 5-6 when
      treatment was ceased. In summary, with repect to AIs, a greater cognitive decline has been
      observed with anastrozole as compared to tamoxifen, while a lesser decline is seen with
      exemestane and letrozole.Larger studies are clearly need to validate these findings. Results
      from many of these studies need to be interpreted cautiously, as there have been various
      limitations in studies pertaining to this field. Many studies have been hampered by a variety
      of inherent methodological problems. These include lack of a baseline assessment, lack of a
      longitudinal design, and failure to control for physical and psychosocial confounding factors
      such as hormonal factors, depression, anxiety, fatigue and educational level.Furthermore,
      studies have also differed considerably with respect to regimens and doses of chemotherapy
      received, previous exposure to anti-hormonal therapy and length of time post-treatment. In
      addition, a limitation of several studies is the lack of pre-treatment evaluations of
      cognitive function.This is especially problematic because it makes it impossible to determine
      whether deficits were present before treatment or to detect changes from baseline. The timing
      of cognitive function assessment after the completion of therapy was also not uniform. Most
      studies lacked non-treated comparison groups and failed to measure potential moderators of
      cognitive function. Several studies failed to include a comprehensive assessment of the
      multiple domains of cognitive function, and occasionally relied on the use of a self-report
      questionnaire. Importantly, cognitive studies in the Asian population have been grossly
      limited. Certain biological pathways, genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic changes could lead
      to alterations in cognitive functioning in only a subgroup of people exposed to chemotherapy.
      For example, several genetic polymorphisms of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) have been
      identified that may influence P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function, one of the most studied
      polymorphisms being C3435T in exon26.P-gp which is present in the blood brain barrier affects
      the amount of drug uptake into the brain by actively transporting them out of the cells.
      Polymorphisms associated with lower expression or functionality of P-gp may cause increased
      vulnerability to chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes. Oxidative stress is the most
      frequent cause of DNA damage in neuronal cells, and has been associated with various
      neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. DNA damage and
      repair systems have been linked to neurodegeneration such as in ataxia telengectasia and
      xeroderma pigmentosum. So far the relation of cognitive functions to the level of DNA damage
      post-chemotherapy has not been well studied. As mentioned, certain studies have detected
      higher than expected rates of cognitive impairment pre-chemotherapy. In addition higher
      levels of oxidative DNA damage have been found in women with breast cancer.These data are
      consistent with research linking certain DNA repair polymorphisms with a decreased DNA repair
      capacity and thus an increased cancer risk. Hence, changes in cognitive function following
      chemotherapy can be evaluated within the context of genetic factors that increase cancer risk
      but also increase risk of cognitive dysfunction pre-treatment. Certain polymorphisms in the
      base-excision pathway may also be worthwhile studying because of their importance in
      modulating oxidative stress and cancer risk.Cytokines play a role in central nervous system
      function, including modulation of neuronal and glial cell functioning, neural repair and
      metabolism of dopamine and serotonin, which are important neurotransmitters for cognition.
      Longitudinal studies of interferon-a and IL2 in cancer populations have shown decrements in
      cognitive performance, particularly in the domains of information processing speed, executive
      function, spatial ability and reaction time.Both chemotherapy and persistent fatigue have
      been linked to increased cytokine levels.Genetic polymorphisms have been identified that
      influence cytokine activity and are associated with Alzheimer's disease and depression.
      However, so far the relationships between these polymorphisms and chemotherapy-induced
      cognitive changes have not been well studied. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) valine
      genotype has been linked to chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment in breast cancer
      survivors and is worthwhile of further study. Chemotherapy in mouse models has also been
      demonstrated to decrease hippocampal cell proliferation, increase histone acetylation and
      decrease histone deacetylase activity. Hence, it would therefore be relevant to study the
      particular candidate mechanisms which are likely to influence cognitive changes in certain
      susceptible individuals. Inclusion of assessments of confounding factors which could play a
      role in influencing cognitive function is vital. Fan et al in their study reported that
      fatigue, menopausal symptoms and cognitive were important adverse effects of chemotherapy
      that improved in most patient over a period of 1-2 years. In comparison, hormonal therapy had
      minimal impact on them.But, even with the use of increasingly sophisticated performance-based
      assessments, subtle differences are often being missed along with the obscurity of the neural
      circuits and structures underlying the cognitive changes. For this reason, neuro-imaging
      tools have gained advantage because they provide the opportunity to examine the effects of
      chemotherapy on brain and cognition. However, such studies have been very limited in the
      field and therefore the need for further brain imaging studies. MRI has emerged as a
      noninvasive method with the potential to produce high resolution and contrast images of the
      brain. From the anatomical findings, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with long-term
      injury to white matter and also damage to gray matter with associated functional deficits. An
      early study by Inagaki et al. comparing 51 adjuvant chemotherapy treated breast cancer
      patients with 55 patients who did not receive chemotherapy, showed that chemotherapy patients
      had smaller volumes in key areas involved in cognitive processing. The patients showed a
      strong positive correlation between volume loss and performance on the WMSR (Wechsler Memory
      Scale Revised) test of attention and memory. A serious weakness of this study was the failure
      to consider the effect of adjuvant endocrine therapy and the lack of prechemotherapy baseline
      assessment. Only three studies to date have investigated the integrity of white matter tracts
      and structural connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Results revealed structural
      neural changes over time as well as indicated region specific differences inherent to most of
      the cognitive deficits.The corpus callosum, an area important for communication between
      hemispheres, exhibited reduced white matter integrity which may explain the reduced
      processing speed reported in the chemotherapy-treated patients. The effect of endocrine
      treatment was not considered in the analysis which provides a drawback for proper
      interpretation. Another study showed decreased Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in frontal and
      temporal white matter tracts as well as increased Mean Diffusivity (MD) in frontal white
      matter. A significant correlation was also seen between the FA scores and the
      neuropsychological tests (attention and processing speed) in the chemotherapy-treated
      patients. White matter organization, particularly in the frontal, parietal and occipital
      white matter tracts, was negatively impacted by chemotherapy and this correlated strongly
      with cognitive functioning scores. This suggests that microstructural white matter changes or
      abnormalities may underlie reported cognitive dysfunctions found in chemotherapy treated
      cancer patients, especially that cerebral white matter is vulnerable to neurotoxins.In
      addition to the small number of structural imaging studies, a limited number of functional
      imaging studies have assessed neural changes in chemotherapy treated cancer patients.
      Combining the anatomical/structural assessment with functional imaging techniques provides a
      wider window of evaluation onto the functional changes associated with such cognitive
      deficits. To understand the underlying functional changes associated with poor executive
      function and processing in chemotherapy patients, a study by Saykin et al was one of the
      first to incorporate working memory assessments with functional MRI readouts. This was one of
      the first prospective longitudinal studies comparing pre- and post-treatment on a working
      memory N-back task. Although the authors reported no group differences in task performance
      with the expected main effect of working memory load on performance at baseline, patients
      assessed one month post-chemotherapy showed increased activation in posterior frontal and
      parietal regions compared to controls with less bilateral activity in more anterior frontal
      regions. This study illustrates that the cognitive changes associated with chemotherapy may
      be too subtle to reliably be detected with standard neuropsychologial assessments and
      underscore the importance of and potential for using functional MRI to elucidate underlying
      neurobiological changes.Interestingly, while investigating declarative memory in 14 breast
      cancer patients three years following chemotherapy, patients showed less activity in
      bilateral frontal gyri and postcentral gyrus with greater activation in parahippocampal,
      bilateral cerebellum, cingulate and precuneus while exhibiting normal cognitive assessment
      and cortisol levels (a measure of distress) compared to control. The increased activation in
      several brain areas compared to controls indicates that patients required greater and more
      global neural effort than controls when attempting to recall task information. More
      interestingly, this study showed that the type of chemotherapy regimen contributed to
      differential patient verbal memory impairments; CMF treated patients showed lower prefrontal
      cortex activity during encoding compared to patients on the
      adriamycine/cyclophosphamide/taxol regimen. This indeed highlights the importance of
      distinguishing between different types of chemotherapy treatment. Although functional MRI is
      the gold standard for evaluation of brain function, it is an indirect measure and functional
      readouts do not represent the underlying neuronal mechanisms involved. Other methods have
      been investigated to assess mere brain activity and more directly detect the underlying
      mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in chemotherapy patients. Only two PET (Positron Emission
      Tomography) imaging studies have been conducted to date. A recent study was conducted in 5
      year post-chemotherapy patients. Patients exhibited lower resting metabolism in the frontal
      cortex and basal ganglia. A major drawback of this study was the lack of baseline assessment
      and the inhomogeneous study group where eight of the patients were on tamoxifen
      treatment.Another PET/CT study to assess brain metabolism after chemotherapy in 128 patients
      is still ongoing.Results from many of these studies need to be interpreted cautiously, as
      there have been various limitations in studies pertaining to this field. Many studies have
      been hampered by a variety of inherent methodological problems. These include lack of a
      baseline assessment, lack of a longitudinal design, and failure to control for physical and
      psychosocial confounding factors such as hormonal factors, depression, anxiety, fatigue and
      educational level. Furthermore, studies have also differed considerably with respect to
      regimens and doses of chemotherapy received, previous exposure to anti-hormonal therapy and
      length of time post-treatment. In addition, a limitation of several studies is the lack of
      pre-treatment evaluations of cognitive function. This is especially problematic because it
      makes it impossible to determine whether deficits were present before treatment or to detect
      changes from baseline. The timing of cognitive function assessment after the completion of
      therapy was also not uniform. Most studies lacked non-treated comparison groups and failed to
      measure potential moderators of cognitive function. Several studies failed to include a
      comprehensive assessment of the multiple domains of cognitive function, and occasionally
      relied on the use of a self-report questionnaire. Importantly, cognitive studies in the Asian
      population have been grossly limited. Taking these shortcomings into consideration, we
      designed a study intended to minimise biases mentioned as above. The chemotherapy regimen
      utilised will be limited to that of anthracyclines and taxanes; specifically we will use
      patients given doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) for 4 cycles followed by weekly paclitaxel
      for 12 cycles as per the adjuvant breast cancer study by Sparano et al as this is the
      chemotherapy regimen most commonly used in our division. Furthermore, we will have a baseline
      pre-treatment assessment for both CANTAB and imaging assessments, a longitudinal study
      design, and a more uniform evaluation taking 6 months and one year post-chemotherapy or after
      starting one year of anti-hormonal therapy as a cut-off point for CANTAB and imaging
      assessments. We will also attempt to minimize biases by analyzing confounders such as
      anxiety, depression and hormonal fluctuations using questionnaires and also recruit a control
      group of healthy subjects with similar age, gender and social background.

    <description>We hope to gain a better understanding of the complex and currently poorly understood relationship between chemotherapy/anti-hormonal therapy and possible cognitive decline in patients undergoing such therapy. In current practice, a large number of patients with primary breast cancer are offered adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, followed by hormonal therapy in patients whose tumours are hormone receptor-positive. The management of many adverse effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea, vomiting and febrile neutropenia has improved, and concern has shifted to more subtle and potentially chronic problems such as cognitive dysfunction, which may affect patients' quality of life.</description>
