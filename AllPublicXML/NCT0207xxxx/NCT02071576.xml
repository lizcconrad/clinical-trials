    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects have to be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subjects have to be able to read, understand, and sign a statement of Informed
             Consent.

          -  Subjects have to be willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations
             for up to 6 and 12 months respectively after surgery.

          -  Corneal topography should be qualified

          -  High contrast, manifest, best spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity correctable
             binocular to at least 1.0 (Snellen 20/20 or 6/6) and monocular to at least 0.8
             (Snellen 20/25 or 6/7.5). In case of a monocular surgery the eye which should not be
             treated must have a best corrected distance visual acuity of at least 0.8 (Snellen
             20/25 or 6/7.5).

          -  Mesopic pupil size measured with the Zywave II WaveFront Aberrometer must be &lt; 7.0 mm
             and photopic pupil size measured with the Orbscan II/ IIz must be &gt; 2.9 mm.

          -  Myopic subjects require a sphere between -0.5 D up to -10.0 D and cylinder between
             -0.5 D up to -4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to -12.0 D

          -  Hyperopic subjects require a sphere between +0.5 D up to +4.0 D and cylinder between
             +0.5 D up to +4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to +6.0 D.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of
             remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.

          -  Hyperopic eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a
             difference of greater than ± 0.75 D in sphere power, or a difference of greater than ±
             0.50 D in cylinder power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees
             compared to the baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of
             less than ±0.75 D, the differ-ence in cylinder axis would not be taken into
             consideration.

          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts,
             which in the Investigator's opinion would interfere with best spectacle-corrected
             visual acuity or a successful treatment.

          -  Subjects with evidence of retinal vascular disease. Subjects with any residual,
             recurrent, or active ocular disease, or corneal abnormality that in the Investigator's
             opinion would interfere with BSCVA or a successful treatment.

          -  Subjects with signs of keratoconus or Subjects with unstable central keratometry
             readings with irregular mires.

          -  Subjects who had previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind, including any
             type of Excimer laser surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes.

          -  Subjects who have a history of Herpes simplex or Herpes zoster keratitis or history of
             glaucoma or glaucoma suspect, corneal edema, or increased IOP &gt; 22mmHg or risk for
             angle closure.

          -  Subjects immunocompromised or carrying diagnosis of connective tissue disease,
             clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other acute
             or chronic illnesses that will increase the risk to the subject or confound the
             outcomes of this study.

          -  Subject taking systemic medications likely to affect wound healing such as
             corticosteroids or antimetabolites.

          -  Subjects who are known to be pregnant, lactating, or who plans to become pregnant over
             the course of the study.

          -  Subjects with an ocular muscle disorder including a strabismus or nystagmus, or other
             disorders affecting fixation.

          -  Subjects with cognitive impairments or other vulnerable persons.
