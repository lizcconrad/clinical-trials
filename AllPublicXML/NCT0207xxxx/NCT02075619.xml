    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-centre, randomized, single dose, three-way crossover, six
      sequence study to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of two Fixed Dose Combination
      (FDC) tablet formulations of amlodipine and rosuvastatin relative to innovator samples under
      fasting conditions, in healthy adult subjects. Subjects will be 12 Chinese and 12 Caucasian
      subjects living in Singapore. The randomisation will be stratified by ethnicity to ensure an
      equal number of subjects will be assigned to each dosing sequence. Subjects will receive each
      of the following three treatments administered in a randomized three-way crossover design: a
      reference treatment consisting of a single 10mg amlodipine tablet and 20mg rosuvastatin
      tablet ; a single fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 10mg amlodipine and 20mg
      rosuvastatin (Test Formulation - FDC 1); and another single fixed dose combination tablet
      consisting of 10mg amlodipine and 20mg rosuvastatin (Test Formulation - FDC 2). Two test
      formulations have same active pharmaceutical ingredients (amlodipine and rosuvastatin), same
      doses and different inactive ingredients. Each subject will participate in three treatment
      periods. The study consists of a screening phase, three treatment periods and a follow-up
      visit. The three treatment periods will be separated by a washout period of 12-17 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 21 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin &lt;=1.5x upper limit of
             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology and measurements. Single corrected QT
             interval (QTc) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec). In particular QTc &lt;450 msec or QT &lt;480 msec
             in subjects with Bundle Branch Block based on an average from three ECGs obtained over
             a brief recording period.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             which is / are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;
             for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the Investigator's review
             of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal
             interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or postmenopausal
             defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample
             with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milli-international units per
             milliliter (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picograms per milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole
             per liter) is confirmatory]; On hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use a protocol approved contraception method if
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most
             forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the
             blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the
             study without use of a contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential with negative
             pregnancy test as determined by serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test
             at the screening or prior to dosing and agrees to use one of the contraception methods
             for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or the
             Investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 14 days
             after last dose of amlodipine/rosuvastatin, i.e. after single dose of treatment period
             3.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraceptive methods and not to donate sperm. These criteria must be followed
             from the time of the first dose of study medication until the follow-up contact visit.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5 - 29.9
             kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Chinese or Caucasian self-reported by the subjects for both parents and all 4
             grandparents. The ethnic group is as defined by National Registration Identity Cards
             provided additional confirmation of ethnicity.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

             standard drinks a day for a woman, and more than 3 drinks a day (about 30 gram [g] of
             alcohol) for a man, and more than 4 days per week. One standard drink contains 10g of
             pure alcohol and is equivalent to a can of beer (220 milliliter [mL]), 1 glass of wine
             (100mL), or 1 nip (30mL) of spirits.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A systolic blood pressure &lt;95 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) or a recent history of

             in excess of 450mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.
