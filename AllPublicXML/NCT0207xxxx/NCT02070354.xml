  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how bariatric surgery affects physical
      activity and nutrient intake.

      This research study is being done because the investigators want to determine better
      recommendations to provide to bariatric surgery patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a two-pronged study. The first phase is a cross-sectional study design meaning each
      participant will only be tested once. The investigators wish to test patients from each of
      the groups listed below to determine CR fitness, activity level, and nutrient intake. The
      investigators wish to determine if any improvements from bariatric surgery can be maintained
      over a 2-year period following surgery. If this is the case, our next project will be to
      track the patients recruited at their new visit longitudinally at all of the five time points
      listed below.

        1. New visit with GI Nutrition

        2. 1 month prior to bariatric surgery (at the time of the patient's initial visit with the
           surgeon (6-7 months after their new visit))

        3. 6 months after bariatric surgery

        4. 12 months after bariatric surgery

        5. 24 months after bariatric surgery
