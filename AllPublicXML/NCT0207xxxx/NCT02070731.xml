      A randomized evaluation of the TriGuard™ HDH embolic deflection device during transcatheter
      aortic valve implantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TriGuard HDH device is an aortic embolism deflection device intended to reduce the amount
      of embolic material that may enter the carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries during
      transcatheter heart valve implantation.

      To assess the safety, efficacy, and performance of the TriGuard HDH embolic deflection device
      in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), in comparison with
      patients undergoing unprotected TAVI.

      Subjects with indications for TAVI and who meet study eligibility criteria will be randomized
      1:1 to one of two treatment arms:

        -  Intervention - TAVI with the TriGuard HDH embolic deflection device

        -  Control - standard unprotected TAVI

          -  The patient is willing to comply with protocol-specified follow-up evaluations

          -  The patient, or legally authorized representative, has been informed of the nature of
             the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent,
             approved by the appropriate Medical Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review
             Board (IRB)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing TAVI via the trans-axillary, trans-subclavian, or trans-aortic
             route

          -  Patients undergoing TAVI via the transapical approach due to friable or mobile
             atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic arch

          -  Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year
             following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a

             test

          -  Patients with known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours
             preceding the index procedure (according to definition) or AMI &gt;72 hours preceding the
             index procedure, in whom creatine kinase and creatine kinase-Muscle Brain have not
             returned to within normal limits at the time of procedure.

          -  Patients with contraindication to cerebral MRI
