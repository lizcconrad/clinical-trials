      BACKROUNDS: Thumb in palm deformity restricts hand function by prevent somatosensory input in
      the children with cerebral palsy who have spasticity in their hands.

      OBJECTİVES: To investigate the effects of thenar palmar kinesiotape application with and
      without pressure on hand function in children with cerebral palsy. METHOD: 45 children were
      randomly allocated to one of the thenar taping groups either with or without pressure or to
      the control group. Nine hole peg test and nine parts puzzle test were used to measure hand
      function. The two study groups were evaluated initially, with taping 20 minutes later and 20
      minutes after taping was removed.

      children were randomly allocated to one of the thenar taping groups either with or without
      pressure or to the control group. Nine hole peg test and nine parts puzzle test were used to
      measure upper extremity function. The two study groups were evaluated initially, with taping

    <description>In the kinesiotape plus thenar pressure (PPTG). Kinesiotape was applied which controled the cortical thumb sign. In addition a piece of plastazote aiming to give thenar pressure was also applied.
The amount of pressure was regulated so that the child felt the pressure without being irritated and without restriction in grasping functions.</description>
