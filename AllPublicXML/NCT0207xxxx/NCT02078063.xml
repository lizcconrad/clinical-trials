  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of long acting reversible contraception (LARC) such as implants or intrauterine
      contraception (IUC) has been shown to reduce repeat abortions. LARCs have the advantage of
      being independent of user error and are considered to be underused, especially among young
      individuals where oral methods have high rates of user failure. IUC is often underused in
      young or nulliparous women due to fear of pain at insertion.

      10 ml of mepivacaine (10mg/ml) or 10ml of sodium hydrochloride will be injected into the
      uterine cavity through a hydrosonography catheter before the tenaculum has been applied but
      prior to sounding and to insertion of the IUC.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that instillation of 10 ml (10mg/ml) mepivacaine though a
      hydrosonography catheter prior to any instrument placement will provide more effective pain
      relief than instillation of 10 ml placebo (sodium chloride 9mg/ml).

      Primary objective: To evaluate the difference in pain score at the time of the insertion of
      the IUC between treatment and control group.

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate acceptability of the procedure.
