      This is a validation study. A stroke symptom questionnaire will be adapted and translated
      into local language. Two community health workers will be trained in its administration.
      Their findings will be validated against assessment by two neurologists.

      The study hypothesis is that the chance corrected agreement between the community worker
      administered stroke symptom questionnaire and the assessment by neurologist based on history
      and physical examination is at least moderate.

      Overall Objective: To translate, adapt and validate a stroke symptom questionnaire for
      identification of stroke symptoms by community health workers ( CHW) in a peri-urban
      Pakistani community

      Specific Aims:

        1. To translate and adapt a stroke symptom questionnaire for identification of stroke
           symptoms by community workers in a peri-urban Pakistani community

        2. To validate community workers administered stroke symptom questionnaire against
           assessment by neurologist in a peri-urban Pakistani community

        3. To determine the feasibility of utilizing community workers for identification of stroke
           patients in the community in terms of subject refusals and difficulty in understanding
           questions

      The study will be conducted at the community site of AMAN community health project in Ibrahim
      Hyderi. Community health workers will systematically select households and from them
      individuals meeting eligibility criteria will be interviewed. Community workers will
      administer stroke symptom questionnaire to them at their homes. Those unable to answer will
      have a surrogate answering for them. In the second part of the study, two neurologists will
      independently assess all individuals. The purpose of this would be to validate the findings
      of the community workers based on the stroke symptom questionnaire.
