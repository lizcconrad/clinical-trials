          -  Have a self-reported average abdominal bloating rating (&gt;3 daily ratings over the
             preceding 7 days) equal or greater than 4 on a numerical scale of 0 to 20.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a structural or metabolic disease or condition that affects the GI system,

             the protocol. Have history or presence of any chronic lung disease

          -  Have presence of hepatic dysfunction, jaundice, or abnormal serum alanine
