  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helping relationships from significant others may assist patients with chronic kidney
      diseases to exercise health behaviors. Patients will adhere on the suggestions from medical
      staff and perform health lifestyle to maintain healthy behavior. The progress of the disease
      may be delayed.

      The research is a 3-year study to explore the influence of helping relationships on healthy
      behaviors among patients with chronic kidney disease. Building on the findings from the past
      three years study and the literature on trans-theoretical Model, helping relationships will
      be articulated. A helping relation intervention will be applied to evaluate its effect on
      healthy lifestyle and quality of life.

      The first year study will be a survey design. An instrument to measure the helping
      relationship will be established and tested. Total of 200 participants will be recruited to
      test the reliability and validity of the instrument. After evaluating the psychometric
      properties of the instrument, items may be revised according to the results. The second year
      of research will be a cross-section study. Of 250 subjects will be recruited to explore the
      correlations between helping relationships, healthy life styles, and quality of life. Data
      will be analyzed using hierarchical linear regression. In the third year, an experimental
      design will be applied to test the effect of a helping relationship intervention. One hundred
      and twenty subjects will be recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental and the
      control group for 60 subjects in each group. The helping relationships intervention program
      will be implemented on the experimental group. And the control group will be provided with
      routine nursing care. Data will be collected at baseline, the sixth and the ninth month of
      the third year of study. Data will be analyzed using generalized estimating equation measures
      to evaluate the effect of the intervention program.
