  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TissueGene-C, an allogeneic human
      chondrocytes expressing Transforming Growth Factor(TGF)-b1, is effective and safe in patients
      with degenerative arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of normal chondrocyte cells and
      transduced chondrocyte cells that express growth factor to modify osteoarthritis symptom for
      long term period.

      During the Phase 3 clinical trial , we will compare TissueGene-C to placebo in 26, 52 weeks
      trial with 156 outpatients who have osteoarthritis. The outpatients are randomized to
      TissueGene-C or placebo in 1:1 ratio, and they will be monitored and recorded in terms of
      alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and the presence of adverse
      events.
