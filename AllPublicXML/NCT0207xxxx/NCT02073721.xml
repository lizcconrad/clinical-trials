      The study will be an experiment with active control, randomized, double-blind, parallel
      intervention. After met the eligibility criteria of the patients will be randomly allocated
      into two groups: Group exercises MAPs (GEX), which is the active control group and
      electrostimulation + exercises MAPs (GEEX).
