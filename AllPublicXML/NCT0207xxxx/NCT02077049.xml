      The main objective of this study is to determine whether elderly people in rehabilitation
      setting show higher adherence to self-training when using computer-based-learning games (i.e.
      the so called serious games) than when performing conventional exercises. Secondly the study
      explores to which extend balance and mobility performances vary according to the mode of
      self-training.

      The primary study hypothesis is that elderly people practice longer and more frequently with
      serious games than with a conventional exercise booklet. The secondary hypothesis is that
      patients experience a significant higher improvement in their balance capacity by using
      serious games compared to patients performing conventional exercises.

      Background:

      The Swiss population, and in Europe in general, is getting older. Due to this evolving
      demographic trend, the need to develop specific healthcare services for this age group is
      becoming crucial. From the international literature, evidence-based findings have
      demonstrated that physical abilities of elderly people can be increased, and institutional
      placement and mortality can be reduced through specific inpatient rehabilitation programs
      (Bachmann, Finger et al. 2010).

      Adults 65 years and older should carry out aerobic physical activities for at least 150
      minutes of moderate intensity or for 75 minutes of high intensity in a week. Besides it is
      strongly recommended that senior adults perform strengthening exercises minimum twice a week
      and activities promoting balance minimum thrice a week (WHO 2010; NIH 2013).

      In order to increase the training intensity and thus the independence in activities of daily
      living, older patients admitted in Kliniken Valens are instructed with a customized
      self-training program, in addition to the usual rehabilitation services. As for
      therapist-assisted sessions, this self-training program leads to significant improvement of
      patient's physical performance (Olney, Nymark et al. 2006) and represents therefore a proven,
      efficient and cost-effective intervention for inpatient settings. However, the compliance of
      elderly people to execute self-training exercises varies considerably. These programs are
      often considered as tedious and boring, and so prematurely stopped (Phillips, Schneider et
      al. 2004). An alternative to increase patient's motivation could be through serious games
      practice. Kliniken Valens has already experienced promising results with computer-based games
      such as the Nintendo Wii® (Schnurr and Oesch 2012).

      Methods:

      In this study participants are categorized in 4 strata according to their Berg Balance Score
      (BBS) (≤ 44 or ≥45) and their computer skills. Subsequently they are allocated randomly
      either in the intervention group or in the control group. In addition to the usual
      rehabilitation services provided in the clinic, participants of both groups are entitled to 2
      additional time-slots (2 x 30 min/day) devoted to self-training and this during the 10 days
      of the intervention period. This protocol ensures the same conditions for each participant to
      perform or not self-training exercises. For safety measures, participants with a low BBS
      (&lt;45) perform the program in siting, whereas those with a higher BBS (≥45) practice in
      standing position (in front of a bench). The time frame of the intervention phase (from t1 to
      t2) lasts 10 working days and starts after self-training exercises have been instructed. In
      other words, t1 equates to approximately day 4 after the patient's admission in the clinic
      and t2 is 10 working days later, i.e. approximately day 16 after admission.

      Intervention group:

      The participants are instructed by experienced physiotherapists on serious games with
      Kinect®. Additionally, participants wear the Fit Bit® (an activity tracker device) and are
      encouraged to walk and climb stairs instead of using the escalator. Finally participants are
      asked to write down in a logbook, the frequency and duration of their self-training sessions.

      Control group:

      As in the usual rehabilitation services, experienced physiotherapists arrange a customized
      self-training program, instruct the exercises and deliver a hand-out. Additionally, patients
      are encouraged to walk and climb stairs instead of using the escalator. Finally participants
      are asked to write down in a logbook, the frequency and duration of their self-training
      sessions.

      Data collection:

      Data on self-training's intensity (primary outcome) are extracted from the logbook at
      post-intervention (t2) i.e. after the 10 working days of the intervention phase. The Berg
      Balance Scale and the Falls Efficacy Scale (secondary outcomes) are completed by a blinded
      researcher at pre- and post-intervention (before t1 and after t2) i.e. approximately at day
      1-2 after admission and day 16-17 after admission.

      Data analysis:

      Data are analyzed using the statistical software for social sciences (SPSS). The statistical
      analysis of the two groups is performed following a normal distribution of data, with an
      unmatched t-test. For non-normal distributions, the Mann-Whitney U test is used.

    <description>Self-training intensity is defined as the frequency of training sessions (f) multiplied by the duration (T) of each training session. The training intensity (f x T) of the 10-days intervention are summated.
These data are recorded daily in a logbook by the patient himself from t1 (which equates to approximately day 4 after admission) till the end of the intervention (t2) i.e. 10 workings days later. The logbook is then collected for data extraction at the end of the intervention (t2), which equates to approximately day 16-17 after patient's admission in the clinic.</description>

The Berg Balance Scale is a clinical test for static and dynamic balance abilities.
