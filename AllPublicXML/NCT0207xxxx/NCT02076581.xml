  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is often difficult to quantify and distinguish aspects of abnormal muscle tone due to
      neurological injury. This makes it difficult to evaluate therapies that aim to reduce the
      effects of abnormal muscle tone. This research study will evaluate the feasibility of a
      clinician worn device to capture and quantify features of spasticity and dystonia.

    <time_frame>For each subject clinician and device data will be collected within a single session. Each session will occur over a maximum of two hours. Analysis of all of the subject data will be completed within 30 days of study completion.</time_frame>
    <description>Device measurements of clinician applied force relative to limb manipulation speed will be compared to conventional clinical outcome measures. For example, correlation between the slope of the force to speed profile and clinician evaluated spasticity, Ashworth score, will be calculated.</description>
