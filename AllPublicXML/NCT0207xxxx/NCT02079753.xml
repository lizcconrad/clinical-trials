      Introduction: Portable oxygen devices simplify and facilitate patient therapy. This study was
      designed to compare oxygen saturation and patient satisfaction with a portable oxygen
      concentrator or with a combined system consisting of a fixed device with continuous flow
      oxygen dispensation and a portable device with pulse dispensation for ambulation.

      Methods: This cross-over trial assessed 25 patients with COPD (92% men; mean age 72.2 ± 7.4
      years; mean FEV 34.14 ± 12.51%) at four hospitals in Madrid. All patients had previously used
      the combined system, consisting of a fixed oxygenation system and a portable system for
      ambulation, with 16 (64%) using stationary and portable concentrators and 9 (36%) using a
      stationary reservoir and portable liquid oxygen bag. Oxygenation settings at rest and while
      walking were determined at baseline. Patients were maintained on the previous combined system
      for one week and then switched to the portable oxygen concentrator for one week. Mean SpO2
      over 24 hours was calculated by the software in the oximeter, and compliance was monitored
