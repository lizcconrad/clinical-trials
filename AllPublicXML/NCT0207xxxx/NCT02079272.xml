  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new technique of radiotherapy for breast
      cancer (helical tomotherapy) can induce cardiac toxicity that would be detected in the first
      two years after treatment. Screening of subclinical cardiac lesions with non-invasive cardiac
      imaging techniques combined with measures of circulating biomarkers of cardiac tissue lesions
      and coronary lesions would allow assessing radiation-induced cardiac toxicity at an early
      stage.

      REBECCA study will consist in a monocentric prospective cohort that will include 120 women
      volunteers treated with adjuvant tomotherapy for breast cancer in the Institut Regaud
      Claudius-Toulouse (ICR) and followed for 2 years after radiotherapy.

      In summary, women aged between 40 and 70 years, surgically treated at ICR for breast cancer
      and for whom adjuvant radiotherapy with tomotherapy is indicated, with no indication of
      chemotherapy will be eligible for the study.

    <description>At baseline, before helical tomotherapy is performed, for each included woman will have:
measures of biomarkers of cardiac injury based on blood samples (including CRP, NT-Pro BNP, …, microparticles and miRNA)
cardiologic examination including echocardiography for measurement of strain and strain rate
a CT coronary angiogram for measurement of coronary plaque indexes
Helical tomotherapy will be performed for all women included in the cohort.
At the end of tomotherapy, follow-up will include:
measures of biomarkers: at the end of radiotherapy, 6 months and 24 months after radiotherapy
cardiologic examinations including a echocardiography 6 and 24 months after radiotherapy
A CT coronary angiogram 24 months after radiotherapy</description>
