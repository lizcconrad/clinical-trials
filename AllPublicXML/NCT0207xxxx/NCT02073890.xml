  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury is common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Incidence and
      pattern of traumatic brain injury varies in developed and developing countries. Subarachnoid
      haemorrhage refers to blood in subarachnoid space that lies between arachnoid and
      piameninges, covering brain. It is often associated with concurrent intracranial injury
      component. Individuals at higher risk for tSAH are those who are at higher risk for blunt
      head trauma. This includes adolescents, low-income individuals, men, and individuals with a
      history of substance abuse. The investigators present study aims to investigate prognostic
      factors associated with the neurological outcome among patients of post traumatic SAH.
