      The study will evaluate if administration of probiotic Culturelle (Lactobacillus Rhamnosus
      GG) along with antibiotics can help decrease the occurrence of diarrhea caused by antibiotics
      as well as Clostridium difficile Diarrhea.

      Inpatient adult males and females who are at least 18 years of age or older, undergoing
      treatment with antibiotics irrespective of indication and the type of antibiotics. The
      setting is an academic hospital.The patients are screened and potentially recruited upon
      initiation of antibiotic treatment regardless of indication for antibiotic prescription. The
      participants are patients being admitted to any inpatient units of the hospital for treatment
      with antibiotics. Exclusion criteria is:

        -  Diarrhea on admission or within the preceding week

        -  Reported recurrent diarrhea

        -  Bowel pathology that could result in diarrhea (including preexisting Inflammatory Bowel
           disease{IBD}, all forms for colitis or any other condition resulting in preexisting
           diarrhea)

        -  Intake of high risk antibiotics (clindamycin, cephalosporins, aminopenicillins→ well
           known to cause CDAD) and or more than two courses of other antibiotics in the past four
           weeks to exclude pre-existing diarrhea associated with antibiotic use

        -  Immunosuppression (Chronic steroid use, Active chemotherapy, Active radiotherapy, HIV or
           any other disorder resulting in a compromise in participants immune status)

        -  Bowel surgery causing liquid stools

        -  Regular probiotic intake before admission

        -  Lactose intolerance or intolerance to dairy products.
