    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced solid tumors, including glioma,
      that harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where
      cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is
      a dose expansion phase where four arms of patients will receive AG-120 to further evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose. Anticipated
      time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs or at
      Investigator discretion.

             on the day of the first study drug administration and confirmed negative prior to
             dosing. Subjects with reproductive potential are defined as sexually mature women who
             have not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal occlusion or who
             have not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e., who have not menstruated at all) for at

             consecutive months). Females of reproductive potential, as well as fertile men and
             their partners who are female of reproductive potential, must agree to abstain from
             sexual intercourse or to use two highly effective forms of contraception from the time
             of giving informed consent, during the study and for 90 days (females and males)

             as hormonal oral contraceptives, injectables, patches, intrauterine devices,
             double-barrier method (e.g., synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with
             spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), or male partner sterilization.
