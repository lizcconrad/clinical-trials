  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 350-400 million people have chronic infection with hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) all over the world. In china, 93 million individuals suffer from this chronic
      condition. Currently, seven medications are approved for the treatment of hepatitis B: two
      formulations of interferon and four nucleos(t)ide analogues. The Chinese population has one
      of the longer average life spans, and the size of the aged population has been increasing
      rapidly. As a result, the prevalence of elderly patients with HBV has increased, and the
      potential for development of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma in such patients is real.
      Hence, treatment of elderly patients with HBV is an important issue. However, ADV or ETV has
      become first choice due to the more side effect of INF and the resistant of LAM and LdT. But
      treatment outcomes with ADV and ETV in elderly are not known yet. In this study, we will
      evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of ADV and ETV between younger and older
      patients with HBV. The aims of the present study are (1)to assess the benefits of ADV or ETV
      therapy for elderly patients with chronic hepatitis B, and (2)to determine differences in the
      emergence rate of side effect.

        We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of chronic hepatitis B patients treated
        with ADV, 10mg, daily, or with ETV，0.5mg，daily between January 2010 and December 2013 in a
        single tererral referral hospital in Beijing. Data were retrieved from a prospectively
        maintined database.
