    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that the lubricity of DAILIES TOTAL1®
      (DT1) lenses after 16 hours of wear is equivalent to the lubricity of unworn DT1 lenses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants wore study lenses for 2 specified time periods (16 hours and 15
      minutes, treatment sequence randomized) following which lenses were collected for ex vivo
      lubricity analysis. The ex vivo lubricity analysis was evaluated under a separate
      non-clinical protocol.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular infection, inflammation, abnormality or active disease that would
             contraindicate contact lens wear, as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated, as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Use of artificial tears and rewetting drops during the study.

          -  Monocular (only one eye with functional vision) or fit with only one lens.

          -  Any abnormal ocular condition observed during the Visit 1 slit lamp examination.
