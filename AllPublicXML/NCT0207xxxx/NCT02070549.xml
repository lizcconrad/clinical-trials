  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib in treating patients
      with cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment (advanced) with or without liver (hepatic) dysfunction. Trametinib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking proteins needed for cell growth. When these
      proteins are blocked, the growth of cancer cells may be stopped and the cancer cells will
      then die. Hepatic dysfunction is frequently found in patients with advanced cancer and
      usually prevents patients from receiving standard treatments or from participating in
      clinical trials. Patients may also need dose adjustments or absorb drugs differently.
      Trametinib may be a better treatment for patients with advanced cancers and hepatic
      dysfunction.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide appropriate dosing recommendations for patients with varying degree of hepatic
      dysfunction receiving trametinib (mild, moderate and severe).

      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      trametinib in advanced cancer patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of trametinib in advanced cancer
      patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document the non-DLTs associated with the administration of trametinib in patients with
      varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      II. To document any antitumor activity associated with trametinib treatment of patients
      enrolled on this study.

      III. To explore and characterize predictive biomarkers for individual cancer patients
      utilizing genomic sequencing technologies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
