      Evaluate the correlation between the structural changes of fractures of the thoracic and
      lumbar spine burst type with clinical outcome of the treatment.

    <textblock>
      The treatment of burst fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine is still a subject of much
      discussion and debate in the literature, especially in patients without neurological deficit.
      Most authors recommend surgical treatment for patients whose fracture shows signs of
      instability: 50% loss of vertebral body height, kyphosis with more than 30 degrees,
      involvement of more than 50% of the spinal canal. The authors advocate that this type of
      treatment uses the shorter hospital stay, early patient mobility, better kyphosis correction,
      the possibility of spinal canal decompression and prevention of neurological deterioration,
      as arguments in its favor.However, observational studies in patients without neurological
      deficit, showed no difference in long-term functional outcomes in patients with this type of
      injury, regardless of the type of treatment used (surgical or conservative). This study will
      express the clinical results and morphological changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine, at a
      minimum follow-up of 24 months, comparing the findings of the patients undergoing surgical
      treatment with those found in undergoing conservative treatment.

    <description>Retrospective review of medical records and imaging studies (radiographs and CT scans) of 30 patients without neurological deficit, with fractures of the thoracic and lumbar burst-type, in the archives of the Orthopedic Hospital of Passo Fundo, in the period between 2002 to 2011 submitted the clinical follow-up or post-operative periodical by the principal investigator of the study. The fractures, of the selected patients will be classified according to Magerl et al. (AO). Minimum follow-up is 24 months. It should be emphasized that all patients underwent at follow-up, the measurement of visual analog pain scale (VAS), the SF36 quality of life questionnaire, radiographic measurements of kyphosis, collapse and narrowing of the spinal canal. The clinical results obtained with conservative and surgical treatment will be compared and correlated with the morphological changes presented by the fractured vertebra.</description>
