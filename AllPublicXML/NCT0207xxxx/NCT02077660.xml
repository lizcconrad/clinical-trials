  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the beneficial effects of a long term (12 weeks)
      green tea drinking on plasma, erythrocytes and saliva oxidative stress biomarkers and
      antioxidant capacity, as well as on cardiometabolic risk factors: anthropometric,
      inflammation and metabolic parameters in a healthy aging men and women.

      A prospective, crossover trial in which every individual served its own control. All subjects
      undergo a four weeks washout period, during which they briefed to avoid tea drinking and
      antioxidant supplements until the end of the study. At the end of the washout period, blood
      and saliva samples is collected after 12 hours of night fast. Subsequently, all subjects
      receive the maltodextrin containing placebo &quot;tea bags&quot;. The subjects instructed to brew the
      placebo sachets for five minute in 240 mL boiling water without stirring and to drink 4 cups
      per day for 12 weeks period (placebo period). After the placebo period, fasting samples
      collected once more and the subjects receive the green tea bags. Preparation and drinking
      instructions are the same as the placebo drink. At the end of the 12 weeks, green tea
      drinking, fasting blood and saliva samples drawn for the third time. During the study, every
      4 weeks the subjects get additional placebo or green tea bags. Assessment of nutritional
      consumption of macronutrients and antioxidants using a food diary, physical activity
      lifestyle as well as weight, body fat and circumference measurements is made at the
      beginning, middle and end of the study.
