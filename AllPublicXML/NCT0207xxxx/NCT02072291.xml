  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main factors associated with pregnancy rate in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment are
      embryo quality and the uterine ability to accept the embryo for implantation. This ability is
      influenced by uterine contractions (UC), which change in pattern and direction during the
      menstrual cycle. An abnormal uterine contraction pattern can displace the embryo from the
      proper position in the uterine cavity towards the cervix or the fallopian tubes and as a
      result may decrease pregnancy rates and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Indeed,
      previous studies demonstrated a negative correlation between uterine contraction rate and
      implantation/pregnancy rates. Suppression of uterine contractions during embryo transfer can
      be achieved by a large array of drugs, such as cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, Î²2-adrenoreceptor
      agonists, calcium-channel blockers, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and oxytocin antagonists.
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Nifedipine administration in
      reducing uterine contractility during IVF-frozen embryo transfer (FET) treatment.
