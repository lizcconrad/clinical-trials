      Drug serum concentrations will be measured at several time-points for inflammatory disease
      patients treated with anti-TNF agents. The purpose is to determine which patients that will
      clinically benefit from either discontinue treatment, adjusting the dose, switch to another
      anti-TNF agent or a different class of medication.

      Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases where the proinflammatory cytokine Tumor
      Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF) plays an important role. Anti-TNF agents are used in the
      treatment. However, some patients do not respond and response rates declines over time. The
      cause may be immunogenicity against the agent itself, the agent´s failure to neutralize TNF
      or another biological pathway leading to inflammation. Anti-TNF agents have been
      administrated as fixed doses at certain frequencies and this may not be optimal for all
      patients, but recent studies have indicated a correlation between efficacy and serum drug
      concentration levels (trough levels). Our preliminary data suggest that trough levels early
      in the treatment course may be predictive of later trough levels. By multiple measurements,
      this will be assessed. The study will also investigate biological markers in serum and blood
      cells which may be predictable for trough levels. Finally, we will compare different methods
      to measure serum drug concentrations.
