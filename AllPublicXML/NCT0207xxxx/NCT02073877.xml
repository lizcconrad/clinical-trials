    <textblock>
      The Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid (Baha) system consists of an implanted part and sound
      processor. The system provides a hearing solution for a subgroup of patients who cannot
      sufficiently profit from conventional hearing aids. Disadvantageous are its high rate (up to
      40%) of associated peri-implant dermatitis. This research project is part of an attempt to
      reduce the amount of peri-implant dermatitis. Besides an attempt of Holgers to identify the
      skin flora in relation to infection around the abutment using a standard culture which
      yielded limited and no clinically relevant results, little is known about the microbiome on
      the abutment or its interaction with the commensal skin flora. Moreover, conventional
      cultures are not very sensitive in identifying bacteria. In 2010, Budding et al. introduced
      IS-pro. Is-pro is a novel 16S-23S rDNA interspace (IS)- region-based profiling method. This
      technology was devised to enable high-throughput molecular fingerprinting of microbioma.
      Since IS-pro is quick and relatively inexpensive, these environments can also be monitored
      over time by repeating the test. This paves the way for researching the microbiome on the
      abutment and it could enable clinically objective follow up of treatments in vivo using the
      human as a host. This technique allows researchers to even discover unknown, previously
      unidentified bacteria. Additionally, Scanning Electron Microscopy will be used to assess the
      spatial distribution and composition of bacteria on the abutment. The first step, using these
      techniques, is to determine the bacteria which inhabit the abutment also in relation to the
      surrounding skin. Additionally, the relationship with skin-implant infections and the effect
      of treatments will be monitored. Depending on these primary scientific results, a subsequent
      study will be devised to study (experimental) treatments in a randomized, controlled fashion.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. To identify the bacterial flora on the abutment in a phylum/species classification.

        2. To assess the relationships between the commensal skin flora and the flora on the
           abutment and to study if clinical signs of peri-implant skin infection and subsequent
           treatment are associated with a change in bacterial composition.

        3. To assess if there exists a relationship between skin hygiene and the transient skin
           flora.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is at least 18 years old

          2. The patient has a Cochlear Baha.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from
        participation in this study if there exists:

          1. Participation in the Cochlear CBAS5439 study.

          2. The new abutment is not compatible with the current and future hearing aid.

          3. Patients can be included until both arms (controls vs. cases) are filled up.

          4. A condition that may have an impact on the outcome of the investigation as judged by
             the investigator (e.g. severe wound healing impairments). If so the reason should be
             noted. In general, patients who potentially could have severe wound healing
             impairments based on their medical history are excluded. This would include:

               -  Unregulated Diabetes Mellitus (DM). This is based on an prolonged elevated HbA1c
                  (for more than 3 months &gt; 7%) or patients reporting to have difficulties
                  regulating their glucose and/or the presence of infectious diseases related to
                  DM.

               -  Any systemic immunosuppressant usage (e.g. corticosteroids).

               -  The usage of topical or systemic antibiotics which could affect the skin (e.g.
                  excludes systemic antibiotics for urinary tract infections).

               -  Skin diseases (e.g. cases of psoriasis, eczema or other skin diseases which have
                  in the past or currently involved the skin on the head, have a tendency to arise
                  on disrupted skin or are not well predictable in their location and recurrence).
