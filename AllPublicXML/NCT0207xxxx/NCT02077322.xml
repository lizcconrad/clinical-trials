  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is the best method of surgically treating patients
      who suffer from sinus disease. Synechiae formation in the nose is the most common
      complication after sinus surgery. Synechiae describes the adhesion of two opposing mucosal
      surfaces in the nasal cavity that can cause scarring and obstruction of the nasal passage.
      Spacers are often inserted during surgery between nasal mucosal surfaces to prevent
      synechiae. The aim of this study is to see if a silastic spacer is more effective at reducing
      the formation of synechiae after sinus surgery than a merocel spacer.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of middle meatal synechiae after functional endoscopic sinus surgery in silastic versus merocel groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of post op standard of care, an expected average of 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The existence of postoperative synechiae will be considered as a categorical, dichotomous outcome variable (presence or absence). A senior Rhinologist will endoscopically assess each nasal cavity independently to determine if synechiae exists between the middle turbinate and lateral nasal wall. Count and absolute percentages will be reported.
Incidence of postoperative synechiae will be compared between right and left nasal cavities receiving either silastic or glove finger spacers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of postoperative synechiae in 6-day versus 14-day postoperative spacer removal groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of post op standard of care, an expected average of 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The existence of postoperative synechiae will be considered as a categorical, dichotomous outcome variable (presence or absence). A senior Rhinologist will endoscopically assess each nasal cavity independently to determine if synechiae exists between the middle turbinate and lateral nasal wall. Count and absolute percentages will be reported.
Secondary comparisons of postoperative synechiae will be compared between subjects in the 6-day vs 14-day spacer removal groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 (SNOT- 22) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of post op standard of care, an expected average of 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The SNOT-22 is a sinus-specific questionnaire that evaluates subjective symptoms for patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis. SNOT-22 is scored out of 110 (22 questions, up to 5-points each) has demonstrated internal consistency, reliability, discriminate and concurrent validity and responsiveness to change12. Responses will be summated and considered as a continuous, numerical variable. Mean, median, standard deviation and inter-quartile range will be reported.
SNOT-22 change between baseline (preoperative score) and 90-days (postoperative score) will be compared between groups having middle meatal spacers removed at 14 days versus 6 days postoperatively.</description>
