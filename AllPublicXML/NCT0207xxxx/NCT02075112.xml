  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if soy supplementation during chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy will decrease side effects caused by treatment. Long-lasting dry mouth is a
      side effect of the standard treatment, and we are testing whether soy supplementation during
      treatment may reduce this symptom and other side effects of chemoradiation.

    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiation is the standard of care for locally advanced squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Improving the outcome for patients with this disease
      remains a major challenge.
