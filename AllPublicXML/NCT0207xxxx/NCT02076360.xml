  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, randomized (1:1 allocation), stratified, single-parallel clinical
      trial at one institution evaluating the use of a preoperative patient education video as an
      adjunct to preoperative counseling on patient-centered outcomes.

      The aim of this study is to determine the impact of a preoperative patient educational video
      as an adjunct to the routine preoperative visit on patients' preparedness for surgery,
      perception of time spent with their healthcare team, and ultimately their satisfaction after
      surgery. The aim of this video is not to limit the doctor patient interaction (as all
      patients will still be granted their pre-allotted 30 minute visit with the physician
      regardless of their intervention allocation) but rather to augment the visit with additional
      educational information in an attempt to optimize the visit.

      Objective:

      A. Primary Aim(s):

      â€¢ To determine if patients feel more prepared for surgery with addition of preoperative
      patient education video

      B. Secondary Aim(s):

        -  To determine if addition of preoperative patient education video correlates with
           improved patient satisfaction after surgery

        -  To determine if patients' perception of time spent with healthcare team in preparation
           for surgery increases with addition of patient educational video

        -  To determine if actual patient-physician time spent counseling differs between groups

        -  To determine if patient preparedness is correlated with objective surgical outcomes

        -  To determine if patient preparedness is correlated with patient symptom improvement
           scores after surgery

      Hypothesis:

      The addition of a preoperative patient education video enhances patient preparedness for
      surgery, increases perception of the amount of time patients spend with healthcare team, and
      improves patient satisfaction.
