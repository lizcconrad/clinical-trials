      The purpose of this study is to determine if Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused
      Ultrasound ablative therapy is safe and feasible for children, adolescents, and young adults
      with refractory or relapsed solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance (MR)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an innovative
      technique that allows for non-invasive thermal ablation of tissue. Advantages over
      conventional local tumor control such as surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency are that
      MR-HIFU is completely non-invasive, non-ionizing, and enables ablation of large tumor volumes
      with avoidance of adjacent tissue injury. This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of MR-HIFU ablative therapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with refractory or
      relapsed solid tumors that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone.
      Patients ≤ 30 years of age with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with measurable target
      lesions that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone are eligible.
      Tolerability will be defined during the 14 days following MR-HIFU ablation. Patients will
      continue to be followed for tumor response and secondary outcomes for up to one year post
      ablation treatment.

        DIAGNOSIS:

        Histologically confirmed malignant solid tumors, which may include but are not limited to
        rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors,
        osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatic tumors, germ cell tumors, and desmoid
        tumors.

        TUMOR LOCATION: Target lesion(s) must be located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity
        to bone. Target lesions must be reachable within the normal safety margins of HIFU as
        specified in the instructions for use.

        TARGET LESION(S): Radiographically evaluable or measurable solid tumor target lesion(s).

        THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS:

        Malignant Tumor: The patient's cancer must have relapsed after or failed to respond to
        frontline curative therapy and there must not be other potentially curative treatment
        options available. Curative therapy may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy,
        or any combination of these modalities.

        PRIOR THERAPY:

        Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy,
        immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering on this study.

        No limitation on the number of prior chemotherapy regimens that the patient may have
        received prior to study entry.

        Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: The last dose of all myelosuppressive anticancer drugs must
        be at least 3 weeks prior to study entry.

        Immunotherapy: The last dose of immunotherapy (monoclonal antibody or vaccine) must be at
        least 4 weeks prior to study entry.

        other local palliative (limited port) radiation must be at least 2 weeks prior to study
        entry.

        Stem Cell Transplantation. At least 2 months post-autologous stem cell transplant or at
        least 3 months post-allogeneic transplant and recovered from toxicities without evidence of
        graft versus host disease and on stable doses of immunosuppressive medications if required.

        Growth Factors. The last dose of colony stimulating factors, such as filgrastim,
        sargramostim, and erythropoietin, must be at least 1 week prior to study entry, the last
        dose of long-acting colony stimulating factors, such as pegfilgrastim, must be at least 2
        weeks prior to study entry.

        CONCURRENT THERAPIES:

        No other anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy) is
        permitted during HIFU treatment and post treatment follow up for tolerability (see section
        3.3).

        wheelchair will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of calculating the performance
        score.

               1. Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≥750/µL

               2. Platelet count ≥75,000/µL (may receive transfusions)

          -  RENAL FUNCTION: Age-adjusted normal serum creatinine OR a creatinine clearance ≥60
             mL/min/1.73 m2.
