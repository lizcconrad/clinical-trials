  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine differences in the process of wound-healing in patients treated with
      platelet rich plasma (a concentration of proteins derived from a patients own blood) applied
      to the wound as a gel; injected into the wound or surrounding tissue; or both; compared to
      patients treated with usual medical treatment . This study seeks to enroll patients who are
      18 or older with a non-healing skin wound that is at least 30 days old. Only patients with
      Diabetic Foot Ulcers, Venous Ulcers, or Pressure Ulcers will be included in the study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation is designed to solicit a large number of patients (N=1,500) with
      non-healing wounds (Diabetic Foot Ulcers, Venous Ulcers, or Pressure Ulcers) that have not
      responded to standard wound care in the previous 30 days or more. A prospective,
      interventional, single-blinded, controlled, registry trial will be used. Data will be
      analyzed to compare patients who received PRP therapy (PRP gel application, PRP injection, or
      both) and standard wound care (usual customary care) with patients who received standard
      wound care (usual customary care), only. Wound size, rate of healing, quality of life, and
      recurrence of wound will be measured during the 16-week period at usual office visits.

      Hypotheses to be tested:

        1. Treatment of a chronic wound with standard of care and autologous platelet rich plasma
           (PRP) will increase the velocity of healing (rate of wound closure) over a twenty week
           period as compared to patients receiving standard wound care only (Control Group), which
           results in the patient's ability to return to previous function and resumption of normal
           activities.

        2. Treatment of a chronic wound with standard of care and autologous platelet rich plasma
           (PRP) will result in complete wound healing within twenty weeks, whereas complete wound
           healing will not be observed within twenty weeks in patients receiving standard wound
           care only (Control Group).

The application of topical PRP gel may be used in chronic wounds possessing an open, moist wound bed according to following treatment schedule: Baseline/Week 0, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 7, and Week 11. The Arteriocyte Magellan® System (510(k) cleared) will be used to prepare the autologous PRP gel.

Some wounds may be suitable for both Autologous PRP Gel plus PRP Injections. Autologous PRP injections into, or to the periphery of, a moist wound bed in which no scarification or raised wound margin is apparent (where autologous PRP Gel can also be used) may further augment wound healing by addressing wound healing in multiple areas, following the treatment schedule: Baseline/Week 0, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 7, and Week 11.

    <description>Autologous PRP Gel is prepared using the Arteriocyte Magellan® System (510(k) approved), an Autologous Platelet Separator Instrument, which is a microprocessor-controlled centrifuge designed to be used in the clinical laboratory or intraoperatively at point of care for the safe and rapid preparation of platelet poor plasma and platelet concentrate (platelet rich plasma) from a small sample of blood. The Arteriocyte Magellan® automatically and quickly separates PRP from anticoagulated blood and dispenses it into a separate sterile syringe. The prepared PRP is then activated (by mixing with thrombin and calcium chloride) and sprayed directly on the area to be treated.</description>
