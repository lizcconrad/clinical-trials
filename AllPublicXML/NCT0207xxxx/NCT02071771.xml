    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate functional vision associated with rotational
      stability at blink of DAILIES® AquaComfort Plus® Toric (DACP T) compared to 1-DAY ACUVUE®
      MOIST® for Astigmatism (1DAM A).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>High Contrast Time Controlled Visual Acuity (TCVA) at Day 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10, each product</time_frame>
    <description>TCVA test was performed at 4 meters under high illumination (90%) using a Landolt ring test. For each acuity level, a series of single rings with gaps in one of four directions was presented and the percentage of correctly identified rings constituted the score. TCVA was measured in VA units and a higher TCVA value indicates an improvement in visual acuity. Both eyes contributed to the analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Oscillation at Blink at Day 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10, each product</time_frame>
    <description>Lens oscillation (rotational stability of the lens on the eye) at blink was video-recorded. Digital images were used to measure the rotational characteristics of the lenses and objectively measure the amplitude of the lens oscillation. A higher value indicates greater lens movement on the eye. This outcome measure was collected at one site only.</description>

          <title>Lens Oscillation at Blink at Day 10</title>
          <description>Lens oscillation (rotational stability of the lens on the eye) at blink was video-recorded. Digital images were used to measure the rotational characteristics of the lenses and objectively measure the amplitude of the lens oscillation. A higher value indicates greater lens movement on the eye. This outcome measure was collected at one site only.</description>
          <population>This analysis group includes all randomized subjects at the UK site with data at visit who had no major protocol violations excluding those who met the critical deviation criteria as specified in the Deviations and Evaluability Plan.</population>
