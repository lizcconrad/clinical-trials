  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia related mobility dysfunction was a preventable presentation in transitional
      variation of frailty. However, the definition, associated risk factors, clinical course and
      outcome of sarcopenia in Taiwanese older adults are still under-clarified and need for
      further study.

        Healthy subjects One thousand Taiwanese subjects aged 20-40 will be recruited equally
        divided in both genders. Exclusion criteria includes (1) morbid obesity (BMI over 35) ; (2)
        long term use of body composition modified medications, like steroid, medications for
        endocrine diseases (hyperthyroidism, diabetes) and autoimmune diseases; (3) energy
        consumption diseases, such as cancer, organ failure; (4) pregnant women.

        Patient enrollment The research subjects will be culled from outpatients aged over 65 at
