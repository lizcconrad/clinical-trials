  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF), a rapid beating of the upper heart
      chambers, can undergo catheter ablation to control or eliminate their rhythm disorder. The
      radiopharmceutical 123I-mIBG (Adreview™ GE Healthcare) has been introduced to visually
      identify cardiac innervation. This study will use non-invasive evaluation using MIBG imaging
      to study if we can predict baseline autonomic characteristics in patients with AF, as well as
      clinical outcome based on post ablation imaging
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, interventional, Phase III trial using the radiopharmaceutical
      123I-mIBG for imaging. In this pilot study, up to 7 eligible participants will undergo
      pre-ablation and post ablation nuclear imaging.

      The major objective of our study is to evaluate the relationship between non-invasive imaging
      of cardiac innervation with invasive mapping of atrial innervation as determined by High
      Frequency Stimulation (standard of care to physiologically document autonomic function). This
      will be followed by the clinical ablation procedure, as discussed by the cardiac
      electrophysiologist, consisting of pulmonary vein (PV) antral isolation, inclusive of regions
      of autonomic innervation, and sites showing complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE)
      when clinically indicated.

      The secondary objective is to determine the relationship between catheter ablation of AF and
      non-invasive nuclear imaging of cardiac innervation.

    <description>A single injection of the 123I-mIBG will be given. Imaging will be done twice following injection: at 0120 minutes and 3-5 hours. The timing is dependent on the specific participant and imaging characteristics.
The imaging is done for approximately 24 minutes at each time point.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-80 years.

          -  Symptoms including one or more of the following: palpitations, shortness of breath,
             dizziness, presyncope or syncope, chest pain, tiredness or lack of energy.

          -  Failure of beta-blockers or at least one antiarrhythmic agent other than Amiodarone to
             prevent AF. In those patients who are not eligible to antiarrhythmic agents other than
             Amiodarone, patients may choose to undergo catheter ablation rather than starting
             Amiodarone.

          -  Paroxysmal (self-terminating AF within 7 days) or persistent AF (requiring an
             intervention to terminate or lasting more than 7 days).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intracardiac thrombus as determined by transesophageal echocardiography

          -  Class III or IV congestive heart failure

          -  Persistent AF duration of more than 3 years

          -  Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months

          -  Left atrial size of greater than 55 mm determined by 2D echocardiogram

          -  Inability to undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram or cardiac CT

          -  Inability to undergo D-SPECT™ imaging

          -  Inability to take Warfarin or the new oral anticoagulants

          -  Previously received 123I-mIBG or 131I-mIBG

             iodinated imaging agents

          -  Use of medications for non-cardiac medical conditions that are known to interfere with
             123I-mIBG uptake and these medications cannot be safely withheld for at least 24 hours
             before study procedures

          -  Diagnosis of or signs or symptoms of a neurologic disease such as Parkinson's disease,
             multiple systems atrophy or Parkinsonian syndromes, or other diseases known to affect
             the sympathetic nervous system
