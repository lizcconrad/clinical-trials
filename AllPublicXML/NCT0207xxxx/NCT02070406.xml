    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of taking ipilimumab after gene-modified T
      cells and vaccine therapy when treating patients with advanced cancer that has spread to
      other areas of the body and has not responded to standard therapies. This trial also will
      determine the best dose of Ipilimumab to use in this combination treatment. T cells are a
      special type of white blood cell (immune cell) that have the ability to kill cancer cells. T
      cells are taken from the blood and modified in the laboratory to recognize a specific protein
      expressed on cancer cells, called NY-ESO-1. This may allow the T cells to target and kill
      cancer cells that express that protein. Dendritic cells are another type of blood cell that
      can teach other cells in the body to look for cancer cells and attack them. Giving a
      dendritic cell vaccine with the NY-ESO-1 protein may help dendritic cells teach the immune
      system to target cancer cells expressing that protein, and further help the T cells attack
      cancer. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody, a type of drug manufactured in the laboratory
      that is similar to antibodies made in the human body that fight off infection. Ipilimumab
      blocks a protein that turns down the immune system, so blocking this protein may make the
      immune system more active. This may increase the ability of immune cells to kill cancer cells
      and improve the effectiveness of the T cell transplant. Giving gene-modified T-cells, a
      dendritic cell vaccine, and ipilimumab together may teach the immune system to recognize and
      kill cancer cells that have the NY-ESO-1 protein.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The safety of NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic adoptive cell transfer (ACT) has
      been reported. The current protocol includes the addition of the cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) blocking monoclonal antibody ipilimumab to NY ESO
      TCR ACT in a dose escalation scheme in two study cohorts at 1 and 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab
      intravenous (i.v.) every three weeks with a maximum of 4 doses (q3wx4).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering the TCR transgenic cell dose and CTLA blockade
      to patients.

      II. To determine the persistence of NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) in serial peripheral blood samples and in biopsies of accessible metastatic
      lesions.

      III. To explore the use of positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging using the PET
      tracer [18F] fluorodeoxy-glucose ([18F]FDG) with the goal of determining if the adoptively
      transferred NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered PBMC when administered with ipilimumab home and expand in
      secondary lymphoid organs and tumor deposits.

      IV. Clinical antitumor activity recording objective response rate will be an exploratory
      endpoint in this pilot clinical trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab.

      CONDITIONING CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 and -4 and
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes daily on days -4 to -1.

      NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC INFUSION: Patients receive NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector
      transduced autologous T cells IV on day 0.

      IPILIMUMAB ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes before the NY-ESO-1
      TCR PBMC infusion on day 0 or after the infusion on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for up to 4 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NY-ESO-1(157-165) PEPTIDE PULSED DENDRITIC CELL (DC) ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive
      NY-ESO-1(157-165) peptide pulsed DC vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 1, 14, and 30.

      LOW DOSE INTERLEUKIN-2 (IL-2) ADMINISTRATION: Patients receive aldesleukin (IL-2)
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 90 days, every
      3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

          -  History of, or significant evidence of risk for, chronic inflammatory or autoimmune
             disease (eg, Addison's disease, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity or other congenital or acquired
             immune deficiency state, which would increase the risk of opportunistic infections and

             specialist

          -  Hepatitis B or C seropositivity with evidence of ongoing liver damage, which would
             increase the likelihood of hepatic toxicities from the chemotherapy conditioning
             regimen and supportive treatments; if there is a positive result in the infectious
             disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their
             primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist

             postmenopausal for two years, or must agree to use effective contraception during the
             period of treatment and 6 months after; all female patients with reproductive
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) within 14 days from
             starting the conditioning chemotherapy; the definition of effective contraception will
             be based on the judgment of the study investigators

          -  Since IL-2 is administered following cell infusion:

               -  Patients will be excluded if they have a history of clinically significant
                  electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, symptoms of cardiac ischemia or
                  arrhythmias and have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45% on a
                  cardiac stress test (stress thallium, stress multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan,

                  excluded

               -  Patients with ECG results of any conduction delays (PR interval &gt; 200 ms,
                  corrected QT interval [QTC] &gt; 480 ms), sinus bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt; 50
                  beats per minute), sinus tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 120 beats per minute) will be
                  evaluated by a cardiologist prior to starting the trial; patients with any
                  arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, excessive ectopy
                  (defined as &gt; 20 PVCs per minute), ventricular tachycardia, 3rd degree heart
                  block will be excluded from the study unless cleared by a cardiologist
