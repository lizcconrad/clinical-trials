      Introduction: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been used to minimize such impairment and
      increasing ventilator reserve in individuals with heart failure. Aim: To analyze
      thoracoabdominal kinematics (TK) in individuals with HF associated to cardiomegaly after
      using NIV. Methods: A randomized crossover clinical trial with allocation consisted of two
      experimental phases: NIV and control, 7 days apart of each other. During NIV phase, 30
      minutes of bi-level ventilation was performed. Any type of ventilator support was offered
      during control phase. Optoeletronic plethismography was performed to asses TK.

    <description>The thoraco-abdominal kinematics was performed by optoelectronic plethysmography which were evaluated as primary outcomes: volume change of rib cage (Δv CT), variables related to volume change of rib cage by hemithorax (ΔV ht CT): tidal volume of cash left thoracic (CT VC sx) and tidal volume right ribcage (VC CT dx); variables with distribution volume in different compartments: tidal volume on pulmonary rib cage (VC CTP), tidal volume in abdominal rib cage (VC CTA ) and tidal volume in the abdomen (AB VC).</description>

    <description>The other ventilatory responses were also assessed by optoelectronic plethysmography which were assessed as secondary outcomes: minute ventilation (MV); Inhalant rate (RR), duty cycle (Ti / Ttot), expiratory time (TE), end of rib cage (VEF CT) expiratory volume.</description>

    <description>In the experimental phase with NIV ventilatory support with bilevel positive pressure was used for 30 minutes with the subject comfortably seated. The NIV (Vivo 40 Bi-Level, General Electric Company) was fitted to the face of volunteer through a face mask, was initially adopted an inspiratory pressure (IPAP) of 15 cm H2O and an expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, resulting in a variation in pressure of 10 cm H2O, where the IPAP would be increased, subject to the comfort of the patient until the patient reached a tidal volume of 6-8 ml / kg, not exceeding the maximum of 20 cmH2O for IPAP.</description>
