      This study will implement a socio-behavioral intervention in Quezon City, the Philippines,
      using a community-based participatory approach. The intervention involves 1-2 psychosocial
      and health education training workshops for the establishment managers and their workers,
      focusing on HIV/AIDS risk reduction information and condom use and condom negotiation

      skill-building. Participants will also be invited to do dream-building activities that
      explore their personal goals and goals for their organization of peers.

      The intervention involves targeted and tailored bio-psycho-educational interventions directed
      at organizational behavior change and social influence modeling through training peers and
      managers. The intervention site will receive peer and manager trainings consisting of
      specific information on STIs along with standard care, held on a day convenient to the
      participants and at the establishment or neutral location.

      In addition to quick pre-post tests before and immediately after the intervention,
      participants will be interviewed 6-12 months after the intervention to evaluate the effects
      of the intervention on their STI/HIV knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, safer sex practices, and
      social support.
