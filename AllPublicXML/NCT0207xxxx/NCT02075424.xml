  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe biological stress (cortisolemia) and perceived
      stress in Emergency Call Center Operators and Doctors while processing a center 15 call.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sample description : qualitative variables be expressed as percentages, numbers and 95%
      confidence intervals Quantitative variables will be expressed as means, standard deviations
      or medians, range, interquartile intervals Description of biological stress : it will be
      described by calculating the difference between the observed peek or peeks of cortisol ans
      the cortisol level measured at rest (means, standard deviations or medians, range,
      interquartile intervals) Description of perceived stress : the AVS will be described in terms
      of means and standard deviation Comparison of the peek-delta/base level of cortisol in the 3
      different workstations of the call center operators according to the non parametrical
      Kruskall Wallis test. Same for the lengthof service of the call operator, the severity of the
      call and the status of the doctor The AVS score (perceived stress) will be compared to the
      peek-delta/base level of cortisol (biological stress) thanks to the Spearmann correlation
      coefficient.

    <description>Each call operator will have a series of salivary sampling taken when assigned to call reception, to the unit deployment station and to the assessment station.
Only one sampling will occur to doctors who are assigned to a single workstation.
Sampling will be taken every 15 minutes during one hour and half and one last sample will be taken 2 hours after the call For each participant, a serie of control-samples will be taken during a day off and during a security break.</description>

    <description>Each call operator will have a series of salivary sampling taken when assigned to call reception, to the unit deployment station and to the assessment station.
Only one sampling will occur to doctors who are assigned to a single workstation.
Sampling will be taken every 15 minutes during one hour and half and one last sample will be taken 2 hours after the call.
To improve interpretation of the results, a series of control-samples will be taken among the call operators and doctors during a day off and not during a security break.
There will be 4x8 samples taken for each call operator and 2x8 samples per doctor.
They will also be frozen at a temperature of -4°C and sent to the laboratory of the CHR Metz Thionville.</description>
