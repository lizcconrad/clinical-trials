    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single
      doses of BIIB061 administered to healthy adult volunteers. Secondary objectives in this study
      population are to determine the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and the absolute
      bioavailability (Fabs) of BIIB061 and to determine the effects of food intake (high-fat,
      high-calorie meal) on BIIB061 PK and safety.
