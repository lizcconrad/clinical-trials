      The major purpose of this study is to evaluate a laboratory developed test that measures
      multiple breast cancer-specific biomarker proteins and multiple antibodies in your blood
      samples. The biomarker and antibody results along with your personal medical profile will be
      evaluated to determine your risk for the presence of a malignancy in the breast as compared
      to your breast evaluation assessment conducted by your physician.
