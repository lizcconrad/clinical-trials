  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Permanently implantable venous ports (Port-A) is very important to patients receiving
      chemotherapy. It not only provides a reliable route to administrate intravenous drugs, and it
      also requires minimal care when it is not in use. However, catheter related blood stream
      infection(CRBSI) is one of the serious complications of Port-A. The diagnosis of CRBSI relies
      on limited tools, including blood culture or symptoms and signs of active infection. In the
      stage of CRBSI, Port-A removal is necessary and pose the risk for the patients to re-implant
      the Port-A. Thus, it is crucial to early detect the infection and give appropriate treatment.
      Among the pathogens, some pathogens are related to skin contaminants. Before systemic
      spreading, these pathogens may colonize or cause minor infection subcutaneously. This
      investigation is to utilize a non-invasive dual spectrum infrared imaging system to evaluate
      the Port-A wound and to detect the infection.

      Aim: 1. To build the database of infra-red thermal images of Port-A wound healing. 2. To
      investigate the thermal images of skin contamination related CRBSI and to compare with the
      thermal images of the CRBSI of unknown foci
