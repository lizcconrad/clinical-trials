      The proposed project will utilize perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
      examine the effects of topiramate on brain and behavioral responses in heavy drinkers to
      appetitive alcohol reminders (cues that motivate continued alcohol use and relapse). This
      project will yield novel findings on brain and behavioral responses to alcohol cues, the
      effects of topiramate on alcohol cue reactivity, and the mechanisms underlying topiramate's
      ability to blunt alcohol cue reactivity and heavy drinking.

      This project is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of topiramate's effects
      on brain and behavior responses in heavy drinkers. Eligible volunteers who meet study
      criteria will be randomized to receive either topiramate or placebo with weekly visits and
      medication management sessions. Participants will complete two magnetic resonance imaging
      sessions. The first scan session will occur prior to starting study drug, and the second scan
      will occur following six weeks of study drug. This project will yield novel findings on brain
      and behavioral responses to alcohol cues, the effects of topiramate on alcohol cue
      reactivity, and the mechanisms underlying topiramate's ability to blunt alcohol cue
      reactivity and heavy drinking.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Physically healthy, as determined by a comprehensive physical examination and approval
             of the study physician, males or females who drink alcohol, ages 18-60.

          -  Average weekly ethanol consumption of &gt;24 standard drinks for men, or &gt;18 standard
             drinks for women.

          -  Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating and either be of non-childbearing
             potential (i.e. sterilized via hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or at least 2
             years postmenopausal) or of child bearing potential but practicing a medically
             acceptable method of birth control. Examples of medically acceptable methods for this
             protocol include: the birth control pill, intrauterine device, injection of

             abstinence (and agreement to continue abstinence or to use an acceptable method of
             contraception, as listed above, should sexual activity commence), and tubal ligation.

          -  Provide voluntary informed consent.

          -  Must be able to read. [Subjects are required to be able to read because there are

          -  History of glaucoma or kidney stones.
