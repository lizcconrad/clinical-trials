  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cancer has traditionally been treated by surgical removal of the tumor, as the tumors
      are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. The traditional treatment, where the entire
      kidney and tumor were removed through an abdominal incision, may now have more long term
      problems than the actual cancer. As a result, less invasive techniques have been developed
      such as laparoscopic surgery where the abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide (i.e. via an
      insufflation system) and the surgery performed with special instruments through small ports,
      known as trocars. Rapid advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques demand ongoing
      technological improvement.

      Conventional insufflators and trocars allow for laparoscopic surgery to occur, however the
      system does not account for pressure changes within the abdomen when instruments are inserted
      or removed. The AirSeal® System consisting of an insufflation, filtration, and recirculation
      system (AirSeal® IFS), a triple lumen filtered tube set, and a valve free trocar (AirSeal®
      Access Port) has been designed to create and maintain the pressure barrier throughout the
      procedure. The objective of this study is to collect comparative physiological, pulmonary
      compliance and surgical utility data for both the AirSeal® System and conventional
      insufflators and trocars in a controlled population undergoing laparoscopic/robotic renal or
      peri-renal procedures. Subjects enrolled in this study will have their procedure performed
      using either the AirSeal® System or a conventional insufflator and trocars. Both systems have
      been cleared for use by the FDA's 510(k) process and are currently employed in clinical
      practice, including at University of California, Irvine Medical Center. We hypothesize that
      with the use of the AirSeal® System, laparoscopic efficiencies and outcomes will be
      significantly greater than with the conventional insufflator and trocars system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques demand ongoing technological
      improvement.

      The benefits of laparoscopic surgery to patient comfort and recovery have been made with
      procedures such as the cholecystectomy and gastric bypass. The AirSeal® System consists of an
      insufflation, filtration, and recirculation system (AirSeal® IFS), a triple lumen filtered
      tube set, and a valve free trocar (AirSeal® Access Port). The device enables peritoneal
      access with a novel mechanism to maintain pneumoperitoneum without a mechanical seal.
      Specifically, the AirSeal® System creates a pressure barrier within the proximal housing of
      the cannula which acts as an invisible seal to maintain pneumoperitoneum during the course of
      surgery. It utilizes a re-circulation and filtration control unit (AirSeal® IFS) designed
      specifically for the AirSeal® Access Port to create and maintain the pressure barrier. The
      AirSeal® System has applications in abdominal minimally invasive surgical procedures to
      establish a path of entry for laparoscopic instruments. The insufflation and recirculation
      system (AirSeal® IFS) is reusable and the AirSeal® Access Port and triple lumen filtered tube
      set are designed as single patient use devices. The 1st generation AirSeal® System received
      FDA 510(k) clearance in 2007 and the current system received FDA 510(k) Clearance in May
      2011. Since that time, the AirSeal™ system has been used routinely in centers throughout the
      United States and has been observed by surgeons and anesthesia teams to provide a more
      gentle, stable, and consistent pneumoperitoneum. Initial evidence of this has reported in the
      literature1. Kavoussi and colleagues state; &quot;We have found that patients had blunted
      end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and CO2 elimination rates compared with the CO2
      elimination rates observed in studies evaluating transperitoneal laparoscopy using the
      conventional trocar. To determine if a difference truly exists, CO2 elimination rates must be
      prospectively analyzed in a head to head comparison between valve-less and conventional
      trocars.&quot; This study is designed to compare the physiological impact and pulmonary compliance
      of patients undergoing laparoscopic/robotic renal or peri-renal surgery with and without the
      AirSeal® System.

    <description>Our primary aim is to show reduction in the variance of intra-abdominal pressure throughout the operative procedure when using the AirSeal device compared to a conventional insufflator. Based on preliminary data, we assume pressures maintained at a mean of 15 through out surgery for both devices and a variance of 3.6 with the conventional insufflator.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (Day of Procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Assuming cardiac output of approximately 5.0 L/min with the conventional device, we will have 96% power to detect as significant an improvement in cardiac output to 5.5 L/min using a two-group Satterwaite t-test and assuming variance of 0.25.
Cardiac out put is defined by the volume of blood pumped by the heart in a given amount of time.</description>

        <description>Our primary aim is to show reduction in the variance of intra-abdominal pressure throughout the operative procedure when using the AirSeal device compared to a conventional insufflator. Based on preliminary data, we assume pressures maintained at a mean of 15 through out surgery for both devices and a variance of 3.6 with the conventional insufflator.</description>
