        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy Male and Female adults over 50 years of age at screening.

          -  The subject who understand the requirements of the study and voluntarily consent to
             participate in the study.

          -  The subject willing to use birth control measures for the entire study duration and
             negative urine hCG(Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin) test at screening for women presumed
             to be of reproductive potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any components of the pneumococcal vaccine

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient conditions including
             leukemia, multiple myeloma, lympoma, Hodgkin's disease, etc.

          -  History of autoimmune disease including multiple sclerosis(MS), lupus, polymyositis,
             dermatomyositis, Hashmoto's thyroiditis, Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Coagulation disorder contraindicating IM(intramuscular) vaccination

          -  Use of any immunosuppressive therapies within the preceding 3 months including
             anti-cancer chemotherapies or radiation therapies and medication such as
             cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptourine, azathioprine, methotrexate, steroids, cyclosporine
             A, rapamycin, leflunomide, TNF-α antagonist (For corticosteroids, this will mean

             allowed.)

          -  Serious chronic disorders including metastatic malignancy, severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen, end-stage renal disease with or
             without dialysis, clinically unstable cardiac disease, impaired immune function.

          -  Any licensed vaccine(not including diphtheria toxoid) administered within the 1 month
             prior to receipt of study vaccine or is scheduled to receive any other licensed
             vaccine(not including diphtheria toxoid) within 1 month following receipt of study
             vaccine.

          -  Subject has received diphtheria toxoid within 6 months prior to receipt of study
             vaccine or planned to receive diphtheria toxoid during full period of the study.
