      The primary objective of the Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study is to continue to assess
      the safety of non-emergency PCI performed at hospitals without cardiac surgery on-site in
      patients with myocardial ischemia (other than ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
      [STEMI]).

      The MASS COMM Post-Randomization Phase Cohort Study (&quot;Cohort Study&quot; is a prospective,
      multi-center, single-arm study of non-emergency PCI performed at non-SOS hospitals in
      patients with myocardial ischemia (other than STEMI). The Cohort Study is designed to allow
      non-SOS hospitals to continue to perform non-emergency PCI after enrollment to the MASS COMM
      trial is completed and before the 30-day and 12-month results are available.

      Specifically, all eligible subjects, after enrollment to the MASS COMM randomized controlled
      trial is completed and before the final results are available and a decision is reached by
      the MA-DPH, will be consented and enrolled into this Cohort Study. Subjects will be followed
      through 30 days post procedure.

             revascularization if either of the following pre-catheterization procedure qualifying
             clinical laboratory values are met:

          -  Documented stable angina pectoris [Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification
             (CCS) 1, 2, 3, or 4], unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia (Braunwald
             Class IB-C, IIB-C, or IIIB-C), non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, or
             documented silent ischemia.

             follow-up evaluations.

          -  Subject has been informed of the nature and purpose of the study and agrees to its
             provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          -  The target lesion(s) is (are) de novo or restenotic (including in-stent restenotic)
             native coronary artery lesion(s) with greater or equal to 50 and less than 100%
             stenosis (visual estimate), or the target lesion is an acute (less than 1 month) total
             occlusion as evidenced by clinical symptoms.

          -  If Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is measured, target lesion(s) has (have) evidence of
             a hemodynamically significant stenosis determined by FFR measurement (FFR less than or
             equal to 0.8).

          -  Target lesions(s) is (are) located in an infarct (if not treated with primary PCI) or
             non-infarct-related artery with a 70% or greater stenosis (by visual estimate) greater
             than 72 hours following the STEMI.

        Lesions treated with PCI greater than 72 hours following STEMI would be subject to the same
        protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above and below with the exception that a
        target lesion of 70% or greater stenosis may be treated with or without symptoms or
        abnormal stress test).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participation in the Cohort Study (and non-emergency PCI may
        not be performed in these patients at the non-SOS site) if ANY of the following conditions
        apply:

          -  The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Evidence of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended
             treatment on infarct related or non-infarct related artery.

          -  Cardiogenic shock on presentation or during current hospitalization.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 20%.

          -  Known allergies to: aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and
             ticlopidine (Ticlid), heparin, bivalirudin, stainless steel, or contrast agent (which
             cannot be adequately premedicated).

          -  A platelet count less than 75,000 cells/mm3 or greater than 700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC
             less than 3,000 cells/mm3.

          -  Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine less than 2.5 mg/dl or less than
             150µmol/L).

          -  Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints. (Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were
             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials).

          -  Prior participation in the MASS-COMM Trial, unless the patient has completed the
             12-month follow-up for the Trial, and/or prior participation in the Cohort Study,
             unless the patient has completed the 30-day follow-up for the Cohort Study.

          -  Within 30 days prior to the index Cohort Study procedure, the subject has undergone a
             previous coronary interventional procedure of any kind. Note: This exclusion criterion

          -  Stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 3 months.

          -  Active peptic ulcer or upper GI bleeding within the prior 3 months.

          -  Subject has active sepsis.

          -  Unprotected left main coronary artery disease (stenosis greater than 50%).

          -  Subject has evidence of a hemodynamically insignificant stenosis determined by FFR
             measurement (FFR greater than 0.8).

          -  In the investigator's opinion, subject has a co-morbid condition(s) that could limit
             the subject's ability to participate in the study or comply with follow-up
             requirements or impact the scientific integrity of the study.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subject has normal or insignificant coronaries (i.e., coronary lesion(s) less than 50%
             stenosis).

          -  Any target vessel has evidence of:

               1. excessive thrombus (e.g., requires target vessel thrombectomy)

               2. tortuosity (greater than 60 degree angle) that makes it unsuitable for proper
                  stent delivery and deployment,

               3. heavy calcification.

          -  Any target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent
             placement (e.g. but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser,
             rotational atherectomy, etc.).

          -  Any lesion that is located in a saphenous vein graft, however, lesions located within
             the native vessel but accessed through the graft are eligible.

          -  The target vessel is in a &quot;last remaining&quot; epicardial vessel (e.g., &gt;2 non-target
             epicardial vessels and the bypass grafts to these territories [if present] are totally
             occluded).
