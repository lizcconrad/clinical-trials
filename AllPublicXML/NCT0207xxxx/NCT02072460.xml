  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present project aims at describing how vestibular signals contribute to the multisensory
      mechanisms of bodily self-consciousness.

      There is a large body of data regarding the sensory and neural mechanisms of
      self-consciousness, but most studies have so far demonstrated the contribution of visual,
      tactile and proprioceptive signals to bodily self-consciousness. Thus, most studies have
      neglected the contribution of the vestibular system, a major sensory system for spatial and
      bodily representations. The vestibular system is sensitive to head motions in space and head
      inclinations with respect to gravity and it should therefore contribute significantly to
      several bodily experiences. This contribution should be put under neuroscientific scrutiny.
      We believe that the current neuroscientific models of bodily self-consciousness will be
      incomplete until they incorporate the contribution of vestibular signals.

      The present project specifically aims at testing the hypothesis according to which vestibular
      signals significantly influence bodily self-consciousness, in particular first-person and
      third-person perspective taking and the internal body models (i.e. the body schema and body
      image). The present project also aims at describing how cortical vestibular processing is
      modified during experimental changes of perspective taking and viewpoint. In addition, the
      present project will describe whether vestibular disorders change performances in
      third-person perspective taking tasks and modify internal body models. This should help
      understanding bodily symptoms in vestibular-defective patients. To this end, we will combine
      approaches from psychophysics and electrophysiology (electromyography,
      electroencephalography) in healthy volunteers and behavioral approached in patients with
      vestibular disorders.

      These studies should further the understanding of how the brain processes vestibular signals,
      which is to date poorly understood. In addition, the outcome of the present project should
      help understanding the multiple and complex symptoms reported by patients with vestibular
      diseases, and should therefore improve their treatment.
