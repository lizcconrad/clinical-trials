  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide tools to develop and pilot an intervention for Functional Abdominal
      Pain (FAP) using a ten session intervention with children ages 5-8. Investigators will train
      the subjects to be &quot;Feeling and Body Investigators&quot;. During treatment phases the following
      will occur 1) gather clues (learn), 2) investigate (experience: perform interoceptive mystery
      missions to explore a body sensation), 3) organize body clues (contextualize: recall other
      contexts that evoke similar sensations), and 4) go on increasingly daring missions
      (challenge: decrease avoidance and safety behaviors). The FBI intervention will be developed
      and refined in 26 child-caregiver dyads during the current R21 phase. In the R33 phase
      investigators will randomize 100 subjects with FAP to FBI or an active control group in order
      to conduct a pilot-test of the feasibility, acceptance, and clinical significance of FBI.
      Young children with FAP who complete the FBI early intervention will learn to experience
      changes in the viscera as fun and fascinating, rather than scary, and will develop new
      capacities for pain management, adaptive functioning, and emotion regulation. For the R21
      Phase (assessing initial feasibility) investigators hypothesize that ≥ 80% of participants
      enrolled in FBI will complete treatment and that ≥ 80% of participants will complete
      home-based practice assignments.

    <description>Treatment in this study refers to10 treatment sessions (4 via webcam or over cell phone video chat from the subject's home and 6 in the investigator's lab) using an acceptance-based behavioral treatment for children 5 through 8 years old with impairing functional abdominal pain. This intervention is rooted in a biopsychosocial framework incorporating advances in neurodevelopment, behavioral learning theory, and attachment theory.</description>

    <description>To access (FAP) subjects will participate in: 10 therapy sessions; and the following treatments: 1) identify strategies with unique patterns of neural circuit maturation associated with early visceral pain on the gut-brain axis: 2) adapt acceptance-based behavioral strategies used to address psychopathology in older children to younger children; and 3) incorporate caregivers as role models and facilitators based on attachment research.</description>

    <description>Investigator's ten session intervention trains children to be &quot;Feeling and Body Investigators&quot;. Half of the sessions will be done in clinic and half at home via web-camera to facilitate generalization. During the treatment child/caregiver dyads will 1) gather body clues (Learn), 2) investigate (Experience: perform interoceptive mystery missions to explore a body sensation), 3) organize body clues (Contextualize: recall other context that evoke similar sensations), and 4) go on increasingly daring missions (Challenge: decrease avoidance and safety behaviors).
If successful, young children with FAP who complete the FBI early intervention will learn to experience changes in the viscera as fun and fascinating, rather than scary, and will develop new capacities for pain management, adaptive functioning, and emotion regulation.</description>

             abdominal pain over 2 months (based on Rome III criteria), or 2) 2 or more episodes of
             abdominal pain which are causing an incapacity greater than or equal to 25% of the
