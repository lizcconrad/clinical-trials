  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no known effective treatment for recurrent/resistant neuroblastoma.

      Fenretinide is an anticancer agent that may work differently than standard chemotherapy
      medicines. It may cause the buildup of wax-like substances in neuroblastoma cancer cells,
      called &quot;ceramides&quot; or other chemicals, called 'reactive oxygen species'. In laboratory
      studies it was found that if too much ceramide or reactive oxygen species build up in
      neuroblastoma cells, they may die.

      In addition, researchers are testing to see if a drug called ketoconazole, commonly used to
      treat fungus infections, can increase fenretinide levels in the body by interfering with the
      body's ability to break down fenretinide.

      This study is being done: 1) to allow patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma
      patients who would otherwise not be able to access fenretinide/LXS oral powder for treatment
      to do so; 2) to further describe the side effects of fenretinide and ketoconazole when given
      by mouth for seven days every three weeks; 3) to determine if a patient's tumor gets smaller
      after treatment with fenretinide oral powder plus ketoconazole or fenretinide oral powder
      alone.

             made in a manner adequate to ensure patient safety.

          -  Patient must NOT receive other anti-cancer agents while on Study.

          -  Ceftriaxone (Rocephin®) is NOT permitted for 24 hours prior to the start of the oral
             fenretinide course, during the course, and for 24 hours after the completion of seven
             day fenretinide course due to concerns of possible adverse effects on the hepatic
             clearance of fenretinide. Alternative antibiotics should be used. Other cephalosporins
             are permitted.

          -  Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is NOT permitted for 24 hours prior the start of the oral
             fenretinide course, during the course, and for 48 hours following the completion of
             the seven day fenretinide course due to concerns of possible hepatic interactions.
             Ibuprofen (Motrin®) should be used for antipyretic control during this time period.

          -  Palliative radiation is allowed.

          -  Patients should NOT receive supplemental Vitamin A, C, or E except as contained in
             routine total parenteral nutrition vitamin supplements, or in a single daily standard
             dose oral multivitamin supplement, because of possible interference with antitumor
             4-HPR-induced, reactive oxygen species and/or ceramide, and due to the unknown effects
             of these drugs on retinol levels

          -  Patients must NOT take any drugs suspected of causing pseudotumor cerebri, which
             include tetracycline, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, sulfonamides (Dapsone
             permitted), lithium, amiodarone, or vitamin A (except as part of routine TPN
             supplements or as part of a single daily standard dose oral multivitamin supplement).

          -  Concomitant use of herbal supplements or other alternative therapy medications IS
             CONTRAINDICATED due to potential adverse metabolic interactions of such supplements
             with fenretinide.

          -  Patients should NOT concurrently take medications that may potentially act as
             modulators of intracellular ceramide levels or ceramide cytotoxicity, sphingolipid
             transport, or p-glycoprotein (MDR1) or MRP1 drug/lipid transporters, such as:
             cyclosporine A or analogue; verapamil; tamoxifen or analogue; chlorpromazine; RU486;
             indomethacin; or sulfinpyrazone. Patients should NOT concurrently take medications
             that are known P450 inhibitors. Contact Study Chair if there are questions regarding
             the suitability of any medication.

          -  As corticosteroids may impact sphingolipid metabolism, systemic corticosteroids should
             NOT be used for emesis control during the course of the study. Systemic
             corticosteroids for asthma control are permissible but should be minimized. Inhaled
             corticosteroids for asthma control are allowed. Steroids for routine metabolic
             deficiency states are allowed. Steroids for CNS lesions are allowed.

          -  Because gastric acidity is necessary for the maximal dissolution and absorption of
             ketoconazole, when actively taking ketoconazole, patients should avoid/minimize
             concurrent medications that decrease gastric acid output (such as ranitidine) or
             increase gastric pH (such as Tums).

          -  Concomitant medication that may prolong cardiac QT interval, especially those with
             known interaction with ketoconazole (See Appendices IV, V and VI). A LIST OF THESE
             MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT AND FAMILY - PLEASE SEE APPENDICES IV, V
             and VI FOR A LIST OF MEDICATIONS THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH CONCURRENT KETOCONAZOLE
             OR THAT SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION. Please SEE APPENDIX IV for a partial list of
             medications potentially prolonging QT interval. Patients may NOT receive therapy with
             the medications listed as PROHIBITED in Appendix IV and V. Medications in Appendix VI
             may be used with cautions as noted.

        Regulatory:

          -  Patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent
             (or assent.)

          -  All institutional, FDA, and NCI requirements for human studies must be met.
