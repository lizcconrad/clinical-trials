  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to introduce new technology and interpreter practices in the
      inpatient setting at MSKCC. We plan to install dual handset phones at the bedsides of limited
      English proficiency (LEP) patients and to assess the impact on both patient and physician
      communication effectiveness with this technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the first 5-6 weeks of the study standard of care will be conducted as usual practice
      by the medicine teams at MSKCC. It is expected that during that time they will care for at
      least 20 LEP patients who meet our inclusion criteria. There are no specific target numbers
      for any of the included languages. During the following 5-6 weeks, the phones will be
      installed by the 10 house-staff teams and approximately an additional 20 LEP patients who
      meet the protocol inclusion criteria will be enrolled. Therefore, in the first half of this
      study about 20 LEP patients and 40 practitioners (two practitioners per LEP patient) will
      provide data and the same numbers will account for the second half of the study after the
      intervention is instituted. There will be no randomization of patients or physicians. The
      only data that will be analyzed are those questions from the surveys to assess communication
      effectiveness with LEP patients. The number of patients who are interviewed will depend on
      MSKCC inpatient census at the time of study.

    <description>This is a feasibility project with the goal of improving communication between limited English proficiency (LEP )inpatients and their providers. Quantitative data will be obtained via two surveys: a patient survey to assess patients' feedback on the effectiveness of the communication during their hospital stay and their understanding of their medical care, and a provider survey to assess the handset's impact on the effectiveness of the communication. From this data we will be able to assess patient and provider communication effectiveness with both the current various practices at MSKCC and the new intervention.</description>
