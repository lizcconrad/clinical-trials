  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate breast milk composition and dietary habits of Chinese
      lactating mothers. Further understanding of the composition of human milk will help to
      understand the nutritional needs of mothers and their infants in their early phase of life
      which eventually will help to support breastfeeding.
