  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale and background: Predictive factors are needed to discriminate chemoradiotherapy
      responders from non-responders and to individualize the treatment regime. Various cytokines
      play a role in processes affecting tumour growth and metastasis. Furthermore, cytokines might
      influence treatment response. Various cytokines are abnormally expressed in colorectal cancer
      patients, are associated with colorectal cancer or determine response to chemoradiotherapy.
      Therefore the investigators want to investigate whether levels of circulating cytokines could
      predict response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesis is that the varying levels of circulating cytokines
      in the blood of rectal cancer patients may predict the response to preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy.

      Study design: This study is an explorative clinical pilot study in which the investigators
      will collect 4 ml of blood from a selection of rectal cancer patients during a regular
      venipuncture before, during and after preoperative chemoradiotherapy and before and after
      surgery. Cytokines will be measured in blood plasma and in tumour and healthy tissue from the
      resection specimen using multiplex immunoassays. Plasma cytokine measurements will be linked
      to pathological response to identify which cytokines and corresponding levels can predict
      response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
      Furthermore, blood plasma cytokine measurements before and after surgery will be compared to
      evaluate the effect of tumour resection on the immune response. In addition, preoperative
      blood plasma cytokine levels will be compared with cytokine levels in normal and tumour
      tissue to test whether circulating cytokine levels are representative for tissue cytokine
      levels.

      Study population: Thirty patients (≥18 years) with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma
      eligible for preoperative chemoradiotherapy (oral capecitabine and 45-50 gray (Gy) in total;
      fractions of 1.8-2 Gy) and surgery.

    <description>The group consists of patients aged ≥18 with a pathohistological diagnosis of locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (&lt;15 cm from the anal verge). They are found eligible for preoperative chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy: oral capecitabine / radiotherapy: 45-50 Gy in total; fractions of 1.8-2 Gy) and surgery (stage 2 or 3 rectal cancer).</description>

      An extra ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid blood tube of 4 ml will be withdrawn from the
      patient during a regular venapuncture or after administration of an intravenous needle
      specifically before, during and just after preoperative CRT, 1 day before and 2 days after
      surgery and 6 weeks after surgery. Blood samples for determination of cytokines are directly
      processed.

      As standard medical treatment surgery will be performed and biopsies of resection specimen
      will be collected by the department of pathology, frozen, and further examined. For this
      study 4 extra biopsies will be taken from resection tissue for cytokine measurements. Two
      from tumour tissue and 2 from normal mucosa of each patient. These biopsies will be
      snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, the frozen biopsies will be grinded with a
      mortar and pestle, which were cooled in liquid nitrogen, and resuspended in 100 μl ice-cold
      PBS containing 10 μl/ml of a cocktail of protease inhibitors.

        Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer diagnosed in St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein
        and Utrecht, 18 years or older, selected for preoperative chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy:
