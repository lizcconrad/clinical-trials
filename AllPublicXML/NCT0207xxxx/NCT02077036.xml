  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a new, non-pharmacological
      method that may alleviate the symptoms of narcolepsy and thereby lead to a reduction in the
      use of medications with potentially serious side effects in patients with this disease.
