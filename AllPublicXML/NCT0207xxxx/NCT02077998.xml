    <textblock>
      This phase 0/II trial studies the effect of carbon C 14 oxaliplatin in tumor tissue and blood
      and the side effects and how well oxaliplatin works in treating patients with metastatic
      breast cancer. DNA analysis of tumor tissue and blood samples from patients receiving carbon
      C 14 oxaliplatin may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment with
      oxaliplatin. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To detect the levels of oxaliplatin-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adducts induced by
      oxaliplatin microdosing in tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and
      correlate the results with patient response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of single agent oxaliplatin treatment (130mg/m^2, 2 hr intravenously
      [IV] day 1; every 3 weeks) in pre-treated, metastatic breast cancer patients.

      II. Evaluate the toxicity of oxaliplatin microdose and chemotherapy treatment in this patient
      population.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of oxaliplatin microdosing and correlate
      with the PK parameters of therapeutic oxaliplatin.

      IV. Determine whether the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin microdosing affects
      oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage and, therefore, patient response to chemotherapy.

      V. Detect repair of DNA adducts in PBMC and correlate with patient response to
      oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

      VI. Correlate the adduct and patient response data to DNA repair genes, such as excision
      repair cross-complementing (ERCC)1 levels as measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR).

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE 0: Patients receive carbon C 14 oxaliplatin IV over 2 minutes on day 1.

      PHASE II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 6 months.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of oxaliplatin-DNA adducts induced will be characterized using descriptive statistics (graphical summaries, mean, standard deviation [SD], box plots) in PBMC and tumor for responders and non-responders to chemotherapy. The mean level of oxaliplatin-DNA adducts will be compared in responders to chemotherapy to that of non-responders using a 2-sample t-test at the 0.05 level (2-sided). The Youden index will be used to estimate and compute a 95% confidence interval for the optimal cut-point in oxaliplatin-DNA adduct levels to differentiate between responders and non-responders.</description>
