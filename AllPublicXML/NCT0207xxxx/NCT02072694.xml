  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the hypothesis that a meal constituted of only glucose produces
      differences in the brain blood flow in people with obesity that are not observed in people
      without obesity. These changes, at least in part, could explain the mechanisms involved in
      maintenance or development of obesity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes after a meal challenge, measured by Single Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and statistical parametric mapping.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes after a meal challenge (time of radiopharmaceutical injection)</time_frame>
    <description>Using 99m technetium ecd radiopharmaceutical, this study aims to detect rCBF differences between SPECT images performed after a meal challenge composed by 75 grams of glucose and water and also after a challenge constituted by only water (control), both ingested orally. This approach is performed in a group of 10 people with obesity and also in 10 people without obesity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood levels mean differences within both groups, with and without obesity and across these groups, of hormones and metabolites by multiplexed assay using luminex technology and spectrophotometry, respectively.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before, at the time and 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the radiopharmaceutical injection.</time_frame>
    <description>This study looks for mean differences of blood levels within and across groups with and without obesity. The metabolites and hormones/cytokines measured are, respectively: glucose (measured by spectrophotometry), insulin, leptin, amylin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha, active ghrelin, peptide yy (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) (multiplexed assay using luminex).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resting energy expenditure (REE) and body composition measurements by indirect calorimetry and electrical bioimpedance, respectively.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours before SPECT acquisition.</time_frame>
    <description>This study also aims to measure and compare the REE by indirect calorimetry with a Quark (Cosmed, Italy) calorimeter and the body composition by Byodinamics 450 (Biodynamics Corp., United States) within the two groups and across them.</description>
