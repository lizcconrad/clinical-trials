  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of oral topical application of
      Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine Solution (ACCS) in subjects with gingivitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized blinded study will evaluate the use of ACCS in subjects with gingivitis. Two
      doses of ACCS will be used. It will be given topically intra-orally daily Monday through
      Friday for 2 weeks. In the first cohort, a low dose of ACCS or saline will be given by random
      chance. If there are no safety issues, cohort two will include a higher dose of ACCS
      randomized with saline. Pocket depth, plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding on probing
      will be assessed. To assess shifts in supragingival flora, a qualitative and quantitative
      microbial analysis will be performed for common oral bacteria. There will also be an analysis
      of inflammatory cytokines in crevicular fluid at the beginning and end of the study.
      Comparisons of adverse events and outcomes will be made between the subjects receiving low
      dose ACCS, high dose ACCS, and saline.
