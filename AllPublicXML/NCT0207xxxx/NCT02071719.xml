  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid development of agents blocking kinases has established the use of molecularly
      targeted therapy as the preferred treatment approach for patients with metastatic renal cell
      cancer (RCC). Five kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, everolimus, temsirolimus, sorafenib and
      pazopanib) are now approved for clinical use. Response rates differ among these agents,
      importantly depending on line of treatment. In first-line treatment sunitinib results in 47%
      objective response rates, where in second-line after cytokines 34% responds. Thus far, it is
      unclear which patient with advanced renal cell cancer will respond to targeted therapy. In
      order to select patients for targeted therapies, several profiling approaches have been
      explored but to date no adequate and reliable test is available. It is assumed that responses
      to targeted agents depend on specific receptor and protein signalling activities in tumor
      tissues. Therefore, we propose that protein phosphorylation profiling with phosphoproteomics
      may be a potential clinical diagnostic tool to predict for tumor response to targeted
      therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical findings associated with an unacceptably high tumor biopsy risk, according to
             the judgement of the investigator.

          -  Radiotherapy on target lesions during study or within 4 weeks of the start of drug.
