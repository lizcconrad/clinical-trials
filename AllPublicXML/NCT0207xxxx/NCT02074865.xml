  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main challenge of the ChARLI program is to assess the clinical burden of severe neonatal
      and childhood bacterial infections in low-income countries,in particular those caused by
      antibiotic resistant bacteria. This program will address both healthcare associated, as well
      as community acquired infections. Beside its main challenge, the ChARLI program will also
      allow the assessment of the economic burden of these infections, the improvement of their
      medical care and then ultimately help to set public health interventions and guide public
      health measures necessary to combat bacterial infections and bacterial resistance in
      children. It will also lead to set up more basic research investigation to better understand
      how pathogenic and epidemic may be the resistant clones in these countries and to experiment
      innovative strategies devoted to prevent these infections.

      In order to achieve these objectives, an international paediatric cohort will be created, and
      monitored a platform. This will be done first within the Institut Pasteur International
      Network (IPIN) and possibly extended in some others low income countries where the IPIN has
      no center. This constituted initiative will represent the first international pediatric
      program of its size to be located in low-income countries and specifically focusing severe
      bacterial infections and bacterial resistance to antibiotics

      At birth, for therapeutic management of the newborns in the presence of a risk factor for
      infection :gastric fluid, external auditory canal swabs, anal swabs, placental biopsy. Before
      empirical antibiotic treatment: blood cultures, blood sampling for CRP determination.In the
      presence of particular warning signs of infection chest X ray and lumbar puncture.

      During the follow-up, for therapeutic management of the newborns if the child has a suspected
      infection : urine samples, blood for blood cultures and Blood formula and C-reactive protein
      (CRP) detrmination; rhinopharyngeal fluid samples, lumbar puncture in febrile children under
      the age of three months; and thick blood smears if the child has a fever.

      Samples based on the presence of particular warning signs of infection: stool samples, eye or
      ear swabbing, chest X
