  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeted therapies are associated with (acquired) resistance after a median of 5-11 months of
      treatment, resulting in disease progression, while almost no tumors are intrinsically
      resistant in the first line setting. The investigators recently published that tumor cell
      resistance to sunitinib may be directly related to lysosomal sequestration of sunitinib. This
      resistance mechanism was shown to be transient, since a drug-free culture period could
      normalize the lysosomal storage capacity for sunitinib and resulted in recovery of drug
      sensitivity.

      In two reports it has been suggested that patients with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma who
      responded to sunitinib in the first-line setting may benefit from rechallenge with sunitinib
      after failure of second-line treatment. However, these data are retrospective. A prospective
      trial to investigate a rechallenge with sunitinib is needed to determine whether this
      strategy is of benefit for patients with mRCC with prior clinical benefit to sunitinib but
      who stopped treatment because of overt clinical resistance.
