      Manualised Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders
      is evaluated in a routine care setting to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Children
      and adolescents receive manualized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for anxiety disorder.

      It is expected, that the intervention will result in less anxiety / lower scores on the
      primary and secondary outcome measures.
