  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to calibrate the Actigraph, Respironics and CamNtech monitors,
      in a wide range of children using energy expenditure measured by respiration calorimetry.
      Energy expenditure will be predicted from the combination of heart rate and activity measured
      by accelerometry. Prediction equations for energy expenditure will be tested and validated
      against a stable isotope method called doubly labeled water for the measurement of
      free-living total energy expenditure.

      In this study, the investigators will apply advanced technology (fast-response room
      calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and
      sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques (cross-sectional time series, CSTS and
      multivariate adaptive regression splines, MARS) to develop and validate prediction models
      that capture the dynamic nature of physical activity (PA) and energy expenditure (EE) in
      preschool-aged children. CSTS and MARS models for the assessment of PA based on activity
      energy expenditure (AEE) and for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE will be developed in
      100 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method
      and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against 12-h room respiration calorimetry and
      the 7-d DLW method. In addition, the investigators will develop algorithms for the
      classification of PA levels and sleep/awake periods using statistical and machine learning
      methods and incorporate the results into our prediction models.
