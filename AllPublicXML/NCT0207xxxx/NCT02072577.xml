      METHODOLOGY:

      -Quasi-experimental research study, before and after an intervention, which was used in the
      educational video as a strategy for teaching about oral hygiene .

      INSTRUMENTS:

      1 ) tool to identify socio- demographic variables ( age, gender ),

      2) scale (zero to ten) to assess the relevance of the student attaches the oral hygiene of
      people undergoing chemotherapy ;

      3 ) instrument composed of true or false statements related to knowledge about oral hygiene
      for people undergoing chemotherapy,

      4) instrument contemplating steps that should be used for oral hygiene of the patient and the
      structures escovadas6 ; contains a list of steps to observation record the implementation of

    <description>The student watched the video prepared individually in the ward where they were interned.
After this step, the student demonstrated again the procedure for oral hygiene.
At this point the researcher also observed the sequence, movements and technical procedures used to analyze the steps of oral hygiene, using the same instrument for such employee initially.</description>
