    <textblock>
      This study will investigate pharmacological interventions between fluconazole and ibuprofen
      when they are given to premature newborn babys. This in order to find out if the drugs are
      influencing each other when they are given at the same time. The study is meant to find out
      if there are reasons to adjust the dose when fluconazole and ibuprofen are given together.

      To evaluate the effect of fluconazole and/or ibuprofen on the urinary excretion of two
      vasoactive arachidonic acid products, thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacycline (PGI2), in
      newborn infants treated with one or both of these drugs because of fungal infection
      prophylaxis and/or patent ductus arteriosis (PDA), respectively, as measurement of the
      possible interactions between these drugs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newborn infants in need of prophylaxis with fluconazole according to clinical routines
             and/or clinical indication for treatment of Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA), or newborn
             infants who are not treated with either fluconazole or ibuprofen according to the
             following study groups:

             1.1 Premature newborn infants with Gestational Age 23+0 to 26+6 weeks who are treated
             only with fluconazole.

             1.2 Premature newborn infants with Gestational Age 23+0 to 26+6 weeks who are treated
             with both fluconazole and Ibuprofen.

             1.3 Premature newborn infants with Gestational Age 27+0 to 36+6 who are treated only
             with ibuprofen.

             1.4 Premature newborn infants with Gestational Age 27+0 to 36+6 and fullterm infants
             who are not treated either with fluconazole or ibuprofen.

          2. Parents that are in command of the Swedish language and capable of understanding the
             study plan

          3. Informed written parental consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Infants who need treatment with other drugs that are metabolised by enzyme Cytochrome
             (CYP2C9) (such as phenytoin, sulphamethoxazole, fluvastatin, sildenafil, losartan,
             irbesartan, torsemide, tienilic acid), or any other enzyme involved in the metabolism
             of fluconazole and or NSAIDs, or treatment with drugs that interact with NSAIDs at the
             cyclooxygenase level, or interact with the vasal effects of the metabolic products of
             the cyclooxygenase.

          2. Infants without possibility to conceive the objectives and implications of the study
             in the opinion of the investigator.
