  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder of the dopaminergic system, combines motor
      symptoms but also non-motor, such as depression, sleep disorders and circadian rhythms and
      impaired cognitive functions. Difficulties in balancing the dopaminergic treatment of these
      patients emphasizes the need to find effective adjuvant therapies. Light therapy (LT)
      represents one such innovative therapeutic approach. Although light has an obvious to visual
      pathways within the brain, today it is known to additionally exert non-visual effects
      throughout the body. Recently our team has shown that non-visual, non-circadian light plays a
      major role in the regulation of sleep, as well as cognitive brain function in general. The
      retina, the primary conduit for the transmission of light information is weakened or thinned
      in Parkinson's patients. The dopamine system is known to enhance the processing of light
      information and intraocular injection of L-dopa in animal models of Parkinson's disease, can
      reverse associated motor symptoms. This allows for the possibility that LT would strengthen
      the dopaminergic tone in the central nervous system. However, to this date its effectiveness
      for alleviating Parkinson's symptoms has only been suggested by two studies, both poorly
      controlled. Thus, through the convergence of basic and clinical data, a study examining the
      effect of LT directly in people Parkinson's disease symptoms, whilst controlling for the
      effects on sleep, circadian system, mood, and cognitive functioning, is of extreme
      importance. With this information our hope is to determine if these polymorphisms allow for a
      predictive model of response to LT treatment.
