      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg
      comparing with goserelin plus anastrozole as first line endocrine therapy for pre- and
      perimenopausal HR+ advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premenopausal advanced breast cancer patients who failed tamoxifen treatment are possible
      good candidates for ovarian ablation/suppression and aromatase inhibitors.Fulvestrant has
      been studied little in premenopausal women despite of its attractive mechanism of actions.
      Based on this rationale, we introduced high-dose of fulvestrant with LHRH agonist as a
      randomized trial comparing with AI plus LHRH agonist.

      To assess efficacy of goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg comparing with goserelin plus
      anastrozole as first line endocrine therapy for pre- and perimenopausal HR+ advanced breast
      cancer in terms of progression-free survival(PFS)
