  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is a major cause of death among patients of east or southeast asian descent, as
      well as other population groups, notably in central and west Africa. Diagnosis of liver
      cancer requires a combination of several imaging techniques and biopsies. Despite this,
      diagnosis can remain inconclusive or difficult to establish in patients at risk for liver
      cancer.

      The purpose of this multi-center trial is to evaluate novel imaging methods developed to
      diagnose the most common form of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma. We propose to use
      novel imaging probes that have been reported to bind to liver cancers but not benign liver
      lesions that can be confused with liver cancer. Two such imaging probes will be evaluated.
      2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, called [18F]FDG, is a radioactive sugar that is widely used
      for cancer imaging with a device called positron emission tomography, or PET scans. We
      already know that [18F]FDG cannot detect some liver cancers that are slow growing.
      [18F]Fluorocholine ([18F]FCH), another molecule, has been recently reported to be highly
      effective at detecting liver cancer. In 2010, a French researcher reported 80-90% detection
      rate by using [18F]FCH alone or in combination with [18F]FDG.

      We will compare [18F]FCH and [18F]FDG in evaluating 150 patients over a period of two years.
      The results will be correlated with those of biopsies and clinical follow-up.

      This study will provide valuable data on whether these imaging agents can successfully
      differentiate malignant liver lesions from benign ones. It will also provide information
      about whether these imaging agents can successfully assess whether the cancer has spread
      outside the liver. It will provide data that will allow physicians to determine the optimal
      imaging protocol to properly diagnose liver cancer.
