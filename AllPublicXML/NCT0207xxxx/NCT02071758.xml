    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females 18 to 49 years of age.

          -  Must be in good general health as confirmed by a medical history and physical exam.

          -  Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative
             urine pregnancy test on the day of each study vaccination, must not be breast-feeding,
             and are required to use one of the following methods of contraception during the first
             3 months of the study: hormonal (e.g., oral, transdermal, intravaginal, implant, or
             injection); double barrier (i.e., condom, diaphragm with spermicide); intrauterine
             device (IUD) or system (IUS); vasectomized partner (6 months minimum); abstinence; or
             bilateral tubal ligation (if no conception post-procedure). These precautions are
             necessary due to unknown effects that LEISH-F3 + SLA-SE or LEISH-F3 + GLA-SE might
             cause in a fetus or newborn infant.

          -  The following screening laboratory values must be within the normal ranges or not
             clinically significant as determined by the PI and Medical Monitor (MM): sodium,
             potassium, BUN, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, fasting
             glucose, total WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.

          -  The following serology tests must be negative: HIV 1/2 antibody, hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.

          -  Negative urine test for recreational drugs and alcohol per Clinical Research Unit
             standards.

          -  Urinalysis not clinically significant as determined by the study clinician.

          -  Must be capable of completing a study memory aid in English.

          -  Must give informed consent, be able and willing to make all evaluation visits, be
             reachable by telephone or personal contact by the study site personnel, and have a
             permanent address.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of possible infection with Leishmania or previous exposure to Leishmania
             vaccines or experimental products containing SLA or GLA.

          -  Veterans who served in the military in the Middle East (Iran, Iraq), Afghanistan, or
             any other areas endemic to Leishmania.

          -  Travelers to, or immigrants from, areas endemic to Leishmania.

          -  Participation in another experimental protocol or receipt of any investigational
             products within the past 3 months.

          -  Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., oral or injected steroids, such as
             prednisone; high dose inhaled steroids) or cytotoxic therapies (e.g., chemotherapy
             drugs or radiation) within the past 6 months.

          -  Received a blood transfusion within the past 3 months.

          -  Donated blood products (platelets, whole blood, plasma, etc.) within past one month.

          -  Received any vaccine within past 1 month and no planned immunizations while on study
             with the exception of seasonal influenza vaccine which should not be given between Day
             0-84 or Day 138-168 due to 30-day washout period prior to immunology blood draws.

          -  History of autoimmune disease or other causes of immunosuppressive states.

          -  History or evidence of any acute or chronic illness (including cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, neurological, hepatic, rheumatic, hematological, metabolic, or renal
             disorders, controlled hypertension), or use of medication that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or
             immunogenicity of the vaccine.

          -  Rash, tattoos, or any other dermatological condition that could adversely affect the
             vaccine injection site or interfere with its evaluation.

          -  BMI, that in the opinion of the Investigator, poses a health risk.

          -  Hypertension (systolic &gt;150 or diastolic &gt;95).

          -  History of significant psychiatric illness with current use of medication.

          -  Known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse within the past 6 months.

          -  Chronic smoker (&gt; 20 pack years).

          -  Subjects with a history of previous anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction to
             vaccines, eggs, or unknown allergens.

          -  Subjects who are unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study protocol.
