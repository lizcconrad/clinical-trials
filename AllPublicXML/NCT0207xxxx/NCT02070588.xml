      This feasibility study is being conducted to determine potential associations between a broad
      range of clinical neurological symptoms and magnetic resonance images (MRI), data, and
      clinical findings involved in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

      These associations will be examined over the acute and sub-acute period (approximately 3
      months) following injury to provide information useful for optimization of MR pulse sequences
      for mTBI applications.

      Correlations exist over the sub-acute period in clinical neurological and MR data (images,
      image reads, and RAW data), which may indicate temporal evolution patterns. The intent of
      this study is to broadly generate potential biomarkers of temporal evolution of mTBI
      detectable in MR images and data (&quot;MR mTBI biomarkers&quot;).

      This hypothesis-generating feasibility study is being conducted to determine potential
      associations between a broad range of clinical neurological symptoms and MR images, data, and
      clinical findings involved in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). These associations will be
      examined over the acute and sub-acute period (approximately 3 months) following injury to
      provide information useful for optimization of MR pulse sequences for mTBI applications.

      The intent of this study is to broadly generate a range of potential mTBI biomarkers
      detectable using investigational MR pulse sequence technologies. Feasibility data attained in
      this study may be used for engineering program decision-making and in support of future
      scientific assessment, engineering development, published research databases or registries
      mTBI data and images, and other purposes determined by the Sponsor. The results of this study
      are not intended for use in regulatory submissions.

      Subjects will be examined on commercially available MR scanners using investigational or
      standard of care MR coils and a series of investigational MR Pulse Sequence sets (Application
      Packs). Each Application Pack will consist of a predetermined sequence of investigational
      pulse sequences (IPSs) optimized by GE Healthcare (GEHC) for mTBI. IPSs will be administered
      in a predetermined order as part of each Application Pack.
