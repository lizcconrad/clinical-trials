  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of four and a half days treatment of a range of doses of AZD5363 on
      selected markers of the AKT pathway and anti-proliferation compared with placebo in oestrogen
      receptor positive breast cancers.

      To assess the tolerability of four and a half days treatment of AZD5363.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal research questions to be addressed are whether (or not) AZD5363 is &quot;hitting its
      therapeutic target&quot; sufficiently and to the extent that is required to produce efficacy in
      pre-clinical experiments.

      The primary endpoint markers have been selected to determine this.

      Reductions in markers of the AKT pathway and increases in markers of anti-proliferation will
      characterise the degree of biological activity arising from the inhibition of AKT across a
      range of doses of AZD5363.
