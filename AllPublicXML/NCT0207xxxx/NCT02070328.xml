  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton therapy is a limited medical resource that is more expensive than conventional x-ray
      therapy. To correctly measure the success of proton therapy in treating different conditions,
      it is important to check a patient's health status after their treatment is finished.
      Checking on the progress of patients over many years (called long-term follow-up) is needed
      because the long-term effects of proton therapy are not well known.

      The objective of this research protocol is the development of a national Proton Therapy
      Center Registry for the purpose of:

        1. Performing retrospective research studies on diseases treated with proton therapy
           throughout the United States.

        2. Maintaining regular, lifetime contact with subjects in order to obtain current
           identification , contact information, and self/parent-reported health status in order to
           obtain a better understanding of overall treatment strategies and patient benefits of
           treatment.

        3. Permitting review of medical record information contained within the Registry to
           identify subjects who may be eligible for participation in future research studies
           conducted at the Proton Therapy Institution where the participant was treated. Obtaining
           the permission of Research Registry participants to be contacted to ascertain their
           interest in participating in future research studies being conducted at their
           participating Proton Therapy Institution for which it appears (i.e., based on medical
           information contained within the Research Registry) they may be eligible.
