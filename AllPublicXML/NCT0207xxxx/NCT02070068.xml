  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operations on the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladders are some of the most commonly performed
      abdominal operations in the United States. Cholecystectomy, removal of the gallbladder, is
      the most common of these with more than 750,000 performed annually. Injury to the common bile
      duct (CBD) during these procedures occur infrequently (approximately 0.1% to 0.5%), but it is
      an important source of patient morbidity. Serious injuries often require at least one
      surgical repair, and these repairs have variable long-term outcomes. Techniques to allow the
      visualization of the bile ducts may prevent such an injury, by providing vital information
      about the presence of gallstones in the CBD and show a surgical road map of the ducts.
      Near-infrared (NIR) cholangiography has the advantage over standard cholangiography of not
      exposing patients and healthcare providers to radiation. This technique also allows the
      superimposition of the cholangiogram onto the normal image.

      This study is being conducted to optimize an imaging technique called PINPOINT. Images will
      be obtained during clinically necessary operations. The images will be evaluated to determine
      the best method for locating and outlining the anatomy. The information learned will guide
      the future use of PINPOINT in laparoscopic procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for the study, subjects must fulfill all of the following criteria:

          1. Subjects who are healthy men or women 18 years of age or older.

          2. Subjects who are scheduled for laparoscopic biliary or hepatic operations.

          3. Subjects who sign an approved informed consent form for the study.

          4. Subjects who are willing to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Subjects with a known allergy or history of adverse reaction to ICG, iodine or iodine
             dyes.

          2. Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, have any medical condition that makes the
             subject a poor candidate for the investigational procedure, or interferes with the
             interpretation of study results.

          3. Subjects who are pregnant or lactating females.

          4. Subjects, who are actively participating in another investigational clinical study and
             who, in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion, should not be enrolled in this study.
