    <textblock>
      The trial is an open label Simon optimal two-stage Phase II trial of fixed doses of oral
      meloxicam and subcutaneous filgrastim to assess the safety and efficacy in mobilizing
      autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL) patients planning to undergo high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support.
      Clinical data regarding the cellular composition and function of the graft mobilized by this
      combination will be obtained.

    <description>The objective of this study is to investigate whether meloxicam and filgrastim can result in a 20% increase in the proportion of patients who mobilize and collect at least half of the total target CD34+ cell dose in the first apheresis. As the total target CD34 dose varies with disease, the primary objective will be as follows according to disease:
• Multiple myeloma patients: Investigate if meloxicam and filgrastim can result in an increase in the proportion of patients who mobilize and collect ≥5x106 CD34 cells/kg in the first day's apheresis, from a historical 40% to at least 60%.
• Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients: Investigate if meloxicam and filgrastim can result in an increase in the proportion of patients who mobilize and collect ≥2.5x106 CD34 cells/kg in the first day's apheresis, from a historical 50% to at least 70%.</description>

    <description>Meloxicam and Filgrastim will be administered in fixed doses to each patient enrolled on this study. The treatments will be administered in a staggered dose schedule for a total treatment duration of 7 days prior to apheresis.
15 mg tablets of Meloxicam will be taken orally for 5 consecutive days.
10 µg/kg of Filgrastim will be subcutaneously injected for 5 consecutive days. Filgrastim may be subcutaneously injected for an additional 3 days if patients do not meet the primary endpoint for cell collection.</description>
