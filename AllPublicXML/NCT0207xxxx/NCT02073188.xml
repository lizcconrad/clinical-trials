      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of iBGstar as a component of the
      diabetes treatment vs. traditional blood glucose self-monitoring system for improving
      glycemic control after 6 months in young patients with type 1 diabetes. The study is intended
      also to demonstrate the superiority of iBGStar as a component of the diabetes treatment vs.
      usual blood glucose self-monitoring system for improving the compliance to self monitoring of
      blood glucose after 6 months.

      The planned study duration will be 20 months (5 quarters) with screening/enrollment of 7
      months, followed by 2-3 weeks of a qualification phase, a 6 month experimental phase, plus a
      6 month follow-up in the post-trial observational phase.

    <description>Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose will be managed with iBGStar and iBGStar Diabetes Manager Application (App) uploaded on iPhone for all duration of the study (6 months of experimental phase plus 6-months of observational phase). In the first 3 months, the patients in Group A will send their glycemic test values and notes by mail to the physician through Diabetes Manager App every 2 weeks. Afterwards until the visit V2 (six months), the patients in Group A will send their glycemic test values and notes by mail monthly. 9 reports in total.</description>
