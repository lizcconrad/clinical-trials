  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a mobile phone application (&quot;app&quot;) for
      symptoms of depression and anxiety is practical and acceptable to young men who are attracted
      to men, and whether it reduces their anxiety and depressive symptoms. The investigators will
      also evaluate whether reductions in symptoms are maintained over a 10 week follow-up period
      after young men complete the mobile phone intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) for a 10-week,
      culturally tailored mobile phone intervention that uses principles of cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) to reduce anxiety and depression among young men who are sexually attracted to
      other males.

      The primary purpose of the RCT is to collect feedback about the intervention from the
      participants. This feedback, along with usage data on which features are used more or less
      often by the participants, and how the features are used, will be evaluated to make
      improvements to the intervention. The investigators will also assess clinical outcomes (such
      as anxiety and depressive symptoms). Outcomes will be monitored pre-, mid-, and
      post-treatment, as well as twice over a 10 week follow-up period.
