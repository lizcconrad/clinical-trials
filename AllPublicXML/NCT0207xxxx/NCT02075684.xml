  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to create a prospectively maintained, multicenter
      database of patients undergoing renal biopsy for renal masses performed percutaneously
      (through skin), via an 18 gauge biopsy needle (.048 inches). In this database, the
      investigators will collect and maintain the data from the biopsy procedure. This will allow
      us to evaluate our experience with this procedure as well as to participate in
      multi-institutional collaborative studies in the future. At University of California Irvine,
      the investigators routinely biopsy patients with renal masses under real-time ultrasound
      control. Percutaneous renal biopsy under ultrasound guidance is a routine procedure performed
      to diagnose renal mass histopathology. The safety and efficacy of this procedure has been
      well documented in the literature. The indications for percutaneous renal biopsy have
      expanded as there has been a substantial increase in the number of renal masses that are
      being diagnosed, and the acceptance of percutaneous biopsy continues to expand in parallel.
      The biopsy procedure is part of your normal standard of care and if not being done for this
      research project.

    <description>Tumor characteristics will be recorded at Baseline (from preoperative imaging) using the R.E.N.A.L.

    <description>Preprocedural and postprocedure verbal analog pain scale. Verbal analog pain scale (0 to 10) will be recorded immediately after and 60 minutes after the procedure. Additional pain assessment will be performed at a follow-up visit 3 days to 3 weeks after the procedure.</description>
