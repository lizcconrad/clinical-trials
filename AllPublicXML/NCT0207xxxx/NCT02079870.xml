  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the effect of
      semaglutide on energy intake, appetite sensations, postprandial glucose and triglyceride
      metabolism and gastric emptying in obese subjects compared with placebo.
