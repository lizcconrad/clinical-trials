  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a major health problem and ruptured AAA is a common cause
      of death in Europe and North America. A key limitation of contemporary treatment strategies
      of AAA is the lack of therapy directed at reducing expansion. Although surgical repair is an
      effective treatment for large AAA, it is associated with significant mortality and morbidity
      as well as substantial cost. The rationale for this randomized controlled study is to
      investigate whether treatment with Ticagrelor inhibits growth of small abdominal aortic
      aneurysms.
