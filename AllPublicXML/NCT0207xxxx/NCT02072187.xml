  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with depression. This study will test if a
      vitamin D supplement is helpful in patients with depression who have not found relief with
      the use of anti-depressant medication. Participants will continue to take their medication
      plus vitamin D or placebo for 8 weeks. The investigators will monitor their depression
      symptoms and the investigators think that the people taking vitamin D may have an improvement
      in their symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that deficient or insufficient levels of vitamin D may play a role in the
      pathogenesis of depression and that supplemental vitamin D may have an antidepressant effect
      -either through a direct action on the brain or though correction of a deficiency state. The
      investigators hypothesize that eight weeks of vitamin D supplementation will produce a
      statistically significant decrease in symptoms of depression compared to placebo for people
      with non-remitted depression.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Individuals will be
      recruited who have failed to achieve remission from a depressive episode after a minimum of
      eight weeks of treatment with a first-line antidepressant, at an adequate dose. They will be
      randomized to receive either placebo or vitamin D supplementation in addition to their
      anti-depressant medication, which they will continue to take at the same dose for the
      duration of the eight week study.There will be an additional follow up visit one month later.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of supplemental vitamin D as an adjunctive
      treatment in the management of non-remitted depression compared to placebo. Additionally, its
      safety and tolerability will be assessed.

      A secondary objective will be to assess the relationship between changes in serum vitamin D
      levels and mood in order to elucidate information about the role that reversal of vitamin D
      deficiency may play in the treatment of this condition.

    <description>Efficacy of the intervention will be assessed though patients' responses on several self-assessment tools. Mean changes in the scores between the Baseline visit and Week 10 will be observed. Depression will be assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale (FCPS). Anxiety will be assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS). Quality of life will be assessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS).</description>

    <description>At each weekly follow-up visit and the 30-day follow up visit, subjects will be questioned by the clinician on any adverse events related to administration of vitamin D using a non-leading question such as, &quot;Have you felt different in any way since starting the new treatment or since the last visit?&quot; In addition, all adverse experiences observed by the investigator or volunteered spontaneously by the patient will be recorded. A physical examination will be performed at Baseline, visit 10 and the Follow-up visit. Vital signs will be measured at Baseline, visit 6, visit 10 and the Follow-up visit.</description>

    <description>The vitamin D formula that will be used is Bio-D Mulsion 1000, produced by Biotics Research Corporation. This formula contains: Vitamin D (cholecalciferol), water and acacia gum and sesame oil.
Participants will be provided with a dose of vitamin D at each visit beginning at the Baseline visit. The weekly dose of vitamin D will be 28 000IU (the equivalent of 4000IU daily) for a period of eight weeks. If baseline or week 4 serum vitamin D levels are measured as &gt;100nmol/L, the dose will be reduced to 14 000IU (the equivalent of 2000IU daily). The dose will be dispensed, using the bottle dropper, onto a disposable plastic spoon which the participant will insert into their mouth.</description>

    <description>The placebo formula, also produced by Biotics Research Corporation, will contain all of the non-medicinal ingredients but no vitamin D. It will be identical in appearance and taste.
Participants will be provided with a dose of the placebo at each visit beginning at the Baseline visit. The weekly dose will be 28 drops or 14 drops if serum Vitamin D levels are &gt;100nmol/L. The dose will be dispensed, using the bottle dropper, onto a disposable plastic spoon which the participant will insert into their mouth.</description>
