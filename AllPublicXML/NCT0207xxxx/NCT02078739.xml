  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combined diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF)
      is common but often missed because of similarities in clinical presentation, risk factors,
      and patient characteristics. The concurrent presence of both diseases worsens the limitations
      in exercise capacity and quality of life that patients experience with either disease alone.
      This pilot study will test the feasibility of a yoga program conducted in patients' homes
      using multi-point interactive videoconferencing (&quot;Tele- Yoga&quot;) for patients with combined
      COPD/HF diagnoses. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive a yoga program at
      home, compared to an educational control group, will experience fewer physical symptoms and
      better quality of life.
