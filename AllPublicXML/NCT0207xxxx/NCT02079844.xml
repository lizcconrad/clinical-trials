  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cognitive impairment associated with
      schizophrenia is attenuated by add-on roflumilast administration to second generation
      antipsychotics (SGA) in participants with stable schizophrenia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is being tested as an
      add-on treatment to second generation antipsychotics (SGA) to treat cognitive impairment in
      people with stable schizophrenia. This study will look at improvement in cognitive impairment
      associated with schizophrenia in people who take roflumilast as an add-on to SGA.

      The study will enroll approximately 22 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of three treatment groupsâ€”which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need) All participants will receive the following treatments at different periods
      throughout the study:

        -  Roflumilast Dose A + SGA

        -  Roflumilast Dose B +SGA

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient + SGA.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 64 days. Participants will make 2 screening visits to the
      clinic and then must be brought to the clinic every day for dosing during each of 3 Treatment
      Periods. Each Treatment Period will be 8 days in duration. All participants will also make 1
      final visit 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Spatial Span Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Spatial Span test assesses the participant's working memory. During this task, participants are presented with a board containing blue blocks randomly arranged. The rater first taps out a pattern of blocks, beginning with two blocks and increasing with participant proficiency, and the participant is tasked with tapping the same pattern. After discontinuation of this part of the subtest, the participant is then tasked with tapping out the reverse pattern after the rater's demonstration. These patterns also begin with two blocks and increase with participant proficiency. The total score for this subtest ranges from 0 (worst) to 32 (best). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and participant nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Ventrolateral Prefrontal (VLPF) Cortex and Orbitofrontal (OFX) Cortex Activation During the Shift Trials</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD fMRI, a test that measures brain activity, was used during the Shifting Task at VLPF and OFX. Participants worked out which pair in a stimulus set consisting of a face and a building; transparent and overlapping, was the target. 1 pair appeared on the left of the screen, the other on the right. In each trial, participants indicated using a button box which side of the screen they thought the target was located on. Every second response, feedback was presented on the screen for 0.6 seconds, indicating whether or not the stimulus chosen was the target. If both of the last 2 choices were correct, the feedback was the word ''correct'' in green; otherwise, the feedback was the word ''incorrect'' in red. After 3 positive feedback events, a change of target occurred. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and participant nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Ventral Striatum Activation During the Reward Trials</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD fMRI, a test that measures brain activity, was used during the Reward Task (Monetary Incentive Delay Test). Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to a light-flash on the display screen. The flash was preceded by an arrow icon that informed participants about the consequences of their response to the flash stimulus. Four conditions were included in the paradigm, as follows:
Win condition (arrow up): win 2 pound sterling if the response was sufficiently fast.
Avoidance of loss condition (arrow down: lose 2 pound sterling if the response was too slow.
Verbal control (vertical double arrow): no gain or loss of money.
Passive control condition (horizontal double arrow): No response was required. Each of the above conditions was presented at least 10 times in a random order. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and participant nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in P300 Amplitude at the Midline Parietal Electrode (Pz)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Brain electrical activity changes were quantified with electroencephalogram (EEG) battery tests. The P300 occurs after the presentation of a novel, behaviorally relevant target stimulus embedded among irrelevant stimuli. It reflects allocation of attention and activation of immediate memory.
The amplitude of P300 indexes brain actions when the mental representation of the stimulus environment is updated, while its latency indexes stimulus classification speed unrelated to response selection processes. The participants are instructed to push a button when hearing the target stimulus, but not when hearing the standard. They are asked to press the button as fast as possible. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mismatch Negativity (MMN) Amplitude at the Midline Frontal Electrode (Fz)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>EEG, a test that measures brain electrical activity was performed during the MMN. The MMN is an auditory event related potential that is elicited by any discriminable change in auditory stimulation irrespective of the participant or participant's attention. The response to stimuli is being recorded by EEG electrodes while participants read a book. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in High Beta/Low Gamma Power During Resting EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to open and close their eyes in 30 second alternating blocks to maintain an approximately constant level of arousal. The eyes closed EEG, a test that measures brain electrical activity, is dominated by alpha (8-14Hz) and the eyes open EEG dominated by beta (14-30Hz eyes open) with the two states analyzed separately to increase sensitivity to drug effects in these bands. Ratio is calculated as High Beta/Low Gamma Power. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Frontal Theta Power (EEG) During N-Back Working Memory Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>EEG, a test that measures brain electrical activity, was performed during the n-back task. In the n-back task participants are required to monitor a series of letters and report when the current letter matches the letter n integers back, where n=1 (1-back) or n=2 (2-back), the latter requiring a greater working memory resources. The task requires continuous updating of information stores. In the 0-back condition (which does not require manipulation of material in working memory), participants respond to the appearance of a pre-specified letter. The task consists of alternating 30-second (s) blocks of 0-back with 1-back, and 2-back conditions, with letters displayed every 2 s for 1 s within each block. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Positive subscale consists of 7 items which assesses the positive symptoms with subscale score ranging from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity. Negative subscale consists of 7 items which assesses the negative symptoms with subscale score ranging from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity. General psychopathology subscale consists of 16 items which assesses the general symptoms of schizophrenia with subscale score ranging from 16 to 96, where higher score indicates greater severity. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period and treatment group as fixed effects and participant nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

             esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, or erosive esophagitis frequent occurrence
             [more than once per week] of heartburn).

         15. History of any surgical intervention known to impact absorption (eg, bariatric surgery
             or bowel resection).

             plasmapheresis), or had a transfusion of any blood product within 3 months prior to
             Day 1.

         20. Has a Screening or Day 1 of Period 1 abnormal (clinically significant)
             electrocardiogram (ECG). Entry of any participant with an abnormal (not clinically
             significant) ECG must be approved, and documented by signature by the principal
             investigator.

         21. Has abnormal Screening or Day 1 of Period 1 laboratory values that suggest a
             clinically significant underlying disease or participant with the following lab
             abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             &gt;1.5 the upper limits of normal.

         22. Has abnormal Screening or Day 1 of Period 1 vital sign values that suggest a
             clinically significant underlying disease.

         23. Has a risk of suicide according to the Investigator's clinical judgment (eg, per
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS] or has made a suicide attempt within 6
             months prior to screening visit).

         24. Has a current diagnosis of a significant psychiatric illness other than schizophrenia,

        <title>Change From Baseline in Spatial Span Test Score</title>
        <description>The Spatial Span test assesses the participantâ€™s working memory. During this task, participants are presented with a board containing blue blocks randomly arranged. The rater first taps out a pattern of blocks, beginning with two blocks and increasing with participant proficiency, and the participant is tasked with tapping the same pattern. After discontinuation of this part of the subtest, the participant is then tasked with tapping out the reverse pattern after the rater's demonstration. These patterns also begin with two blocks and increase with participant proficiency. The total score for this subtest ranges from 0 (worst) to 32 (best). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and participant nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Continuous Performance Test (CPT)</title>
        <description>The CPT is a computerized test that assesses the participantâ€™s attention and vigilance. The participant was asked to attend to digits flashing on a computer screen and to click the mouse when the same string of digits flashed consecutively. The test consisted of 3 trials: the first contained 2-digit sequences, the second contained 3-digit sequences, and the third contained 4-digit sequences. Scoring was based the number of correct hits. The total score was an average of the 3 trials. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Ventrolateral Prefrontal (VLPF) Cortex and Orbitofrontal (OFX) Cortex Activation During the Shift Trials</title>
        <description>BOLD fMRI, a test that measures brain activity, was used during the Shifting Task at VLPF and OFX. Participants worked out which pair in a stimulus set consisting of a face and a building; transparent and overlapping, was the target. 1 pair appeared on the left of the screen, the other on the right. In each trial, participants indicated using a button box which side of the screen they thought the target was located on. Every second response, feedback was presented on the screen for 0.6 seconds, indicating whether or not the stimulus chosen was the target. If both of the last 2 choices were correct, the feedback was the word â€˜â€˜correctâ€™â€™ in green; otherwise, the feedback was the word â€˜â€˜incorrectâ€™â€™ in red. After 3 positive feedback events, a change of target occurred. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and participant nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

        <description>BOLD fMRI, a test that measures brain activity, was used during the Reward Task (Monetary Incentive Delay Test). Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to a light-flash on the display screen. The flash was preceded by an arrow icon that informed participants about the consequences of their response to the flash stimulus. Four conditions were included in the paradigm, as follows:
Win condition (arrow up): win 2 pound sterling if the response was sufficiently fast.
Avoidance of loss condition (arrow down: lose 2 pound sterling if the response was too slow.
Verbal control (vertical double arrow): no gain or loss of money.
Passive control condition (horizontal double arrow): No response was required. Each of the above conditions was presented at least 10 times in a random order. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and participant nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in P300 Amplitude at the Midline Parietal Electrode (Pz)</title>
        <description>Brain electrical activity changes were quantified with electroencephalogram (EEG) battery tests. The P300 occurs after the presentation of a novel, behaviorally relevant target stimulus embedded among irrelevant stimuli. It reflects allocation of attention and activation of immediate memory.
The amplitude of P300 indexes brain actions when the mental representation of the stimulus environment is updated, while its latency indexes stimulus classification speed unrelated to response selection processes. The participants are instructed to push a button when hearing the target stimulus, but not when hearing the standard. They are asked to press the button as fast as possible. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>

        <description>Participants are asked to open and close their eyes in 30 second alternating blocks to maintain an approximately constant level of arousal. The eyes closed EEG, a test that measures brain electrical activity, is dominated by alpha (8-14Hz) and the eyes open EEG dominated by beta (14-30Hz eyes open) with the two states analyzed separately to increase sensitivity to drug effects in these bands. Ratio is calculated as High Beta/Low Gamma Power. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Frontal Theta Power (EEG) During N-Back Working Memory Task</title>
        <description>EEG, a test that measures brain electrical activity, was performed during the n-back task. In the n-back task participants are required to monitor a series of letters and report when the current letter matches the letter n integers back, where n=1 (1-back) or n=2 (2-back), the latter requiring a greater working memory resources. The task requires continuous updating of information stores. In the 0-back condition (which does not require manipulation of material in working memory), participants respond to the appearance of a pre-specified letter. The task consists of alternating 30-second (s) blocks of 0-back with 1-back, and 2-back conditions, with letters displayed every 2 s for 1 s within each block. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. ANOVA with treatment sequence, study period, and treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within treatment sequence as a random effect was used for analysis.</description>
