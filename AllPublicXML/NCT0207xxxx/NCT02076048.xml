  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to take images of the brain in order to see if long-chain
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) exposure during infancy influences brain structure and
      function in middle childhood.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LCPUFAs are essential fatty acids that are found in all cells of the body, particularly in
      the brain, retina and other nervous tissue. LCPUFAs are found naturally in seeds, nuts, fish
      and human breast milk. The body can also make LCPUFAs from shorter-chain fatty acid
      precursors.

      The researchers in the study have previously found that LCPUFA supplementation during infancy
      has a beneficial effect on vision and development in the early years of life. However,
      researchers feel there is a growing need to better understand if there are structural and/or
      functional changes in the brain that explain these benefits. It is also important to
      understand if changes in development are still present later in childhood.

    <measure>Event-Related Field (ERF) Amplitude and Latency</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We will use an MEG Event-Related Field (ERF) to study the development of children's cognitive capabilities. The waveform components associated with information processing and response inhibition will be measured in order to assess the developmental progress of LCPUFA effects with increasing age.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Regional gray and white matter brain volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Structural brain imaging is widely used to measure gray and white matter maturation patterns in young children. We will use automated, sensitive, and validated methods to test whether LCPUFA supplementation positively impacts changes in the brain associated with higher functioning and intelligence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify structural and metabolic mediators</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>In a single imaging session, we will measure metabolic biomarkers associated with cellular mechanisms such as bioenergetics, membrane status, and oxidative state, each of which have been implicated as associated with LCPUFA supplementation.</description>
