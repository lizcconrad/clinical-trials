  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botox act on nerve endings, yet there are no nerve endings inside the muscle, where they are
      typically injected. All nerves terminate on the fascia, where ASIS device can precisely
      deliver Botox by creating that subdermal bloodless space, between the skin and muscle. Thus
      enhancing and prolonging Botox's efficacy, at the same time prevent it's unnecessary adverse
      reactions and distant spread, especially since Botox has no reason to travel to the rest of
      the body any way.

      Aim 1 over 6 months will demonstrate ASIS device's consistent performance on 60 adult
      subjects with Upper limb Spasticity. Gadolinium will be injected with ASIS subdermally (30)
      or conventional intramuscularly (30) for these 7 muscle groups: Biceps Brachii, Flexor Carpi
      Radialis, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Flexor Digitorum Sublimis,
      Adductor Pollicis, and Flexor Pollicis Longus. An MRI will be taken promptly after Gadolinium
      injection, as starting reference, to which subsequent MRI taken at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs
      later will be compared for Persistent %. Since there isn't a way to measure level of
      Gadolinium within it, or any other (e.g. Botox) for that matter, at least the Prolongation of
      Gadolinium may be approximated by the greater or longer Persistent % on MRI. However, this
      approximation can only work if the variables are minimized to the same population with Upper
      limb Spasticity, and these particular 7 muscle groups. Case in point, patients with Upper
      limb Spasticity presumably have hyperactivity in these 7 muscle groups, so expectantly will
      have shortened Gadolinium intramuscularly Persistent %, and somewhat reduced Gadolinium
      subdermally Persistent % as well due to agitation, thus these Persistent % values in Upper
      limb Spasticity patients will not be like those of normal patients, or even the same between
      these 7 different muscle groups. Therefore, the Relative Prolongation Ability Score or total
      Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent % intramuscularly, will be specific and
      valuable indicators to help us modify the Botox dosage and duration to inject into that
      &quot;unknown&quot; subdermal bloodless space for Aim 2.

      Aim 2 over 12 months, using Botox, instead of Gadolinium, to demonstrate the advantages of
      ASIS device subdermally over intramuscularly, for the same 60 adult subjects with Upper limb
      Spasticity, on these particular 7 muscle groups: Biceps Brachii, Flexor Carpi Radialis,
      Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Flexor Digitorum Sublimis, Adductor
      Pollicis, and Flexor Pollicis Longus. Hypothetically speaking, if that subdermal bloodless
      space in patients with e.g., Upper limb Spasticity somehow failed to show prolongation of
      half-life for Gadolinium in Aim 1, we can still proceed with primary interest being
      therapeutic comparison for Botox in Aim 2, in terms of improvement on the Physician Global
      Assessment Scale and Ashworth score (force required to move an extremity around a joint), at
      6,12,18,24, and 30 weeks, and reduction in adverse reactions.
