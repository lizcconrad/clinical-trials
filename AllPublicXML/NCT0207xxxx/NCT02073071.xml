      Stage 1: In hospital, preterm/low birth weight infants less than or equal to 34 weeks
      gestational age at birth, birth weight of ≥ 1000g to &lt;1800g and conditions meeting the
      enrollment criteria will be fed formula with or without parenteral nutrition until discharge.
      Stage 2: Post-discharge, all infants with birth weight &lt; or =1500g will be followed on
      formula per standard of care and accepted standard of care including feeding until the
      infant's weight &gt;or= 25th percentile of growth expectation based on corrected age (P25) or
      until infant reaches 9 months corrected age.
