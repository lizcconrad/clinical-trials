      Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early onset, highly
      heritable, clinically heterogeneous, long-term impairing disorder with tremendous impact on
      individuals, families, and societies. It affects 7.5% of school-aged children in Taiwan.
      Emerging evidence has suggested that patients with ADHD may present with a deficit of
      attention, alertness and sleep disturbances. Since attention, alertness, and sleep
      disturbances may significantly increase the functional impairment of ADHD, gaining insight
      into their pathophysiology as well as into their treatment is of relevance to provide a
      better clinical management of patients suffering from ADHD. The orexin system, located in the
      hypothalamus, takes an important role in homeostatic functions, such as attention, alertness,
      sleep-wake cycle, and feeding. To our best knowledge, the functioning of the orexin system
      has never been investigated in patients with ADHD. Given the involvement of the orexin system
      in the control of alertness and reward seeking, the present study aims to examine whether
      plasma orexin and mRNA expression levels of pre-pro-orexin gene are associated with the
      symptoms and neurocognitive deficits of ADHD.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To evaluate the correlations between plasma levels of orexin A and symptoms of ADHD.

        2. To evaluate the correlations between mRNA expression levels of pre-pro-orexin gene and
           symptoms of ADHD.

        3. To evaluate the correlations between plasma levels of orexin A and neurocognitive
           dysfunction of ADHD.

        4. To evaluate the correlations between mRNA expression levels of pre-pro-orexin gene and
           neurocognitive dysfunction of ADHD.

      Subjects and Methods: Subjects in this study will be recruited from Children's Mental Health
      Center, Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). The sample will
      consist of 50 ADHD probands (aged 6 to 18 years) and 50 age- and sex- matched healthy
      controls. The phenotype measures include (1) interviews for psychopathology (K-SADS-E) and
      social functioning (SAICA), (2) self-administered questionnaires to measures ADHD symptoms
      (SNAP-IV), comorbid conditions (YSR, CBCL), and family support (Family APGAR), and (3)
      Neuropsychological tests: CPT, WISC-III, and CANTAB. Plasma orexin A and mRNA expression
      levels of pre-pro-orexin gene will be measured in all participants.

      Anticipated Results: We anticipate the identification of potential relationship between
      plasma orexin A, mRNA expression and symptoms of ADHD. In addition, this study will determine
      the association of plasma orexin A and mRNA expression with the neurocognitive deficits of
      ADHD. We hope that this study will elucidate the pathogenesis of ADHD, and orexin A will be a
      possible biomarker for this disorder. In addition, the data of orexin A and mRNA expression
      of pre-pro-orexin gene in ADHD will provide insight in developing more specific and more
      effective treatment for ADHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the proband subjects to be eligible to participate in this study, they need to fit
             the following criteria: (1) subjects have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD, or
             Hyperkinetic Disorder defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10, respectively, which was made
             by a full-time board-certificated child psychiatrist at the first visit and following
             visits; (2) their ages range from 6 to 18 when we conduct the study; (3) subjects have
             at least one biological parent; and (4) both parents are Han Chinese.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The proband subjects will be excluded from the study if they currently meet criteria
             or have a history of the following condition as defined by DSM-IV: Schizophrenia,
             Schizoaffective Disorder, Organic Psychosis, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder.
             Moreover, the subjects will also be excluded from the study if they completely cannot
             cooperate with blood withdrawal.
