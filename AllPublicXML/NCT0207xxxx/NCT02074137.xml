      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety of cabazitaxel (Jevtana) in patients with metastatic hormone
      refractory prostate cancer

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To describe the use of cabazitaxel (Jevtana) in combination with oral prednisolone for
           the treatment of patients with metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer

        2. To describe patient profile in terms of demography, disease characteristics and prior
           treatment history

        3. To describe efficacy outcomes: radiological response (if available) using Recist
           criteria V 1.1 and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) response

      The study consists of:

        -  a screening phase (maximum length of 7-day).

        -  a treatment phase with 21-day study treatment cycles. Patients continue to receive
           treatment until disease progression , death, unacceptable toxicity, investigator's
           decision or withdrawal of consent.

        -  a 30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication.
