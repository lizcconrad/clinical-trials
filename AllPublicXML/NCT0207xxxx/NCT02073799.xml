  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent literature indicated that postoperative storage symptoms after Photoselective
      vaporization of the prostate (PVP) or holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) were
      often reported and generally more common than after transurethral prostatectomy (TURP).
      However, almost all literature focused on postoperative urgency or dysuria immediately after
      PVP or HoLEP. Thus, there has been a scarcity of data on serial changes of storage symptoms
      in the postoperative period after PVP or HoLEP and data on predicting factors that influence
      improvement in storage symptoms postoperatively. The aim of this study was to compare serial
      changes of postoperative storage symptoms between PVP and HoLEP, and to identify the
      predictors that influence improvement of storage symptoms postoperatively.
