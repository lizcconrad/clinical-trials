    <textblock>
      NAFLD(non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) is a common liver disease with a high
      morbidity which seriously influence people's health. In clinical, there are two major
      Traditional chinese medicine(TCM) patterns which are the pattern of &quot;liver depression and
      spleen deficiency&quot; and pattern of &quot;damp-heat in the interior&quot;, According to TCM patterns, the
      treatment is effective, but not used worldwide. While the development of metabonomics
      provides a tool to investigate the correlation of TCM patterns and metabonomics which will
      promote the further development of TCM.

      Currently researches on NAFLD patterns based on metabolomics were limited. Our study was
      undertaken to investigate the correlation of TCM patterns and metabonomics, to evaluate the
      application of urinary metabonomics in NAFLD: whether it can be used in TCM patterns
      auxiliary classification of NAFLD. In addition, the investigators also aim to discover novel
      biomarkers for the noninvasive early diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

      In this study, urine samples from humans of three divided groups (healthy controls, the group
      of &quot;liver depression and spleen deficiency&quot; pattern and group of &quot;damp-heat in the interior
      pattern) were collected, then 4℃, 15 min 3000 rpm centrifuged and - 80℃ cryopreserved. The
      metabolic profile changes were analyzed by Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer(GC/MS) with
      principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) and
      orthogonal partial least squares-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA). Furthermore, biochemical
      examination were also carried out to compare among these three groups.

      Base on literature survey, the investigators inferred that there should be metabolic
      differences between the two patterns of NAFLD. If the investigators hypothesis is correct,
      the investigators can find different metabolites which can be used discriminate between NAFLD
      and healthy population, different patterns through urinary metabonomics.

      The results will be attractive which mean a lot: it will prove the importance of the four
      diagnosis methods of TCM used in differential analysis by metabonomics; it will validate the
      classification of TCM syndromes is scientific; it will shed light in the study of TCM
      syndromes; it will find biology markers to help diagnosis, treatment and pattern
      discrimination.

      1. Both genders between the ages of 18-60 years, eligible for study through a screening
           test confirming the presence of NAFLD according to diagnostic criteria.

        2. The patients will fill in a syndromes questionnaire for TCM information.

        3. Based on the symptoms, tongue and pulse conditions by four diagnostic information, the
           NAFLD patients will be randomized into the group of &quot;liver depression and spleen
           deficiency&quot; pattern and group of &quot;damp-heat in the interior&quot; pattern.

        4. Then urine samples of the patients will be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The existence of fat in liver parenchyma scatters the beam of ultrasound more than a
             non-fatty liver. Although ultrasonography might have some limitations for the grading
             of NAFLD, its availability makes it an appropriate tool for NAFLD screening.The
             radiologist was not informed about the clinical.

          2. NAFLD indicates the lack of any evidence of ongoing or recent consumption of
             significant quantities of alcohol.

          3. Both genders between the ages of 18-60 years, eligible for study through a screening
             test confirming the presence of NAFLD as defined above.
