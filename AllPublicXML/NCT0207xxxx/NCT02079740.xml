    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib and navitoclax
      and how well they work in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other
      places in the body. Trametinib and navitoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of trametinib in combination with navitoclax,
      and the maximal doses at which both drugs can be safely administered together. (Phase Ib) II.
      To determine the response rate of the combination of trametinib and navitoclax in subjects
      with KRAS or NRAS mutation-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors in disease-specific
      expansion cohorts. (Phase II) III. To confirm the safety and tolerability of trametinib and
      navitoclax in combination at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in the Phase 1b
      portion. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of both drugs administered together. (Phase Ib) II. To
      assess for evidence of response to therapy. (Phase Ib) III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic
      response to therapy in tumor biopsies. (Phase Ib) IV. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic
      response to therapy in tumor biopsies (first 15 patients enrolled overall). (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and navitoclax PO QD on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      If unacceptable toxicity is observed, patients may receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial;
             exception: patients with brain metastases will be allowed on study if they have

                  used as an appetite stimulant is allowed)

               -  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted; however, treatment must
                  be initiated prior to the first dose of study therapy; prophylactic use of

                  treatment of osteoporosis

               -  The concurrent use of all herbal supplements is prohibited during the study
                  (including, but not limited to, St. John's wort, kava, ephedra [ma huang], ginkgo
                  biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], yohimbe, saw palmetto, or ginseng)

                  function are excluded, with the exception of low-dose anticoagulation medications
                  (such as heparin) that are used to maintain the patency of a central intravenous
                  catheter; aspirin will not be allowed within 7 days prior to the first dose of
                  navitoclax or during navitoclax administration; however, subjects who have
                  previously received aspirin therapy for thrombosis prevention may resume a low
                  dose (i.e., maximum 100 mg QD) of aspirin if platelet counts are stable (&gt;=
                  50,000/mm^3) through 6 weeks of navitoclax administration; all decisions
                  regarding treatment with aspirin therapy will be determined by the investigator
                  in conjunction with the medical monitor

          -  Caution should be exercised when dosing navitoclax concurrently with cytochrome P450,

             C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) substrates; common CYP2C8 substrates include paclitaxel,
             statins, and glitazones, whereas CYP2C9 substrates include phenytoin and warfarin;
             when possible, investigators should switch to alternative medications or monitor the
             patients closely (particularly in the case of medications that have a narrow
             therapeutic window such as warfarin; use of warfarin is specifically prohibited while
             on study); cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inhibitors such as
             ketoconazole and clarithromycin are not allowed 7 days prior to the first dose of
             navitoclax or during navitoclax administration; as part of the enrollment/informed
             consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with
             other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the
             patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product; patient
             instructions and information of possible drug interactions will be given to all
             patients upon enrollment in this study
