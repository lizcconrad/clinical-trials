      1. To evaluate efficacy, safety, and feasibility of maintenance therapy with Cetuximab
           combined with irinotecan or fluorouracil after Cetuximab plus irinotecan and
           fluorouracil(FOLFIRI) in patients with incurable colorectal cancer.

        2. The relevant phase III studies reported that the progression free-survival of cetuximab
           combined with FOLFIRI in advanced colorectal cancer was 4.3 months up to 6.8 months.

      This study assumed that the progression free-survival was 5.1 months which was not inferior
      to the continuous chemotherapy

    <description>Initially, all subjects received 8 cycles of Cetuximab (400mg/m2 d1,250mg/m2 every week or 500mg/m2 every 2 weeks)plus FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m2 IV on day 1 , leucovorin 400mg/m2 on day 1 , fluorouracil 400mg/m2 on day 1 and fluorouracil 2400mg/m2 civ46h every 2 weeks) .
After 8 cycles or severe toxicity, patients received maintenance therapy comprising Cetuximab (250mg/m2 every week or 500mg/m2 every 2 weeks) and either irinotecan( 180 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks) or fluorouracil arm( leucovorin 400mg/m2 on day 1 , fluorouracil 400mg/m2 on day 1 and fluorouracil 2400mg/m2 civ46h every 2 weeks ). In cases of unacceptable toxicity, only the related medication was stopped</description>
