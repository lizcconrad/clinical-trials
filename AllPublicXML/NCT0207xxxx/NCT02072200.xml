      This study is multicenter, Ph IV, single arm, interventional study to assess relative
      reduction of morning stiffness of Lodotra® in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients.Study medication
      will start after study visit at baseline (week 0, visit 1) and follow-up visit will be after
      2, 6 and 12 weeks after treatment (visit 2,3,4).

      Test Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration:

      Starting dose is 10mg, and depending on the clinical symptoms and the patient's response, the
      initial dose can quickly be reduced to a lower maintenance dose. When changing over from the
      standard regimen (glucocorticoid administration in the morning) to Lodotra® administered at
      bedtime (at about 10 pm), the same dose (in mg prednisone equivalent) should be maintained,
      if the subject has taken stable dose within 30 days. Lodotra® dose cannot exceed more than
      10mg.

      Lodotra® should be taken at bedtime (at about 10 pm), with or after the evening meal and be
      swallowed whole with sufficient liquid. If more than 2 - 3 hours have passed since the
      evening meal, it is recommended to take Lodotra® with a light meal or snack.

      Modified-release tablets are not to be broken, divided or chewed.

      Treatment procedure:At Visit 1(week 0), subjects who qualify for entry into the study will
      medicated to Lodotra® starting dose of 10 mg daily. (Written informed consent has to be
      obtained, and subjects will undergo complete evaluation for study eligibility) No dose
      increase will be allowed for more than 10mg

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Morning Stiffness Duration at Week 12 as Assessed by Patient Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Data for the duration of morning stiffness will be obtained from patient diaries. Duration of morning stiffness will be from wake-up time to time of resolution of morning stiffness.
Relative reduction rate of the morning stiffness duration from baseline to Week 12 of the study drug treatment was calculated for this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Change of Baseline Severity of Morning Stiffness at Week 12 Using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a 100 mm line ranging from 0 mm (no pain) on the left end and 100 mm (worst pain) on the right end. Subjects marked on the line to indicate their pain severity. The distance in mm was measured from the left end to the subject's marking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Functional Disability Index of the Korea Health Assessment Questionnaire (KHAQ) From Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in KHAQ score from baseline to Week 12 post-treatment: KHAQ is composed of 8 functional disability indices. The scale for each index is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). Scores for each disability index were summed to obtain the total score for each subject, ranging between 0 to 24, with higher scores reflecting higher functional disability. The scores were then averaged across all subjects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are diagnosed more than 3 months

          -  Morning stiffness on previous treatment with or without oral steroids (below or equal
             to 10mg per day, methylprednisolone doses were converted into prednisone doses as
             follows: prednisone dosed=methylprednisolone dose*1.25), average daily duration of 45
             min or more.

          <title>Change of Baseline Severity of Morning Stiffness at Week 12 Using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scale</title>
          <description>The VAS is a 100 mm line ranging from 0 mm (no pain) on the left end and 100 mm (worst pain) on the right end. Subjects marked on the line to indicate their pain severity. The distance in mm was measured from the left end to the subject's marking.</description>
          <population>ITT population was 145, but 3 patients were not assessed for primary efficacy parameter of morning stiffness severity. So, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) was not done for these 3 patients after baseline . Other patients' missing data were handled using LOCF method.</population>

        <description>Change in KHAQ score from baseline to Week 12 post-treatment: KHAQ is composed of 8 functional disability indices. The scale for each index is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). Scores for each disability index were summed to obtain the total score for each subject, ranging between 0 to 24, with higher scores reflecting higher functional disability. The scores were then averaged across all subjects.</description>
