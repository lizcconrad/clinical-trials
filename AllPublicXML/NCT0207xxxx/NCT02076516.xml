      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the CORACTO®
      (Rapamycin®-Eluting coronary stent delivery system) for the treatment of up to two de novo
      lesions or restenotic post-PTCA (non-stented) lesions located in up to two epicardial native
      coronary arteries (maximum one lesion per vessel) suitable for treatment with stents from 2.5
      to 4.0 mm in diameter &lt; than 15 mm suitable for treatment with a single CORACTO® stent in a
      population of 100 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is ≥ 18 years old.

             candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

          -  Clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive functional study, stable
             angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS) 1, 2, 3 or 4) or
             unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Class IB-C, IIB-C, or IIIB-C), or silent ischemia.

          -  The target lesion(s) or target vessel(s) meet(s) all the following criteria:

               1. The target lesion is a single de novo lesion in a native coronary artery.

               2. The stenosis of target lesion(s) is ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% (by visual estimation).

               3. The target lesion length must be ≤ 15 mm. In case that a second stent should be
                  required for successful treatment, it should be a CORACTO® stent.

               4. The target reference vessel diameter must be (by visual estimation) suitable for
                  treatment with stents between 2.5 and 4.0 mm.

          -  Patient has been informed of the nature of the study, understands the study
             requirements, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as
             approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical
             site.

             visual estimation).

          -  The target lesion(s) has any of the following characteristics (by visual estimation):
