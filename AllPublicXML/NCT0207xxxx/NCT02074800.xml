  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Part 1 of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of 2 dose levels
      (1.4 and 2.8 mg/kg) of CHO-derived CNTO 328 and Sp2/0-derived CNTO 328. The purpose of Part 2
      of this study is to access the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the study medication)
      comparability of the 1.4 mg/kg dose of CHO-derived CNTO 328 and Sp2/0-derived CNTO 328.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose and randomized (study medication is assigned by chance) study. This
      study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Approximately 144 participants will
      be enrolled in this study (24 participants in Part 1 and 120 participants in Part 2). Part 1
      is the double-blind (neither physician nor participants know the treatment that the
      participant receives) and staggered parallel (a clinical study comparing the response in two
      or more groups of participants receiving different treatments) part of the study.
      Participants in Part 1 will receive either 1.4 or 2.8 mg/kg of either Sp2/0-derived CNTO 328
      or CHO-derived CNTO 328 or placebo. Part 2 is the open-label (all people know the identity of
      the intervention) part of the study. Participants in Part 2 will receive 1.4 mg/kg of either
      Sp2/0-derived or CHO-derived CNTO 328. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse
      events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory
      tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study participation
      for each participant will be approximately 199 days including a screening phase (within 30
      days before the first study medication administration) and a treatment phase (inpatient
      [hospitalization period] 12 days and outpatient [follow-up] visits up to 169 days).
