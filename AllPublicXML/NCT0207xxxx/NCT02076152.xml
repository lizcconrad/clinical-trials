      In this research study, the investigators are using FMISO-PET and MRI scans to explore the
      delivery of bevacizumab to the blood vessels in patient's with recurrent glioblastoma before
      and after treatment.

      Bevacizumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma . It works by targeting a specific protein called VEGF, which plays a
      role in promoting the growth or spreading of tumor blood vessels. Since anti-VEGF agents also
      affect normal blood vessels in the brain, they can inhibit the way other drugs used in
      combination with bevacizumab are delivered to the tumor.

      In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds
      the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells. For the PET scans in this
      research study, the investigators are using an investigational radioactive substance called
      FMISO. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the role of FMISO-PET scans is still being studied and
      that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. FMISO goes to areas with low
      oxygenation so parts of the tumor that do not have enough oxygen can be seen.

      In addition, a vascular MRI will be used to evaluate the changes in tumor blood flow, blood
      volume, and how receptive blood vessels are. This scan will be performed at the same time of
      the FMISO-PET scan.

      This study does not add any additional treatment to patients with malignant glioma who are
      already scheduled to receive bevacizumab monotherapy. All treatment decisions will be at the
      discretion of the treating physician. There will be no change in the diagnosis or management
      of the patient based on any procedures or tests carried out as a part of this study.

      If the participant chooses to take part in this research study each treatment cycle will last
      28 days.

        -  Day 1-The participant will have the following procedures done before they can receive
           bevacizumab:

             -  An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance
                Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans

             -  Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

        -  Day 14:The participant will have the following procedures done after they receive
           bevacizumab:

             -  An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance
                Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans before the participant have received bevacizumab

             -  Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

        -  Day 28: The participant will have the following procedures done after they receive
           bevacizumab:

             -  An assessment of the participant's tumor by Vascular MRI (Magnetic Resonance
                Imaging) and FMISO-PET scans after the participant has received bevacizumab

             -  Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

      FMISO-PET Scans:

        -  The participant will have the scans performed in Charlestown, MA at the Martinos Center.
           The participant will be injected with two separate intravenous (IV) injections (listed
           below). Intravenous means a need will be injected into a vein in the participant's arm.

             -  FMISO for PET scan and a contrast dye for the MRI scan

             -  Drawing blood to assess the radioactivity of FMISO

        -  The PET scan will take approximately 60-75 minutes. The participant will receive one
           injection of FMISO. Following the injection of the radiotracer, blood samples will be
           taken from the second IV line. The tracer is given through a vein (IV) and travels
           through the participant's blood and collects in organs and tissues. The participant will
           need to wait nearby as the tracer is absorbed by the their body. This takes about 90
           minutes. Then, the participant will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large
           tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET will pick up signals from the tracer and a computer will
           change the signals into 3D pictures that will be displayed on a monitor for the
           participant's study doctor to read.

      MRI Scan:

        -  MRI scans will last about 60-75 minutes. This will occur at the same time as the PET
           scan. The participant will be injected with contrast dye twice during the MRI scan. The
           participant will have 3 MRI scans (prior to starting treatment, day 1 of treatment and
           day 14 of treatment) that would not have routinely been performed if the participant
           were not participating in this study.

        -  Blood samples will be collected during both scans in order to measure how the
           participant blood vessels are processing the radiotracer FMISO and how well it is being
           delivered to the tumor tissue.

        -  The participant will be assessed for side effects via clinic visit or phone call about
           24 hours after each of the visits above.

      Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to call the participant every 3 months for
      three years after the 28 day visit to see how they are doing and if the participant is
      experiencing any side effects. If the participant is removed from the study due to an
      unacceptable side effect, the participant will be followed until it has been resolved.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma and evidence of
             recurrence. Patients with low-grade tumors who have progressed to glioblastoma are
             eligible.

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;
             10 mm. See section 10 for the evaluation of measureable disease.

          -  Only patients for whom their neuro-oncologist has planned to give bevacizumab as
             monotherapy are eligible for this study

          -  Age &gt; 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of FMISO in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study
             but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 (see Appendix A).

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL

               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL

               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance &gt; 60
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels about institutional normal.

          -  Patient must be able to undergo MRI and PET scans.

          -  Patients must be maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen for 5 days prior each
             MR-PET scan.

          -  The effects of FMISO on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because radiopharmaceuticals agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to temozolomide or FMISO.

          -  Participants who have already received anti-VEGF or experimental anti-angiogenic
             therapy for glioblastoma.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because FMISO is a radiopharmaceutical
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment
             of the mother with radiopharmaceutical agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with radiopharmaceutical agents. These potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with FMISO. In addition, these
             individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients who are no suitable to undergo MRI or use gadolinium contrast due to:

               -  Claustrophobia

               -  Presence of metallic objects or implanted medical devices in body (i.e. cardiac
                  pacemaker, aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial hearts, valves
                  with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or steel
                  implants)

               -  Sickle cell disease

               -  Renal failure

               -  Reduced renal function, as determined by creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min based
                  on a serum creatinine level obtained within 28 days prior to registration
