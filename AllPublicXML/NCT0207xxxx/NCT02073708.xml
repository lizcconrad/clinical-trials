  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One out of ten adults and up to 20 % of children in Northern Europe are diagnosed with
      asthma. Patients with onset of disease in childhood and patients with adult-onset asthma have
      in common that their symptoms can be aggravated by exposures in the workplace. Work
      exacerbated asthma (WEA) is defined as worsening of asthma due to conditions at work and is
      common with a median prevalence of 22 %. However, additional research is needed to improve
      the understanding of the risk factors, mechanisms and outcomes of WEA. Studies of difference
      in response to exposures between subgroups of asthma patients may provide new insight also
      into the phenotypic heterogeneity of asthma.

      The primary aim of the study is to estimate the incidence rate of asthma in relation to age,
      sex, socioeconomic factors and occupational exposures in a prospective study. Recently, data
      on respiratory symptoms and physician diagnosed asthma has been collected from 16.300
      inhabitants of Telemark County (baseline study). A random sample from the baseline sample of
      1000 asthma cases and 1000 controls will be asked to participate in a medical examination in
      which blood pressure, lung function and Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) will be
      measured. In addition, blood samples will be collected form analysis of inflammatory markers
      and gene sequencing. The case-control study will be repeated after five years and ten years,
      if founded (5- and 10-year follow-up).

      Hypotheses and choice of methods:

        1. In a large random sample of the population of Telemark the investigators have estimated
           the occurrence of both child-onset and adult-onset of physician diagnosed asthma.
           Childhood asthma is defined as persons with a history of physician-diagnosed asthma at
           age &gt; 18 years. The case-control study allows the identification of specific exposures
           that may be associated with an increased or decreased occurrence of asthma and
           exacerbation of disease and gives the opportunity to compare differences in these
           outcomes between those with child-onset and adult-onset of asthma. Previous studies have
           mainly used crude measures of self-reported exposure to biological dust, mineral dust,
           gas or fumes when assessing occupational exposure. This leads to a loss in precision
           when characterizing exposure. In the case-control study all asthmatics and two controls
           will receive a comprehensive questionnaire by mail and be asked to answer additional
           questions regarding occupational exposure, nutrition and physical activity. On the basis
           of the questionnaires, a job exposure matrix (JEM) will be established for each
           participant. For those who participate in the medical consultation, the questionnaires
           and the JEMs will be updated and reviewed together with the patient through structural
           interviews. An occupational hygienist will assess all occupations as being exposed, not
           exposed or &quot;uncertain or low exposed&quot; to validate the use of JEM and to ensure that the
           participants are correctly classified. The JEM is based on the Nordic matrix (NJEM) [1]
           with some changes that are more adaptable to exposure conditions in Telemark, which is
           one of the main onshore industrial centers in Norway. This will provide comprehensive
           exposure information. The use of a JEM is expected also to reduce risk of information
           bias, specifically biased reporting of exposure. Research indicates that participants
           with respiratory symptoms can over-state their exposure and those without symptoms can
           understate their exposure, biasing effect estimates away from the null [2]. The use of a
           JEM provides more objective and less biased exposure estimates than self-reports alone
           [3]. This will allow a better identification of groups at risk. Whereas the medical
           examinations will allow the assessment of severity of disease and provide the basis for
           studies of mechanisms of WEA.

        2. In the case-control study lung function, FeNO and levels of inflammatory markers in
           blood and analysis of heritability through gene sequencing will be performed. These
           outcomes will be compared in patients with child- and adult-onset asthma and with
           controls. More than 100 asthma candidate genes have been identified by genome wide
           association studies (GWAS). However, the causality of the variants detected by GWAS is
           questionable and many of the asthma candidate genes have not been replicated. This may
           in part be explained by the fact that only common genetic variants are detected by GWAS.
           Another possible explanation is that any signal has been diluted by phenotypic
           heterogeneity. Asthma is known as a heterogenic disease, and lack of clinical
           description of included asthma cases in genetic studies is recognized. The investigators
           will meet this challenge by performing a medical examination of the participants in
           combination with novel genetic methods (Next-Generation gene Sequencing). Rare variants
           can be detected by Next-Generation gene Sequencing (NGS) of the asthma candidate genes
           and may thus explain some of the &quot;missing heritability&quot; of asthma. A panel of asthma
           candidate genes will be designed, and NGS of exons and flanking intron sequences will be
           performed.

        3. The consumption of health care services associated with asthma will be estimated through
           collection of information from the case-control study participants' in relation to the
           use of health services, hospital admissions, consultations, surgery, medication, etc.
           The regional ethics committee has given permission to connect to national registers for
           disability, sick leave and unemployment to make calculations, of disability and sick
           leave. The investigators will study asthma-related sick leave and disability in relation
           to occupation and analyze the data in strata of gender, age, ethnicity, different levels
           of education and occupations. The participants will finn-inn a questionnaire regarding
           health related quality of life (HRQoL) at baseline of the case control and at
           pre-defined time intervals. Further, the investigators will measure the occurrence of
           cardiovascular diseases, fatigue, chronic fatigue, anxiety and depression since these
           variables are known to influence the patients' HRQoL. The study will provide a unique
           opportunity to report how patients with asthma experience treatment and how they cope
           with every-day life. Further, comparison of HRQoL will be made between patients with
           work-related asthma and those without work-relation. The data analysis allows also the
           identification of subgroups with poor perceived health and help to guide interventions
           to improve their situation.
