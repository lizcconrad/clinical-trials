  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grass pollen allergens are universally recognised as a major cause of allergic diseases in
      humans, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and dermatitis.

      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate allergy symptoms and allergy medication in
      subjects with grass-related rhinoconjunctivitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of moderate to severe rhinoconjunctivitis consistent with allergy to grass for
             at least 2 years.

          -  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) of at least 70% of predicted value or
             personal best if available at the Screening Visit.

          -  Perennial Rye grass or Timothy grass-specific IgE ≥ 0.35 kU/L as measured by
             ImmunoCAP®.

          -  Positive skin prick test to Perennial Rye grass or Timothy grass allergen

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive skin prick test ≥ 5 mm to any confounding, co-existing seasonal allergens
             likely to be present during the pre-season baseline and grass pollen period.

          -  Medical records of symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or asthma or a positive
             skin test ≥ 5 mm due to a perennial allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed
             (moulds, dust mites, cockroaches, and animal dander) and which cannot be avoided
             during the course of the study.

          -  Previous immunotherapy treatment with any grass allergen for more than 1 month within
             5 years prior to screening.

          -  Subjects who had been treated with any non-grass licensed allergen immunotherapy
             extracts or non-grass investigational immunotherapy for more than 1 month within 1
             year.
