    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement is one of the most commonly performed orthopedic procedures. As of
      2010, about 600,000 total knee replacements were being performed annually in the United
      States and these numbers are rising. The normal knee joint functions as a complex hinge
      allowing primarily ﬂexion and extension, rotation and gliding. The knee joint is made up of
      three compartments, the lateral, medial and anterior (patellofemoral). Damage to the
      cartilage of one or more compartments may be the result of osteoarthritis (idiopathic or
      post-traumatic), inﬂammatory arthritis (rheumatoid,psoriatic, etc.), a-vascular necrosis,
      tumors, or congenital deformities. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the causes of
      the overwhelming majority of total joint arthroplasties.

      A successful Total knee arthroplasty(TKA) surgery includes: an accurate alignment( the
      mechanical axis in axial and rotational planes), as well as significant pain relief which
      improves function and quality of life. Incorrect alignment can lead to abnormal wear,
      premature mechanical loosening of the components and patellofemoral problems.

      The common techniques for Total knee replacement are:

        1. Conventional method TKR

        2. CT/MRI-based preoperative navigated TKR

        3. Image-free intraoperative navigated TKR In our research we focus on the 3rd method using
           the Orthopilot navigation system Aesculap®, Tutlingen, Germany. This system is an active
           PC based guiding system that helps the surgeon decide on the accurate alignment and
           orientation of the implant and cutting surfaces of the bone and thus avoid incorrect
           alignment.

      We aim to compare between pre-operative and post-operative lower limb alignment (mechanical
      axis) in Aesculap based TKA using serview CT. Furthermore, we will try to examine the
      existence of a correlation between the CT scans and the Orthopilot navigation system output
      and assess the clinical outcome of the patient postoperatively.

      Our Hypothesis is that the intra-operative navigation system is accurate and correlated to CT
      images results, moreover, allows the surgeon to achieve a good mechanical axis and high
      clinical outcome,
