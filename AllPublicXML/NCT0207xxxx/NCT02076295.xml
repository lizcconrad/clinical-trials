  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment and dementia are frequent non-motor complications of moderate to
      advanced Parkinson's disease. Brain positron emission tomography (PET) study findings confirm
      post-mortem evidence that cholinergic loss is related to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's
      disease. However, current cholinergic augmentation therapy is not always effective and it
      should only target those Parkinson's disease patients who have evidence of cholinergic system
      impairment. The objective of this study is to study the association of a particular subtype
      of cholinergic receptors, so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, with cognition in
      Parkinson's disease using a novel PET marker of cholinergic system integrity.

      Parkinson's disease patients will undergo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor PET imaging with
      the radioligand [18F]flubatine and MRI on one day and extensive neuropsychological testing on
      another day. The degree of nicotinic receptor expression obtained with PET imaging will be
      correlated with the neuropsychology test results.

      Positive [18F]flubatine PET findings in this study would establish nicotinic receptors as an
      important contributor to cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and could kindle
      pharmaceutical interest in pursuing these agents for Parkinson's disease applications.

      We expect that lower nicotinic receptor expression is associated with impaired cognitive
      functioning in Parkinson's disease. In a personalized medicine approach the PET radioligand
      [18F]flubatine could serve as an important marker to identify those patients who are expected
      to benefit most from nicotinic receptor drug treatment.
