    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Avastin (bevacizumab, 5 mg/kg intravenously
      every 2 weeks) in patients with multiple myeloma, relapsed/refractory after at least 2 lines
      of prior therapy.

    <description>A complete response was defined as the disappearance of the original monoclonal protein from the blood and urine on at least 2 determinations 6 weeks apart; &lt; 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow on at least 2 determinations 6 weeks apart; if a skeletal survey is available, no increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions; and the disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas for at least 6 weeks. A partial response was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction of monoclonal protein in the blood on at least 2 determinations 6 weeks apart; if present, reduction in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion by either ≥ 90% or to &lt; 200 mg for at least 2 determinations 6 weeks apart; ≥ 50% reduction in the size of tissue plasmacytomas for at least 6 weeks; and if a skeletal survey is available, no increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions.</description>
