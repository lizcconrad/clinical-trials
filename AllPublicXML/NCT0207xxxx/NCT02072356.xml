    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies radiolabeled glass beads (yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres) in
      treating patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Internal radiation therapy uses
      radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Using
      radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be an effective treatment for liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Provide oversight to treatment with TheraSphere to eligible patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) of the liver who are not surgical resection candidates.

      II. Evaluate patient experience, toxicities and overall survival associated with TheraSphere
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intra-arterially (IA) on day 0, and may
      receive a second dose within 30-90 days of initial treatment. Patients may receive additional
      treatment 4-12 weeks after initial treatment at the discretion of the study physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6 weeks and annually for 2
      years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of intrahepatic malignancy including but not limited to HCC; the
             histopathology confirmation criterion may be waived in patients with a
             radiographically identifiable liver mass, known laboratory or clinical risk factors
             for cancer or elevated tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and clinical
             findings

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 0 - 2

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months

          -  &gt; 4 weeks since prior radiation, surgery or chemotherapy

          -  Able to comprehend and provide written informed consent in accordance with
             institutional and federal guidelines

          -  Ineligible for surgical resection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 5 times upper
             limit of normal (UNL)

          -  Serum bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl (unless segmental infusion is planned)

          -  Any contraindications to angiography and hepatic artery catheterization such as:

               -  History of severe allergy or intolerance to any contrast media, narcotics,
                  sedatives, or atropine that cannot be corrected or premedicated

               -  Bleeding diathesis, not correctable by usual forms of therapy

               -  Severe peripheral vascular disease that would preclude catheterization

          -  Evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) of
             radiation to the lungs in a single treatment

          -  Evidence of pulmonary insufficiency

          -  Evidence of any detectable technetium-99m macroaggregated serum albumin (Tc-99m MAA)
             flow to the stomach or duodenum, not correctable by using established angiographic
             techniques to stop or mitigate such flow

          -  Significant extrahepatic disease representing an imminent life-threatening outcome

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Significant underlying medical or psychiatric illness

          -  Co-morbid disease of condition that would preclude safe delivery of TheraSphere
             treatment or, in the judgment of the physician, place the patient at undue risk

          -  Pregnancy
