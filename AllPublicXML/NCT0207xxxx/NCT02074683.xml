  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of plantar fat pad atrophy may be age-related, due abnormal foot mechanics,
      steroid use, or collagen vascular disease. Displacement or atrophy of the fat pad can lead to
      osseous prominences in the forefoot that may be seen with painful skin lesions. Disease
      states, such as diabetes, may have loss of soft tissue integrity. Fat pad atrophy, regardless
      of the etiology, may result in significant pain, epidermal lesions, or metatarsalgia. In
      sensate patients, the pain can lead to emotional and physical pain, leading to productivity
      and financial losses.

      It is well documented that plantar pressure is directly correlated with plantar tissue
      thickness, with the loss of plantar fat being a fundamental mechanism for pressure related
      foot disorders.Autologous fat grafting to areas of plantar fat pad atrophy may reduce plantar
      pressures, and thus serve as a treatment for metatarsalgia, corn and callus prevention, and
      possibly ulcer prevention in diabetics. Plastic surgeons, with significant skills in fat
      grafting, can make a significant contribution.

      Current treatment modalities for fat pad atrophy include silicone injections, fat injections,
      and other temporary fillers; however, no objective studies using autologous fat have been
      performed. Approximately 30 adults who experience pain from fat pad atrophy, will have the
      option to participate. Through a randomized, controlled, cross-over study, some patients will
      receive autologous fat grafting, while some will receive standard of care podiatric
      treatment, then cross-over to fat grafting treatment after a year. Through pedobarograph and
      ultrasound assessments, the focal pedal pressure and tissue thickness following treatment
      will be documented over two years.

      We hypothesize that fat grafting for areas of increased pedal pressure in well-controlled
      diabetics will help decrease foot pressure during gait and increase soft tissue thickness on
      the foot pad, ultimately reducing pain. We also hope to demonstrate that by using autologous
      fat with evidence-based fat transfer techniques, results may be durable. This pilot study
      will help build new collaborative efforts between Foot and Ankle Surgery, Podiatry and
      Plastic Surgery, combining expertise in foot biomechanics with reconstructive fat grafting.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups and the visit schema for each group is
      delineated below. The group determination in which the subject will receive either the
      standard of care treatment or the fat grafting procedure will be determined using the
      GraphSoft random number generator function.

      Subjects will randomized to a group assignment (Either YEAR A PATHWAY with fat grafting
      procedure during year one or YEAR B PATHWAY with observational visits at 6 and 12 months with
      fat grafting procedures during year 2).

      YEAR A PATHWAY - this occurs after screening visit and upon eligibility determination

      YEAR B PATHWAY - this occurs after screening visit and upon eligibility determination. Pre-
      Operative research visits will occur at month 6 and 12 and will be concurrent to the
      subject's standard of care treatment. Visits at months 6 and 12 will be performed by a
      podiatrist as standard of care.

    <description>The specific aim of this outcomes study is to assess if fat grafting to areas of increased pedal pressure in well-controlled diabetic patients with metatarsalgia will reduce foot pressure during gait, increase the soft tissue thickness of the foot pad and ultimately reduce pain. Data from this study will help determine the durability of relief from this treatment and open the doors to additional studies using other modalities.</description>

    <description>Demonstrate that autologous fat grafting decreases pedal pressure during gait and increase plantar tissue thickness in well-controlled diabetics.
Rationale: Studies investigating silicone injections, acellular dermal graft and fat grafting demonstrated an increase in soft tissue thickness for about one year in duration. Only one study of fat transfer to the foot has been published; however, a standardized fat grafting technique was not utilized and no objective data were recorded.

    <description>Autologous fat grafting in well-controlled diabetics will demonstrate durability over time due to its biologic compatibility.
Rationale: Silicone and dermal grafts are foreign materials. Adipose tissue is abundant, inexpensive, biologically compatible and easy to harvest. The Coleman technique has refined fat graft harvesting and shows greater viability and cellular function after transplantation. This technique has not been assessed in plantar fat pad fat grafting.
Hypothesis: Fat grafting to the foot employing the Coleman technique will maintain a greater longevity of success compared to historical studies of silicone or other fillers.</description>

    <description>With decreased pedal pressure and increased tissue thickness, pain and skin lesions will be reduced in well-controlled diabetic patients with metatarsalgia.
Rationale: Plantar fat pad atrophy and limited joint mobility are risk factors increasingly associated with high foot pressures and, ultimately, pain and onset of skin lesions.
Hypothesis: Increasing soft tissue thickness and decreasing pedal pressure through autologous fat transfer in well-controlled diabetics will reduce skin lesion formation and decrease foot pain.</description>

    <description>Operative Procedure will occur after screening visit.
Fat grafting is a minimally invasive clinical procedure that has been widely used by plastic surgeons within reconstructive surgery for many years. In brief, fat tissue to be used for grafting is harvested (usually from abdomen or thighs) with a small liposuction cannula. The fat tissue is then sterilely centrifuged and allowed to decant before separating the fluid and oil layers from the fat tissue fraction. The aspirated fat is then loaded into 1cc syringes and injected into the plantar fat pad using specialized injection cannulas.
