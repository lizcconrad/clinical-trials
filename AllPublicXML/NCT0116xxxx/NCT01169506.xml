  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sublingual positioning of a silicon capillary system is applied. After 15 min, while the
      individual is in resting position with closed mouth and normal tidal breathing through the
      nose is performed, the silicon capillary system is connected to a capnometer and CO2 tension
      is measured.

      The investigators hypothesis is that this setup offers a non-invasive assessment of
      ventilatory efficiency with similar accuracy as arterial PCO2.

    <textblock>
      We have developed a new silicon capillary system for sublingual monitoring of CO2 tension in
      order to assess tissue perfusion. This set up is non-invasive, cheaper than previous
      tonometry devices and easier to apply in clinical routine. We have recruited patients with
      stable COPD and healthy individuals.

      Sublingual tonometry results were evaluated after 15 min of tidal breathing with a capnometer
      for CO2 tension. Corresponding end tidal CO2 (PETCO2)and arterial blood gas values (pH,
      PaCO2, PaCO2) were also investigated.

    <description>Stable patients with COPD and healthy individuals were asked to open their mouth and a small butterfly silicon capillary was placed sublingually. After 15 minutes, while the mouth was closed completely and nose breathing was performed, the capillary system was connected to a capnometer and sublingual tonometric PCO2 was measured. At the same time, PETCO2 was also measured and arterial blood was drawn for pH, PO2 and PCO2 analysis</description>
