  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza poses a significant threat to individual and public health, and influenza
      vaccination with a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is widely recommended to children,
      adults at risks and elderly. Due to antigenic changes of influenza viruses, the virus strains
      used in interpandemic influenza vaccines are adjusted every year according to WHO (World
      Health Organization) and CHMP (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use)
      recommendations. Following a change in the vaccine antigen composition recommendation from
      the previous season, immunogenicity and tolerability of the newly composed vaccines are
      subject of evaluation in an annual clinical trial in non-elderly adult and elderly subjects
      according to the guidelines set by EMEA (CPMP/BWP/214/96).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female volunteers of 18 years of age and older, mentally competent, willing
             and able to give written informed consent prior to study entry;

          2. Individuals able to comply with all the study requirements;

          3. Individuals in good health as determined by medical history, physical examination and
             clinical judgment of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals with behavioral or cognitive impairment or psychiatric disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to
             participate in the study;

          2. Individuals with any serious chronic or acute disease (in the judgment of the
             investigator), including but not limited to:

               1. Cancer, except for localized skin cancer;

               2. Advanced congestive heart failure;

               3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);

               4. Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis);

               5. Acute or progressive hepatic disease;

               6. Acute or progressive renal disease;

               7. Severe neurological or psychiatric disorder;

               8. Severe asthma;

          3. Individuals with history of any anaphylactic reaction and/or serious allergic reaction
             following a vaccination, a proven hypersensitivity to any component of the study
             vaccine (e.g. to ovalbumin, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza viral
             protein, polymyxin, neomycin);

          4. Individuals with known or suspected (or have a high risk of developing)
             impairment/alteration of immune function (excluding that normally associated with
             advanced age) resulting, for example, from:

               1. receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (any parenteral or oral corticosteroid or
                  cancer chemotherapy/radiotherapy) within the past 60 days and for the full length
                  of the study;
