      The primary objective is to evaluate the handling of Mepitel® One when used in acute wounds
      in home care.

      Secondary objective is to evaluate the comfort, conformability, stay-on ability, pain at
      removal, transparency of dressing and adverse events.

      The investigation is designed as an open, non-controlled, proof of concept investigation.
      Subjects with acute wounds at one centre will be included. Each subject will be followed once
      a week for 3 weeks or until healing if that occurs earlier. All dressing changes will be done
      according to clinical routine and registered in a dressing log. Cover dressing will be used
      when needed according to clinical routine.

      A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled provided that they fulfil all the inclusion criteria
      and none of the exclusion criteria and have signed and dated the written informed consent.

      The subjects will be consecutively allocated to a subject code.

      At baseline, subject characteristics will be registered together with subject status of
      health, wound history and wound status, wound characteristics and current treatment of the
      wound.

      The following variables will be measured as follows:
