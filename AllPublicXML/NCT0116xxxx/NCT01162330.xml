    <textblock>
      This study will look at the feasibility and acceptability of testing newborn babies who are
      referred after their newborn hearing screen for an infection called congenital
      Cytomegalovirus (cCMV). Around 1 in every 100 to 200 babies is born with this virus, and
      although most remain well it causes 1 in 5 cases of childhood deafness. Knowing that a baby
      is infected shortly after birth could have significant benefit since a treatment is now
      available, but screening programs need to be feasible and acceptable. This study aims to
      evaluate targeted screening for cCMV by taking samples (saliva and urine) from babies who do
      not pass their newborn hearing screening. The investigators want to see if we can find a
      quick, reliable and parentally acceptable way to screen babies who fail their hearing test
      for this virus.

    <description>Secondary outcomes.
Assess and compare the clinical utility of performing salivary and urine CMV testing on babies referred through NHSP in terms of:
rate of diagnosis of cCMV by day 21
rate of initiation of treatment, where clinically indicated, by 4 weeks of age. 2. Calculate the prevalence of cCMV in children with SNHL detected following newborn hearing screening (number per population screened)</description>

        This population this study examines is infants in Newcastle and South West London who are
        referred for more hearing tests after their neonatal hearing screen.

        This cohort of patients will be offered screening tests for congenital CMV infection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All infants 'referred' for one or both ears following hospital-based newborn hearing
             screening in North of Tyne and South West London areas. Babies with other known causes
             of SNHL (e.g. hereditary) and those admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units will be
             included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusions to this study will be infants with parents/guardians not willing/able to
             give informed consent or children known to have congenital CMV by antenatal testing or
             clinical features of CMV infection at birth.
