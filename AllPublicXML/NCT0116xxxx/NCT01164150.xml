  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative radiotherapy is internationally accepted as standard practice in the
      management of high-risk endometrial cancer1. Whilst it has no proven impact on overall
      survival it significantly increases local control.

      Conventional radiotherapy techniques (3-dimensional) utilise a 3 or 4 field beam arrangement
      to target the pelvis in order to treat those areas at risk of recurrence: the vagina, the
      parametrium and the pelvic lymph nodes. However, when using such a technique it is not
      possible to avoid irradiating sensitive normal tissues such as the bowel and bladder.

      Toxicity data from international randomised control trials in endometrial cancer report
      significantly more haematological, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and cutaneous toxicites
      (all grades) in those who received pelvic irradiation compared to those who did not2,3. These
      trials delivered radiotherapy using 2 or 3-dimensional techniques.

      Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is a newer but established radiotherapy
      technique in many tumour sites that allows us to much more tightly conform the radiation. It
      uses computer-generated beams to produce radiotherapy volumes that can avoid irradiation of
      normal tissues in the pelvis.

      There are no randomised studies reported in the literature that compare 3-dimensional pelvic
      irradiation with IMRT in patients who have had surgery for endometrial cancer. However there
      are several small studies that report considerable sparing of normal tissues using IMRT and
      when compared retrospectively with conventionally treated patients demonstrate marked
      reductions in acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity4.

      By delivering post-operative radiotherapy to the pelvis using IMRT (as opposed to the
      standard 3-dimensional technique) it is anticipated that whilst local control and survival
      will be unaffected acute and late toxicity will be reduced.
