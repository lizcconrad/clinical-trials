  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have developed in vitro systems including primary epithelial cell cultures and explant
      cultures of bronchial tissues to study the interaction between the bronchial mucosa and
      allergens. This approach involves culturing bronchial biopsies under optimal conditions and
      stimulate them with allergens thus enabling us to perform a dynamic study without the need of
      performing several bronchoscopies and will allow the testing of unapproved substances, which
      could, otherwise, not be delivered, in vivo.

      We wish to apply these ex vivo bronchial culture systems to assess cytokine release in
      moderately severe asthmatics and evaluate the effects of blocking TNF-alpha signalling using
      anti TNF-alpha monoclonal antibodies.

      Volunteers with moderately severe asthma will be recruited and carefully characterized in
      terms of lung function, asthma symptom scores, medication usage and allergen sensitivity (by
      blood and skin tests). If suitable, they will then be asked to withdraw their corticosteroids
      for a week with careful monitoring of the symptoms and peak flows before undergoing
      fibreoptic bronchoscopy as was carried out in the previous explant study. Bronchial brushings
      and biopsies will be carried out as per standard technique used in University medicine.
      Primary epithelial cell cultures will be established from bronchial brushings and will be
      used for optimising the dose of anti TNF-alpha required for inhibition of TNF-alpha induced
      responses. The biopsies will be placed in either culture medium alone, allergen extract or
      allergen extract plus anti TNF-alpha antibody and cultured for 24 hours. The biopsies will
      then be either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis of cytokines or processed for
      immunohistochemical analysis. The supernatants from each study will be recovered and analysed
      for cytokine (IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, MIP 1 alpha and RANTES) release by ELISA.
