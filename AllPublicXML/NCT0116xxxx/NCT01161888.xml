      The purpose of this study is to determine if topical imiquimod is effective in the
      pathological complete regression of lentigo maligna.

    <measure>Pathological complete regression (PCR) in the mapped biopsied and resected LM using 2 mm slices.</measure>
    <time_frame>Results available at 1-2 week post surgery follow up visit.</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical assessment of response after imiquimod treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 12 week treatment visit and 1-2 week post surgery follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The pathological response in the entire resected lesion will be compared with that predicted from clinical examination and biopsies taken before surgery, post imiquimod treatment. We will assess whether adequate surgical margins can be determined using clinical maps. It is essential to know the accuracy of the method of clinical assessment of response.</description>

    <measure>Clinical feasibility of imiquimod treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Tolerability will be assessed during treatment period of 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of reported local adverse reactions and systemic adverse reactions; adherence to treatment schedule and acceptability of imiquimod treatment.</description>

    <measure>Frequency of functional T cell responses recognising peptide epitopes in melanocyte differentiation and cancer-testis antigens.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed with baseline and 12 week visit samples.</time_frame>
    <description>Circulating immune responses to proteins expressed within melanoma will be measured using blood draws taken before imiquimod treatment and after completion of imiquimod therapy but before surgery. The demonstration of a circulating immune response would be an important finding that would strongly support the investigation of imiquimod as primary therapy for melanoma, even if coupled with subsequent surgery because of the potential for such an immune response to be preventative against recurrence or invasive disease.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of lentigo maligna (LM) (acquired pigmented macule present for more
             than 12 months with no change in skin surface texture or contour, no palpability,
             diameter &gt;10 mm, sited on the head or neck). The lower anatomical limit is the root of
             the neck - a line joining the medial end of the clavicles with the medial insertion of
             trapezius.

          -  Histological findings consistent with LM (increased numbers of atypical melanocytes
             confined to the epidermis, sun damaged skin) in one or more 4mm punch biopsies(s) from
             the darkest area, reported by a pathologist with expertise in the diagnosis of
             melanocytic lesions, and part of a recognised NHS skin cancer Multi-Disciplinary Team.

          -  The upper limit of the lesion is not defined by size, but it must be suitable for
             complete surgical excision using a 5 mm lateral margin.

          -  The outline of the lesion must be easily defined visually in daylight around its
             entire circumference.

          -  Patient fit enough and willing to undergo surgery as required by the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical or histological evidence of invasive melanoma including any palpability of
             the lesion, or clinical and/or histological evidence of regression or dermal invasion

          -  Aged less than 45 years

          -  Recurrent LM - the index lesion must not have been previously treated

          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 months

          -  Other skin lesions which may compromise the ability to complete this study, such as
             co-existing or adjacent melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer. Co-existing adjacent
             actinic keratoses would not exclude the patient from the study

          -  Women of childbearing potential, who are pregnant, plan to become pregnant during
             their study participation or breastfeeding.

          -  Unable to give informed consent.

          -  Hypersensitivity to imiquimod or to any of the excipients (methylhydroxybenzoate
             (E218), propylhydroxybenzoate (E216), cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol).

          -  Taking immunosuppressive medication.

          -  Taking part in any other intervention study.
