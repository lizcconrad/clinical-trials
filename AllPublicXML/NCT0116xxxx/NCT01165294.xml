  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop an exploratory design for future Proof-of-Concept
      trials which reliably and accurately measure the central nervous system (CNS) effects of
      potentially new drugs that oppose the effects of ketamine at a subanesthetic dose level given
      to healthy volunteers. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
      electroencephalogram (EEG) performed simultaneously during a ketamine challenge will register
      the effects triggered by Ketamine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned
      drug), placebo-controlled, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 2 way crossover
      ketamine challenge study (participants may receive different interventions sequentially
      during the trial) in 24 healthy male volunteers. For all participants, this study will
      consist of an eligibility screening examination, two 2-day treatment periods, separated by at
      least 1 week, and a follow-up examination about 7 days after last dose administration. The
      maximal study participation for each volunteer will be around 6 weeks. Apart from observing
      possible neural and vascular ketamine effects, the cerebral ketamine effects will be
      investigated by simultaneously performing fMRI/EEG during ketamine administration. These
      investigations will be done while volunteers rest as well as during cognitive testing (visual
      oddball task). Safety evaluations include continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen
      saturation. Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of ketamine the assessments will start
      after an intravenous ketamine bolus (drug given directly into the vein over a short period of
      time) followed by a 1 minute break. During the assessments there is a continuous intravenous
      (minimal) drug administration. Before the assessments start there will be an intravenous
      bolus of 0.1 mg/kg ketamine in 5 minutes time followed by a 1 minute break after which a
      continuous infusion will start of 0.015625 mg/kg/min ketamine. Since the plasma level
      elevates during the infusion the administered dose will be lowered by 10% every 10 minutes.
