      A phase IIa open-label single center pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      Nilotinib in patients with Scleroderma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how safe and tolerable a medication called Nilotinib
      (Tasigna) will be for patients diagnosed with Systemic Sclerosis. Systemic Sclerosis
      (scleroderma) is an autoimmune disease that can involve the skin, the blood vessels, the
      muscles and other connective tissues, and major organs including the lungs, kidneys,
      gastrointestinal tract, and heart. The exact cause of this disorder is not known at this time
      and no drug has been proven to cure scleroderma. Experiments done in animal models and
      &quot;test-tube&quot; models of fibrosis suggest that Nilotinib may be a useful therapy for
      scleroderma. Nilotinib is a medication on the market which has been FDA approved for the
      treatment of a type of leukemia called chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It is an oral
      medication, taken two times a day.

      This is a 32 week, open-label, Phase IIa, single center clinical trial. The primary goal of
      the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Nilotinib in patients with scleroderma.
      The secondary goal is to assess how effective Nilotinib is in treating patients with
      scleroderma. The clinical tests performed such as the Modified Rodnan Skin Score, Pulmonary
      Function Tests, Echocardiograms, Electrocardiograms, and the blood and skin collected in this
      study will help determine whether this therapy is safe and effective, and also improve our
      understanding of scleroderma.

    <description>Efficacy of Nilotinib in patients with systemic sclerosis, as defined by an improvement in the Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) The Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) measures dermal skin thickness through the examination of 17 body areas: fingers, hands, forearms, arms, feet, legs, and thighs (in pairs), and face, chest, and abdomen. The skin score is evaluated by manual palpation in each of these areas. The skin score is 0 for uninvolved skin, 1 for mild thickening, 2 for moderate thickening, and 3 for severe thickening (hidebound skin). The total skin score is the sum of the skin scores of the individual areas where the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 51. A higher score indicates greater severity of disease.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to eighteen years.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of diffuse systemic sclerosis by ACR criteria, with a stable
             modified Rodnan skin score in the one month preceding introduction of oral nilotinib
             therapy. The modified Rodnan skin score must be greater than or equal to sixteen at
             screening and initiation of therapy.

          3. Disease duration of less than or equal to 3 years as defined by the date of onset of
             the first non-Raynaud's symptom.

          4. Estimated ejection fraction of greater than 50% by echocardiography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to render informed consent in accordance with institutional guidelines.

          2. Disease duration of greater than 3 years.

          <description>The Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) measures dermal skin thickness through the examination of 17 body areas: fingers, hands, forearms, arms, feet, legs, and thighs (in pairs), and face, chest, and abdomen. In each of these areas, the skin score is evaluated by manual palpation. The skin score is 0 for uninvolved skin, 1 for mild thickening, 2 for moderate thickening, and 3 for severe thickening (hidebound skin). The total skin score is the sum of the skin scores of the individual areas. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 51. A higher score indicates greater severity of disease.</description>
