  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the safety of a single high-dose of radiation therapy before
      radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate). The investigators want to find out what
      effects, good and/or bad, the radiation will have on men undergoing prostatectomy. The
      investigators are especially interested in men who are at risk for having cancer cells that
      have spread outside the prostate.

    <intervention_name>High-Dose Single-Fraction Image-Guided Radiotherapy for Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>A baseline DCE-MRI will be obtained prior to the day of radiotherapy treatment. Immediately following the delivery of radiotherapy another DCE-MRI will be performed to assess for perfusion changes in the prostate resulting from irradiation. RP will be completed within 6 weeks (+ 2 weeks) of radiation and the RP specimen will be assessed for radiation treatment effect and other pathologic parameters (including surgical margin status) by a dedicated genitourinary pathologist. Following RP, participants will follow-up with their surgeon every 3 months for one year, with visits alternating between the urologist and the radiation oncologist. After the first year follow-up will occur at 6 month intervals until the patient is 3 years out from surgery.</description>
