  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum continues to be a global problem with devastating
      consequences. A greater understanding of the immunologic and parasitologic factors associated
      with infection and disease is badly needed, and will accelerate the development of highly
      protective vaccines for both mothers and children. Pregnancy malaria is associated with low
      birth weight, maternal anemia, and gestational hypertension, and both inflammation and the
      fetal response to infection may contribute to these poor outcomes. Childhood malaria is a
      major cause of mortality, and we have found that risk of childhood malaria is related to in
      utero exposure to pregnancy malaria, as well as other host factors like iron status and
      constitutive cytokine levels. Pregnancy malaria is caused by a distinct parasite binding
      phenotype, and as our primary hypothesis in this study we speculate that severe childhood
      malaria parasites may also have distinct features. A longitudinal cohort study will be
      conducted in Ouelessebougou, Mali an area of intense seasonal transmission. Up to 2000
      pregnant women and their infants and 2000 children ages 0 - 3 will be enrolled and followed
      to age 5 years, with clinical evaluation and periodic venous and peripheral blood samples
      obtained. In addition, 2000 febrile children up to age 10 years will be enrolled at the
      Ouelessebougou district health centers or the Gabriel Tour(SqrRoot)(Copyright) Pediatric
      Hospital in Bamako, Mali, with acute and convalescent samples being obtained and 500 pregnant
      women enrolled at the health centers and hospital in Ouelessebougou district or the Gabriel
      Tour(SqrRoot)(Copyright) Hospital in Bamako for a case-control study on pregnancy malaria and
      preeclampsia. Clinical, parasitologic and host response (including immunologic) endpoints
      will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including possible confounders, to
      determine factors associated with infection and disease in pregnant woman and young children.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A study participant must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:

          1. Pregnant women aged 15-45 years and their newborn infants who are residents of the
             district of Ouelessebougou for at least one year at the time of enrollment; OR

          2. Children aged 3 years or less, who are residents of the district of Ouelessebougou for
             at least one year at the time of enrollment; OR

          3. Febrile hospitalized children (aged 0 10 years), including those with positive and
             negative blood smears for P. falciparum in Ouelessebougou or the pediatric service of
             Gabriel Toure Hospital in Bamako and pregnant women aged 15-25 in Ouelessebougou
             district health centers or maternity unit of Gabriel Toure Hospital iin Bamako for a
             case-control study of pregnancy malaria and preeclampsia.

             Cases include women with signs/symptoms of preeclampsia. Control pregnant women
             without signs/symptoms of preeclampsia will be recruited sequentially after
             identification of individual cases, matched for parity, age (+/-2 years) and pregnancy
             trimester.

          4. The study participant or parent/guardian understands the study and gives informed
             consent for participation of themselves and/or their child and agrees to have samples
             stored.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A participant will be excluded from the study if any one or more of the following criteria
        are met:

          1. Chronic, debilitating illness, other than malaria, determined by history and physical
             examination fo mother or study participant.

          2. Conditions that in the judgment of the investigator could increase the risk to the
             volunteer.

          3. History of previous participation in a malaria vaccine trial.
