    <textblock>
      The investigators are hoping to discover the cause of chest pain in patients with a normal
      coronary arteriogram. For patients with chest pain coronary angiography is the standard
      method by which the blood vessels of the heart can be visualized and any narrowing can be
      assessed. In some cases the investigators find totally normal coronary blood vessels or only
      minor disease. Such a finding is associated with an excellent long term prognosis. However,
      as a large proportion of patients with normal coronary arteries or mild coronary narrowings
      often continue to experience recurrent chest pains the investigators are interested in
      understanding the mechanisms responsible for this. The investigators hypothesise that in many
      cases, coronary artery spasms are responsible for the recurrent chest pains. These spasms
      usually respond to treatment with drugs known as vasodilators. The acetylcholine test
      (ACH-test) has been recommended by the European Society of Cardiology and the American
      College of Cardiology as a diagnostic test. This test can reveal whether the coronary blood
      vessels have a tendency to go into spasm. The investigators plan in this study to carry out
      the test in patients who have chest pains suggestive of coronary narrowings but are found to
      have normal or only mildly narrowed coronary arteries on angiography. A positive test
      -indicating a tendency for spasm- may help guiding therapy with vasodilators, which are often
      very effective to prevent coronary spasms. The investigators would also like to take blood
      samples during the test (before and after) from every patient to measure blood markers and
      see if there is a relation between these markers and the result of the ACH-test.

      This study comprises two parts:

        1. Blood sample

        2. ACH-test (including coronary flow measurements)

      Blood will be taken, frozen and stored for up to 5 years. The following markers will be
      studied: C-reactive protein, E-selectin, neopterin, troponin and CD40 ligand. These are
      essential biochemical markers or so called pro-inflammatory substances that normally
      circulate in the blood but their levels can increase under certain conditions such as stress
      or inflammation. In addition, expansion of CD4+CD28null T-cells will be measured via flow
      cytometry.

      Coronary angiography will be performed according to routine clinical guidelines. If the
      investigators find severe disease standard treatment procedures will take place and the
      investigators will only ask for a blood sample. If the investigators find normal coronary
      arteries on coronary angiography the investigators will conduct the ACH-test as part of the
      study. After injecting ACH into the coronary arteries narrowing can occur and provoke the
      same or similar symptoms as at home (i.e. chest pain). If you experience severe pain the
      investigators will inject a drug called nitroglycerine to relieve the pain. Then the
      investigators will measure the capacity of the blood vessels to dilate with a special
      catheter. The whole procedure including coronary angiography and ACH-test will last for about
      one hour. There is only very little radiation needed for the ACH-test which is unlikely to
      cause any health problems (~2.4mSv). In some very rare cases chest pain can be prolonged and
      heart rhythm disorders can occur. In worst case prolonged narrowing can lead to a heart
      attack (myocardial infarction, &lt; 1%).

      The result of the ACH-test can lead to 3 different results.

        1. Epicardial coronary spasm. This means that the narrowing of the blood vessel occurs in a
           place where it can be seen on the screen during angiography.

        2. Microvascular dysfunction This means that the narrowing of the blood vessel cannot be
           seen on the screen but on the ECG. It only affects the very small blood vessels of the
           heart.

        3. Normal ACH-test This means that the test is normal and the patient has no chest pain
           during the test and also no narrowing.

      Depending on the result the investigators will suggest to start with a medication according
      to current guidelines and inform the patient's GP about the results and further suggestions
      for treatment. To maintain confidentiality all participants are entered onto our secure
      database using only their initials and a study number.

    <description>As this is not a follow-up study, the intracoronary vasoreactivity tests will be conducted at the day of study entry to assess which patient suffers from endothelial dysfunction. According to this result the patients will be divided into two groups (endothelial dysfunction and NO endothelial dysfunction).
Definition of endothelial dysfunction:
Vasoconstriction of &gt;75% together with ischemic ECG changes and/or reproduction of angina OR ischemic ECG changes with reproduction of angina without vasoconstriction</description>

    <description>Definition of abnormal epicardial and microvascular vasoreactivity Abnormal epicardial vasoreactivity is defined as a reduction of the baseline coronary diameter ≥75% after glyceryltrinitrate i.c. together with a reproduction of the angina symptoms reported by the patient and/or ischemic ECG-changes. Abnormal microvascular vasoreactivity is defined as the reproduction of the angina symptoms together with ischaemic ECG-changes, but without changes in epicardial vasomotion.</description>

    <description>Incremental doses of 2, 20 and 100 µg of ACH will be injected into the left coronary artery (LCA) via the diagnostic catheter for 3 minutes each. After that 80 µg of ACH will be injected into the right coronary artery. Coronary angiography will be performed after each 3 minute dose period. After the test or when intolerable chest pain due to coronary spasm occurs, 0.2 mg of glyceryltrinitrate will be injected into each vessel. During the test, heart rate, blood pressure and ECG will be monitored continuously.</description>
