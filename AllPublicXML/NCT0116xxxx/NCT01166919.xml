  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Port wine stain, also called nevus flammeus, is a congenital, cutaneous vascular malformation
      involving post-capillary venules which produces a light pink to red to dark-red-violet
      discoloration of the skin. It is estimated that Port wine stain occurs in 3 children per
      1,000 live births. Approximately 900,000 individuals in the United States and twenty million
      people worldwide have Port wine stain birthmarks .

      The purpose of this research study is to improve port wine stain treatment after Matrix
      Radiofrequency device treatment. The Matrix Radiofrequency device energy generates fractional
      deep dermal heating in the region of the electrode matrix to induce skin injury, thus
      eliciting a wound healing response. Less affected tissue surrounding the matrix points may be
      stimulated by heat which helps accelerate the healing process, while at the same time
      minimizing adverse effects such as scarring or changes in the normal skin pigmentation.

      The researcher can determine Port wine stain areas treated with the Matrix Radiofrequency
      device will have improved Port wine stain blanching responses as compared to those areas
      treated by pulsed dye laser.
