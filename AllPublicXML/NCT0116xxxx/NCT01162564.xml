  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, observational study of incisional/ventral hernia repair with NG-TSM
      laparoscopically. The study is not randomized and has a single treatment design assessing
      NG-TSM intra-operatively, its ease of use and handling characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the ease of use of NG-TSM intra-operatively in
      laparoscopic incisional/ventral hernia repair, and assessing early outcomes post-operatively
      following mesh implantation, including seroma formation, hematoma, wound complications,
      infections, early recurrences, adverse events, and subject comfort, as well as health
      economic data to include quality of life, subject satisfaction data, time of procedure,
      length of stay, re-hospitalization, and extended hospitalization.
