  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a continuous intravenous infusion of
      unfractionated heparin on the multiple-dose pharmacodynamics of palifermin in healthy adult
      subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The planned study is designed to characterize the impact of heparin on the biologic activity
      of palifermin and assess the impact of the combination of palifermin and heparin on
      tolerability. Approximately forty-three (43) eligible healthy adult men and oophorectomized
      or postmenopausal women between 18-45 years of age will be assigned to one of three treatment
      groups where treatment group A will receive a daily dose of palifermin 40 µg/kg for three
      consecutive days as intravenous (IV) bolus injections and continuous heparin IV infusion,
      treatment B will receive a daily dose of palifermin 40 µg/kg for three consecutive days as IV
      bolus injections and treatment C will be a control group without any treatment administered.
      The subjects will be randomized in a 20:15:8 ratio (Treatment A:B:C).

      The study consists of a up to 21-days screening period, a 5-days treatment period and a up to
      45-days follow-up period.

        <title>Palifermin PK Parameters: Apparent Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss)</title>
        <description>Blood samples for palifermin PK was collected pre-dose on Days 1 and 3 of the treatment period; 2, 5, 15 and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after the Day 1 and Day 3 dose of palifermin (Treatment A and Treatment B only).
Descriptive pharmacokinetic parameters for palifermin Vss was determined by linear/log trapezoidal method. Parameters was calculated from individual subject serum concentration-time data using actual subject blood collection times. Serum concentrations reported below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was treated as zero.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits sponsor a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 90 days). Sponsor may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multi-center studies, investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
