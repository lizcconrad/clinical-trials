    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the investigational drug Midostaurin in various doses given with
      ATRA and CLAG chemotherapy. Midostaurin is a FLT3 inhibitor that is activated or
      overexpressed in a significant proportion of AML patients. Research has shown that
      midostaurin and drugs like midostaurin may work better in combination with chemotherapy, like
      CLAG. CLAG is a combination of cladribine, cytarabine, and G-CSF which is approved by the FDA
      and used to treat AML.

      The main purpose of this study is to gather information about the use of a drug called
      midostaurin when given with ATRA and CLAG chemotherapy. Midostaurin is an investigational
      drug. It is a drug that inhibits FLT3 that is mutated or overexpressed in a significant
      proportion of AML patients. Research has shown that midostaurin and drugs like midostaurin
      may work better in combination with chemotherapy, like CLAG. ATRA is known to promote myeloid
      differentiation and has also been shown to augment cancer cell death in combination with
      chemotherapy. CLAG is a combination of cladribine, cytarabine, and G-CSF which is approved by
      the FDA and used to treat AML. This study will look at how safe this combination is, how you
      tolerate the treatment, and to see what dose of midostaurin is appropriate.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be ≥18 of age. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently
             available on the use of midostaurin in combination with ATRA and CLAG in patients &lt;18
             years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future
             pediatric phase 2 combination trials.

          -  Patient must be diagnosed with refractory or relapsed AML. For the purpose of the
             study, refractory AML is defined as failure to achieve CR after 2 cycles of induction
             chemotherapy or persistent &gt; 40% bone marrow blasts after one cycle of chemotherapy
             induction. Relapsed AML is defined as any evidence of disease recurrence after
             achieving CR. Early relapse is defined as relapse occurring earlier than 12 months and
             late relapse is defined as relapse occurring later than 12 months.

          -  Patient must have a Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥ 70% (unless poor performance
             status is related to the disease).

          -  Patient must have the following laboratory values:

               -  AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN),

               -  Serum Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN,

               -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN. Laboratory values can be outside this range if
                  secondary to AML disease.

          -  Patient must able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document prior to registration on study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not have newly diagnosed AML.

          -  Patient must not have known CNS leukemia

          -  Patient must not have a history of allergic reactions to compounds of similar chemical
             or biologic composition to midostaurin or other agents used in the study.

          -  Patient must not have any uncontrolled or intercurrent illness including, but not
             limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction within 6 months,
             poorly controlled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal disease, or
             psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Patient must not have any condition, including the presence of laboratory
             abnormalities, which places him/her at unacceptable risk if s/he were to participate
             in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Patient may not concurrently use other anti-cancer agents or treatments (with the
             exceptions of hydroxyurea, steroids, and leukopheresis).

          -  Female patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Adults of reproductive potential must employ an effective method of birth control.
             Barrier contraceptives must be used throughout the study in both sexes. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 48 hours prior to
             administration of midostaurin. Women considered not of childbearing potential include
             any of the following: no menses for at least 5 years; menses within 5 years but
             amenorrheic for at least 2 months and luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular

                  days of Day 1.

          -  Patients must not have a known confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection or active viral
             hepatitis.

          -  Patient may not have received any investigational agent within 30 days prior to Day 1.
             Patient may not be receiving any other investigational agents while on this trial.

          -  Patients must not have had any surgical procedure, excluding central venous catheter
             placement or other minor procedures (e.g. skin biopsy) within 14 days of Day 1.

          -  Patients must not have any pulmonary infiltrate, including those suspected to be of
             infectious origin. In particular, patients with resolution of clinical symptoms of
             pulmonary infection but with residual pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray are not
             eligible until pulmonary infiltrates have completely resolved.
