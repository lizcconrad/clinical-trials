  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a new diagnostic method for developmental disorders
      based on behavior recording during the interview of the subjects by medical staff as well
      anonymous persons. The behavior recording by video camera will be accompanied by non-invasive
      physiological recordings, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG),
      electromyogram (EMG), and body temperature using infrared (IR) thermograph. Thus, the
      physiologically relevant and the disorder correlated behavior parameters could be extracted
      and used as new diagnostic markers. If necessary, the medical staff may take blood sample
      from the subject before and after the interview. For the longitudinal study, the similar
      interview and the recording of the same subject will be planned to evaluate the effect of the
      medical and educational intervention. The investigators also examine the synergistic effect
      of the intervention and the administration of the supplement (e.g., vitamin D, arachidonic
      acid, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ-10)). The clinician may use Risperidone.

      Case 1:The investigators started the intervention and supplementation of arachidonic acid for
      3 patients diagnosed as autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) from September 4, 2010 at Sawa
      hospital (Osaka, Japan). Another ASD patients (n=5) at Sawa hospital were treated by
      administration of Risperidone as medicinal drink from January 14, 2011. The supplementation
      as well as Risperidone administration followed double-blind placebo controlled cross-over
      protocol to access the effect of the treatment. These trials will continue until November
      2011. Final outcome will be evaluated by clinical diagnosis and behavior parameters
      measurement as described under Brief Summary.

      Case 2: The investigators started the intervention and supplementation of reduced form of
      CoQ10 for learning disability children (n=20) at small private cramming school (JIZAI-ken,
      Tokyo) from February 5, 2011. This trial will continue until October 2011. The effect of the
      intervention and supplementation will be evaluated by behavior parameter measurement as
      described above.
