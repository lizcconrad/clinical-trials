      Objective: To evaluate real acupuncture, as compare to sham acupuncture, in improving
      persistent sleep difficulties in veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) Design:
      Randomized, blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial Setting: Outpatient clinic at a major VA
      medical center in Southeast USA Participants: Sixty veterans aged 24-55 (mean 40) with
      history of mTBI at least 3-month and beyond, suffering from sleep difficulties refractory to
      regular care and sleep education, as indicated by a global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      (PSQI) score of 14.25 + 3.23 pre-intervention (baseline). They were randomized into 2 groups,
      real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, and stratified by Post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) diagnosed by PTSD CheckList - Military Version (PCL-M).

      Intervention: Real or sham acupuncture with both standardized and individualized acupoints
      selection. All subjects were informed that the treatments, if effective, may improve symptoms
      such as pain, anxiety or depression other than sleep; real acupuncture may not be effective
      in some individuals, and sham acupuncture may as well be effective by mind-body interactions.

      Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure was global PSQI score change after intervention as
      compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measure was wrist-actigraphy sleep latency, sleep
      efficiency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep duration. PTSD was analyzed as a
      co-variant.

    <description>change of global PSQI score as compared to baseline The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval.
The PSQI global score has a possible range of 0-21 points. Any score above 5 is considered insomnia. The higher the score the worse the condition.</description>

    <measure>Wrist Actigraphy (an Objective Sleep Measure) Sleep Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, post-intervention (1wk of recording each)</time_frame>
    <description>Wrist actigraphy is a non-invasive method of continuously monitoring gross body activities when a watch-like actimetry sensor is worn at the non-dominant wrist. An algorithm has been developed to assess sleep/wake behavior. Specifically in this study, we used Respironics® actiwatches for data collection. Subjects were asked to wear the actiwatches for a consecutive week at baseline and then at post-intervention, and the actiwatches were taken off only during showers. Wrist actigraphy was examined in association with sleep diary the subjects were to keep for the weeks of monitoring. Threshold-based method algorithm for data interpretation was provided by Respironics® Actiware Software. Medium level threshold was set to detect Wake and Sleep; sleep interval detection algorithm was set for 3 minutes of immobile minutes for Sleep Onset and 5 minutes of immobile minutes for Sleep End. Sleep efficiency is sleep duration divided by total bed time (both in minutes), times 100%.</description>

          <title>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</title>
          <description>In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. Only global PSQI scores were used for this study.</description>

        <description>change of global PSQI score as compared to baseline The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval.
The PSQI global score has a possible range of 0–21 points. Any score above 5 is considered insomnia. The higher the score the worse the condition.</description>

Sham Acupuncture: Treatments will be performed by the PI, who is a licensed physician acupuncturist and has practiced acupuncture independently for 5 years with about 4000 patient/visit treatment history. A total of 10 acupuncture treatments represent a reasonable approach to optimal duration of treatment. Acupoint selection will be based on a combination of standardization and individualization for best treatment effects. At least 5 standardized body and auricular acupoints will be selected. Standardized sterile, disposable acupuncture needles will be applied for 20 minutes. Each sham or real acupuncture needle will be applied through a tube as sham needles have blunt tip and telescopic shaft, the visual effect and percutaneous sensation of sham needle mimic the real needle penetration.</description>

        <title>Wrist Actigraphy (an Objective Sleep Measure) Sleep Efficiency</title>
        <description>Wrist actigraphy is a non-invasive method of continuously monitoring gross body activities when a watch-like actimetry sensor is worn at the non-dominant wrist. An algorithm has been developed to assess sleep/wake behavior. Specifically in this study, we used Respironics® actiwatches for data collection. Subjects were asked to wear the actiwatches for a consecutive week at baseline and then at post-intervention, and the actiwatches were taken off only during showers. Wrist actigraphy was examined in association with sleep diary the subjects were to keep for the weeks of monitoring. Threshold-based method algorithm for data interpretation was provided by Respironics® Actiware Software. Medium level threshold was set to detect Wake and Sleep; sleep interval detection algorithm was set for 3 minutes of immobile minutes for Sleep Onset and 5 minutes of immobile minutes for Sleep End. Sleep efficiency is sleep duration divided by total bed time (both in minutes), times 100%.</description>
        <time_frame>pre-intervention, post-intervention (1wk of recording each)</time_frame>
        <population>All obtained actigraphy data were analyzed. This form doesn't allow specific indication of sample sizes. Therefore, here overall numbers of participants analyzed were the same as the maximal potential.</population>
