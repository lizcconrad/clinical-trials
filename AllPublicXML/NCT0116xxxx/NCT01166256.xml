  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may require invasive mechanical ventilation. However,
      invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with a variety of complications. Non-invasive
      ventilation has been presented as an alternative treatment but controversy remains. The
      investigators hypothesize that high-flow nasal cannula system is effective enough to prevent
      intubation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and not inferior to non-invasive
      ventilation.
