      The EUM100pro (Electrical Uterine Monitor)is a uterine contraction monitor which measures
      uterine contractions based on the electrical activity of the uterine muscle.The study will
      compare the EUM100pro measurements to the already existing uterine contractions monitors
      (tocodynamometer and Intra Uterine Pressure Catheter) in pregnant women with complaints of
      uterine contractions.

      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate that the EUM100pro is as good as the
      current methods for monitoring pregnancy in labor (tocodynamometer, IUPC) in measuring
      uterine contractions. This will be performed by measuring the expectancy of time differences
      between the tocodynamometer/IUPC and the EUM in the beginning, end, peak and duration of each
      contraction. A good correlation will be 0.9 and significance of 95%.

      100 women will be recruited to the study. The measurement with the EUM100pro will not
      interfere with the usual clinical care, meaning- the EUM100pro will be used in addition to
      the standard care and monitoring.
