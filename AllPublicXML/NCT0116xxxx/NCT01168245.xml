  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine if combined treatment with TMS and cognitive training
      (CoTra) for several weeks can produce a sustained improvement in cognitive and behavioral
      symptomatology of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current available pharmaceutical treatment for Alzheimer Disease (AD) is only partially
      and temporary effective. Therefore, new approaches are needed. rTMS is a non-invasive
      technique which generates a small electric current that induces a modulation in cortical
      excitability. In addition, cognitive training was suggested to improve cognitive functions in
      Alzheimer patients.

      In this study we intend to treat mild to moderate AD patients with rTMS interlaced with
      cognitive training (rTMS- COG).

      Patients with probable AD will be treated with rTMS-COG daily for 6 weeks followed by
      maintenance sessions for additional 3 months.
