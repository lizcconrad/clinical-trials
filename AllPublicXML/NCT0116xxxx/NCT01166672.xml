      The purpose of this study is to establish feasiblity of recruiting obese breast cancer
      survivors at the end of treatment, getting those survivors to lose weight and attend
      follow-up visits for 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer related lymphedema occurs in 20-30% of survivors. Weight loss could prevent
      onset. We seek to do a pilot study to establish feasibility of 1) recruiting survivors at
      risk for lymphedema to do a weight loss intervention, 2) achieving 10-15% weight loss over 26
      weeks in this population, and 3) attendance at follow-up visits 6 months.
