    <textblock>
      A randomized two-way crossover study to determine whether concomitant administration of CYP
      P450 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole and fluticasone furoate/GW642444M combination significantly
      increases the systemic effects and exposure to repeat dose fluticasone furoate and/or
      GW642444 in healthy subjects. Key assessments will include blood potassium, heart rate, blood
      pressure, QTc, serum cortisol and pharmacokinetic parameters, and safety including vital
      signs, ECGs, adverse event monitoring and laboratory safety tests, including blood glucose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, randomized, double-blind (with respect to ketoconazole),
      two-way cross-over study in healthy male and female subjects. Subjects will attend for a
      screening visit within 28 days prior to the first treatment period. There will be two study
      periods, each consisting of 14 days. Ketoconazole or matching placebo will be administered
      for 11 days with fluticasone furoate/GW642444M inhalation powder co-administered on Days
      5-11. During each period subjects will be required to report to the unit on Day -1 and will
      remain there until 1 hour post-dosing with ketoconazole or placebo on Day 1. Subjects will
      return to the unit on the mornings of Day 2 to Day 4 for dosing with ketoconazole or placebo.
      Subjects will then return on the evening of Day 4 and leave the unit on the morning of Day 6
      (2 nights). Subjects will return to the unit on the mornings of Day 7 to Day 10 for dosing
      and pre-fluticasone furoate/GW642444M dose safety assessments. Subjects will return on the
      evening of Day 10 and leave the unit on the morning of Day 12 (2 nights). Subjects will make
      two outpatient visits, one in the evening on Day 12 and one in the morning on Day 13, to
      complete a few study related procedures. The two treatment periods will be separated by a
      washout of at least 7 days and no more than 14 days. Pharmacodynamic profiles for potassium,
      heart rate, QTc, blood pressure and serum cortisol will be taken on Day 11 with fluticasone
      furoate and GW642444 pharmacokinetic profiles on Days 5 and 11. Safety assessments will
      include vital signs, ECGs, adverse event monitoring and laboratory safety tests, plus blood
      glucose and blood potassium profiles on Day 5.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive

          2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
                  contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until completion of the follow-up visit.

          3. Body mass index within range of 18.5-29.0 kg/m2 inclusive.

          4. Subjects who are current non-smokers, who have not used any tobacco products in the 12
             month period preceding the screening visit, and have a pack history of &lt;/= 5 pack
             years.

          5. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN
             is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          6. No significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening, including the following
             specific requirements:

               -  QTcF &lt; 450 msec

          7. No clinically significant abnormality on the Holter ECG at screening.

          8. FEV1 &gt;/= 85% predicted at screening.

          9. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

         10. Able to satisfactorily use the dry powder inhaler.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigations,
             the principal investigator or delegate physician deems the subject unsuitable for the
             study. Subjects must not have a systolic blood pressure above 145 mmHg or a diastolic
             pressure above 85 mmHg unless the Investigator confirms that it is satisfactory for
             their age.

          2. The subject has any history of breathing problems in adult life (i.e. history of
             asthmatic symptomatology).

          3. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at screening or by positive
             serum/urine hCG test prior to dosing.

          4. Lactating females.

             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 3 months, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the

         16. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

         17. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within 3 months of the start of the trial.

         18. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.
