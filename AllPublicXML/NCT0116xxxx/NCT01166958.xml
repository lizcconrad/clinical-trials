  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current osteoporosis therapies produce a prompt increase in bone mass, followed by only
      modest or no further subsequent gains. This limitation, known as the &quot;remodeling transient,&quot;
      reflects the &quot;coupling&quot; of bone resorption with formation such that interventions impacting
      either of these processes lead to compensatory changes of the other. For example, medications
      which increase bone formation promptly also stimulate bone resorption. Thus, given the need
      to dramatically increase bone mass in patients with osteoporosis, it is necessary to
      &quot;uncouple&quot; formation and resorption. The investigators believe this to be possible using
      currently existing FDA-approved therapeutic agents, by using a novel, sequential approach.

      This pilot project will obtain preliminary data essential to support future work. In this
      study, the investigators will begin to explore the use of sequential anabolic treatment with
      teriparatide followed by antiresorptive therapy with raloxifene. The investigators propose
      that such sequential treatment will allow opening of the &quot;anabolic window,&quot; the brief period
      of time following initiation of teriparatide therapy in which bone formation exceeds
      resorption.
