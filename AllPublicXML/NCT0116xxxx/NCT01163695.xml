    <textblock>
      This study examines an economic empowerment model of care and support for orphaned
      adolescents in rural Uganda. The Suubi intervention focuses on economic empowerment of
      families caring for orphaned youths. It attempts to address the health risks and poor
      educational achievements resulting from poverty and limited options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AIDS epidemic and a 20‐year civil war have had a devastating impact on Uganda. The events
      have led to population displacement, worsening living conditions, exacerbation of poverty,
      and disruption of already weakened social service systems. As implemented, the Suubi Project
      goes considerably beyond the usual care, which primarily consists of institutionalization and
      reactive strategies (involving food and material aid). Specifically, the intervention
      promotes children's savings accounts, also known as children development accounts, for
      postprimary education and microenterprise development (i.e., development of small
      income‐generating businesses).

      The Suubi intervention is grounded in asset theory (Sherraden 1990, 1991), which holds that
      assets (e.g., savings, educational opportunities, and economic opportunities in the form of
      income‐generating activities or microenterprises) have important economic, social, and
      psychological benefits for individuals and families. Asset building is increasingly viewed as
      a critical factor for reducing poverty, improving psychosocial functioning, and positively
      affecting attitudes and behaviors.

    <description>Children in the experimental condition (the SUUBI program) received, in addition to the usual care, an economic empowerment intervention aimed at promoting asset accumulation for families—and consisting of three major components: 1) workshops focused on asset-building and future planning; 2) a monthly mentorship program for adolescents with peer mentors on life options; and 3) a Child Development Account (CDA), dedicated to paying for secondary schooling, vocational training and/or a family small business. The CDAs were matched savings accounts, with a match rate of 2:1 as an incentive for participants to save, but with a limit on the maximum savings that could be matched (the match cap, in this case, was equivalent to $10 a month).</description>
