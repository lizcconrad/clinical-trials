  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter clinical study to test a new qualitative in vitro nucleic acid amplification
      assay based on kPCR technology. The assay is intended for the diagnosis of Chlamydia
      trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC).

      The study was terminated

      This clinical trial protocol outlines the analytical and clinical performance characteristics
      that will be evaluated to demonstrate equivalency of the VERSANT CT/GC DNA 1.0 (kPCR) Assay
      for product registration. The Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2 Assay will be used as the CE-marked
      comparative method. The studies conducted during the clinical trial are intended to provide
      data to support the safety and effectiveness, as well as the labeling claims for the VERSANT
      CT/GC Assay. The study objectives are as follows:

        -  To demonstrate concordance with the Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2 Assay;

        -  To estimate the positive and negative predictive values for each specimen type included
           in the study;

        -  To estimate the indeterminate rate for each specimen type included in the study;

        -  To estimate the equivocal rate for each specimen type; and

        -  To assess reproducibility of the VERSANT CT/CG DNA 1.0 Assay (kPCR) using the VERSANT
           kPCR Molecular System.

      Two (2) studies will be conducted to validate the analytical and clinical performance
      characteristics of the CT/GC DNA 1.0 (kPCR) Assay. Table 1 provides an overview of these
      studies.
