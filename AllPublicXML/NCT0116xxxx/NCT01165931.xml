      The aim of the study is to assess the effects of intracoronary Riociguat on coronary blood
      flow in subjects with coronary artery disease and to compare this effect with the
      intracoronary nitroglycerin, a coronary vasodilator widly used to treat patients with
      coronary artery disease.
