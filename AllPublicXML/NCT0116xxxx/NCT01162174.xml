  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that acute consumption of Oligonol, a patented lychee fruit
      extract (Amino Up Chemical Co.) particularly rich in low molecular weight flavanols, will
      improve endothelial function, reduce platelet reactivity and increase circulating levels of
      flavonoids after a single intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have demonstrated from previous studies at UC Davis that a single dose of a
      high-flavanol supplement from cocoa can improve endothelial function, measured by increased
      blood flow from peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), reduce platelet reactivity, and increase
      circulating levels of flavonoids in the blood. The investigators seek with this proposal to
      determine if a similar response can be noted with a different high-flavanol supplement in
      normal, healthy people.
