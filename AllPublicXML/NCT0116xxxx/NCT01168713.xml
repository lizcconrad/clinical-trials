      Study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral CEM-101 compared to oral Levofloxacin in
      the treatment of adults with moderate to moderately severe community-acquired bacterial
      pneumonia.

    <textblock>
      Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma with
      symptoms such as fever or hypothermia, chills, rigors, chest pain, and/or dyspnea. The
      widespread emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, including the macrolide-resistant
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, has resulted in a need for new and effective antibiotics that have
      activity again CABP pathogens. CEM-101 is the first fluoroketolide with excellent in vitro
      and in vivo activity against resistant S. pneumoniae and other key typical and atypical
      bacterial respiratory pathogens.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of community acquired bacterial pneumonia (e.g. cough with purulent sputum
             or change in character of sputum consistent with bacterial infection, dyspnea or
             tachypnea, chest pain due to pneumonia, fever, presence of rales and/or signs of
             consolidation).

          2. No prior systemic antibacterial therapy, unless failed other therapy.

          3. Chest Xray shows new lobar or multilobar infiltrate(s) consistent with acute bacterial
             pneumonia.

          4. PORT Risk Class II, III, or IV &lt;=105

          5. Ability to take oral medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease FEV1 &lt;30%.

          2. Hospitalization within 90 days or residence in a long-term-care facility within 30
             days prior to the onset of symptoms

          3. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the previous 3 months.

          4. Significant hepatic, hematological, renal abnormalities.

          5. Any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude an
             evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy
             and follow-up could be completed (e.g. life expectancy &lt;30 days).
