      Would you like to quit smoking?

      Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is launching a new study that may be able to
      help. Participants who enroll in this study will be randomly assigned by computer (like
      flipping a coin) to one of two online programs. The goal of this study is to learn which of
      these programs is the most effective at helping people stop smoking. Findings from this study
      will be used to help build more effective online smoking cessation programs in the future.

      Participants in both of the smoking cessation programs used in this study will receive:

        -  Interactive tools for dealing more effectively with urges to smoke

        -  Step-by-step guides for quitting smoking

        -  Personalized plans for quitting and remaining smoke-free

        -  Electronic links for reaching one-on-one expert help for quitting

      Participants will be asked to complete online questionnaires, including a brief three-month
      follow-up survey.

      There is no cost for participating in this study.

      To enroll in this study or for more information, please visit www.webquit.com.

      This study is being conducted by Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
      (www.fhcrc.org), a world leader in advancing the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
      cancer. The principal investigator for the WebQuit smoking cessation study is Dr. Jonathan
      Bricker, a faculty member at both the Hutchinson Center and at the University of Washington
      in Seattle.
