    <textblock>
      Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone) is recognized as an endogenous fat-soluble antioxidant in the
      mitochondrial membrane and considered as a preventive factor for coronary artery disease
      (CAD). However, the relationships between coenzyme Q10 and the prevention of the risk of CAD
      are still inconsistent. The purposes of this study are to investigate the relation of
      coenzyme Q10 concentration with the blood lipid levels, plasma homocysteine, the markers of
      lipid peroxidation (TBARS, ox-LDL),antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, glutathione
      peroxidase, superoxide dismutase)and to examine the association with the risk of CAD.The CAD
      patients is identified by cardiac catheterization as having at least 50% stenosis of one
      major coronary artery (n = 100). The second year is a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      intervention study. CAD subjects (n = 60) are randomly assign to one of the three groups
      (coenzyme Q10 supplements 60 mg/d, 150 mg/d, and placebo groups, n = 20/group). Intervention
      is going to administration for three months. The third year is a case-control study. The
      control group （n = 100） is comprised of healthy individuals with normal blood biochemical
      values, and match by age and gender with the first year CAD subjects (case group). Fasting
      blood samples will be obtain to determine the concentration of coenzyme Q10, homocysteine,
      the markers of lipid peroxidation,antioxidant enzymes activities. The differences between
      case and control groups will be compared by using Student's t-test. Conditional logistical
      regression model will be performed to calculate the odds ratio for CAD based on coenzyme Q10
      level. Hopefully, the results of this study could provide the information to what has been
      know in CAD subjects. We expect coenzyme Q10 could be a preventive supplement to reduce the
      risk of CAD.
