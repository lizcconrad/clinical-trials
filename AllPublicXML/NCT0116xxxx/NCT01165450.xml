      persistent corneal epithelial defects (PED) resulting from corneal epithelial debridement
      during diabetic vitrectomy surgery, HSV keratitis, HZV keratitis, corneal burns, post-PRK, or

      The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled,
      dose-escalation study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nexagon® in subjects with
      persistent corneal epithelial defects (PED) resulting from corneal epithelial debridement
      during diabetic vitrectomy surgery, HSV keratitis, HZV keratitis, corneal burns, post-PRK, or
      post-corneal transplant surgery. In general, traditional therapy of PED consists of
      aggressive lubrication with preservative-free artificial tears and ointments, the use of
      bandage soft contact lenses, pressure patching, punctal plugging, and the surgical closure of
      the eyelids. Unfortunately, the success rates with these conventional treatment modalities
      are varied, and overall, disappointingly low. As such, much research is currently being
      directed at finding better treatments for PED. Nexagon® is a novel therapeutic agent that has
      been shown to be effective in treating skin lesions, and it has been shown in animal studies
      and in preliminary human studies to be safe and efficacious in treating PED.

    <measure>Percent Healing of the Corneal Epithelial Defect at Day 14 ± 1 in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>14 ± 1 days</time_frame>
    <description>Primary efficacy measure: To determine whether topical treatment of persistent epithelial defects with Nexagon preparations yields greater healing at Day 14 ± 1, compared to vehicle alone, in individuals having had diabetic vitrectomy. Healing will be determined by comparing pseudo-area (as measured by Investigator, or designated ophthalmologist) at baseline (taken just prior to the first treatment) and Day 14 ± 1. Pseudo-area is defined by the longest diameter of the lesion multiplied by the longest perpendicular to this longest diameter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events Following Application of the Investigational Product in All Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>28 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Primary safety measure: To determine incidence of adverse events by recording their occurrence at each study visit through Day 28 ± 2. Analysis of safety data will be performed prior to each dose-escalation. If greater than 2 serious adverse events are found that are causally related to the investigational product, the study will be halted.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Complete Re-epithelialization of the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>28 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Resolution of epithelial defect is defined as the largest diameter of the epithelial defect being less than 0.5 mm, as it is difficult to distinguish a smaller defect from the small amount of fluorescing staining seen in a healed defect. Time of complete re-epithelialization will be defined as the midpoint between the last observed date with an epithelial defect and the date of the first visit with no epithelial defect, up to Day 28 ± 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete Healing of the Corneal Epithelial Defect at Day 14 ± 1 in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>14 ± 1 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine binary indicator of whether or not healing has occurred at 14 ± 1 days, defined as the largest diameter of the epithelial defect being smaller than 0.5 mm as determined by slit lamp examination with fluorescein staining.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Rate of Re-epithelialization of the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>35 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the change in the rate of re-epithelialization of the study eye from the screening run-in period to the treatment period, if applicable.
Time Frame: Screening period is defined as Day -7 to Day 0 ± 1. Treatment period is defined as Day 0 ± 1 through time of complete re-epithelialization. Time of complete re-epithelialization is defined as the midpoint between the last observed date with an epithelial defect and the date of the first visit with no epithelial defect, up to Day 28 ± 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Persistence of Complete Corneal Re-epithelialization in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>28 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether or not complete corneal re-epithelialization was persistent, as determined by whether the healed epithelium remains intact after complete re-epithelialization is confirmed in the study eye. The measurement will be made at Day 28 ± 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Reduction of Corneal Epithelial Defect at Day 28 ± 2 in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>28 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>To compare, in each of the two patient populations, the percent reduction in epithelial defect size at Day 28 ± 2 compared to baseline, as measured by slit lamp examination with fluorescein staining. Epithelial defect size determined by pseudo-area, defined by the longest diameter of the lesion multiplied by the longest perpendicular to this longest diameter.</description>

        <title>Percent Healing of the Corneal Epithelial Defect at Day 14 ± 1 in the Study Eye</title>
        <description>Primary efficacy measure: To determine whether topical treatment of persistent epithelial defects with Nexagon preparations yields greater healing at Day 14 ± 1, compared to vehicle alone, in individuals having had diabetic vitrectomy. Healing will be determined by comparing pseudo-area (as measured by Investigator, or designated ophthalmologist) at baseline (taken just prior to the first treatment) and Day 14 ± 1. Pseudo-area is defined by the longest diameter of the lesion multiplied by the longest perpendicular to this longest diameter.</description>
