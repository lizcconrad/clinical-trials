    <textblock>
      Healthy older adults with self-reported cognitive difficulties who receive strategy training
      will demonstrate greater performance benefits on measures of real-world activities, relative
      to those receiving a control intervention, immediately post treatment and at follow-up.

    <description>The key features of the protocol are: i. Participants are actively engaged in selecting their treatment goals. The research clinician will work with the participants to identify five specific, measurable real-world goals using a standardized semi-structured interview, the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Three of these will be training goals, two will not be trained but evaluated post-intervention for evidence of generalization and transfer to non-trained tasks; ii. A global problem solving approach is used (Goal- Plan- Do- Check). Participants are guided by the trainer to apply this strategy to their goals.</description>

    <description>The active comparator uses an information-based format and is designed to engage participants without providing any specific training techniques or strategies.

        <description>COPM is a standardized semi-structure interview in which participants identify goals related to everyday life activities. Goals considered improved to criterion are those that had 2 or more points increase on COPM ratings.</description>

            <description>Real world strategy approach: The key features of the protocol are: i. Participants are actively engaged in selecting their treatment goals. The research clinician will work with the participants to identify five specific, measurable real-world goals using a standardized semi-structured interview, the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Three of these will be training goals, two will not be trained but evaluated post-intervention for evidence of generalization and transfer to non-trained tasks; ii. A global problem solving approach is used (Goal- Plan- Do- Check). Participants are guided by the trainer to apply this strategy to their goals.</description>

            <description>The active comparator uses an information-based format and is designed to engage participants without providing any specific training techniques or strategies. During weekly sessions, participants will receive factual information on brain structure and function, age-related cognitive changes, and general brain health issues and will spend time doing non-specific cognitive exercises including crossword and Sudoku puzzles. Homework will consist of reading assignments related to the session topics.</description>

          <description>Real world strategy approach: The key features of the protocol are: i. Participants are actively engaged in selecting their treatment goals. The research clinician will work with the participants to identify five specific, measurable real-world goals using a standardized semi-structured interview, the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Three of these will be training goals, two will not be trained but evaluated post-intervention for evidence of generalization and transfer to non-trained tasks; ii. A global problem solving approach is used (Goal- Plan- Do- Check). Participants are guided by the trainer to apply this strategy to their goals.</description>
