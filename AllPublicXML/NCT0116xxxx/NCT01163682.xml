  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two arm randomized pilot study. This study seeks to determine if 12 weeks of weekly
      electroacupuncture will prevent or decrease neuropathic pain in breast cancer patients
      receiving 12 weekly treatments of taxane treatment.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the difference in neuropathic pain as
      measured by the mean Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) worse pain score at 12 weeks
      between the two arms. The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form is a well validated clinical tool
      used frequently to assess severity of pain and its effect on daily functions. BPI-SF also
      monitors the effects of treatment on pain in patients with cancer and other chronic
      illnesses. The instrument gives several ratings of the intensity and severity of pain and the
      degree of pain interference on activity, mood, sleep, relations with others and work. The
      questionnaire uses a 0-10 scale for subject ratings and takes five minutes to complete. We
      consider a reduction of 2 or more points on the BPI-SF worst pain item to correspond with a
      clinically meaningful decrease in pain.

      The secondary endpoints include other efficacy outcomes such as quality of life measures,
      extent of neurological dysfunction, blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and adverse
      events.

    <description>Subjects will be placed in prone position and acupuncture sites will be cleaned with alcohol preparation. Stainless steel disposable acupuncture needle (diameter 0.25mm) will be inserted into the skin to appropriate depth needed to elicit de qi(approximately 3-4mm). Selected acupuncture points will be attached to2 leads connected to an electro-stimulator that generates 2 Hz of mixed pulsatile intervals for a total of 30 minutes. The acupuncturist will return two times during the treatment at 10 and 20 minutes with needles in situ to check on the patients and needles. Needles not attached to the electro-stimulator will be manipulated manually to elicit de qi one time during the treatment.</description>

    <description>Will be utilizing a sham control that consists of collapsible acupuncture needle so that there is no penetration of skin. The sham needles will be place on 4 non specific body points. The elecrto-stimulator will be attached to the needles for 30 minutes but will not be turned on. The acupuncturist will return two times during the treatment at 10 and 20 minutes to check on the patient. The acupuncturist will touch the collapsible acupuncture needs to simulate the manipulation of the needles.</description>
