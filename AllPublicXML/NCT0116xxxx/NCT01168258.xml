      Background:

      - Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common condition in people with diabetes. DME occurs when
      blood vessels in the eye leak fluid, resulting in swelling inside the back of the eye and
      progressive vision loss. Research has shown that good blood sugar control can reduce the risk
      and severity of DME. However, not all diabetic patients with poor blood sugar control develop
      DME, and some patients develop DME despite excellent blood sugar control. This suggests that
      other factors, such as genes or inherited traits, may predispose or protect a diabetic
      patient from developing DME.

      Objectives:

      - To investigate genetic factors that may influence the development of diabetic macular
      edema.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have type 2 diabetes, with or without diabetic
      macular edema.

      Design:

        -  The study will require one visit to the National Institutes of Health eye clinic.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and basic eye examination.
           Individuals who have certain eye diseases other than DME may not be allowed to enroll in
           the study.

        -  Participants will provide a blood sample, and will receive fluorescein angiography (an
           injection of fluorescein dye, after which a camera will take pictures of the dye as it
           flows through the blood vessels in the eye).

        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.

      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (EPO), endothelin-1 (EDN1) and receptor for
      advanced glycation end product (RAGE) genes are associated with the development of diabetic
      macular edema (DME).

      Study Population:

      Two hundred case participants with DME and 200 diabetic controls without DME will be
      enrolled.

      Design:

      This is a longitudinal, genetic association study evaluating whether single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF, EPO, EDN1 and RAGE genes affect the development and progression
      of DME. All participants will provide a blood sample, undergo an eye examination, optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA) and discuss their medical, family
      and social history. Case participants with DME and diabetic control participants without DME
      will be allowed to receive standard-of-care treatment at the NEI under this protocol.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome variable is the genotype frequency of SNPs in the above specific genes of
      DME and control participants. Secondary outcomes are serum levels of VEGF, EPO, EDN1 and AGE,
      plasma biomarkers such as mRNA and ophthalmic measurements (visual acuity and imaging results
      such as FA and OCT results). The longitudinal outcome measure includes investigating
      associations between the studied genetic polymorphisms and the long-term response to
      standard-of-care therapy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All participants must meet the following criteria:

        Participant is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes prior to enrollment.

        Participant must understand and sign this protocol s informed consent document and agree to
        provide a blood sample for analysis.

        Participant must be 18 years of age or older.&lt;TAB&gt;

        DME Participants (cases):

        Participant is diagnosed with active DME defined by fluorescein leakage associated with
        either central retinal thickness greater than 260 microns on spectral domain OCT or cystic
        changes present on OCT.

        OR

        Participant has evidence of focal laser scars indicative of prior DME Investigators will
        verify the laser therapy was performed for DME via medical records, fluorescein angiograms
        or photographs.

        Non-DME Participants (controls)

        Participant has no evidence of DME defined fluorescein leakage associated with either
        central retinal thickness greater than 260 microns on spectral domain OCT or cystic changes
        present on OCT.

        Participant has no evidence of focal laser scars indicative of prior DME.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participant has another retinal disease that may confound the evaluation of the DME.
        Examples include vein occlusions, uveitic macular edema or neovascular age-related macular
        degeneration.

        Participant has opacities of the ocular media, limitations of pupillary dilation or other
        problems sufficient to preclude adequate dilated examination.
