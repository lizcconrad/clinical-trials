  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a unique dose-escalation trial that will titrate doses of umbilical cord blood (UCB)
      Treg and CD3+ Teff cells with the goal of infusing as many CD3+ Teff cells as possible
      without conferring grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      In this study, the investigators propose to add UCB Treg and UCB CD3+ Teff cells to the two
      TCD UCB donor units with the goal of transplanting as many CD3+ Teff cells as possible
      without reintroducing risk of acute GVHD. The investigators hypothesize that Treg will permit
      the reintroduction of CD3+ Teff cells that will provide a bridge while awaiting HSC T cell
      recovery long term. The co-infusion of Treg will prevent GVHD without the need for prolonged
      pharmacologic immunosuppression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on prior studies, the first patient will start at lowest dose combination (3 x 10^6/kg
      of Treg and 3 x 10^6/kg of CD3+ Teff cells).

      One patient will be entered at each level with a minimum of 35 days to observe the patient
      prior to moving to the next dose level. (1) If GVHD does not occur, a &quot;successful step&quot;, then
      the CD3+ Teff cell dose will increase to the next higher level for the next patient; (2) If
      GVHD occurs, a &quot;failed step&quot;, then Treg dose will increase to the next higher level for the
      next patient. It would take a minimum of 5 (if no GVHD) and maximum of 9 patients (if GVHD is
      observed at each level) to complete all Treg:CD3+ Teff cell combinations.

      An additional 10 patients will be enrolled to verify that this reflects the optimal
      combination and evaluate its safety profile.
