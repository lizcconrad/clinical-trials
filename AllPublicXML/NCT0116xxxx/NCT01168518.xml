      This observational study is a non-interventional multi-centre, prospective study.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the Sorin Group new passive- and active- fixation pacing
      leads. We plan to assess the acute and short term lead dislodgment rate (within the first
      three months following implantation) correlated with the type of lead (active- or passive-
      fixation). Further, we are collecting data related to leads handling and leads electrical
      performances

      The primary objective of this observational study is to assess the acute rate of dislodgment
      of the new Sorin group range of active- and passive- fixation leads up to 3 months following
      implant.

      Assessment of electrical performances (pacing threshold, sensing amplitude, impedance) of the
      leads at implant and during follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The implanted lead must allow the measurement of pacing threshold at 0.5ms, R-wave or
             P-wave amplitude and impedance of the lead.

          -  Included patients may receive more than one lead under evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindication to endocavitary lead implantation;

          -  Inability to understand the purpose of the study or refusal to co-operate.

          -  Geographically unstable or unavailability for scheduled M1-M3 follow-up at the
             implanting centre as defined in the investigational plan.

          -  Patient of minor age (&lt;18)
