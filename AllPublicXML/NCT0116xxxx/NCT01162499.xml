  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been proposed that the rapid gastric emptying of carbohydrate containing fluids into
      the intestine causes hyperglycemia followed by reactive hypoglycemia. The investigators have
      shown that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in response to a glucose load is
      increased in children with Post-prandial hypoglycemia (PPH). This is a proof of concept study
      to investigate the causative role of GLP-1 in the pathophysiology of PPH after fundoplication
      by evaluating the effects of GLP-1 receptor antagonism on metabolic variables after a mixed
      meal.

      Hypothesis: In children with post-prandial hypoglycemia after fundoplication, antagonism of
      the GLP-1 receptor by exendin-(9-39) will elevate nadir blood glucose levels after a meal
      challenge and prevent post-prandial hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PPH is a frequent complication of fundoplication in children. The mechanism responsible for
      the PPH is poorly understood, but involves an exaggerated insulin response to a meal and
      subsequent hypoglycemia. We have shown that children with PPH after Nissen fundoplication
      have abnormally exaggerated secretion of GLP-1, an incretin hormone with multiple glucose
      lowering effects including stimulation of insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon
      secretion. In this study we seek to examine the causal role of endogenous GLP-1 in PPH after
      fundoplication by evaluating the effects of antagonizing the GLP-1 receptor with
      exendin-(9-39) on key metabolic features of PPH.

    <description>To examine the effect of Exendin-(9-39) on plasma glucose levels samples were collected at various time points before and during the infusion [Exendin-(9-39) or vehicle] including: 60 minutes before the start of the infusion, again at the start of the infusion (time 0), and then every 30 minutes until 3 hours after the start of the meal. Using this information, the mean plasma glucose area under the curve (AUC) from the start of the infusion to the end of the infusion (3 hours) was calculated for both doses of Exendin-(9-39) [300pmol/kg/min &amp; 500pmol/kg/min] and compared with the vehicle.</description>

    <measure>Mean Acetaminophen Plasma Concentration Area Under the Curve (AUC 0-3h)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of gastric emptying was examined using the acetaminophen method whereby acetaminophen (30mg/kg or maximum of 1500mg) was mixed into the Pediasure/formula during the meal tolerance testing. Blood samples were collected every 30 minutes and the absorption of acetaminophen was determined by the gastric emptying rate, as the serum concentrations correlate with gastric emptying of liquids. Mean acetaminophen levels for each group at each time point were used to calculate the Area Under the Concentration versus Time Curve (AUC expressed in Î¼g*min/l) after the consumption of formula for each of the two Exendin-(9-39) dose levels and normal saline vehicle.</description>

    <description>After an overnight fast, an intravenous (IV) infusion of Exendin-(9-39) will be started 1 hour prior to the meal challenge and continued for 5 hours. After the first hour of the infusion, subjects will undergo a mixed meal tolerance test in which Pediasure (10cc/kg) will be consumed by mouth or gastrostomy/nasogastric tube over a period of 15 minutes (for infants under 12 months, Pediasure will be replaced by the infant's formula). Blood samples will be drawn at different time points during the infusion to measure blood glucose, plasma insulin, glucagon and plasma glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1). The Exendin-(9-39) dose for the first 3 subjects will be 300pmol/kg/min and, if tolerated, the dose will be increased to 500pmol/kg/min for subsequent subjects.
The next day, all procedures will be repeated except subjects will receive an IV infusion of normal saline (vehicle) over 6 hours.</description>

        <title>Mean Plasma Glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC 0-3h)</title>
        <description>To examine the effect of Exendin-(9-39) on plasma glucose levels samples were collected at various time points before and during the infusion [Exendin-(9-39) or vehicle] including: 60 minutes before the start of the infusion, again at the start of the infusion (time 0), and then every 30 minutes until 3 hours after the start of the meal. Using this information, the mean plasma glucose area under the curve (AUC) from the start of the infusion to the end of the infusion (3 hours) was calculated for both doses of Exendin-(9-39) [300pmol/kg/min &amp; 500pmol/kg/min] and compared with the vehicle.</description>

After the first hour of the infusion, subjects underwent a mixed meal tolerance test in which Pediasure (10cc/kg) was consumed by mouth or gastrostomy/nasogastric tube over a period of 15 minutes. Blood samples were drawn during the infusion to measure blood glucose, plasma insulin, glucagon and plasma glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1). The Exendin-(9-39) dose was 300pmol/kg/min, infused over 4 total hours.</description>

After the first hour of the infusion, subjects underwent a mixed meal tolerance test in which Pediasure (10cc/kg) was consumed by mouth or gastrostomy/nasogastric tube over a period of 15 minutes. Blood samples were drawn during the infusion to measure blood glucose, plasma insulin, glucagon and plasma glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1). The Exendin-(9-39) dose was 300pmol/kg/min, infused over 4 total hours.</description>

          <title>Mean Plasma Insulin Area Under the Curve (AUC 0-3h)</title>
          <description>To examine the effect of Exendin-(9-39) on plasma insulin levels, samples were collected at various time points before and during the infusion [Exendin-(9-39) or vehicle] including: 60 minutes before the start of the infusion, again at the start of the infusion (time 0), and then every 30 minutes until 3 hours after the start of the meal. Using this information, the mean plasma insulin area under the curve (AUC) from the start of the infusion to the end of the infusion (3 hours) was calculated for both doses of Exendin-(9-39) [300pmol/kg/min &amp; 500pmol/kg/min] and compared with the vehicle.</description>

        <description>The effect of gastric emptying was examined using the acetaminophen method whereby acetaminophen (30mg/kg or maximum of 1500mg) was mixed into the Pediasure/formula during the meal tolerance testing. Blood samples were collected every 30 minutes and the absorption of acetaminophen was determined by the gastric emptying rate, as the serum concentrations correlate with gastric emptying of liquids. Mean acetaminophen levels for each group at each time point were used to calculate the Area Under the Concentration versus Time Curve (AUC expressed in Î¼g*min/l) after the consumption of formula for each of the two Exendin-(9-39) dose levels and normal saline vehicle.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
