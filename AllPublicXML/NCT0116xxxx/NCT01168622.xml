      The effects of race/ethnicity on platelet function and response to antiplatelet agents will
      be assessed using 125 healthy subjects, 250 coronary heart disease patients treated with
      aspirin, and 250 coronary heart disease patients treated with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor
      antagonist, clopidogrel or prasugrel. A minimum of 25 healthy people, 50 people taking only
      aspirin, and 50 people taking aspirin and clopidogrel/prasugrel will be recruited for at
      least 5 racial/ethnic groups.

        Inclusion Criteria: Each subject must fulfill the following criteria in order to be
        included in the study.

          -  For diseased patients, subjects with documented CAD are eligible to participate if
             they have been treated with antiplatelet therapy of aspirin (81 to 325 mg/day) with
             and without clopidogrel (75 mg/day) or another P2Y12 antagonist for at least one
             month.
