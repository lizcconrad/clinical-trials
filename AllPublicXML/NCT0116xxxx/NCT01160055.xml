        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: &gt;= 3 months and &lt; 5 years at the time of enrolment. The subject becomes
             ineligible on the fifth birthday.

          -  Signs, symptoms, and conditions:

          -  One of the functional or general signs of otalgia, conjunctivitis, fever AND EITHER

          -  Paradise's criteria, OR

          -  Spontaneous otorrhoea of less than 1 day.

          -  Onset of signs and symptoms of acute otitis media within 3 days prior to diagnosis of
             acute otitis media by a physician. To be included as treatment failure, subjects must
             have then received antibiotic treatment from the physician, but remain symptomatic 2-3
             days after initiation of treatment.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from parent(s) or Legally Acceptable Representative
             prior to study start.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalised during the diagnosis of acute otitis media or during treatment,

          -  Otitis externa, or otitis media with effusion,

          -  Presence of a transtympanic aerator,

          -  Systemic antibiotic treatment received for a disease other than acute otitis media in
             the 3 days prior to enrolment,

          -  Receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis for recurrent acute otitis media,

          -  Provision of antibiotic by the ear nose and throat specialist at the enrolment visit,
             prior to the sampling of the middle ear fluid by tympanocentesis or spontaneous
             otorrhoea,

          -  Patients on antibiotics for acute otitis media who are clinically improving.

          -  Child in care.
