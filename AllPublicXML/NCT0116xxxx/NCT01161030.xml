      This trial examined the impact of acute and chronic almond ingestion on indicators of glucose
      control (postprandial glycemia and hemoglobin A1c). Hypotheses:

        1. Almonds will stimulate the secretion of GLP-1 in healthy adults and in adults with T2D
           The investigators were not able to demonstrate a relationship between GLP-1 secretion
           and almond consumption. Individuals with T2D were characterized with significantly
           greater GLP-1 secretion than the non-diabetic control subjects.

        2. Acute ingestion of almonds will decrease the postprandial glycemia and insulinemic
           responses in healthy controls and in individuals with T2D The investigators data support
           the hypothesis: almond consumption by individuals with T2D did attenuate postprandial
           glycemia; however, almond consumption did not alter glycemia in non-diabetic control
           subjects

        3. Chronic almond ingestion for 12 weeks will reduce fasting glucose (FG) and A1c
           concentrations in individuals with T2D The investigators data demonstrated modest
           beneficial effect of almond consumption on A1c in individuals with T2D. Almond
           consumption was also associated with modest weight loss as compared to the control
           treatment (low fat cheese sticks).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  12 subjects with diagnosed T2D for at least 1 year and 12 healthy individuals without
             T2D will be recruited for the acute almond trial.

          -  24 subjects with diagnosed T2D for at least 1 year will be recruited for the chronic
             almond trial.

          -  Subjects from the campus population and nearby communities will be recruited to
             participate in these trials.

          -  Men and women must be willing to comply with the experimental protocol including the
             restriction of nut consumption:

               -  subjects recruited for the acute almond study must agree not to consume any nuts
                  or nut butters for 1-week prior to and during the 2-week trial

               -  participants in the chronic almond study must agree not to consume nuts or nut
                  butters more than 2 times per week during the 12 week trial.

          -  Participants must have a body mass index (BMI) from 20 to 35 kg/m2 and are aged 30 to
             70 years.

          -  Subjects with T2D may take oral hyperglycemic agents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Insulin use

          -  History of a peanut allergy

          -  Chronic or unresolved disease

          -  Current smoking habit

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  Medication use that may impact incretin secretion. [Incretins are gastrointestinal
             hormones secreted at meal-time.]
