      The purpose of this study is

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of the Ramipril 10 mg capsules relative to
           that of ALTACE@ 10 mg capsules in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under non-fasting
           conditions and to assess the bioequivalence.

        -  To monitor the safety of the subjects.
