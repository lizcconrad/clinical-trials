  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: There are worrying signs from Western Cambodia that parasitological responses to
      artesunate containing treatment regimens for uncomplicated falciparum malaria are slower than
      elsewhere in the world. Delayed parasite clearance and unusually high failure rates with
      artesunate-mefloquine have been reported. These antimalarials are central to current
      treatment strategies and spread of significant resistance outside this area would be a global
      disaster. Radical containment measures are needed. In this context there is an urgent need to
      proceed quickly to investigate whether there is any evidence of resistance to artemisinin
      derivatives in Vietnam.

      Objective: The primary objective is to assess the slope of the decline in the log
      parasitemia-time curve in patients treated with artesunate 2mg/kg/day, artesunate 4mg/kg/day
      or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine once daily, and to compare the results of this study to the
      pharmacokinetic results and to the recent data from patients in Cambodia and Thailand treated
      with equivalent therapies.

      Methods: The trial will be conducted in Phuoc Long Hospital, Binh Phuoc Province, Vietnam.
      The participants will be febrile patients (aged &gt; 10 years) with slide confirmed
      uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Patients will be treated with either artesunate
      2mg/kg/day, artesunate 4mg/kg/day or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine once daily for 3 days.
      Patients on artesunate therapy arms will then receive 3 days of treatment with
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with dosages according to the national guidelines. Clinical
      and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 42-day follow-up period. The
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin will be assessed by
      using a population pharmacokinetic modeling.

      This surveillance study is a three-arm prospective evaluation of the efficacy of artesunate
      and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria. This will be an
      evaluation of the slope of the decline in the log parasitemia-time curve, parasite clearance
      times in patients randomized to one of two different doses of oral artesunate or
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. People with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled, screened, randomized and treated on site with either
      artesunate 2mg/kg/day, artesunate 4mg/kg/day or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine once daily
      according to weight for 3 days. The artesunate arms will immediately follow with
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine therapy for 3 days (study days 3 - 6) at the dose defined by
      national guidelines. Patients on all three arms will be monitored for 42 days. The follow-up
      will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory
      examinations. PCR analysis will be used to distinguish between true recrudescence due to
      treatment failure and reinfection.
