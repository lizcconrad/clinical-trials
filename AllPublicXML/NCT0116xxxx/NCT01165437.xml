  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent medical condition. Patients with PAD
      are usually diagnosed on the basis of the ankle-brachial index. The ankle-brachial index is
      the ratio of ankle pressure to arm pressure after measurement of blood pressures in the arms
      and legs using a Doppler device. The need for dedicated equipment and trained personnel,
      along with the time required to perform the test, have been identified as barriers to
      widespread implementation of ankle-brachial index screening. The use of automated
      oscillometric devices for blood pressure measurement has been applied to leg pressure
      measurement and determination of the ankle-brachial index with variable success. It will be
      beneficial to investigate a reliable oscillometric-based procedure that can accurately
      measure leg pressures for the ankle-brachial index across the entire spectrum of PAD
      severity.

      In a previous pilot study completed in 2009 (IRB 08-823), the investigators gathered data
      from N=60 subjects which allowed for mathematical analysis of oscillometric waveforms derived
      from the lower extremities as compared to Doppler-based measurements of blood pressure. We
      used signal processing analysis and regression techniques to develop a two-step algorithm
      which will allow for accurate interpretation of oscillometric waveforms in normal/mild vs.
      moderate/severely diseased limb and accurate calculation of ankle pressure across the
      spectrum of peripheral artery disease severity.

      This proposed project will validate this novel oscillometric ABI algorithm in a population of
      patients who have been identified as at risk for PAD and for whom screening ABI has been
      recommended by multiple professional organizations (AHA/ACC and American Diabetes
      Association). Arm, ankle, and toe pressure measurements will be made in the supine position
      using Doppler, oscillometric methods, and a photoplethysmographic sensor. The ankle-brachial
      index and toe-brachial index will be calculated.
