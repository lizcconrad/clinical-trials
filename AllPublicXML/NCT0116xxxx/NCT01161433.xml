  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spirometry is a recommended component of asthma diagnosis and treatment in the primary care
      setting, however, few primary care providers report routine use of spirometry in the
      provision of care for their asthma patients. Even when spirometry is used to aid in asthma
      severity classification, primary care providers have a high rate of failing to meet the
      quality goals for testing established by the American Thoracic Society.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtually delivered quality
      improvement (QI) program. The program is designed to train primary care providers and their
      medical staff in the use of spirometry to improve pediatric primary care management for
      children with asthma.

      A cluster randomized trial with matched practice pairs. All practices receive a spirometer
      and standard vendor training. Those randomized to the intervention group receive a 7-month QI
      program, which includes:

        1. Spirometry Fundamentals™ CD-ROM;

        2. Case-based, interactive webinars; and

        3. an Internet-based spirometry quality feedback reporting system.
