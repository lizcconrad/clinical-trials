    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to verify if there is a neurophysiologic reserve when caffeine
      and placebo perceived as caffeine are manipulated in closed- and opened-loop exercises.
      Parameters of excitability level of skeletal muscle and Central Nervous System (CNS), and
      peripheral metabolism will be measured

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A neurophysiological reserve related to central mechanisms is supposed to be present, which
      should be observed when an increased central drive occurs. In theory, according to the
      central regulation model of effort, an increased performance could be due to the elevation on
      Central Nervous System excitability and activity, since exercise is not peripherally limited.
      Conversely, the absence of muscle performance improvement to the increased central drive
      promoted by caffeine would be an evidence for a peripherally localized neurophysiological
      limit and would indicate the absence of reserve. Therefore, if present, this reserve could be
      verified by using peripheral and central measures derived from electric-stimulation, evoked
      twitch and interpolated twitch techniques, associated to measures of EMG and peripheral
      metabolism, when caffeine is manipulated during closed- and opened-loop exercise.

      In addition, there should also be possible to access the reserve without stimulant substance
      manipulation (placebo effect). By teleological argument derived from the central regulation
      model of effort, a neurophysiological reserve would be a natural mechanism to protect the
      cellular integrity. Therefore, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that, if present, a
      reserve would be observed by an increase in performance promoted by an elevation in central
      drive when placebo is perceived as caffeine. Unfortunately, however, no study utilized this
      experimental approach, including measures of central and peripheral activity during closed-
      and opened-loop exercise, to consistently respond the reserve question.

    <description>The time to cover a 4-km trial (closed-loop) or the time to exhaustion in an incremental intensity test (opened-loop) can show if the caffeine manipulation affects the performance. In addition, measures of CNS excitability such as EMG during the closed-loop exercise or at the exhaustion point in the opened-loop exercise, and measures such as the amplitude of H reflex, the rate of increase in H reflex/M wave relationship, can indicate if some central or peripheral alteration occurred during the exercises.</description>

    <description>The placebo should also promote decrease in time of trial or increase in mean power output during a closed-loop exercise, elevation in time to exhaustion and maximal power output during an opened-loop exercise, and increase in maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and time to contraction in a target force. Also, there should be a higher CNS excitability such as: 1) higher EMG during closed-loop exercise and higher EMG at the exhaustion point in an opened-loop exercise; 2) increased amplitude of H reflex; 3) elevation on the rate of increase in H reflex/M wave relationship.</description>
