      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.
      AZD6244 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. It is not yet known whether fulvestrant is more effective with or without AZD6244 in
      treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well fulvestrant works with or
      without AZD6244 in treating patients with advanced breast cancer that progressed after
      aromatase inhibitor therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the efficacy of fulvestrant with versus without MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in
           patients with advanced stage, endocrine-sensitive breast cancer that progressed after
           aromatase inhibitor therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To examine other outcome parameters.

        -  To develop a virtual tissue bank for future translational research.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, prior
      treatment with tamoxifen citrate (yes vs no), the setting in which prior aromatase inhibitor
      was given (adjuvant treatment vs advanced stage treatment), HER-2 disease (positive vs
      negative), visceral metastasis (present vs absent), performance status (0 vs 1 or 2), and
      disease (measurable disease vs bone-only disease or small but unequivocal liver or lung
      metastases). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (experimental): Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 15
           of course 1 and on day 1 of each subsequent course. Patients also receive oral AZD6244
           twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (control): Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I. Patients also receive oral
           placebo twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.
