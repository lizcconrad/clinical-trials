      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of repeated RIPC and exercise, on exercise
      performance, skeletal muscle responses and circulating cellular and humoral biology in humans

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) results in a powerful and widespread protective effect
      against subsequent prolonged ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury of distant organs and systemic
      inflammatory responses, both of which are key elements in the evolution of local and
      multiorgan effects of many clinical IR syndromes. The signal transduction within the target
      organ to generate ischemia tolerance, and the effects of RIPC on systemic anti-inflammatory
      pathways, however, remain to be elucidated fully. Particularly, data regarding the mechanisms
      of 'second window' protection (a resurgence of protection 24-72 hrs after the initial RIPC
      stimulus) is scant; even less is known of the effects of repeated RIPC, and a potential
      'third window' of protection. Our preliminary data and several recent publications have shown
      that the biology of RIPC and exercise show considerable overlap. This research has raised the
      possibility of a reciprocal effect between RIPC and exercise, with chronic exercise being a
      model of the potential effects of 'chronic preconditioning'. This is relevant, as repeated
      RIPC might be a strategy to improve exercise function in those with limited exercise
      tolerance e.g. heart failure.

    <intervention_name>Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC)</intervention_name>
    <description>RIPC will be induced using a standard blood pressure cuff and hand anaeroid sphygmomanometer, on the right arm. The subject will be seated, the blood pressure cuff placed on the arm and inflated to a pressure of 200mmHg for 5 minutes (ischemia). The cuff will then be deflated for 5 minutes (reperfusion) completing one cycle of ischemia reperfusion. A total of 4 inflation and deflation cycles will be applied. This protocol of RIPC will be applied daily, for 10 consecutive days.</description>

    <description>Subjects will then undergo exercise daily, for 10 consecutive days. A chronic high-intensity interval exercise training protocol standardized to subjects' aerobic power (VO¬2max) will be used. Each exercise session will consist of a 5 min warm-up period followed by 4 sets of 2 min high intensity intervals interspersed with 3 min recovery periods.</description>
