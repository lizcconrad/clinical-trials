    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, crossover
      study in which approximately 20 subjects with Discoid Lupus Erythematosus will be enrolled to
      receive AMG 811 and placebo in one of two sequences (ie, AMG 811 followed by placebo or
      placebo followed by AMG 811).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, between the ages of 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive, at the time of
             randomization;

          -  Diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) with or without SLE;

          -  Intolerance of anti-malarial therapy or ≥ 3 months of anti-malarial therapy with
             residual disease activity. The total CLASI activity must be ≥ 10;

          -  Stable dose of topical steroids no stronger than medium-potency (Class III or less)
             for ≥ 2 weeks and/or systemic immunosuppressive therapy at stable dose for ≥ 8 weeks
             prior to randomization (except for leflunomide which requires ≥ 12 weeks) are
             permitted;

          -  Oral prednisone ≤ 20 mg/day (or equivalent) is permitted; one increase or one decrease
             of ≤ 5 mg/day prednisone equivalent (not to exceed 20 mg/day) will be allowed within
             30 days before randomization;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any disorder (including psychiatric), condition or clinically significant disease
             (other than a diagnosis of DLE or SLE) that would, by its progressive nature and/or
             severity, interfere with the study evaluation, completion and/or procedures per the
             investigator's discretion;

          -  History of malignancy;

          -  Signs or symptoms or relevant history of a viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic

             antibodies (confirmed by PCR or RIBA) during the screening period;

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 3 months of study randomization and during the study;

          -  Prior use of the following agents:

          -  Administration of an investigational biologic agent that primarily targets the immune
             system -

          -  Rituximab, Lymphostat-B, or TACl-Ig within 9 months prior to randomization (or
             comparable B cell depleting or B cell inhibiting biologics); Rituximab (or other
             depleting CD20 targeted agents) treated patients must demonstrate a return of CD19+ B
             cells to &gt; 5/μL;

          -  CTLA4-Ig within 3 months prior to randomization;

          -  Other agents within 5 half-lives prior to randomization;

          -  Administration of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, IV immunoglobulin, and/or
             plasmapheresis within 3 months of randomization;

          -  Administration of thalidomide or lenalidomide within 3 months of randomization;

          -  Administration of oral or IV cyclophosphamide (or any other alkylating agent) within 9
             months of randomization;
