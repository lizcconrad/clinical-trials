  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving ridaforolimus and
      vorinostat together in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. Giving
      ridaforolimus in combination with vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine which dose combinations of Ridaforolimus and Vorinostat are safe and
      tolerable.

      II. To define the maximum tolerated dose. III. To characterize dose limiting toxicities.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the activity of this combination amongst all enrolled patients in terms of
      response rate, progression free survival and overall survival.

      II. To describe the activity of this combination in the subset of patients with RCC in terms
      of response rate, progression free survival and overall survival.

      III. To describe the pharmacodynamic effects of these agents in combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive ridaforolimus orally (PO) once daily on days 1-5 and vorinostat PO twice
      daily on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every three months for up to 3
      years.
