      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a telephone-based physical
      activity (PA) intervention in obese adolescents attending a Health Weight Comprehensive
      Clinic. Secondary aims focus on increasing the amount of change in obesity markers, namely
      waist circumference and BMI z-scores. The investigators hypothesize the following: 1.The
      telephone-based PA intervention will increase PA levels above the mail group; and 2. The
      telephone-based PA intervention will provide changes in waist circumference and BMI z-scores
      above the mail group.

      Obesity rates in youth have tripled over the past 20 years. Physical activity aids in weight
      loss and is critical for weight maintenance. Further, physical activity has other
      physiological and psychological benefits. Obese youth often see specialists for weight loss
      treatment. Treatment in a pediatric population uses a multi-component approach, but physical
      activity if often overlooked. Combining physical activity information with physician care and
      nutritional information could improve weight loss and the overall health of these obese
      children.
