  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine if high-iron or low-iron formula,
      containing an average of 12.7 mg/L or 2.3 mg/L respectively, had differing effects on iron
      status in infancy and on development longitudinally.

Low-iron formula distributed in powdered form. Project personnel visited infants' homes weekly to record measures of powdered formula used per day. Formula consumption was also verified by the number of cans given by the clinic nurse at each visit (regular pediatric visits and monthly clinic appointments until 12 months of age.)</description>
