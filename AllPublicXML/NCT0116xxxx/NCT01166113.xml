      This study will evaluate if the combination of Pomalidomide, Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone
      is safe and provides benefits in patients with multiple myeloma relapsed and/or refractory to
      lenalidomide.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter phase I followed by a phase II trial designed to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the combination of Pomalidomide with Cyclophosphamide and
      Prednisone in patients with multiple myeloma relapsed and/or refractory to lenalidomide.

      Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3 study periods: pre-treatment,
      treatment and long-term follow-up (LTFU).

      The pre-treatment period includes: screening visits, performed at study entry. After
      providing written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated
      for study eligibility. The screening period includes the evaluation of inclusion criteria
      described above. Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      The treatment period includes: administration of the salvage treatment PCP for 6 cycles and
      maintenance treatment. In order to assess the toxicity of treatment, patients will attend
      study centre visits at least every 2 weeks, unless clinically indicated. The response will be
      assessed after each cycle.

      During the LTFU period, after development of confirmed PD, all patients are to be followed
      for survival every 1-3 months via telephone or office visit.

    <description>Induction
This multicenter phase I followed by a phase II trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination Pomalidomide-Cyclophosphamide-Prednisone (PCP) in patients (pts) with MM relapsed/refractory to lenalidomide.
In the phase I we assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PCP in 25% of pts. The first 4 pts are given the second dose level, accrual continues with 4 pts per dose level for a maximum of 24 pts.
The dose level associated with an updated DLT is recommended for the next patient cohort.
Each patient is assigned to a salvage therapy including Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone (both 50 mg every other d), and Pomalidomide at one of the following doses:1 mg/d;1.5 mg/d;2 mg/d;2.5 mg/d
In the phase II a total of 43 pts will be treated with the MTD of PCP. Pts enrolled at the MTD during the phase I will be included in the Phase II trial.
Maintenance (each cycle repeated every 28 d, until PD) Pomalidomide: 2.5 mg/d; Prednisone: 25 mg every other d</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patient with multiple myeloma who received 1 to 3 lines of treatment (including
             high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support, conventional poli-chemotherapy,
             thalidomide- , bortezomib- and melphalan-based regimens) and is relapsed or relapsed
             and refractory (that means relapsed while on salvage or progression within 60 days of
             most recent therapy) to lenalidomide therapy.

          -  Patient has clinical relapse of MM based on standard criteria.

          -  Patient has measurable disease, defined as follows:

               -  For secretory multiple myeloma, measurable disease is defined as any quantifiable
                  serum monoclonal protein value (greater than 1 g/dL of IgG M-protein, greater
                  than 0.5 g/dL of IgA M-protein or IgD M-protein OR urine light-chain excretion of
                  more than 200 mg/24 hours)

               -  For oligo- or non-secretory multiple myeloma, measurable disease is defined by
                  the presence of measurable soft tissue (not bone) plasmacytomas as determined by
                  clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e., MRI, CT scan).

        A measurable lesion is defined as a lesion with minimum largest diameter of &gt;20 mm (if
        measured by conventional techniques such as physical exam, conventional CT scan, MRI) or of
        &gt;10 mm (if measured by spiral CT scan) in one dimension.

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females.

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Use of any other concomitant standard/experimental anti-myeloma drug or therapy.

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction within 6
             months of enrolment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure,
             uncontrolled angina, clinically significant pericardial disease, or cardiac
             amyloidosis Other malignancy within the past 5 years. Exceptions: basal cell or non
             metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ or FIGO
             Stage 1 carcinoma of the cervix.

          -  Concurrent medical condition or disease (e.g., active systemic infection, uncontrolled
             diabetes, pulmonary disease, cardiac disease) that is likely to interfere with study
             procedures or results, or that in the opinion of the investigator would constitute a
             hazard for participating in this study.
