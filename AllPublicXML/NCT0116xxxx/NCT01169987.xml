    <textblock>
      This observational study will document to what extent in daily clinical practice Humira
      (adalimumab) therapy is continued, interrupted or permanently discontinued during a follow-up
      period of 2 years. Reasons for interrupting or permanently discontinuing Humira therapy and
      reasons for restarting Humira therapy will be noted. An evaluation will be performed of the
      effect of the disease on quality of life and work productivity.

    <description>Percentage of participants with an adalimumab treatment status of continuous, early intermittent, late intermittent, permanently discontinued, or other. Continuous=initiated on adalimumab, had no treatment interruption period, still on treatment at study termination, and completed the study. Early intermittent=initiated on adalimumab 40 mg, treated every other week (EOW) for &lt; 112 days (16 weeks) after initiation of treatment, with afterwards ≥ 1 treatment interruption period of ≥ 70 consecutive days, on treatment at study termination, and completed the study. Late intermittent=initiated on adalimumab 40 mg, treated EOW for ≥ 112 days (16 weeks) after initiation of treatment, with afterwards ≥ 1 treatment interruption period of at least 70 consecutive days, on treatment at study termination, and completed the study. Permanently discontinued=received ≥ 1 dose of adalimumab and stopped adalimumab treatment permanently. Other=participants not belonging to any of the previous groups.</description>

    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI): Mean Percentage Improvement From Baseline for All Participants and Broken Down by Adalimumab Treatment Retention Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730); last observation (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Four anatomic sites (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities) were assessed with PASI for erythema, induration (plaque thickness), and desquamation (scaling) as seen on the day of the examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale: 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. PASI percentage improvement=100*(PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline. For the purpose of the analysis of the evolution of parameters over time, follow-up visits were classified into time-windows (TWs), based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>

    <description>DLQI score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each question are: very much (3), a lot (2), a little (1), or not at all (0). The total DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. For the purpose of the analysis of the evolution of parameters over time, follow-up visits were classified into time-windows, based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>

    <description>DLQI is a participant-reported outcome consisting of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot (score of 2), a little (score of 1), or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The following scoring categories present the effect on participant's life: 0-1 no effect at all; 2-5 small effect; 6-10 moderate effect; 11-20 very large effect; 21-30 extremely large effect. Follow-up visits were classified into time windows (TWs), based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>

          <title>PASI: Percentage Improvement Change Categories From Baseline for All Participants and Broken Down by Adalimumab Treatment Retention Status</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants who achieved ≥ 50%, 75%, 90% or 100% reduction (improvement) from Baseline in PASI score (PASI50, PASI75, PASI90, PASI100). Four anatomic sites (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities) were assessed for erythema, induration (plaque thickness), and desquamation (scaling) as seen on the day of the examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale: 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. PASI percentage improvement=100*(PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline. For the purpose of analysis of the evolution of parameters over time, follow-up visits were classified into time-windows (TWs), based on the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>
          <population>ITT set: all participants enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab, and for whom any follow-up data were available; n=number of participants with an assessment at given time point.</population>

        <title>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI): Mean Score for All Participants and Broken Down by Adalimumab Treatment Retention Status</title>
        <description>DLQI score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each question are: very much (3), a lot (2), a little (1), or not at all (0). The total DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. For the purpose of the analysis of the evolution of parameters over time, follow-up visits were classified into time-windows, based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>

        <title>DLQI: Percentage of Participants in DLQI Categories for All Participants and Broken Down by Adalimumab Treatment Retention Status</title>
        <description>DLQI is a participant-reported outcome consisting of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot (score of 2), a little (score of 1), or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The following scoring categories present the effect on participant's life: 0-1 no effect at all; 2-5 small effect; 6-10 moderate effect; 11-20 very large effect; 21-30 extremely large effect. Follow-up visits were classified into time windows (TWs), based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>

          <title>DLQI: Percentage of Participants in DLQI Categories for All Participants and Broken Down by Adalimumab Treatment Retention Status</title>
          <description>DLQI is a participant-reported outcome consisting of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot (score of 2), a little (score of 1), or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The following scoring categories present the effect on participant's life: 0-1 no effect at all; 2-5 small effect; 6-10 moderate effect; 11-20 very large effect; 21-30 extremely large effect. Follow-up visits were classified into time windows (TWs), based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>
          <population>ITT set: all participants enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab, and for whom any follow-up data were available; n=number of participants with an assessment at given time point.</population>

        <title>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire: Mean Percentage of Work Time Missed (Absenteeism) for All Participants and Broken Down by Adalimumab Treatment Retention Status</title>
        <description>Absenteeism, presented as the mean percentage of work time missed due to psoriasis (as reported on the WPAI), and calculated as: 100*number of hours of work missed due to psoriasis / (number of hours of work missed due to psoriasis + number of hours worked). WPAI is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity; scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity. For the purpose of the analysis of the evolution of parameters over time, follow-up visits were classified into time-windows (TWs), based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>

        <title>WPAI Questionnaire: Mean Percentage of Impairment While Working Due to Psoriasis (Presenteeism) for All Participants and Broken Down by Adalimumab Treatment Retention Status</title>
        <description>Presenteeism (the extent to which psoriasis decreased productivity) is presented as the mean percentage of impairment while working due to psoriasis, and calculated as: 100*scale value of question 5 on the WPAI (between 0 and 10) / 10. WPAI is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity; scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity. For the purpose of the analysis of the evolution of parameters over time, follow-up visits were classified into time-windows (TWs), based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>

        <title>WPAI Questionnaire: Mean Percentage of Activity Impairment Due to Psoriasis for All Participants and Broken Down by Adalimumab Treatment Retention Status</title>
        <description>Activity impairment due to psoriasis (the extent to which psoriasis affected the ability to perform usual daily activities) is presented as the mean percentage of activity impairment, calculated as 100*scale value of WPAI question 6 (between 0 and 10) / 10. WPAI is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity; scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity. For the purpose of the analysis of the evolution of parameters over time, follow-up visits were classified into time-windows (TWs), based upon the number of days between onset of adalimumab treatment and the date of each subsequent visit: TW 3 months=period between Day 1 and 137 (target, Day 91); TW 12 months=period between Day 275 and 456 (target, Day 365); TW 24 months=period starting on Day 640 (target Day 730).</description>
