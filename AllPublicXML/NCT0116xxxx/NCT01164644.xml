  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arnica montana is a homeopathic drug that is made in accordance with the official methods of
      the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) and is commonly used by cosmetic
      surgeons throughout the world, although there is no study proving its benefit after
      rhinoplasty surgery. The purpose of the research is to see if Arnica montana will reduce the
      amount of bruising and the intensity of the bruising after surgery. Photographs of the
      subject's face will be taken and used to analyze bruising after rhinoplasty surgery in
      subjects who receive Arnica montana and compare them to photographs of subjects who take a
      placebo (sugar pill).

      Subjects will receive either oral arnica montana or placebo without any identifying labels or
      markers on the drugs.

      During the post-operative period, the patients will be seen back in surgery clinic on
      post-operative days 3, 7 and 10. During the first two visits, the subject will receive
      routine post-operative care with no difference from patients not enrolled in the study. This
      includes routine sets of photographs. The participant will then return for a third
      post-operative visit lasting under ten minutes only for study photos using the left and right
      &quot;three-quarters&quot; view. Again, the subject will hold a measurement marker so length
      measurements can be made, and this marker will be held under the ear to not interfere with
      the routine cosmetic analysis of the photographs. The digital photographs will be used to
      analyze the bruising for the study. The ratio was calculated by dividing the number of pixels
      of bruised area over number of pixels of standard area.

    <description>Primary outcome measure will be to measure the extent of bruising in based on a ratio of pixels on post-operative day number three. Every subject held a card in front of their face with a specific size marker. The square area of this marker was known and used to measure the number of pixels in this marker with Photoshop and compare it to the known area. Next the area of bruising was measured in number of pixels. Therefore for every photograph a standardized ratio of pixels was known because of the marker.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Adult patients scheduled for rhinoplasty surgery with nasal bone osteotomies by the senior author at an outpatient surgery center were recruited by a clinic nurse practitioner (GJ) during the routine pre-operative history and physical exam visit. Enrollment was opened from July of 2009 through June of 2012.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>28 subjects were recruited, 22 completed the study. One elected to leave the study prior to surgery, 2 attended only one post-operative visit; 2 did not undergo surgery (loss of health insurance [1] and thrombocytopenia [1]); and 1 subject elected to leave the study for laser treatments for ecchymosis on post-operative day 3</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Primary outcome measure will be to measure the extent of bruising based on a ratio of pixels on post-operative day number seven. Every subject held a card in front of their face with a specific size marker. The square area of this marker was known and used to measure the number of pixels in this marker with Photoshop and compare it to the known area. Next the area of bruising was measured in number of pixels. Therefore for every photograph a standardized ratio of pixels was known because of the marker.</description>
