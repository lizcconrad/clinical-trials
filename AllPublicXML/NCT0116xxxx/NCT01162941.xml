      1. If urea breath test (+); omeprazole 20mg bid, amoxicillin 1000mg bid and clarithromycin
           500mg bid for 1 week.

           Second line Helicobacter pylori eradication will be permitted after failure of first
           line treatment.

        2. Anti-D Anti-Ro 50 Î¼g/kg IV for 2 days (D1, 2)

        3. Danazol maintenance (from D1): Danazol will be continued at least 3 months. The dose of
           danazol can be reduced according to the adverse effects, especially in premenopausal
           women.
