      The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition among older adults
      admitted to hospital and to analyse predictive factors for malnutrition. Further, the aim was
      to analyse the association between nutritional status and all-cause and cause-specific
      mortality.

      The hypothesis is that malnourished patients have a higher mortality then well-nourished
      patients after three years.

      The baseline survey was a cross-sectional study of 1771 patients aged ≥65 years who were
      admitted to hospital. Nutritional status was assessed using the MNA instrument, and possible
      risk factors associated with malnutrition were recorded during the hospital stay. All-cause
      mortality was followed up after median 3.5 years s in a cohort study of 1767 participants.
      Cause-specific mortality was followed up after median 4.7 years in a cohort of 1767
      participants. Previous dietary intake in middle-aged and older adults was recorded at basline
      in 725 participants, who had their nutritional status assessed with the MNA when admitted to
      hospital 10 years later.
