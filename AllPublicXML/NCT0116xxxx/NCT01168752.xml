    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Debio 0932 when
      administered orally, every-other-day or daily during the first 30 days, in patients with
      solid tumours or lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase I, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic study in patients with advanced and/or refractory malignancies (solid tumours
      or lymphoma), to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of Debio 0932 administered
      orally every-other-day (schedule A) or every day (schedule B) and to assess its safety
      profile, pharmakokinetic, antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

      Increments used in dose escalation will be determined according to the maximum grade of
      treatment-related adverse events observed during the first 30-day treatment period of each
      schedule in the previous in the preceding dose level Once reaching the recommended dose (RD)
      for each schedule, up to 40 additional patients will be enrolled and treated at the RD of the
      retained schedule, as part of an expansion phase.

    <description>Debio 0932 will be administered orally to sequential escalating dose cohorts, as an every-other-day schedule.
Each dose level (DL) for each schedule will be determined according to the maximum grade of treatment-related AEs observed during the first 30 days treatment period (DLT period) in the previous DL.
Dose-escalation could be undertaken only after a minimum of 3 (or 6 in case of DLT) patients have been followed up and evaluated for at least 1 DLT period.</description>
