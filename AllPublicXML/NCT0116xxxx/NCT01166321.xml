    <textblock>
      Treatment standard for patients with atypical or anaplastic meningioma is neurosurgical
      resection. With this approach, local control ranges between 50 and 70%, depending on
      resection status. A series or smaller studies has shown that postoperative radiotherapy in
      this patient population can increase progression-free survival, which translates into
      increased overall survival. However, meningiomas are known to be radioresistant tumors, and
      radiation doses of 60 Gy or higher have been shown to be necessary for tumor control.

      Carbon ions offer physical and biological characteristics. Due to their inverted dose profile
      and the high local dose deposition within the Bragg peak precise dose application and sparing
      of normal tissue is possible. Moreover, in comparison to photons, carbon ions offer an
      increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE), which can be calculated between 2 and 5
      depending on the cell line as well as the endpoint analyzed.

      First data obtained within the Phase I/II trial performed at GSI in Darmstadt on carbon ion
      radiotherapy for patients with high-risk meningiomas has shown safety, and treatment results
      are promising.

      Therefore, in the current Phase II-MARCIE-Study a carbon ion boost will be applied to the
      macroscopic tumor (gross tumor volume, GTV) in conjunction with photon radiotherapy to the
      clinical target volume (CTV) in patients with atypical meningiomas after incomplete resection
      or biopsy.

      Primary endpoint is progression-free survival rate, secondary endpoints are overall survival,
      safety and toxicity.
