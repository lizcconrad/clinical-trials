  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a near-infrared transmission
      measurement in blood samples collected from healthy volunteers. We propose that NIR
      spectroscopic blood glucose measurements in healthy patients are as accurate as handheld
      glucometers and a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI). We will also evaluate in vitro blood
      samples spiked with pharmacological interferents to test if the spectroscopic glucose
      measurement is affected by common medications.

      Luminous Medical is developing an automated glucose measurement system that addresses the
      rapidly growing clinical demand for tight glycemic control in the intensive care unit (ICU),
      operating room (OR), and intermediate care units. The system automatically measures glucose
      and other analytes by spectroscopically analyzing blood as it passes through a disposable
      Sensor Set. Our unique optical measurement does not chemically interact with blood, is
      insensitive to sensor fouling, and, unlike a biosensor, does not require frequent
      recalibration.
