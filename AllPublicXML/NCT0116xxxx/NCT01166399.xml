      The study design will be a cohort study to determine the incidence of FI symptoms at 6, 12
      and 24 weeks postpartum in primiparous women sustaining an OASI. At 6, 12 and 24 weeks
      postpartum, subjects will be contacted by telephone for evaluation of FI symptoms. Symptoms
      of FI will be defined by at least monthly symptoms of leakage of liquid, solid stool, and
      mucus. Flatal incontinence will be assessed at 24 weeks, based on the Fecal Incontinence
      Severity Index, and fecal urgency will be assessed at 24 weeks based on the one question from
      the Modified Manchester questionnaire. A sample size of approximately 400-450 subjects will
      be enrolled.

      The primary aim of the &quot;BOOST Cohort Study&quot; is to determine the incidence of FI symptoms at 6
      and 12 weeks postpartum in primiparous women sustaining an OASI.

      Secondary aims of the cohort study are:

        1. To determine the incidence rates of FI symptoms at 24 weeks post delivery in primiparous
           women sustaining an OASI

        2. To examine the relationship between the modified WHO sphincter tear classification types
           and FI symptoms

        3. To examine predictors (socio-demographic, physical and clinical) associated with WHO
           sphincter tear classifications (3a, 3b and 4) and predictors associated with FI symptoms

        4. To evaluate the incidence of fecal urgency and flatal incontinence at 24 weeks
           postpartum in primiparous women sustaining an OASI.

    <description>Subjects in this trial will be primiparous women who underwent anal sphincter repair at the time of a singleton vaginal delivery. Sphincter tears will be clinically characterized at the time of delivery as &lt;50% tear through the anal sphincter (modified WHO 3a), &gt;50% (modified WHO 3b), or complete tear through the anal sphincter (4th degree). Subjects in this study will not have receive study interventions.</description>
