  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of acarbose in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetic subjects has been
      associated with a significant reduction of cardiovascular events. Additionally, acarbose has
      been shown to have a beneficial influence on some of the other cardiovascular risk factors
      (metabolic syndrome components). Thus, prevention of postprandial hyperglycemia by acarbose
      may be a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing the increased risk for cardiovascular
      disease. Further studies are needed to confirm the influence of acarbose on cardiovascular
      risk factors in the real life setting.
