  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of tacrolimus in the management of NS(nephrotic syndrome) , the
      investigators designed this prospective study. The investigators will enroll 100 children
      with NS(frequent relapse steroid dependent NS, steroid resistance NS) who will be treated
      with tacrolimus (0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses over 12 h adjusted to a trough level
      between 5 and 10 ng/ml) for 12 months in combination with low-dose steroids. Other therapies
      will be included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antihypertensive drugs,
      multivitamins and lipid-lowering agents.

      Follow-up is every second week for the first 4 weeks, then monthly. After initiation of
      tacrolimus therapy, blood was drawn each visit to determine tacrolimus trough levels.

      Subsequently , monthly measurements were made until stable levels of tacrolimus were
      achieved. Urine was analyzed for proteinuria at each visit. Serum creatinine, glucose,
      albumin and alanine aminotransferase were measured and complete blood counts were obtained at
      each visit during the study.
