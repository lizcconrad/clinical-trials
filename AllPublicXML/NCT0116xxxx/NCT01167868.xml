  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single and multiple ascending dose study in healthy male and female (of non-child
      bearing potential) Japanese and White volunteers, to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      blood and urine drug levels of FosD. FosD is being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis.
