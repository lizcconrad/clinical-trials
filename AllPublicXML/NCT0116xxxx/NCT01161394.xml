  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pioglitazone decreases oxidative load, inflammatory end points and improves vascular
      reactivity in obese patients in a dose dependent manner and that this effect is independent
      of its glucose lowering effects.

      This is a single center, open labeled study. A total of 24 obese patients will be recruited
      to participate in this study. The study will have three groups of 8 patients each. Subjects
      will be enrolled into each group by alternate recruitment. Subjects in group one will receive
      15mg of pioglitazone; subjects in group two will receive 30 mg of pioglitazone; subjects in
      group three will receive placebo. All subjects will receive Pioglitazone or placebo for 6
      weeks, followed by a 6-week observation period off Pioglitazone/placebo.

      At baseline, and at week 1, week 2, week 4, week 6 and month 3 all patients will have blood
      drawn for TBARS, ortho and meta-tyrosine, 9-HODE and 13-HODE, NF, Ikb, TNF-a, ICAM-1, VCAM-1,
      PAI-1, AP-1, EGR-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP, CRP-1, E-Selectin, P-Selectin, Asymmetric
      dimethylarginine (ADMA), PAPP-A, SAA, MCP-1, IL-6, ROS generation, insulin levels, and CRP.

      Post-ischemic dilation of the brachial artery will be used as an index of
      endothelium-mediated vasodilation. All subjects will have an oral glucose tolerance test
      (GTT) with 75gm of glucose at Day 0 and at Day 42. Vascular reactivity will be assessed at 0,
      6, and at 12 weeks.
