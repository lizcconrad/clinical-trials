        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Considered reliable and willing to be available for the study duration and is able to
             record seizures and report adverse events (AEs) themselves or have a legal guardian or
             a caregiver who can record seizures and report AEs for them

          2. Understand the requirements of the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System tests and able
             to perform the tests appropriately at Visit 1

          3. Male or female, 12 to less than 18 years of age at the time of consent/assent

          4. Have a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily
             generalized seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy's (ILAE)
             Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981).

          5. Diagnosis should have been established at least 6 months prior to Visit 1, by clinical
             history and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that is consistent with localization-related
             epilepsy; normal interictal EEGs will be allowed provided that the subject meets the
             other diagnosis criterion (ie, clinical history)

          6. Have had a brain imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan or computed
             tomography[CT]) within the 5 years prior to Visit 1 that ruled out a progressive cause
             of epilepsy

          7. Must have had at least 1 partial-onset seizure during the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1
             despite a stable regimen of 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)

          8. Are currently being treated with stable doses of 1-3 AEDs. Only 1 inducer AED (either
             carbamazepine or phenytoin) out of the maximum of 3 AEDs is allowed

          9. Are on a stable dose of the same concomitant AED(s) for at least 4 weeks prior to
             Visit 1; in the case where a new AED regimen has been initiated for a subject, the
             dose must be stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum human chorionic
             gonadotropin (?-hCG) at Visit 1 and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to
             randomization at Visit 2. Female subjects of period of at least 60 days following
             administration of the last dose of study medication to commit to the consistent and
             correct use of a medically acceptable method of birth control (e.g., a double-barrier
             method [condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide]). Abstinence will be
             considered an acceptable method of contraception on a case by case basis upon prior
             approval by the Medical Monitor

         11. Have an intelligence quotient (IQ) of ?70, using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test,
             second edition (KBIT-2)

        Extension Phase:

        Have completed all scheduled visits up to and including Visit 8 in the Core Study
        Randomization Phase

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsies or seizures such as absences and/or
             myoclonic epilepsies

          2. Have current or a history of pseudo-seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures
             [PNES]) within approximately 5 years prior to Visit 1

          3. Have a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome

          4. Have seizure clusters where individual seizures cannot be counted

          5. Have a history of status epilepticus that required hospitalization during the 12
             months prior to the Visit 1

          6. Have an unstable psychiatric diagnosis that may confound the investigator's ability to
             conduct the study or that may prevent completion of the protocol specified tests
             (e.g., significant suicide risk, including suicidal behavior and ideation 6 months
             prior to Visit 1, current psychotic disorder, or acute mania)

          7. Have any concomitant illnesses/co-morbidities (e.g., autism, attention deficit
             hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]) at Visit 1 that could severely affect cognitive
             function during the course of the study

          8. Have previously participated in a clinical trial involving perampanel

          9. Have chronically or routinely use benzodiazepines and who have not discontinued use at
             least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1
