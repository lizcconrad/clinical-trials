      HYPOTHESIS:The study purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured pursed-lips
      breathing (PLB) protocol taught via real-time interactive telecommunication with a home
      computer using the lnternet and Skype software in veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD. The primary hypothesis is veterans with COPD and dyspnea on exertion who
      receive a PLB educational intervention taught via weekly interactive telecommunication over a
      4-week period will have greater reduction of exertional dyspnea compared to those who receive
      the PLB educational intervention with no weekly interactive sessions.

      RESEARCH PLAN: An experimental two- group design is used. All subjects receive a brief 5 - 10
      minute one-on-one PLB educational session. Subjects are then randomized to either the
      intervention group or the control group. The intervention group receives 4 weekly interactive
      group sessions with the health educator (principal investigator)via computer. A free software
      program known as Skype allows synchronous video and audio interaction. The comparison group
      receives only the brief PLB educational session with no weekly follow-up.

      RESULTS: At end of 4 weeks, the intervention group had significantly lower dyspnea intensity
      scores (group X time interaction F = 6.69, p = 0.02) and significantly higher social support
      scores (group x time interaction F = 4.34, p = 0.058).

      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Skype is a viable means for providing patient education. A structured
      PLB protocol provides significant differences in exertional dyspnea over time. A structured
      PLB protocol plus Skype showed significant reduction in patients' sense of dyspnea intensity
      and increased social support scores.

    <description>Dyspnea Intensity is measured with the Visual Analogue Scale. The scale is a 100-cm horizontal line with verbal anchors at either end. Interval level data are obtained by measuring from left to the point marked by the subject. The subjects mark the scale with a pencil in response to the question, &quot;During the last 24 hours, how easy or how hard was it to get your breath?&quot;</description>
