      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of
      patients with chronic low back pain with a radicular component to placebo.

      Study hypothesis:

      Duloxetine is a new substance now in use for the treatment of neuropathic pain. It has proven
      its efficacy in diabetic peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia in several trials. The
      investigators therefore hypothesize that duloxetine will be efficacious in patients with
      chronic low back pain and a radicular component.

      Study Rationale:

      Chronic low back pain is an extremely common diagnosis. However, therapeutic options for the
      condition are limited and therapy remains difficult. Duloxetine has proven its efficacy in
      patients with neuropathic pain and may also be useful in chronic low back pain. If the
      investigators are able to show a benefit for patients in the duloxetine arm, the substance
      may constitute a further treatment alternative in chronic low back pain.

      Study Design:

      Prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled cross over study. Patients will be
      administered duloxetine for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week wash-out phase after which they will
      be medicated with placebo for 4 weeks. A second group of patients will receive the medication
      in reversed order. The primary study endpoint is constituted the weekly mean of VAS-Score in
      the last week of each treatment period. Secondary endpoints are defined as use of rescue
      medication, Beck Depression Inventory score, Health related Quality of Life SF-36 score and
      side effects/adverse events.

    <description>Operationally a VAS is a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end (left= no pain, right=worst imaginable pain).The patient marks the current subjective pain intensity on the scale. This is converted to a numeric value by measurement from the left side of the scale. (Units 1-10)</description>
