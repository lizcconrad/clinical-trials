  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is compare the effects of consuming glucose- and fructose-sweetened
      beverages on appetite, body weight, body fat, and the amount of energy the body burns as well
      as effects on blood pressure, hormones, blood triglycerides and cholesterol, and the body's
      sensitivity to the insulin.

      The study is designed as a prospective, blinded diet intervention study during which the
      participants consume either fructose- or glucose-sweetened beverages (25% of energy) with
      meals. Experimental procedures, including 24-hour serial blood sampling, 26-h stable isotoped
      infusions, post-heparin blood collection, gluteal biopsies, metabolic rate monitoring,
      computed tomography scans of the abdomen, and Oral Glucose Tolerance and Disposal Tests, are
      performed during baseline and at the end of a 10-week intervention period at the UC Davis
      School of Medicine/Sacramento Veterans Affairs Medical Center Clinical Research Center
      (CCRC). During the 2-week inpatient baseline period, subjects are served energy balanced
      diets containing 15% of energy as protein, 30% as fat, and 55% as complex carbohydrate.
      Following the baseline period, the subjects reside at home for 8 weeks and consume their
      usual ad libitum diet along with 25% of energy requirements as fructose- or glucose-sweetened
      beverages. Subjects then return to the CCRC for the 2-week inpatient intervention period at
      the end of the study and are served energy-balanced diets containing 15% of energy as
      protein, 30% as fat, 30% as complex carbohydrate and 25% of energy as fructose- or
      glucose-sweetened beverage.
