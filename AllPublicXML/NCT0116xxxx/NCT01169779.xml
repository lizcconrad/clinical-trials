  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010) in
      comparison to placebo, as an add-on treatment to metformin with or without sulfonylurea, over
      a period of 24 weeks of treatment.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects on glycemic control of lixisenatide (AVE0010)
      in comparison to placebo as an add-on treatment to metformin with or without sulfonylurea in
      terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction (absolute change) at Week 24.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide over 24 weeks on
      percentage of patients reaching HbA1c less than (&lt; ) 7 percent (%) or HbA1c less than or
      equal to (&lt;=) 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPG)
      and glucose excursion during standardized meal test, body weight; to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and anti-lixisenatide antibody development.

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change = HbA1c value at Week 24 minus HbA1c value at baseline. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline on-treatment assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from Week 24 value. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to 1 day after the last dose of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline on-treatment assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glucose Excursion at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose excursion = 2-hour PPG minus plasma glucose 30 minutes prior to the standardized meal test, before study drug administration.

    <description>Routine fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after week 12) values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication. If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after week 12) were performed. Threshold values - from baseline to Week 8: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;250 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (13.9 mmol/L), from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;220 mg/dL (12.2 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 24: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8.5%. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline on-treatment assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>

        <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>
