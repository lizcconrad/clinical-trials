  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease, an x-linked recessive lysosomal storage disease (LSD) is commonly recognized
      as a cause of renal failure in involved men and more recently recognized in women too. Women
      are involved in significant numbers and with complications, as are men, of vascular disease.
      This manifests as unexpected strokes in young adults. We have morphologic evidence that
      storage-endotheliopathy induced microvascular disease is the cause of cardiopathy and of
      cryptogenic strokes, and that storage endotheliopathy starts in early life, probably before
      birth. Based on our earlier work with other endotheliopathies such as diabetes mellitus,
      Susac syndrome, and hypertension, we will find and study patients using unique methods,
      neuro-retinal fluorescein angiography (NRFA), that we have developed for this purpose. These
      methods include NRFA to demonstrate capillary perfusion in the optic nerve head and retinal
      quadrants. We anticipate, based on our earlier experience with other endotheliopathies, that
      we will show more vascular pathology earlier than previously reported. Using epidemiologic
      and genetic tools we will find more patients than previously known or expected. It will offer
      opportunity for earlier diagnosis, prognosis, and response to enzyme replacement therapy.

      We hypothesize that Fabry disease is a poorly recognized and poorly characterized cause of
      microvascular disease and cryptogenic strokes in young women and men. Neuroretinal capillary
      perfusion abnormalities in Fabry disease will be predictive of equivalent vascular disease in
      kidney, heart, brain and other organs, and further that it will be responsive to change
      induced by enzyme replacement therapy treatment.

      Specific Aims

      Specific Aim 1. To demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of the diagnostic capabilities
      of a neuroretinal examination which includes slit lamp and fundoscopy, and NRFA for the
      diagnosis of Fabry disease on a subject population of identified FD patients.

      Specific Aim 2. To show capillary perfusion abnormalities in optic nerve and retina using
      neuroretinal fluorescein angiography in patients with Fabry disease and compare these to
      renal (measured by GFR).

      Specific Aim 3. To show that the change in capillary perfusion studies when compared to
      baseline in response to enzyme replacement therapy treatment over time, as a manifestation of
      tissue burden and prognosis is a more sensitive biomarker of the extent of patient disease
      than corneal keratopathy.

        Initially any Fabry patient, age 18 and above who has a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry
        disease by previously identifying plasma or leukocyte α-galactosidase A (α-gal A)
        deficiency, will be recruited from all participating physician practices. Those who present
        with evidence of angiopathy (with specific attention to the target organs: renal, cardiac,
        or ocular) will be recruited for the study.
