  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, multi-site, dose-escalation study of the safety and immunogenicity of four dosage
      levels of Intramuscular (IM) Norovirus Bivalent VLP Vaccine adjuvanted with monophosphoryl
      lipid A (MPL) and aluminum hydroxide (AlOH) compared to controls. Subjects will receive two
      doses, by intramuscular (IM) injection, 28 days apart.

      The hypotheses for this study are:

        -  The incidence of adverse events after vaccination with IM Norovirus Bivalent VLP Vaccine
           will be similar to the incidence of adverse events after other IM vaccines including
           CERVARIX® which contains MPL and AlOH.

        -  Two doses of IM Norovirus Bivalent VLP Vaccine will be more immunogenic than one dose.

        -  The post-vaccination serum antibody responses, the number of antibody secreting cells
           (ASC), including homing markers, and memory B-cell responses directed against norovirus
           antigens will be increased after IM Norovirus Bivalent VLP Vaccine compared to controls.

                  vital signs, medical history, and physical exam within 45 days before
                  administration of IM Norovirus Bivalent VLP Vaccine or control.

               -  Cohorts B and C: In good health as determined by a screening evaluation that
                  includes vital signs, medical history, and physical exam within 45 days before
                  administration of IM Norovirus Bivalent VLP Vaccine or control. Any existing
                  medical diagnoses or conditions must be stable based on medical history and
                  targeted physical examination. A stable medical condition is defined as: (A)
                  Clinically acceptable health outcomes for the specific condition over the prior 6
                  months and (B) No change in prescription medication(s), dose, or frequency over
                  the prior 3 months. Acceptable changes in medications are: a change of health
                  care provider or insurance company or that is made for financial reasons as long
                  as the medications are in the same class and/or a change due to improvement in a
                  disease outcome.

             of birth control (e.g. oral contraceptives; diaphragm or condom in combination with
             contraceptive jelly, cream, or foam; intrauterine contraceptive device, or
             Depo-Provera; skin patch; vaginal ring or cervical cap) for 30 days prior to
             vaccination and must agree to continue such precautions for at least 60 days after the
             last vaccination. A woman is eligible if she is monogamous with a male who has had a
             vasectomy. Male subjects must agree not to father a child for at least 60 days after
             the last vaccination and to practice abstinence or use an effective method of birth
             control as noted above.
