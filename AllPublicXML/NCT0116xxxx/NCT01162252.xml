      The purpose of the study is to examine and compare the effects of the Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) program and the Living Well (LW) program on adults with psoriasis in
      terms of how these programs may affect their psoriasis, immune function, physical and
      emotional health, and well-being.

      The study examines the effects of two eight-week programs (MBSR vs. LW) for disease processes
      in patients with psoriasis severity reporting moderate or higher perceived stress. The
      research will focus both on clinical measures of the disease state and overall well-being.

      The Aims of our proposed intervention study are the following:

        1. To examine the effects of MBSR, versus the Living Well (LW) program, on (a) disease
           severity, immunological markers of inflammation, and keratinocyte proliferation, (b)
           psoriasis-related stress and perceived stress in general, and (c) anxiety and
           depression.

        2. To examine whether treatment effects of either program are moderated by personality
           traits, mindfulness, and age.

        3. To examine the effects of behavioral and psychological mediators on immune outcomes.

    <measure>Psoriasis disease severity measured from biopsied tissue samples of psoriatic and nonpsoriatic skin.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis is assessed for keratinocyte proliferation including immunohistochemistry (for CD3, neutrophil elastase, keratin 6 and S100A7 markers) and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to examine expression of mRNA for IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17A, and the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 (assessed pre &amp; post intervention).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunological markers of inflammation measured from blood samples.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Circulating cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-22 measured via enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) on all blood samples (pre, mid &amp; post intervention plus follow-up).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen S., Kamarck T., &amp; Mermelstein R. (1983))</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is used to measure the degree to which current life situations are appraised as stressful by a participant (assessed at pre, mid &amp; post intervention plus follow-up).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger C.D., Gorsuch R.L., &amp; Lushene R.E. (1970))</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) consists of two, 20-item scales to distinguish between relatively recent, transitory &quot;state anxieties&quot;, from more chronic or persistent &quot;trait anxiety&quot; (assessed pre, mid &amp; post intervention plus follow-up).</description>

    <description>The standardized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is the primary training tool used to enhance mindfulness. The eight-week-long MBSR program is designed to teach subjects how to develop their inner resources in the service of taking better care of themselves. MBSR training includes the learning and refining of a range of skills aimed at increasing relaxation and awareness of physical experiences and sensations related to physical symptoms, emotions, and thoughts. Special emphasis is placed on movement, meditation, and breathing.</description>

    <description>The Living Well (LW) program involves a series of informational presentations and group discussions on a variety of topics related to the promotion of health and well-being. The 8-week program is designed to provide participants with knowledge about ways to improve their physical and emotional health as a complement to traditional medical treatments.</description>
