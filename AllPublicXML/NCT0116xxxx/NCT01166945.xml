    <textblock>
      The investigators objective is to compare short course (5 days) to long course (14
      days)antibiotics for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. The
      investigators hypothesize that short course therapy will lead to more frequent relapses of
      sinusitis and will not reduce resistant organisms.

    <description>The Aim of this project is to compare short course (5 days) to long course (14 days) antimicrobials for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in children between 1 and 10 years of age. The effectiveness of the treatments will be compared with regard to (a) the likelihood of failure (clinical relapse) at 10 and 20 days in the short and long term treatment groups, respectively and (b) the development of antimicrobial resistance among the normal nasopharyngeal flora 30 days after treatment has been initiated compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>All subjects will be started on treatment with 5 days of high dose amoxicillin (90mg/kg) with potassium clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg) twice daily in bottle A. The allocation to group B1 or B2 will be concealed until after the family and subject has signed the assent and consent, respectively. The maximum dose will be 2 gms twice daily. After 5 days the subjects will be randomized to either continue to receive the same dose of amoxicillin clavulanate or a look-a-like and taste-a-like placebo for the next 9 days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. children with nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough (which may be worse at

             respiratory tract

          7. history of recurrent acute sinusitis (more than 3 episodes in 6 months or 4 episodes
             in a year)

          8. history of chronic sinusitis (more than 90 days of respiratory symptoms in this or the
             previous respiratory season)
