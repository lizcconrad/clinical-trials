  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) has been performed for nearly 100 years to alleviate the
      abdominal pain associated with pancreatic malignancy and other conditions, and is usually
      undertaken at a late stage in the disease process, when analgesic options have been largely
      exhausted or have led to significant and often unacceptable side effects. Until recently, CPN
      was most commonly performed under radiographic guidance; however, in the last 10 years, CPN
      has been routinely performed under endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance. Several case series
      have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of this technique when used to treat the pain
      associated with pancreatic malignancy and/or chronic pancreatitis. However, the efficacy of
      EUS-guided CPN in the treatment of pain related to non-pancreatic malignancies has yet to be
      described. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of EUS-guided CPN in the
      management of pain in patients with abdominal non-pancreatic malignancies. Our hypothesis is
      that EUS-guided CPN will provide adequate pain relief in these patients.

    <description>All patients will receive anesthesia. The linear echo-endoscope will be advanced into the proximal stomach. It will be noted whether the tumor is seen in the celiac axis, if there is flow in the celiac artery, and if the celiac ganglia are seen. The celiac ganglia will be injected directly with 10cc of 0.25% bupivicaine followed by 10cc of 98% dehydrated alcohol. If the celiac ganglia cannot be identified, the posterior and anterior aspects of celiac artery take-off will be injected in a similar manner (twice the volume). Flow in the celiac axis will be confirmed. All injections will be performed with a standard EUS injection needle made especially for CPN . Prior to injection, aspiration will be performed through the needle to ensure that no blood is aspirated.</description>
