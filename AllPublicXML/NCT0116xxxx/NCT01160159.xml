      Rationale: To analyse the arterial state of women with thrombophilia by techniques studying
      micro and arterial macrocirculation because of a reported and still discussed increase risk
      in cardio-vascular events in these women.

      Primary objective: To measure endothelium dependent vasodilatation (VDE) in controls and in
      women with thrombophilia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several papers reporting an increase in the risk of arterial diseases in women with
      thrombophilia. However these reports remain controversial. In order to gain insight on that
      issue we propose to study the micro and macrocirculation in women with an history of venous
      thrombosis or thrombophilia and in controls matched by age.

      Design: It is a prospective open transversal trial.

      Management of the study: Two groups of 80 women will be compared: healthy volunteers and
      women with thrombophilia. Following an inclusion consultation where the informed consent will
      be obtained and inclusion criteria checked, an appointment for the arterial explorations will
      be given. These explorations will be measurement of endothelium dependent vasodilatation
      (EDV), capillar density, arterial fitness and compliance and retinogram. There is no
      follow-up visit.Benefits and risks: the measurement will characterize the arterial state of
      patients with thrombophilia included in the study.There is no risk in performing these
      techniques.

      Principal criteria: measurement of EDV.

      Secondary criteria: capillar density, arterial compliance and stiffness and retinogram.
