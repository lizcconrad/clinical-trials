    <textblock>
      Study to collect post-market safety data for HUD IBV Valve System, a device to control
      prolonged air leaks of the lung, or significant air leaks that are likely to become prolonged
      air leaks following lobectomy, segmentectomy, or LVRS. An air leak present on post-operative
      day 7 is considered prolonged unless present only during forced exhalation or cough. An air
      leak present on day 5 should be considered for treatment if it is: 1)continuous, 2) present
      during normal inhalation phase of inspiration, or 3) present upon normal expiration and
      accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema or respiratory compromise.

    <description>Secondary study objectives are to gather probable benefit information regarding reduction in air leaks and reduction in health care utilization to support potential future premarket applications. The response of the air leak to valve treatment will be observed and recorded along with the time of observation. Probable benefit information gathered during the study will be analyzed and summarized</description>
