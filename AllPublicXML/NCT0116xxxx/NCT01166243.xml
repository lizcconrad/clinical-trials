      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and and hemostatic effectiveness of the
      Fibrin Pad (FP) versus standard of care treatment (SoC) in controlling parenchymal bleeding
      during hepatic surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects &gt; 18 years of age, requiring elective or urgent, open hepatic surgery

          -  Presence of an appropriate bleeding hepatic parenchymal Target Bleeding Site (TBS) as
             identified intra-operatively by the surgeon

          -  Subjects must be willing to participate in the study, and provide written informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may preclude
             conduct of the study procedure

          -  TBS is from large defects in arteries or veins where the injured vascular wall
             requires repair with maintenance of vessel patency and which would result in
             persistent exposure of the FP to blood flow and pressure during healing and absorption
             of the product

          -  TBS with major arterial bleeding requiring suture or mechanical ligation

          -  Subjects admitted for trauma surgery

          -  Subject is a transplant patient for fulminant hepatic failure

          -  Subject with TBS within an actively infected field

          -  Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony
             confine

          -  Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the
             study product or is unwilling to receive blood products

          -  Subjects who are known, current alcohol and / or drug abusers

          -  Subjects who have participated in another investigational drug or device research
             study within 30 days of surgery

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing
