    <measure>Number of Seroconverted Subjects for Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies Against Flu A/CAL/7/09 H1N1 Strain</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion rate (SCR) was defined as the proportion of subjects who had either a pre-vaccination reciprocal HI titer below (&lt;) 10 and a post-vaccination reciprocal titre greater than or equal to (≥) 40, or a pre-vaccination reciprocal HI titer ≥ 10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post vaccination reciprocal titer against the vaccine virus. The Flu strain assessed was A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like virus (Flu A/CAL/7/09), following the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) guidance. The CBER criterion was fulfilled if the lower 95% confidence interval (CI) for SCR was (&gt;) 40%. The CHMP criterion was fulfilled if the point estimate for SCR was &gt; 40%.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or pre-menarchal female children 3 to &lt; 10 years of age at the time of the study
             vaccination. &quot;Less than 10 years of age&quot; implies inclusion of children who have not
             reached their 10th birthday as of Day 0, the day of the study vaccine dose under this
             protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject's parent/legally acceptable
             representative (LAR); written informed assent obtained from the subject if
             appropriate.

          -  Good general health as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Subjects and/or parent(s)/LAR who the investigator believes can and will comply with
             the requirements of the protocol as documented by signature on the informed consent
             document (and, if appropriate, the informed assent document).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history of physician-confirmed infection with an A/California/7/2009
             (H1N1)v-like virus.

             vaccine.

          -  Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses
             which, even if stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject
             or parent(s)/ LAR(s) unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.

          -  Presence of a temperature ≥ 38.0ºC by any route or method, or acute symptoms greater
             than &quot;mild&quot; severity on the scheduled date of vaccination.

          -  Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to study enrollment (day of
             study vaccination), or any other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within 6 months
             of study enrollment. Topical, intra-articular or inhaled glucocorticoids are allowed.

          -  Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 6 months of study
             enrollment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.

             Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., low-dose
             acetylsalicylic acid, and without a clinically-apparent bleeding tendency, are
             eligible.

          -  Administration of any licensed live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before study
             vaccination or any licensed inactivated vaccine within 15 days before study
             vaccination.

          -  Planned administration of any A/California H1N1v-like vaccine other than the study
             vaccine between Day 0 and the Day 21 phlebotomy.

          -  Planned administration of any other vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol between
             Day 0 and Day 21. Routine childhood vaccinations are exempted if they cannot be
             delayed, but they must not be administered on the same day as the H1N1 vaccine
             candidate.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding study vaccination, or planned use during the
             study period.

          -  Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines; a history of
             anaphylactic-type reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse
             reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.

             agency, organization, institution or entity by the courts).

        <title>Number of Seroconverted Subjects for Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies Against Flu A/CAL/7/09 H1N1 Strain</title>
        <description>Seroconversion rate (SCR) was defined as the proportion of subjects who had either a pre-vaccination reciprocal HI titer below (&lt;) 10 and a post-vaccination reciprocal titre greater than or equal to (≥) 40, or a pre-vaccination reciprocal HI titer ≥ 10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post vaccination reciprocal titer against the vaccine virus. The Flu strain assessed was A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like virus (Flu A/CAL/7/09), following the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) guidance. The CBER criterion was fulfilled if the lower 95% confidence interval (CI) for SCR was (&gt;) 40%. The CHMP criterion was fulfilled if the point estimate for SCR was &gt; 40%.</description>

The Flu strain assessed was Flu A/CAL/7/09, following the CHMP and the CBER guidance. The CHMP criterion was fulfilled if the post-vaccination point estimate for SCF was &gt; 2.5.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity at Day 182, which included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results for antibodies against A/California-like HA antigen for the blood sample taken 182 days after vaccination were available.</population>
