      technique for health care personnel.

    <textblock>
      Stress, both job related and personal, is an increasing problem in the health care sector.
      Yoga is said to have a good stress-reducing effect.

      The participants will provide blood, urine, and saliva samples. They will take part in two
      different stress tests. They will also fill in various qualitative questionnaires, including
      the Swedish questionnaire on health related quality of life (SWEDQUAL), Antonovsky's sense of
      coherence scale (KASAM), and the Job stress survey (JSS), both before the study starts and
      after 3 months of participation.
