  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) in pediatric
      patients with advanced/metastatic, unresectable solid tumors refractory to standard therapy
      and/or the patient does not tolerate standard therapies. Tumors are likely to include
      neuroblastoma, lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma,
      non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
      Benign tumors are excluded. These tumor types were selected because evidence of biological
      activity was observed in cancer cells lines and ex vivo infected primary human tissue
      samples, specifically pediatric cancer types such as sarcomas and neuroblastomas.
