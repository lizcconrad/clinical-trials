  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disposition of NRL972 after a 15-second intravenous injection of 2 mg NRL972 is
      distinctly slower in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and acute hepatitis than in healthy
      control subjects. NRL972 appears to be a suitable investigational marker of hepatic
      transporter clearance dysfunction.

      Although the pharmacokinetics of NRL972 provide a reliable differentiation between subject
      groups, this approach relies on precisely timed sampling of venous blood, cautious
      preparation, handling and on-site storage of plasma samples, the transfer of samples to a
      central laboratory for analysis, and the availability of a validated assay procedure.

      For these reasons, there is interest in developing and validating alternative methods for
      determining the concentration of NRL972 in venous blood. Two such methods have been developed
      to date, but their utility in determining NRL972 pharmacokinetics has yet to be established.
