  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized control trial is to evaluate the effects of a multi-component
      intervention aimed at:

        1. preventing tobacco initiation in youth

        2. promoting anti-tobacco socialization in the home

        3. decreasing environmental tobacco smoke exposure in children

        4. promoting successful cessation in parent/guardian smokers.

      Control arm participants receive general health education. This family-based approach is
      implemented with school systems as the primary point of entry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All research participants (children and parents/guardians) will be recruited from 14 schools
      (7 control and 7 intervention; 7 urban and 7 rural) in a Southeastern U.S.

      Self-report measures are at: baseline, end of year one, year 2, end of year two, and years
      three and four. Biological measures of salivary cotinine are at Baseline, end of treatment
      (year 2) and end of study (year 4).
