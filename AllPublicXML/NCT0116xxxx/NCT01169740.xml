  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective comparison of measurement of bilirubin in jaundiced newborns by a transcutaneous
      device (bilirubinometer) and laboratory analysis of blood samples.

      We hypothesise that correlation of the two measurements depend on bilirubin level,
      gestational age as well as postnatal age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whenever a blood sample is drawn for measurement of bilirubin in a newborn, a transcutaneous
      measurement of skin yellow color will be made. Such measurements will also be included in all
      infants when a CRP-test (blood sample for C-reactive protein) has been ordered, as well as in
      connection with the routine blood sampling for metabolic screening. Only infants where
      parents have given written consent for their infant will be included in the study.
