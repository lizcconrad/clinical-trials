    <textblock>
      Dental implants are a valid and reliable method to replace missing teeth. The major
      requirement for their success is an adequate volume of bone into which they can be placed.
      One widely used method to augment bone at the time of placing the implant is to use a bone
      substitute rather than taking a block bone graft from the patient. Successful augmentation in
      the vertical direction has often proved difficult, however, the investigators have developed
      a technique to achieve this in the investigators patients using a synthetic bone substitute,
      Osteon (Implantium, CE0120) in an attempt to avoid patients having to undergo another
      unnecessary surgical procedure.

      Primary Objective

      • To determine the success of dental implants in alveolar bone augmented in the vertical
      direction with Osteon.

      Secondary Objectives • To determine the long term success of dental implants in this
      augmented bone.

      Primary Endpoint

      • Radiographically assessed vertical height of alveolar ridge formation following Osteon
      augmentation.

    <measure>The success of dental implants in alveolar bone augmented in the vertical direction with Osteon</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The implants will be deemed successful at each time point if the radiographic bone level remains at 2 mm above the level of the implant, i.e. at the same height as when placed. Given that we know precisely the dimensions of the abutments placed in the implant, this provides the necessary calibration in order to undertake this assessment. If the bone level is lost, the procedure will be deemed to have failed.</description>
