    <measure>Percentage of Participants With No Radiographic Progression at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic progression was defined as change from Baseline in the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) of ≤ 0.5 units). The mTSS is a measure of change in joint health: digitized images of radiographs of hands and feet obtained at Screening and Month 12 were scored in a blinded manner. Joints were scored for erosions on a scale from 0 (no damage) to 5 (complete collapse) and joint space narrowing on a scale from 0 (no damage) to 4 (ankylosis or complete dislocation). Erosion scores and narrowing scores were added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 398 [maximal disease]). An increase in mTSS from Baseline represents disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represents halting of disease progression, and a decrease represents improvement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis as defined by the 1987-revised
             American College of Rheumatology-classification criteria and has disease duration of
             less than 2 years from diagnosis.

          2. Subject must have been on a dose of methotrexate therapy either subcutaneously or
             orally administered (15-25 mg/week) for at least 3 months prior to baseline visit and
             has had an inadequate response to treatment defined as having a Disease Activity Score
             DAS28 &gt; 3.2 (at Screening visit).

          3. Subject must also meet the following three criteria (at screening visit): at least 4
             swollen joints out of 66 assessed; at least 4 tender joints out of 68 assessed;
             subject must have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt;/= 20 mm/1h or
             C-reactive protein &gt; upper limit of normal.

          4. Subject must fulfill at least one of the following three criteria: history of
             rheumatoid factor positive; history of at least one erosion on X-ray or magnetic
             resonance imaging; history of anti-cyclic-citrullinated protein antibody positive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has previous exposure to any biologic therapy including adalimumab.

          2. Prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs triple therapy with methotrexate.

          3. Subject has been treated with intra-articular or parenteral administration of
             corticosteroids in the preceding 4 weeks prior to baseline visit. Inhaled
             corticosteroids for stable medical conditions are allowed.

          4. Subject has undergone joint surgery within the preceding two months (at joints to be
             assessed within the study) of Baseline.

          5. Subject has a poorly controlled medical condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes,
             unstable heart disease, congestive heart failure, recent cerebrovascular accidents and
             any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject
             at risk by participating in the study.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With No Radiographic Progression at Month 12</title>
        <description>Radiographic progression was defined as change from Baseline in the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) of ≤ 0.5 units). The mTSS is a measure of change in joint health: digitized images of radiographs of hands and feet obtained at Screening and Month 12 were scored in a blinded manner. Joints were scored for erosions on a scale from 0 (no damage) to 5 (complete collapse) and joint space narrowing on a scale from 0 (no damage) to 4 (ankylosis or complete dislocation). Erosion scores and narrowing scores were added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 398 [maximal disease]). An increase in mTSS from Baseline represents disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represents halting of disease progression, and a decrease represents improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With No Radiographic Progression at Month 6 and Month 24</title>
        <description>Radiographic progression was defined as change from Baseline in the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) of ≤ 0.5 units). The mTSS is a measure of change in joint health: digitized images of radiographs of hands and feet obtained at Screening and Month 12 were scored in a blinded manner. Joints were scored for erosions on a scale from 0 (no damage) to 5 (complete collapse) and joint space narrowing on a scale from 0 (no damage) to 4 (ankylosis or complete dislocation). Erosion scores and narrowing scores were added to obtain the mTSS (range = 0 [normal] to 398 [maximal disease]). An increase in mTSS from Baseline represents disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represents halting of disease progression, and a decrease represents improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With EULAR Moderate Response at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity and an attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the DAS28 score. The DAS28 score ranges from 0-10, with higher scores indicating more disease activity. A Moderate EULAR Response is defined as either: an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of &gt; 0.6 and &lt; 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of ≤ 5.1; or an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of ≥ 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of &gt; 3.2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>HAQ is a participant-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A lower HAQ-DI score is better.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID) in HAQ at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants achieving MCID in HAQ, defined as a 0.22 unit decrease in HAQ. HAQ is a participant-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A lower HAQ-DI score is better.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue Scale at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a self-administered patient questionnaire that consists of 13 questions designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants respond to the questions on a scale from 'not at all' (0) to 'very much' (4). The scale score is computed by summing the item scores, after reversing those items that are worded in the negative direction. The FACIT-Fatigue subscale score ranges from 0 to 52, where higher scores represent less fatigue.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving MCID in FACIT-Fatigue Scale at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a self-administered patient questionnaire that consists of 13 questions designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants respond to the questions on a scale from 'not at all' (0) to 'very much' (4). The scale score is computed by summing the item scores, after reversing those items that are worded in the negative direction. The FACIT-Fatigue subscale score ranges from 0 to 52, where higher scores represent less fatigue. The MCID was defined as a 3.56-unit decrease in FACIT-Fatigue Scale.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQOL Questionnaire (EQ-5D) Index Score at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a participant answered questionnaire scoring 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. EQ-5D health states, defined by the EQ-5D descriptive system, are converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches values (also called QOL weights or QOL utilities) to each of the levels in each dimension. EQ-5D Summary Index values range from -0.594 to 1 (with higher scores indicating better health state).</description>
