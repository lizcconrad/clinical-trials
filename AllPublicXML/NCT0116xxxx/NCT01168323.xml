  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two memory research findings (the spacing and testing effects) can dramatically improve
      retention of learning, but they have largely have been ignored by educators. The researchers
      have developed a novel form of online education (termed 'spaced education') based on these
      two effects which has been shown in randomized trials to improve knowledge acquisition and
      boost learning retention. Using prostate cancer screening as an experimental system, the
      researchers investigated whether spaced education could durably improve clinicians'
      behaviors, not just their knowledge.

    <measure>Percentage of inappropriate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening performed by clinicians</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1-108</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the difference in the percentage of inappropriate PSA screening performed by clinicians in the spaced education and control cohorts. Based on published clinical guidelines and reports, inappropriate PSA utilization was defined as the use of PSA for prostate cancer screening in patients &gt;76 or &lt;40 years old, or with an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years.</description>

    <description>Spaced education is currently delivered via periodic emails that contain clinical case scenarios and multiple-choice questions. Upon submitting answers to each question online, clinicians receive immediate feedback and educational material. The questions are then repeated over spaced intervals of time to harness the pedagogical benefits of the spacing effect.</description>
