      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether temozolomide is
      more effective when given with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with recurrent
      glioma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well temozolomide works with or
      without bevacizumab in treating patients with recurrent glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To document the activity of both combination temozolomide plus bevacizumab and
           temozolomide alone in patients with recurrent grade II or grade III glioma without
           1p/19q co-deletion.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the safety of treatment in these patients.

        -  To document the quality of life and cognitive functioning, as a measure of clinical
           benefit, of these patients.

        -  To explore qualification or occurrence of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers of
           activity or efficacy in these patients. (exploratory)

        -  To document the discordances between RANO and Macdonald's criteria for the evaluation of
           response and progression. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution,
      initial histology (grade II vs grade III), WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2), and prior
      treatment (radiotherapy [RT] alone, temozolomide [TMZ] or procarbazine, lomustine and
      vincristine [PCV] alone vs TMZ/RT). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral temozolomide as in arm I and bevacizumab IV over 90
           minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete neurocognitive questionnaires (i.e., the Hopkins Verbal Learning test, the
      Controlled Oral Word Association test, and the Trail Making tests A and B). Quality-of-life
      assessment questionnaires, including EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC-BN20, are completed by both
      patients and caregivers/relatives at baseline and then periodically.

      Frozen tumor biopsies or paraffin blocks and blood specimens are collected for bio-banking
      and translational research.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study in such a manner that the risk
             of pregnancy is minimized. In general, the decision for appropriate methods to prevent
             pregnancy should be determined by discussions between the investigator and the study
             subject. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not
             undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation,

                  products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms,
                  spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their
                  partner is sterile (eg, vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing
                  potential.

               -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
                  test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours
                  prior to the start of investigational product.

          -  Female patients within one year of entering the menopause as well as males must agree
             to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during the treatment period
             and for at least 6 months after the last study treatment.

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; such
             conditions should be assessed with the patient before randomization in the trial.

          -  Before patient randomization and study related procedures (that would not have been
             performed as part as standard care), written informed consent must be given according
             to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations. Informed consent should also be given for
             biological material to be stored and used for future research on brain tumors.

          -  All indicated timelines and absolute values requested by the eligibility criteria must
             be adhered to. However, a maximum of +/- 10% of the reference value for laboratory
             parameters and a maximum of +/- 2 days for timelines may be acceptable. Discussion
             with Headquarters and study coordinator is encouraged.
