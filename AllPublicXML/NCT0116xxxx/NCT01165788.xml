      1. To explore specific aspects of social adaptation such as social connectedness,
           occupational outcomes and family relationships in lymphoma patients after autologous
           blood or marrow transplantation (BMT).

        2. To investigate how social adaptation varies with time lapsed since BMT and with the life
           stage as determined by patient?s age. Understanding both the positive and negative
           aspects of cancer and cancer therapy leads to opportunities to promote adaptive
           strategies.

    <description>A trained research assistant will conduct in-person, in-depth semi-structured interviews at a location of the participants choosing. Participants will be asked to discuss their experiences with cancer, focusing especially on how their cancer affected their (1) work/education (2) relationships with their family (spouse, children, parents, siblings and other relatives) (3) their other social relationships</description>

        Subjects will be identified from the comprehensive database of the Blood and Marrow
        Transplant Division of Stanford Hospitals &amp; Clinics. We will target lymphoma patients who
        received an autologous BMT as adults (18 years or older). We estimate there are ~580
        surviving who are between 2 and 22 years post-BMT.
