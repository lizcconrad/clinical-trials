  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Burn Repository 2007, the most common type of burn injury is a
      partial thickness burns. The current standard of care for partial thickness burns is two
      weeks of topical therapy and wound care. Burns that do not heal within two weeks undergo
      surgical excision and skin grafting.

      Researcher can use the combination of Modulated Imaging and Laser Speckle Imaging can be used
      as an adjuvant to standard clinical evaluation to gauge burn wound and severity of infection.
      Researcher can image the burn wounds of and compare with current standard of care, clinical
      exam, and can use the outcomes information in terms of time to healing and treatment

      Modulating Imaging is a noninvasive optical modality measure the metabolic functions of the
      burn wound.

      Laser Speckle Imaging is a noninvasive optical modality can measure blood flow of burn wound.
