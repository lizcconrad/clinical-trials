  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients with diabetes-related peripheral
      neuropathic pain also have non-recognized damage to the intestine caused by autonomic
      neuropathy. The model will shed light on aspects of peripheral nerve injuries on both somatic
      and as well as visceral sensory nerves. Classical autonomic parameters from
      electrocardiography (ECG) and Holter (24-h ECG and blood pressure) are compared with
      peripheral nerve injuries. The damage of autonomic nerves often recognized late in the course
      when patients develop gastroparesis, however an earlier recognition of this nerve damage may
      help clarifying the fundamental pathomechanisms and thereby optimize treatment for this
      patient group in the future.

          2. Proven peripheral neuropathy.

          3. Oral and written consent, with documentation that all relevant information about the
             program is given to the patient.

          4. The patient must be willing and able to, to meet the planned visit and meet the
             planned curriculum, including the participation in the experimental investigations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          2. Medical or surgical disease for the study doctor's assessment makes the patient
             unsuitable for participation in the study

          5. Use of analgesic opioid medication less than 24 hours before screening

          6. Competitive conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy (eg, herpes zooster)
