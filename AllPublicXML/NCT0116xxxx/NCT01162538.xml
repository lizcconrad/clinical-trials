      The population VIH1 not B is not unimportant in our region of the Seine St Denis, a tendency
      which seems to be in increase (47 % in 2006, 67 % in 2007).

      Most of the studies evaluating the clinical, immunologic and virologic response to the ARV
      according to the viral subcategories are corresponding and show comparable results for
      patients infected by HIV 1 of subcategory B or non B. In spite of these reassuring results,
      it is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of a new ARV all the more a new class. It seems
      also necessary to observe attentively the profiles of resistance which will be selected at
      the carrier patient's of virus of subcategories not - B in failure of treatment. It will
      allow to determine if, because of the important polymorphisms of the viruses not - B, the
      evolution towards the resistance will be made differently.

        It's a pilot open label, multicentric, national, prospective and descriptive study to
        evaluate effectiveness and safety of regimen containing Raltegravir (400mg x 2) in 40
        treatment naive HIV non B infected subjects versus in 20 treatment naive HIV B infected
        sujects.

        The patients will be matched according to:

          -  basal viral load (&lt; 10 000 copies/ml, ≥100 000 copies/ml)

          -  rate of basal CD4 (&lt;200 cell/mm3, ≥ 200 cell/mm3)
