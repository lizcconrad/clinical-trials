  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open, not randomized, unilateral multicenter eye study
      consisting of two study arms to observe the long term satisfaction of patients after an
      INTRACOR treatment. The satisfaction is determined with the help of the patient perception
      and the subjective / objective diagnostic data.

      The hypothesis of the study is that patients after an INTRACOR treatment are satisfied in the
      long term.

    <textblock>
      The study is divided into two study arms. The first study arm includes patients of the
      preceding study &quot;Intrastromal Correction of Ametropia by Femtosecond Laser (study ISCAF),
      study arm 1, Presbyopia sub-group: treatment pattern 5-Rings&quot; and the second study arm
      includes patients of the previous &quot;Intrastromal Presbyopia Correction by Means of Femtosecond
      Laser (study # 0905)&quot;.

      The hypothesis of the study is that patients after a INTRACOR treatment are satisfied in the
      long term.

      By detailed patient information and a clarification conversation it is guaranteed that every
      interested and agreeing patient fulfils the inclusion criteria of this study. The
      quantitative measuring values of the patient perception are assessed by a questionnaire. For
      measuring the subjective / objective diagnostic data only certificated diagnostic devices are
      used. No invasive intervention in the eye will be made to change the visual acuity.

      Within the scope of the study between 98 and 135 patients should be examined. 49 to 63
      patient are intended for the first study arm and 49 to 72 for the second study arm.

      The follow-up examinations are carried out at 12 months and/or 24 months as well as for 36
      months after the INTRACOR treatment. The study end points are determined for all follow-up
      examinations. The aim criteria should be reached for the final examination, which is after 36
      months, at the latest.

    <description>Satisfaction is assesed by three questions:
Do you fell comfortable with the treatment result? Would you do the traetment again? Would you recommend the treatment to a relativ or a friend?
If two out of these three questions are answered with &quot;yes&quot; then it can be assumed that the patient is satisfied.</description>
