      WHAT IS THE STUDY PRODUCT? The study product is a contraceptive patch, which has the study
      drug on the patch. The patch is applied directly to the skin and it contains Levonorgestrel
      (LNG) in a time-release form. LNG is a hormone that has been tested and been approved by the
      Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) in other forms, for example: contraceptive pills,
      intrauterine devices (IUDs, which are put in the uterus (womb)) and implants (drug in silicon
      tubing placed under the skin). The use of LNG in the form of a contraceptive patch makes this
      an experimental drug because the way the drug will be absorbed in the body is a new
      technique. This study drug does not contain estrogen and it does not protect against HIV,
      AIDS, or any other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

      LNG is a progestin (a type of drug that is like a hormone. Progestins can cause changes at
      the opening of the uterus (womb), such as thickening of the cervical mucus (fluid). This
      thickened cervical mucus makes it difficult for the male's sperm to reach and fertilize the
      woman's egg. Since LNG is being absorbed through your skin from the patch, it is
      experimental, and it is unknown if this study product will really prevent pregnancy like
      other progestins.

      WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?

      The purpose of this study is to find out:

        -  How well the patch prevents pregnancy

        -  How safe the patch is to use every day

        -  How much study drug needs to be in the patch to make sure that it prevents pregnancy

        -  How the study drug in the patch affects cervical mucus (fluids)

        -  How the study drug in the patch affects your rate of ovulation (how often you release an
           egg)

        -  How well the patch sticks to your skin, without falling off, for a week at a time

        -  Whether the patch causes any skin irritation or rash (redness or itchiness)

        -  Whether the study drug in the patch affects your everyday life and if it causes any side
           effects.

      WHAT DOES THE STUDY INVOLVE? We expect that there will be approximately twenty (20) women at
      each of the six (6) participating clinics in the study. In total, there will be about 120
      women from all over the United States who will be in this study. This study is comparing the
      effectiveness of two different doses of the study drug (40ug and 75 ug) in the patches. This
      study is an open-label randomized trial, meaning that you and your study doctor will be aware
      of the dosage of study drug that you will be given. Randomization means that you will be
      selected by chance, like tossing a coin or rolling a dice. You have a 50% chance of being in
      the group that receives the 40ug dose patch or the group that receives 75ug dose patch.

      This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group, pharmacokinetic,
      pharmacodynamic study of the AG1000-6.5 and AG1000-12.5 transdermal contraceptive delivery
      systems (TCDS) in healthy women followed as an outpatient for up to three 28-day cycles (12
      weeks or approximately 3 months). During this study, subjects will receive active treatment
      with the LNG TCDS patches for 11 weeks, followed by one week of post-treatment assessment.
      The TCDS is designed for one week of patch wear. This study will be conducted by the National
      Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in its Contraceptive Clinical Trials
      Network (CCTN) at 6 sites in the USA and will enroll approximately 120 women.

      This study will enroll approximately 120 subjects, who will be randomized across all sites
      into the two treatment groups (~60 subjects at each dose level). The randomization schedule
      will be further stratified to ensure enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI &gt;32
      kg/m2 and &lt;40 kg/m2 and approximately 50% of subjects with BMI &lt;32 kg/m2 for each dose level.

             mucus are not included in the total scoring) yielding a total possible score of 12 (3,
             4).

               1. If subject is postpartum or post-abortal (with abortion in second trimester), she
                  will be required to have two normal menstrual cycles prior to screening.

               2. If subject had an abortion in the first trimester, she will be required to have

             without spermicide is acceptable) for the entire duration of the study. Use of a
             spermicide applied separately is not allowed. Cervical caps or diaphragms are not
             allowed during study participation.

        contraceptives as referenced in the World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Eligibility
        Criteria(MEC category 1 or 2) (1), in addition to contra-indications specific to this
        clinical trial including:

          -  1. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to progestins.

          -  2. Known or suspected pregnancy.

          -  3. Prior hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy.

             (i.e. repeat test with negative results). In accordance with PI/medical designee
             assessment and local standards of practice, women with a history of genital herpes can
             be included if outbreaks are infrequent. Antiviral prophylactic therapy is permitted.

             day must be evaluated by the PI for inclusion based on risk factors that would
             increase their risk for CVD and thromboembolism.

          -  17. Current or past deep vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders.

          -  18. History of known thrombophilia in a first-degree relative &lt;45 years of age
             suggesting familial defect in blood coagulation system, which in the opinion of the

             significant risk.

          -  19. Cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease or increased risk for arterial
             thrombosis.

             remission for more than 5 years.

          -  23. Current or past medically diagnosed severe depression, which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, could be exacerbated by use of a hormonal contraceptive, unless she

             Investigator's judgment.

          -  28. Participation in another clinical trial involving an investigational drug or

             need to use condoms consistently, injection drug users. Women enrolled in the study,
             who use condoms to protect against STIs or pregnancy, should be instructed that they
             can use condoms that are pre-lubricated with spermicide or lubricated, but they cannot
             use a spermicide applied separately and they should record all condom use in their
             diaries.

          -  32. Women who use any medications on the Exclusionary Medication List (see Appendix 2)
             OR used any within the past three months prior to the screening visit.
