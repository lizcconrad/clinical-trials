  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized study will assess the mass balance, metabolism, routes and
      rates of elimination as well as efficacy and safety of RO5185426 (RG7204; PLEXXIKON; PLX4032)
      in previously treated or untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will receive
      continuous twice daily oral treatment with RO5185426. On Day 15, a 14C-labeled dose will be
      administered. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression occurs.

    <description>Best overall response (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria) was defined as best response recorded from start of treatment until disease progression which included complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that had been confirmed by second tumor assessment no less than (&lt;) 4 weeks after criteria for response were first met. Confirmed CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; no new lesions, and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 millimeters (mm). Confirmed PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), no progression in non-target lesions, and no new lesions. Disease progression: at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions.</description>

Confirmed CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; no new lesions, and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 millimeters (mm). Confirmed PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), no progression in non-target lesions, and no new lesions. Disease progression: at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions.</description>

        <description>Collection of samples continued until the recovery criterion was met (radioactivity recovered from urine and feces ≤ 1 % of the radioactivity in the administered dose between any two successive 48-hour interval assessments). Plasma samples were pooled over three time intervals for this analysis based on available radioactive counts (4 + 6 hours, 12 + 24 hours, and 36 + 48 hours). Radioactivity was measured in terms of region of interest by high performance liquid chromatography. The radiolabelled components in each chromatogram were evaluated to determine retention times and peak area values.

          <description>Collection of samples for radioactivity continued until the recovery criterion was met (radioactivity recovered from urine and feces ≤ 1 % of the radioactivity in the administered dose between any two successive 48 hour interval assessments). Plasma samples were pooled over three time intervals for this analysis based on available radioactive counts (4 + 6 hours, 12 + 24 hours, and 36 + 48 hours). The concentrations were measured in nanogram equivalent per gram which was calculated based on ratio of dosed radioactivity and the last dose of RO5185426. The concentration values represented the drug portion of the last dose. Data for 14C-labeled RO5185426 and 14C-labeled metabolite (mono-hydroxy) are reported.</description>

        <description>Collection of samples continued until the recovery criterion was met (radioactivity recovered from urine and feces ≤ 1 % of the radioactivity in the administered dose between any two successive 48-hour interval assessments). Fecal samples were pooled over two time intervals for this analysis (0-24 + 24-48 hours, 48-72 + 72-96 hours). Radioactivity was measured in terms of region of interest by high performance liquid chromatography. The radiolabelled components in each chromatogram were evaluated to determine retention times and peak area values. Data for 14C-labeled RO5185426 and 14C-labeled metabolites (glucosylation, mono-hydroxy, and glucuronide) are reported.</description>

        <description>Collection of samples continued until the recovery criterion was met (radioactivity recovered from urine and feces ≤ 1 % of the radioactivity in the administered dose between any two successive 48-hour interval assessments). Urine samples were pooled over period of 96 hours (pool of 0-6 + 6-12 + 12-24 + 24-48 + 48-72 + 72-96 hour samples), Radioactivity was measured in terms of region of interest by high performance liquid chromatography. The radiolabelled components in each chromatogram were evaluated to determine retention times and peak area values. Data for 14C-labeled RO5185426 and 14C-labeled metabolites (2 unknown metabolites, glucosylation, mono-hydroxy) are reported.</description>
