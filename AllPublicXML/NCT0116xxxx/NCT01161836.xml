  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label study.

      During Segment 1, patients are administered a single IV administration of [14C]-iniparib.

      During Segment 2, patients are administered iniparib with or without additional chemotherapy.
      Acceptable chemotherapy regimens is limited to those for which previous experience with
      iniparib exists.
