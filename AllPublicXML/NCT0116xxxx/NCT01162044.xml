    <textblock>
      PTSD is a common and distressing possible outcome following exposure to a traumatic event.
      Recent studies show that memory processes may be central to the development of the disorder,
      and interrupting the consolidation of traumatic memories may prevent the disorder from
      developing. Specifically the use of a visual spatial task has been shown to reduce a key
      characteristic of PTSD, intrusions, in non-clinical populations. This study aims to
      administer a visual spatial task to recent trauma survivors in the Emergency Room, and
      compare PTSD and symptoms development in these patients as compared to a control group who
      did not carry out the task. The study hypothesizes that the task will result in less PTSD,
      lower levels of intrusions, dissociation and pain.
