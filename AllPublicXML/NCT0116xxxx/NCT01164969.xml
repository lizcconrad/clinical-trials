    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether mixed H. pylori strain infection is the
      reason for eradication failure during treatment of H. pylori infection. The investigators
      present the results got from extensive sampling of biopsy samples taken from individuals
      diagnosed with H. pylori connected disease. The investigators were looking for individuals
      that were not able to eradicate H. pylori although they had susceptibility testing tailored
      antibiotic therapy. On their control visit after 2 months they presented again with H. pylori
      although at their first visit they had H. pylori isolated from biopsy sample sensitive to all
      antibiotics prescribed. Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) was used to prove the sequence
      type of H. pylori and E test was used to determine susceptibility of H. pylori to
      antibiotics.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sequence type of H.pylori determined with MLST as a good evidence that people are infected with only one strain of H. pylori</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months after first visit the strains from before/after therapy will be inspected with MLST to see if people have mixed strain infection.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators assume that people that are not able to eradicate infection with H. pylori although they have never been treated for such infection and they have taken appropriate therapy, have such problems because H. pylori is capable to escape from immune response. The investigators will define if patients have the same H. pylori sequence type through longer period and that such H. pylori is capable to develope resistance to clarithromycin very quickly.Such patients can eliminate H. pylori if we check the infection status more often and give them more suitable antibiotic therapy.</description>

        The investigators invited people who were not able to eradicate H. pylori although at their
        first visit they had H. pylori sensitive to all antibiotics tested. At first visit all
        patients had stomach biopsy sample taken and H. pylori isolated and therapy prescribed. If
        they did not eradicate bacteria after 2 months they were again invited to control visit to
        define the problem and appropriate therapy prescribed. They were again invitation to
        control visit at the end of June 2010 to see the outcome of therapy.
