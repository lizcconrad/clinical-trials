    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough (Pre-bronchodilator and Pre-dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the clinic visit (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1measurement taken at the clinic visit while still on-treatment. Pre-dose and pre-rescue albuterol/salbutamol trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry in the evening at the Baseline through Week 12 clinic visits. The highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline was the pre-dose value obtained at Visit 3. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline trough FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment group. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing m</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Serial FEV1 Over 0-24 Hours Post-dose at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Serial FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry at the Baseline and Week 12 clinic visits. Weighted mean was calculated using the 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements that included the pre-dose assessment (within 30 minutes prior to dosing at Baseline and within 5 minutes prior to dosing at Week 12) and post-dose assessments after 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours. At each time point, the highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline was the value obtained at Visit 3. Change from Baseline was calculated as the average Week 12 FEV1 value minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour (hr) Periods During the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily electronic diary (eDiary). A 24-hour (hr) period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no use of rescue medication was considered to be rescue free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 12-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom-free 24-hour (hr) Periods During the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptoms were recorded in a daily eDairy by the participants every day in the morning and evening before taking any rescue or study medication and before the peak expiratory flow measurement. A 24-hour (hr) period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no symptoms was considered to be symptom free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 12-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (+12) Score at Week 12/Early Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire used to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ for 12 years and older (AQLQ [+12]) is a modified version of the AQLQ for use in asthma patients between the age of 12 and 70. The AQLQ contains 32 items in 4 domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). For the 32 items on the questionnaire, the response format consists of a seven-point scale, where a value of 1 indicates &quot;total impairment&quot; and a value of 7 indicates &quot;no impairment.&quot; The AQLQ total score is defined as the average of the scores from all 32 questions; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates &quot;total impairment&quot;) to 7 (indicates &quot;no impairment&quot;). Baseline was the total score obtained at Visit 3. Change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Week 12 minus the total score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The ACT is a 5-item questionnaire developed as a measure of the participant's asthma control. Questions are designed to be self-completed by the participant and include the following: In the past 4 weeks, &quot;How much of the time did your asthma keep you from getting as much done at work, school or at home?&quot;, &quot;How often have you had shortness of breath?&quot;, &quot;How often did your asthma symptoms wake you up at night or earlier than usual in the morning?&quot;, &quot;How often have you used your rescue inhaler or nebulizer medication (such as albuterol)?&quot; and &quot;How would you rate your asthma control&quot;? The ACT total score is defined as the sum of the scores from all 5 questions, provided all questions have been answered; thus, the total score ranges from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma). A score of 20 or higher indicates well-controlled asthma. Change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Week 12/Early Withdrawal minus the total score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough (Pre-bronchodilator and Pre-dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the clinic visit (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1measurement taken at the clinic visit while still on-treatment.

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom-free 24-hour (hr) Periods During the 12-week Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Asthma symptoms were recorded in a daily eDairy by the participants every day in the morning and evening before taking any rescue or study medication and before the peak expiratory flow measurement. A 24-hour (hr) period in which a participant’s responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no symptoms was considered to be symptom free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 12-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (+12) Score at Week 12/Early Withdrawal</title>
        <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire used to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ for 12 years and older (AQLQ [+12]) is a modified version of the AQLQ for use in asthma patients between the age of 12 and 70. The AQLQ contains 32 items in 4 domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). For the 32 items on the questionnaire, the response format consists of a seven-point scale, where a value of 1 indicates “total impairment” and a value of 7 indicates “no impairment.” The AQLQ total score is defined as the average of the scores from all 32 questions; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates &quot;total impairment&quot;) to 7 (indicates &quot;no impairment&quot;). Baseline was the total score obtained at Visit 3. Change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Week 12 minus the total score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Serial FEV1 Over 0-24 Hours Post-dose at Baseline</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Serial FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry at Baseline. Weighted mean was calculated using the 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements that included the pre-dose assessment (within 30 minutes prior to dosing) and post-dose assessments after 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours. At each time point, the highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements were recorded. Baseline was the value obtained at Visit 3.</description>

        <description>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each morning prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use. Change from Baseline (defined as the last 7 days prior to randomization of the participants) was calculated as the value of the averaged daily AM PEF over the 12-week treatment period (at Week 12) minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The ACT is a 5-item questionnaire developed as a measure of the participant's asthma control. Questions are designed to be self-completed by the participant and include the following: In the past 4 weeks, &quot;How much of the time did your asthma keep you from getting as much done at work, school or at home?&quot;, &quot;How often have you had shortness of breath?&quot;, &quot;How often did your asthma symptoms wake you up at night or earlier than usual in the morning?&quot;, &quot;How often have you used your rescue inhaler or nebulizer medication (such as albuterol)?&quot; and &quot;How would you rate your asthma control&quot;? The ACT total score is defined as the sum of the scores from all 5 questions, provided all questions have been answered; thus, the total score ranges from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma). A score of 20 or higher indicates well-controlled asthma. Change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Week 12/Early Withdrawal minus the total score at Baseline.</description>
