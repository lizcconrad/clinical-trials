    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tarceva (erlotinib) in
      routine clinical practice as second-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic
      non-small dell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data will be collected from patients who have received 1
      course of standard systemic chemotherapy, experienced disease progression, and who are
      receiveingTarceva in a second-line setting. Patients will also be followed through third-line
      treatment if there is disease progression on Tarceva therapy.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), or Progressive Disease (PD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years, 4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response to treatment was determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TL) or the disappearance of all non-TLs. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since treatment started for TLs and the persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s). PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. For the best overall responses of CR and PR, a response was &quot;confirmed&quot; if a subsequent RECIST evaluation also showed a CR or PR.</description>

    <measure>Time to Disease Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years, 4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to disease progression was defined as the time from Baseline until disease progression as determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years, 4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from Baseline until disease progression or death from any cause. Progressive disease was determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years, 4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Study participants and treating physicians completed the LCSS, a measure of Quality of Life (QoL), at Baseline and throughout the study. The patient LCSS measures 6 major symptoms, the Symptom Burden Index (SBI), associated with lung malignancies (3 thoracic [cough, dyspnea, haemoptysis] and 3 general symptoms [loss of appetite, fatigue, pain]) and 3 additional scores (overall symptomatic distress, interference with daily activities, global QoL), each on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (0=no impairment, 100=maximum impairment). The physician LCSS evaluates the 6 lung malignancy associated symptoms, the SBI, on an ordinal scale (100=none, 75=mild, 50=moderate, 25=marked, 0=severe). The average of the patient and physician SBI scores (6 symptoms) and the average of the patient total score (9 symptoms) ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher patient and a lower physician score indicating more impairment. A negative patient and a positive physician change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Developed Rash</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years, 4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit, the presence of skin rash was graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), with grade 0 = no rash, grade 1 = mild, grade 2 = moderate, grade 3 = severe, and grade 4 = life threatening or disabling rash. Reported is the percentage of participants who developed a grade ≥ 1 rash.</description>

        <description>The best overall response to treatment was determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TL) or the disappearance of all non-TLs. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since treatment started for TLs and the persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s). PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. For the best overall responses of CR and PR, a response was “confirmed” if a subsequent RECIST evaluation also showed a CR or PR.</description>

        <description>Study participants and treating physicians completed the LCSS, a measure of Quality of Life (QoL), at Baseline and throughout the study. The patient LCSS measures 6 major symptoms, the Symptom Burden Index (SBI), associated with lung malignancies (3 thoracic [cough, dyspnea, haemoptysis] and 3 general symptoms [loss of appetite, fatigue, pain]) and 3 additional scores (overall symptomatic distress, interference with daily activities, global QoL), each on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (0=no impairment, 100=maximum impairment). The physician LCSS evaluates the 6 lung malignancy associated symptoms, the SBI, on an ordinal scale (100=none, 75=mild, 50=moderate, 25=marked, 0=severe). The average of the patient and physician SBI scores (6 symptoms) and the average of the patient total score (9 symptoms) ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher patient and a lower physician score indicating more impairment. A negative patient and a positive physician change score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) Scores</title>
          <description>Study participants and treating physicians completed the LCSS, a measure of Quality of Life (QoL), at Baseline and throughout the study. The patient LCSS measures 6 major symptoms, the Symptom Burden Index (SBI), associated with lung malignancies (3 thoracic [cough, dyspnea, haemoptysis] and 3 general symptoms [loss of appetite, fatigue, pain]) and 3 additional scores (overall symptomatic distress, interference with daily activities, global QoL), each on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (0=no impairment, 100=maximum impairment). The physician LCSS evaluates the 6 lung malignancy associated symptoms, the SBI, on an ordinal scale (100=none, 75=mild, 50=moderate, 25=marked, 0=severe). The average of the patient and physician SBI scores (6 symptoms) and the average of the patient total score (9 symptoms) ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher patient and a lower physician score indicating more impairment. A negative patient and a positive physician change score indicates improvement.</description>
          <population>Per-protocol population: All enrolled participants who started erlotinib therapy and did not violate the study protocol. Only participants with LCSS scores were included in the analysis.</population>
