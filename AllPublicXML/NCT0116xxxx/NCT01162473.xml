      Background and Rationale

      For patients with Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy, the current management
      includes identification of the causative food and avoidance. Specifically, among young
      children, cow's milk allergy is the most common food allergy, occurring in as many as 2-3%.
      Given the prevalence of milk and the difficulty to avoid it in the diet, the investigators
      aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of oral immunotherapy for cow's milk allergy.

      Main Objective

      The primary objective is to study the efficacy of milk oral immunotherapy.

      Target Population

      Children aged six to 17 years with a history of cow's milk allergy will be recruited from The
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Allergy clinical offices for the investigators study.

      Primary Study Interventions

      Prior to and after the desensitization, we will conduct double-blind placebo controlled food
      challenges to cow's milk protein. During the desensitization phase, we will give increasing
      doses of cow's milk protein by mouth on a weekly basis, as tolerated. The desensitization
      protocol starts with dilutional doses of milk and build up to a goal of 8 ounces of cow's
      milk.

      Main Study Outcome Measure

      The percentage of children completing the desensitization protocol in each study group will
      be the primary outcome measure.

Full physical exams performed and vital signs were obtained. During desensitization, families were contacted every other day (first week) and then twice a week (weeks 2-6).</desc>
