      The purpose of this study is to conduct an early evaluation of a nurse-led follow up
      intervention added to the usual medically oriented follow up care. Besides evaluating the
      feasibility and acceptability to patients, the effect on psychosocial adjustment and quality
      of life of patients is determined.

      Background: After treatment for cancer, follow-up surveillance is regarded important. In head
      and neck cancer patients however, increasing research evidence shows that at least the goal
      of detecting recurrence of cancer during routine control visits in an asymptomatic stage is
      not achieved. Other goals of follow-up such as management of treatment complications and
      helping patients and families cope and adjust remain important and ask for an accurate,
      effective but tailored and sensitive approach. Increasingly, nurses are mentioned as care
      providers best suited to perform this task.

      Aim: The purpose of this study is to conduct an early evaluation of a nurse-led follow up
      intervention added to the usual medically oriented follow up care. Besides evaluating the
      feasibility and acceptability to patients, the effect on psychosocial adjustment and quality
      of life of patients is determined.

      Methods and design: A quasi-experimental prospective design is used. Two groups of patients
      are enrolled consecutively (n=160) and patient data are collected at baseline (T0), at 6(T1)
      and at 12(T2) months respectively. The duration of the intervention is defined to the first
      year of follow up. Participating nurses are trained prior to the recruitment of the
      intervention group and receive supervision and individual coaching during the entire duration
      of the intervention phase.

      Outcome measures: Primary outcome, psychosocial adjustment to illness. Secondary outcomes,
      health related quality of life, psychosocial problems, and usage of care.

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 mo, 12mo</time_frame>
    <description>The adaptive psychosocial response of an individual to a significant life change was assessed using the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale -Self Report (PAIS-SR), a 46-item self-report measure that assesses changes in seven domains. A mean PAIS-SR T-score of 50 is the average score for each domain, meaning that patients with this score adjusted neither better nor worse than a mixed cancer reference group, whereas a score lower than 50 indicates better adjustment. The total scale range for the T score is 21-80. The PAIS-SR is well validated and has been used in previous studies of HNC patients.Here, we used the validated Dutch translation.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 mo, 12 mo</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life(QoL)was measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&amp;N35.The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains five functioning scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and nine symptom scales. The QLQ-H&amp;N35 contains 18 disease-specific symptom scales. All scores in both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&amp;N35 were transformed to a 0-100 scale following instructions in the scoring manual, with higher scores representing better quality of life and less disease-specific symptoms.</description>

    <description>Usual care Participants in the comparison group receive the usual care which consists of a 5 year medical routine control schedule based on the national guidelines, and - if appropriate - involvement of the dietician and the speech language therapist.During years one to five the routine control appointments are planned at a minimum of every 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 months respectively. Most patients who undergo a total laryngectomy have additional contact with an oncology nurse during their 6-8 weekly medical control visits at the outpatient clinic for approximately the first year of follow-up. All other head and neck cancer patients have no structured follow-up contact with an oncology nurse.</description>

    <description>Interventional care Year 1 follow-up: 2-monthly medical control visit + 30 minute nursing consultation, to a minimum of 6 in year 1. No restrictions with regard to cancer stage, site or treatment modality.
Intervention consist of standardised nursing consultations comprising a thorough needs assessment, supportive counseling, adequate referral to other care providers if necessary and improvement of the continuity of follow-up care. Goals: helping patients (and their partners) cope with the physical and psychosocial consequences of treatment and help them to gradually adjust to 'the life after', and into survivorship.</description>

          <description>The participants in the usual care group received care that consisted of a 5-year routine control schedule with six bimonthly 10-minute visits to a head and neck surgeon in the first year posttreatment in accordance with national guidelines.19 Nursing follow-up care consisted of ad hoc problem-based contacts except for patients who underwent a laryngectomy, who received standard nursing consultations during the first 6 months posttreatment in parallel with the medical control visits. Patients who were treated with surgery alone all had one standard wound control visit with a nurse; patients who were treated with radiotherapy had one to six ad hoc nursing contacts during the first 6 months posttreatment. For the duration of the study, there were no changes in usual care.</description>

          <title>Intervention</title>
          <description>The intervention consisted of six 30-minute nursing follow-up consultations in the first year posttreatment. A standardized protocol was used for this purpose. Nursing consultations were conducted in parallel with and preceding the medical routine control visits and included a needs assessment based upon the biopsychosocial model.The aim of consultation was to give advice and support to patients (and their partners) addressing the physical and psychosocial consequences of treatment. To increase patient focus and active participation during consultations, patients completed a 13-item checklist prior to each consultation. Every 3 months, patients were screened for psychosocial problem areas using a specific questionnaire.
During the consultations, the nurses also performed simple medical checks including inspection of the tracheal stoma, cannula and speech valve (if applicable), and oral cavity, and palpation of the neck and lymph nodes.</description>

To increase patient focus and active participation during consultations, patients completed a 13-item checklist prior to each consultation.Every 3 months, patients were screened for psychosocial problem areas using a specific questionnaire.During the consultations, the nurses also performed simple medical checks including inspection of the tracheal stoma, cannula and speech valve (if applicable), and oral cavity, and palpation of the neck and lymph nodes.</description>

        <description>The adaptive psychosocial response of an individual to a significant life change was assessed using the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale –Self Report (PAIS-SR), a 46-item self-report measure that assesses changes in seven domains. A mean PAIS-SR T-score of 50 is the average score for each domain, meaning that patients with this score adjusted neither better nor worse than a mixed cancer reference group, whereas a score lower than 50 indicates better adjustment. The total scale range for the T score is 21-80. The PAIS-SR is well validated and has been used in previous studies of HNC patients.Here, we used the validated Dutch translation.</description>
