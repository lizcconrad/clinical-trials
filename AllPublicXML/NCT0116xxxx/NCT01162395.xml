             standard therapy is currently considered appropriate.

          -  Documented evidence of metastatic prostate cancer

          -  Presence of progressive disease defined as one or more:

          -  Biochemical progression of the prostate cancer

          -  Progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1
             guidelines

          -  Two or more new metastatic bone lesions from bone scans from a previous assessment

          -  Serum testosterone concentration less or equals 50 ng/dL

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 0 to 1 with no deterioration over
             the previous 2 weeks and minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.

          -  Sexually active males should be willing to use condoms

          -  For inclusion in the AZD3514 administered in combination with abiraterone acetate
             cohort(s), patients must:

          -  Have received prior chemotherapy containing or based on docetaxel

          -  Not have received prior treatment with abiraterone acetate, MDV3100, TAK700, TOK001 or
             other similar therapies which target the AR axis or with selective AR
             down-regulator-like properties

          -  For inclusion in the AZD3514 administered in combination with abiraterone acetate in
             patients who are currently receiving abiraterone acetate cohort(s), patients must:

               1. Have been stable on abiraterone acetate abiraterone acetate for ≥ 4 months (i.e.
                  stable PSA values) and have achieved ≥ 50% reduction in PSA while being treated
                  with abiraterone acetate

               2. Have evidence of biochemical progression (PSA) of the prostate cancer, as defined
                  in inclusion number 5 (except for the withdrawal of abiraterone acetate as an
                  anti-androgen therapy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria
             for Adverse Events (CTCAEv4) grade 1 except for alopecia or toxicities related to the
             use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists

          -  Medically important spinal cord compression or brain metastases

          -  Medically important evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease

          -  History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of AZD3514 or drugs with
             a similar chemical structure or class to AZD3514

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to
             swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would
             preclude adequate absorption of AZD3514

          -  Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function

          -  Any medically important factors identified from electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements

          -  Concurrent or recent treatment with certain medications or medical procedures

        The following criteria exclude patients from entering the AZD3514 administered in
        combination with abiraterone acetate cohort(s):

          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             diseases or conditions, including adrenocortical insufficiency or a history of
             cardiovascular disease including heart failure (currently there are no randomized data
             for the use of abiraterone acetate in patients with LVEF &lt; 50% or NYHA Class III or IV
             heart failure), which would make it undesirable for the patient to participate in the
             trial. See the full local prescribing information for abiraterone acetate for more
             detail

          -  Child-Pugh class B and C hepatic impairment

          -  If unable to fast for ≥ 2 hours prior to taking a dose to ≥ 1 hour post dose

          -  Received abiraterone acetate treatment previously

          -  Known hypersensitivity to components of prednisone or prednisolone

          -  Any systemic fungal infections
