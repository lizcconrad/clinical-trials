  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, parallel-group, open-label study will evaluate the effect of Actemra
      (tocilizumab) on vaccination in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who have an
      inadequate response to methotrexate and who have had an inadequate clinical response or were
      intolerant to treatment with one or more anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Responded to ≥ 6 of 12 Anti-pneumococcal Antibody Serotypes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 3) and Week 8 (5 weeks post-vaccination)</time_frame>
    <description>Serum levels of antibody to pneumococcal vaccine were drawn 5 weeks after vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to assess humoral immune response. A positive response to the pneumococcal vaccine was defined as a 2-fold increase in serum antibody titers from Baseline or an increase of &gt; 1 mg/L from Baseline levels.
The 12 serotypes evaluated were pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 6B, 8, 9N, 12F, 14, 19F, 23F, 7F, and 18C.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that is fatal or is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above.</description>

          <description>Serum levels of antibody to pneumococcal vaccine were drawn 5 weeks after vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to assess humoral immune response. A positive response to the pneumococcal vaccine was defined as a 2-fold increase in serum antibody titers from Baseline or an increase of &gt; 1 mg/L from Baseline levels.
The 12 serotypes evaluated were pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 6B, 8, 9N, 12F, 14, 19F, 23F, 7F, and 18C.</description>
