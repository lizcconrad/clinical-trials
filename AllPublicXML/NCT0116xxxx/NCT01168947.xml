  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sodium loading during hemodialysis treatment is common and may contribute to increased
      interdialytic weight gain and hypertension. Excessive use of isotonic saline (containing 0.9%
      sodium chloride) is one of the factors that may cause sodium loading. During each
      hemodialysis session, approximately 400 mL of isotonic saline fluid, representing 1.4 grams
      of sodium, is used to prime and rinse the extracorporeal circuit, and is often administered
      to the patient. Switching to a non sodium-containing priming and rinsing fluid could allow
      for removal of the equivalent amount of sodium.

      Switching to a non sodium-containing solution for the priming and rinsing of the
      extracorporeal circuit can contribute to increased sodium removal during the dialysis
      treatment and allow for reduced interdialytic weight gain, reduced thirst, and improved blood
      pressure control.

      This 12 week study consists of 3 phases:

      Phase 1 (4 weeks): Observation only. Standard priming/rinsing procedure with isotonic saline
      Phase 2 (4 weeks): Intervention. Switch to a 5% dextrose solution for priming/rinsing
      procedure Phase 3 (4 weeks): Switch back to standard priming/rinsing procedure with isotonic
      saline During the study, blood pressures will be measured in a standardized manner at 2 week
      intervals, a thirst questionnaire will be completed at the end of each phase, and
      interdialytic weight gain, in-center pre/post-HD blood pressure and intradialytic symptoms
      will be recorded, apart for routinely measured parameters.
