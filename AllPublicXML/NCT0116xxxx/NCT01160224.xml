  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW766994 is a selective, competitive antagonist of the human CC chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3).
      It is proposed that the inhibition of the CCR3 receptor may provide a treatment for airway
      inflammation such as in asthma. This will be a double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel
      group study being conducted to evaluate the effects of GW766994 in subjects with
      mild-moderate asthma who have high sputum eosinophilia. The primary objective is to compare
      the effects of GW766994 to placebo on sputum eosinophils.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-centre study. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study, in patients with asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis. Subjects with
      asthma will be atopic and not on oral prednisone. Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed if on
      stable dose. All subjects will receive a 5 day course of 30mg daily of oral prednisone after
      one week stopping study drug.

      All subjects will attend screening (Visit 1) at which their eligibility for inclusion will be
      assessed. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either 300 mg of GW766994 twice
      daily or matching placebo at Day 1 (Visit 2) and will be stratified according to the
      subject's sputum eosinophil count at Visit 1. Treatment will be 10 days of oral dosing, and
      subjects will participate in a Day 7 or 8 visit (Visit 3), Day 10 visit (Visit 4 - End of
      Treatment), followed by a 1 week wash out period (Visit 5 -Follow Up Visit). At Visit 5, all
      subjects will be given 30 mg oral daily prednisone for 5 days and subjects to return to
      clinic at a Post Oral Prednisone Visit (Visit 6) at Day 22.

      Pharmacodynamic assessments will include both sputum and blood biomarkers and spirometry.

      Safety will be assessed by vital sign measurement, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory
      tests (hematology, chemistry &amp; urinalysis), clinical monitoring and adverse event reporting.
      Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from each subject according to the sample schedule
      in the timing and events table.

      Study will involved sputum biology (progenitors, cell counts). Study will be conducted in
      Canada only.

    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum was collected according to the Hargreave/Nair Sputum Induction procedures. Each site performed their sputum analysis locally. Chemotactic analysis was performed as spontaneous chemotactic activity (Chemotactic activity of the sputum at several dilutions) and Eotaxin-induced chemotaxis (determination in the presence and absence of a single, pre-defined eotaxin concentration spiked into the sputum). In each case the data was a fluorescence intensity which was proportional to the number of migrated cells. The plate-corrected fluorescence intensities were derived by subtracting the mean basal values for each plate from the non-basal individual values on that plate and has been presented as dilution types: neat; 1:03;1:09: 1:27; spiked.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new/exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Physician diagnosis of asthma (&gt;12% improvement in FEV1 with a bronchodilator or PC20
             methacholine less than 8 mg/ml) documented within the past 2 years.

          -  Males and females aged â¥18-75 years inclusive.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
