      This study will look at a cohort of parents whose children are confronting life-threatening
      illnesses in intensive care, palliative care, and complex care settings, to test whether
      parents with higher levels of hopeful patterns of thinking are subsequently more likely a) to
      change the &quot;level of care&quot; order status of their child (as an important and demonstrable
      example of adapting goals); b) to reprioritize goals for the child when they are reassessed
      regarding goals ; and c) to report a higher degree of achieving self-defined 'good parent'
      attributes.

    <textblock>
      Parents making medical decisions for a child living with a life-threatening condition
      confront, sometimes repeatedly, an extremely daunting task: how to decide when to set aside
      the therapeutic goal of cure or of life prolongation and instead prioritize the goals of
      comfort or quality of life.

      This study will look at a cohort of parents whose children are confronting life-threatening
      illnesses in intensive care, palliative care, and complex care settings, to test whether
      parents with higher levels of hopeful patterns of thinking are subsequently more likely a) to
      change the &quot;level of care&quot; order status of their child (as an important and demonstrable
      example of adapting goals); b) to reprioritize goals for the child when they are reassessed
      regarding goals ; and c) to report a higher degree of achieving self-defined 'good parent'
      attributes.

      We hypothesize that parents with higher levels of hopeful patterns of thinking subsequently
      will be:

      More likely to enact a limit of intervention order. More likely, upon explicit formal
      reassessment, to reprioritize goals for the child.

      More likely to report a higher degree of achieving self-defined 'good parent' attributes.

        Parents of children of age &lt; 18 years or cognitively impaired such that their parents make
        all medical decisions on their behalf; and of either gender and any race/ethnicity who are
        patients at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) admitted to the neonatal,
        pediatric, or cardiac intensive care unit (CICU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), or
        pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), or who have been referred to the Pediatric Advanced
        Care Team (PACT) for palliative care services.

             palliative care services. A patient is eligible when the patient's attending physician
             considers it likely that parents will have major treatment decisions to make for their
             child within the coming 12 to 24 months.
