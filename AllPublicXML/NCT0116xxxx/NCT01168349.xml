  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the clinical benefit of NeoRecormon (epoetin beta) in
      daily routine practice in cancer patients with anemia. Data will be collected from patients
      who are receiving chemotherapy for a solid tumor or hematological malignancy. Patients will
      be followed for 28 weeks.
