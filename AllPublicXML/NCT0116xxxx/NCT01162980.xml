  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACE inhibitors have been studied extensively in the treatment of heart failure and have been
      shown to be beneficial in all its stages. Studies with the use of angiotensin receptor
      blockers (ARBs) in chronic heart failure have not shown equivalent results. Many patients are
      on an ARB for a variety of reasons. Some of these may have had cough as a symptom of heart
      failure and not due to medication side effect. According to guidelines, angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are still first-line therapy in the treatment of heart
      failure. As ACEi have been extensively studied showing improvement in morbidity and mortality
      all patients should be on this treatment unless absolutely contraindicated.
