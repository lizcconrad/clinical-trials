  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how often two investigational drugs that are given
      together will shrink the patient's tumor and how well they will prolong the time it takes
      their tumor to grow. The investigators also wish to find out how they affect certain
      substances in the patient's tumor and in their blood important for tumor growth. The
      combination of these drugs is experimental, and has not been proven to help treat melanoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      [RECIST]) and one-year overall survival to the study drugs temsirolimus and AZD6244
      (selumetinib) hydrogen sulfate in BRAF V600E mutant unresectable stage IV melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate 6-month progression-free survival in patients receiving temsirolimus and AZD6244
      hydrogen sulfate.

      II. Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of temsirolimus and AZD6244 on pERK, s6K, PTEN and
      mediators of apoptosis.

      III. Determine the toxicity profile of temsirolimus with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.

      OUTLINE:

      Treatment Phase: This period begins with the first intravenous (through the vein) infusion of
      TEMSIROLIMUS and the first AZD6244 administration by mouth (visit 2, Week 1) and will
      continue until Week 8 (Visit 4).

      As many as 38 patients will receive the same dosage of TEMSIROLIMUS injected in the veins
      once a week for 8 weeks, and the AZD6244 will be given as capsules by mouth twice a day for 8
      weeks. That is one cycle. The TEMSIROLIMUS and AZD6244 will be given to participants as an
      outpatient, unless admission to the hospital was needed for treatment of related side effects
      or underlying disease. The subsequent cycles of TEMSIROLIMUS and AZD6244 will be given every
      8 weeks. The TEMSIROLIMUS will be injected in a vein over 30 minutes.

      The continuation phase begins with visits at weeks 12 in patients who receive at least two
      cycles of treatments.

    <description>Anti-tumor response (CR+PR) was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>Patients will be evaluated by physical examination and imaging assessments (brain MRI and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis). Disease progression will be defined by RECIST criteria on physical exam or diagnostic imaging assessments that are attributed to metastatic melanoma.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

        <description>Anti-tumor response (CR+PR) was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

Investigators planned for as many as 38 patients to receive the same dosage of TEMSIROLIMUS injected in the veins once a week for 8 weeks, and the AZD6244 would be given as capsules by mouth twice a day for 8 weeks. That is one cycle. The TEMSIROLIMUS and AZD6244 would be given to participants as an outpatient, unless admission to the hospital was needed for treatment of related side effects or underlying disease. The subsequent cycles of TEMSIROLIMUS and AZD6244 would be given every 8 weeks. The TEMSIROLIMUS would be injected in a vein over 30 minutes.
The continuation phase would begin with visits at weeks 12 in patients who received at least two cycles of treatments.</description>

        <description>Patients will be evaluated by physical examination and imaging assessments (brain MRI and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis). Disease progression will be defined by RECIST criteria on physical exam or diagnostic imaging assessments that are attributed to metastatic melanoma.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
