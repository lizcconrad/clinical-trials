      The objective of this study is to compare hematological toxicity, costs, health-related
      quality of Life (HR-QOL) and outcomes observed in real life in the Belgian Non-Hodgkin
      Lymphoma (NHL) population receiving 90Y-Zevalin, with model-predicted data at reimbursement
      on the basis of a clinical trial in heavily pre-treated NHL.
