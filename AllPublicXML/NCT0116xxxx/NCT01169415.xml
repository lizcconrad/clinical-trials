      Purpose and Objective:

        1. To compare the effects of either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone on
           functional capacity in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.

        2. To compare neurocognitive function in newly diagnosed GBM patients receiving either an
           abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.

        3. To compare skeletal muscle strength in newly diagnosed GBM patients receiving either an
           abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.

        4. To examine the association between functional capacity and neurocognitive function and
           patient-reported measures (i.e. quality of life, fatigue, etc.) in newly diagnosed GBM
           patient on either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.

        5. To examine the association between functional capacity and neurocognitive function and
           body composition measures (body-mass index, etc.) in newly diagnosed GBM patient on
           either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.

        6. To examine the association between functional capacity and neurocognitive function and
           biochemical metabolic measurements in newly diagnosed GBM patient on either an
           abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.

      All study endpoints will be assessed at three timepoints as follows: (1) initial assessment
      after surgery in the hospital, (2) second assessment at initial clinical visit at the Preston
      Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRT-BTC) at Duke, approximately 1 week post-operatively, and
      (3) third assessment at second clinical visit in the PRT-BTC at Duke, approximately 10 weeks
      post-operatively and after completion of radiotherapy. An additional fourth assessment will
      be obtained at 4 weeks post-operatively if the subject is undergoing radiotherapy here at
      Duke.

      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial. After obtaining written informed
      consent, all participants will be randomized to either an abbreviated (14 days) or protracted
      (30 days) course of dexamethasone post-operatively.
