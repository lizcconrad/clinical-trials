    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 4 weeks after last dose (up to 67 months) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

    <description>The PGA of psoriasis was scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), induration (I), and scaling (S) across all psoriatic lesions in participants. The severity rating scores (Erythema: 0= no evidence of erythema to 4= dark, deep red; Induration: 0= no evidence of plaque elevation to 4= marked plaque elevation, hard/sharp borders; Scaling: 0= no evidence of scaling to 4= thick, coarse scale predominates) were summed (E + I + S = total) and the average (total/3) was taken. The total average was rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA. The 5-point scale for PGA was: 0= clear; 1= almost clear; 2= mild; 3= moderate; 4= severe, where higher score indicated more severity of psoriasis. Percentage of participants with response of 'clear' (score of '0') and 'almost clear' (score of '1') were reported.</description>

    <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity (estimated by 3 components: of erythema, induration and scaling) and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Each component of severity, that is, erythema, induration and scaling was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] and lower limbs [l]) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Higher score indicates greater severity. Final PASI score = 0.1Ah (Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2Au (Eu + Iu + Su) + 0.3At (Et + It + St) + 0.4Al (El + Il + Sl), where head and neck: 0.1; upper limbs: 0.2; trunk: 0.3; lower limbs: 0.4.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Physician Global Assessment (PGA) Response of 'Clear' or 'Almost Clear'</title>
        <description>The PGA of psoriasis was scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), induration (I), and scaling (S) across all psoriatic lesions in participants. The severity rating scores (Erythema: 0= no evidence of erythema to 4= dark, deep red; Induration: 0= no evidence of plaque elevation to 4= marked plaque elevation, hard/sharp borders; Scaling: 0= no evidence of scaling to 4= thick, coarse scale predominates) were summed (E + I + S = total) and the average (total/3) was taken. The total average was rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA. The 5-point scale for PGA was: 0= clear; 1= almost clear; 2= mild; 3= moderate; 4= severe, where higher score indicated more severity of psoriasis. Percentage of participants with response of 'clear' (score of '0') and 'almost clear' (score of '1') were reported.</description>

        <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Component Scores: Induration</title>
        <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity (estimated by 3 components: of erythema, induration and scaling) and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Induration was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) on a 5-point scale ranges from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, excluding the participants who had compliance issues. Here, ‘number of participants analyzed’ signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time points for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Component Scores: Scaling</title>
        <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity (estimated by 3 components: of erythema, induration and scaling) and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Scaling was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) on a 5-point scale ranges from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, excluding the participants who had compliance issues. Here, ‘number of participants analyzed’ signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time points for each arm, respectively.</population>

After 3 months of treatment, participants received twice daily dosing of tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg tablets until any safety and efficacy finding requiring study discontinuation (up to a maximum of 66 months). Dose adjustment (5 mg or 10 mg) was assessed on every 3 month visit and was based on investigator’s discretion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Component Scores: Erythema at Month 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity (estimated by 3 components: of erythema, induration and scaling) and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Erythema was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) on a 5-point scale ranges from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Component Scores: Induration at Month 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity (estimated by 3 components: of erythema, induration and scaling) and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Induration was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) on a 5-point scale ranges from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, excluding the participants who had compliance issues. Here, ‘number of participants analyzed’ signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time points for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Component Scores: Scaling at Month 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48</title>
        <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity (estimated by 3 components: of erythema, induration and scaling) and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Scaling was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) on a 5-point scale ranges from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, excluding the participants who had compliance issues. Here, ‘number of participants analyzed’ signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time points for each arm, respectively.</population>

            <description>Participants received Tofacitinib 10 mg tablets orally twice daily for a period of 3 months. After 3 months of treatment, participants received twice daily dosing of tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg tablets until any safety and efficacy finding requiring study discontinuation (up to a maximum of 66 months). Dose adjustment (5 mg or 10 mg) was assessed on every 3 month visit and was based on investigator’s discretion.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) 50 Percent Reduction From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Scores</title>
        <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity (estimated by 3 components: of erythema, induration and scaling) and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Each component of severity, that is, erythema, induration and scaling was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] and lower limbs [l]) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Higher score indicates greater severity. Final PASI score = 0.1Ah (Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2Au (Eu + Iu + Su) + 0.3At (Et + It + St) + 0.4Al (El + Il + Sl), where head and neck: 0.1; upper limbs: 0.2; trunk: 0.3; lower limbs: 0.4. Percentage of participants with &gt;=50% reduction from baseline in PASI scores were reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) 125 Percent Increase From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Scores</title>
        <description>PASI score is the combined assessment of lesion severity (estimated by 3 components: of erythema, induration and scaling) and area affected into single score range: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. Each component of severity, that is, erythema, induration and scaling was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] and lower limbs [l]) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. Higher score indicates greater severity. Final PASI score = 0.1Ah (Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2Au (Eu + Iu + Su) + 0.3At (Et + It + St) + 0.4Al (El + Il + Sl), where head and neck: 0.1; upper limbs: 0.2; trunk: 0.3; lower limbs: 0.4. Percentage of participants with &gt;=125% increase from baseline in PASI scores were reported.</description>

        <description>ISI assessed severity of itching due to psoriasis. ISI was a single item, horizontal numeric rating scale. Participants were asked to rate their 'severity of itching' due to psoriasis over the past 24 hours on a numeric rating scale anchored by the terms '0=no itching' and '10=worst possible itching' at the ends. Higher scores indicated greater severity of itching.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 questionnaire, version 2, acute was a 36-item generic health status measure. SF-36 evaluated 8 health-related aspects of an individual: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, social functioning, mental health, role emotional, vitality, and general health. The score range for each of the 8 health aspects ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores indicating good health condition. Two summary scale scores were computed from the 8 health aspect scores: physical component summary score and mental component summary score. Score range for both summary scales ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores indicating good health condition.</description>

          <description>The PtGA evaluated the overall skin disease of participants at that point in time on a single-item. Participants provided their response on a 5-point scale ranges from: 0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe. Higher score indicated greater severity of disease. Participants who provided their response as “clear (score of 0)” or “almost clear (score of 1)” in PtGA at each specified visit were reported in this outcome measure.</description>
          <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, excluding the participants who had compliance issues. Here, ‘number of participants analyzed’ signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time points for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated 5-dimension (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression) questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Each dimension was assessed on a 3-point scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems, where higher scores=worse health condition). The responses from the 5 dimensions were used to calculate a single utility index value. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigned a utility value for each dimension in the profile. Score was transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicated a better health state.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Answered Psoriasis Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire (Ps-HCRU)</title>
        <description>Ps-HCRU was a short questionnaire designed to assess healthcare resource use and the impact of psoriasis on work. In the first section, it assessed direct costs associated with healthcare resource use which included participant’s interactions with healthcare providers such as general practitioners, dermatologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, surgeons and nurses. When taking the evening dose of tofacitinib, participants were asked to answer the Ps-HCRU questionnaire only if they had an interaction with a healthcare provider or their work was impacted by psoriasis on that specified day. In this outcome measure, number of participants who answered Ps-HCRU at any specified visits were reported.</description>
