      Brief Summary:

      RATIONALE: Comparing results of diagnostic procedures, such as esophagoscopy, done before and
      after radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to
      treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying esophagoscopy in evaluating treatment in patients
      with stage I-IV head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy and/or
      chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the prevalence of esophageal pathology (any esophageal abnormality,
      specifically: esophagitis, stricture/web, infections, neoplasms) as identified by
      esophagoscopy in patients with HNCA before and 3 months following primary radiation and/or
      chemotherapy.

      II. To assess the changes in self-reported dysphagia symptoms as measured by the Eating
      Assessment Tool.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo transnasal esophagoscopy at baseline and 3 months following completion of
      radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.
