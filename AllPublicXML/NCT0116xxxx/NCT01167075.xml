  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the low-volume supplement.
      The investigators randomized critically ill patients to receive Intestamin plus Fresubin or
      Fresubin alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare early supplementation with antioxidants and glutamine using an enteral
      pharmaconutrition supplement (Intestamin®) to an energy adjusted standard elementary diet and
      to investigate its affect on clinical efficacy and tolerability in critically ill patients
      with sepsis/SIRS.

      Methods: This was a prospective controlled randomized study in 58 critically ill patients.
      They received either Intestamin or a diluted Fresubin solution. After 10 or 14 days
      inflammatory parameters, catecholamine need, and maximal enteral delivery were determined.
