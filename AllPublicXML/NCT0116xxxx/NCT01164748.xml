      Rationale: Like in primary breast cancer, prognosis in recurrent breast cancer is correlated
      with regional lymph node status. Therefore, axillary staging may be warranted in patients
      with recurrent disease and intact axillary nodes, although this has not been described in
      guidelines yet. The lymphatic drainage pathways in the breast and/or axilla could have been
      changed due to prior surgery and/or radiotherapy. These aberrant drainage pathways could be
      detected with lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy (SNB), leading to a more accurate
      staging.

      Objective: To assess the technical feasibility of lymphoscintigraphy after prior breast
      surgery. A second goal is to investigate whether or not previous breast surgery (with or
      without radiotherapy) significantly changes the lymphatic drainage pathways of the breast.

        We included patients that received BCT with SNB and/or ALND for primary breast cancer
        located in the upper-outer quadrant of one breast at least 3 years before this analysis.
        Patients were excluded if they had breast surgery for other reasons than breast cancer, had
        recurrent breast cancer or had a former allergic reaction to 99mTc-colloidal-albumin.

        44 patients were included and were divided into two groups according to previous surgical
        treatment of the axilla, being the sentinel node biopsy group and the Axillary Lymph Node
        Dissection group
