  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that antagonism of neuromuscular blockade (neostigmine 0.04 mg kg-1)
      affects depth of anaesthesia with an increase in bispectral index (mean maximal change of
      7.1) and middle-latency auditory evoked potentials (mean maximal change of 9.7).

      Sugammadex has a quicker and more complete effect than neostigmine. This study aims to
      demonstrate if sugammadex administration increases bispectral and neurosense indices of the
      depth of anesthesia while patients still receive propofol-remifentanil iv anesthesia.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Sugammadex - Nacl 9/00:
Patients will first receive sugammadex: 4 mg/kg when post tetanic count shows at least 1 or 2 responses; 2 mg/kg when Train of four shows at least 2 responses.
In case of complete reversal of myorelaxation, total intravenous anesthesia is stopped and patients are allowed to awake.
In the adverse case, patients wil receive Nacl 9/00 5 minutes after the first bolus of sugammadex.
The study is finished 5 minutes after this second injection and care is let to the choice of the anesthesiologist in charge.</description>

Patients wil first receive Nacl 9/00. In case of complete reversal of myorelaxation, total intravenous anesthesia is stopped and patients are allowed to awake.
In the adverse case, patients wil receive sugammadex 5 minutes after the first bolus of Nacl 9/00.
Sugammadex is given as: 4 mg/kg when post tetanic count shows at least 1 or 2 responses; 2 mg/kg when Train of four shows at least 2 responses.
