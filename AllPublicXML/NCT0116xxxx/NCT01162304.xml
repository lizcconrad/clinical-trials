    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that subjects will have greater pain relief when taking
      IR-oxycodone compared with ER-oxycodone for several reasons. The ability to take a varying
      amount of medication at six different points over the course of a day will allow patients to
      take as much (or as little) medication as they need to control their pain. In addition, the
      ability to vary the medication doses in this way will give them a greater sense of control,
      which will also contribute to greater pain relief. Similarly, the investigators predict that
      patients will show greater benefits with IR-oxycodone on the measures of physical and
      emotional functioning. Because there is relatively little data on sleep apnea in chronic pain
      patients (Webster et al., 2008), these assessments are exploratory and not hypothesis-based.
      Finally, although it is typically thought that the abuse liability of IR-opioid medications
      is greater than for ER-medications, the data on which this belief are based have not involved
      systematic studies of patients with chronic pain; the assessments of abuse liability will
      therefore also be exploratory.

      This study is a single-center, randomized, open-label, 13-week, 2-period crossover clinical
      trial. Subjects will complete each of the following (unless they withdraw from the trial):
      (1) a one-week baseline period during which the subject completes pain diaries and remains on
      stable dosages of their existing pain medications; (2) immediate-release (IR) oxycodone 5 mg
      3-4 pills every four hours; (3) extended-release (ER) oxycodone 40 mg 1 pill every 12 hours
      and IR-oxycodone 5 mg 1-2 pills every six hours. Subjects will be randomized to one of two
      treatment sequences (ER-oxycodone first then IR-oxycodone or vice verse). It is expected that
      this trial will take approximately 2 years to complete.

      Crossover periods. Each of the two treatment periods will be 6 weeks in duration, which will
      allow ample time to assess pain relief, adverse effects, treatment satisfaction, and impact
      of treatment on health-related quality of life. There will be no need for a titration period
      at the beginning of either period or for a washout period before the second period because
      oxycodone at the same dosages will be administered in both periods. At each visit, subjects
      will be given sufficient medication to sustain them until at least the following visit.

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this clinical trial will be pain relief documented in the subjects' daily pain diaries. Specifically, the average of the daily pain ratings recorded by subjects during the final weeks of the two treatment periods will be compared. The treatment comparison of interest is IR-oxycodone vs. ER-oxycodone, which will be tested at the p &lt; 0.05 level using a two-tailed test.</description>
