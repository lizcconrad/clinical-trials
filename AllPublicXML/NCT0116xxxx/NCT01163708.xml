      This project aims to assess two different techniques used to position the knee replacement
      implant during surgery. The patients will be randomised to receive either the following:

        1. The established Navigation System (gold standard)

        2. The new Prophecy Technique (validated by the Navigation System)

      The study hypothesis is there will be no difference between the gold standard Navigation
      system and the Prophecy technique in relation to the placement of the knee implant.

      Knee joint pain is often the cause of reduced joint and limb function. Total knee joint
      replacement is a procedure which aims to relieve pain and help to improve mobility. There has
      been continued development and improvement in knee implant design and the instruments
      required during surgery to assist with the accurate placement of the implant. These
      developments have reduced surgery time and assisted in the accurate positioning of the knee
      implant, which leads to better long term outcomes.

      Navigation system is a computerised system currently used intraoperatively to position the
      Advance knee implant. The Prophecy technique is a pre-operative alignment technique. Patient
      undergo a MRI or CT scan which is used to manufacture personalised cutting blocks which are
      then used intraoperatively to position the knee implant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients requiring a total Knee Arthroplasty as determined jointly by the surgeon and
             the patient.

          2. Over 65 years of age at time of surgery.

          3. Patients with the Varus or Valgus Osteoarthritis

          4. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing to participate for
             the length of the prescribed term of follow-up.

          5. Patients who are capable of, and have given, informed consent to their participation
             in the study.

          6. The individual does not have an active infection within the affected joint.

          7. The individual has not had a previous total knee replacement or knee fusion of the
             affected knee joint.

          8. The individual is skeletally mature.

          9. The individual is not pregnant.

         10. The individual is not a prisoner.

         11. The individual has no plans to relocate to another geographic area before the
             completion of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous surgery requiring implanting a device.

          2. Knee deformity is &gt;30° anatomic varus (as measured on an AP radiograph taken with the
             patient standing)

          3. Knee deformity is &gt;30° anatomic valgus (as measured on an AP radiograph taken with the
             patient standing) &gt;20° knee flexion contracture (as measured by investigator
             examination)

          4. Those patients requiring bone grafting or any other procedure that would extend the
             operative time beyond that of just replacing the knee should be excluded.

          5. The individual is classified as morbidly obese (&gt;40 BMI).

          6. The individual is physically or mentally compromised (i.e., currently being treated
             for a psychiatric disorder, senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, presence of alcohol
             or substance abuse), and is unwilling or unable to comply with postoperative scheduled
             clinical and radiographic evaluation and rehabilitation.

          7. The individual has a neuromuscular or neuro-sensory deficiency which limits the
             ability to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device.
