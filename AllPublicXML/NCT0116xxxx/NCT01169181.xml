      The procedure involves: (1) assisted hand movement by a mechanical device, (2) mechanical
      vibration applied to the surface of the forearm, and (3) stimulation of the brain with either
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcortical direct current stimulation (DCS).
      These 3 components of the procedure are carried out simultaneously. Each subject will be
      evaluated pre- and post-treatment with several clinical tests of functional movement. The
      hypotheses of this project are that the AMES+rTMS and AMES+tDCS procedures are safe and will
      enable most of the stroke patients to recover finger extension.

      This protocol is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of a procedure for treating
      chronic (&gt;1 year post) stroke patients who still cannot move the hand affected by the stroke.
      The treatment involves: (1) assisted hand movement by a mechanical device, (2) mechanical
      vibration applied to the surface of the forearm, and (3) stimulation of the brain with either
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcortical direct current stimulation (DCS).
      Subjects receiving TMS during treatment are expected to respond more fully (i.e., increased
      volitional EMG) in the treated hand compared to those receiving DCS.
