  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General:Prospective, randomized, double blind controlled trial of the food supplement
      GOLDTRAIN PLUS, to assess its safety and efficacy in comparison to placebo in subjects with
      upper respiratory infection.

      Hypothesis: The food supplement GOLDTRAIN PLUS will be superior to placebo in shortening the
      time to recovery from the disease symptoms.

      Study design and outcome measures:Study population of 182 generally healthy subjects with
      acute respiratory infection randomized in 1:1 ratio to active supplement versus placebo
      treatment, with randomization stratified by site. The study supplement administration will be
      continued for 7 days, and patient global assessment (PGA) will be the main primary
      measurement tool, based on a self-reporting questionnaire filled and monitored every 12 hours
      for 7 consecutive days. Throat and nasal swabs determining type of viral infection, will be
      taken at inclusion of patient and a number of blood tests at the end of treatment to look for
      any adverse effects of the medication.

      Analysis and conclusion: All data-from the filled questionnaires, clinical follow up and
      laboratory studies will be analyzed by multivariate analysis to determine the efficacy of the
      supplement and its correlation to the clinical and laboratory parameters.

Time from the enrollment to the first 12 hours when the subject reports on a sustained improvement in symptoms (two consequent 12 hours periods) will be a primary outcome. The study supplement administration will be continued for 7 days.</description>
