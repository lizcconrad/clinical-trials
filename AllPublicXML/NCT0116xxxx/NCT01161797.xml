      The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between 1,5-Anhydroglucitol in patients
      with HbA1C &lt;7%, and glycemic excursions as assessed by the continuous glucose monitoring
      system compared to fructosamine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1,5-Anhydroglucitol (AG) is a glucose analogue present in the plasma of healthy subjects.
      Physiologically, the plasma levels of 1,5-AG are very stable and only a small quantity is
      excreted in the urine. It is competitively reabsorbed with glucose in the renal tubules.
      Therefore, in the hyperglycemic state where glycosuria is present, glucose competitively
      inhibits renal tubular reabsorption of 1,5-AG and consequently the plasma 1,5-AG levels
      decrease. When glycemia is normalized and glycosuria is resolved, 1,5-AG levels increase.

      The usefulness of 1, 5-AG in reflecting glycemic excursions have been demonstrated in
      moderately controlled patients to some extent, although some studies reveal controversial
      results.

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of 1,5-AG and postprandial
      hyperglycemia determined using the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) in DM patients
      with HbA1C&lt;7% and evaluate the usefulness of 1,5-AG as a marker of glycemic control compared
      to HbA1C and fructosamine.
