  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass and function (widely recognized as
      &quot;frailty&quot;), is increasingly being appreciated, primarily in the research environment.
      Interventions to prevent or treat sarcopenia can be anticipated to reduce falls, fractures
      and thereby to facilitate independence and improve quality of life for older adults.
      Unfortunately, there is no current consensus definition of sarcopenia, thereby impeding
      clinical recognition and treatment. It has been advocated that low appendicular (arm and leg)
      lean mass, as measured by DXA, be utilized as a clinical diagnostic tool to define
      sarcopenia. While such an approach is possible, however, muscle strength loss is more rapid
      than mass loss, indicating deterioration of muscle &quot;quality.&quot; Muscle quality may be affected
      by changes at the neuromuscular, cellular or subcellular levels; parameters not detected by
      measuring mass alone. Clearly, tools evaluating muscle performance, not simply mass, are
      needed to optimally identify, and subsequently monitor, treatment of older adults with
      sarcopenia. While current tests of muscle power/function (e.g., chair-rising, self-selected
      gait velocity, etc.) do correlate with functional limitation in older adults, these existing
      tests have limitations in that they cannot be performed in all people, may have &quot;yes/no&quot;
      results rather than a continuous scale and may not be highly precise. Thus, improved muscle
      function assessment tools are needed, both clinically and in research venues. Jumping
      mechanography is very likely one such methodology.

        Ambulatory community dwelling adults who are able to stand without assistance. Both men and
        women age ≥ 70 years from the Madison Wisconsin area. Specifically, participants will be
        enrolled using the following strata in each gender group: low vitamin D/low functional
        status (12 men and 12 women), normal vitamin D/low functional status (12 men and 12 women),
        low vitamin D/high functional status (12 men and 12 women), and normal vitamin D/high
        functional status (12 men and 12 women). Low vitamin D will be defined as 25(OH)D
        concentrations &lt; 25 ng/ml, normal vitamin D status will be defined as 25(OH)D concentration
        of 30 ng/ml or greater. Functional status will be based on screening short physical
        performance battery (SPPB) score dichotomized at &lt;9 vs. 9 and above.
