  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly.
      In most people, the illness is complicated by co-occurring psychiatric problems such as
      depression and anxiety. These non-motor concerns negatively affect the course and management
      of the disease, often leading to poor outcomes for both patients and their families. Despite
      these deleterious consequences, psychiatric symptoms in PD are both underreported by patients
      as well as under-recognized and under-treated by health care providers.

      The primary purpose of this study is to identify and describe barriers to mental healthcare
      utilization for people with Parkinson's disease. Secondary objectives include the assessment
      of attitudes and preferences regarding the need for mental health services in the PD
      community and the acceptability of telehealth interventions as a method for improving access
      and quality of care. In order to accomplish these aims, participants will be asked to fill
      out an anonymous survey which will take about 15-30 minutes to complete. To best accommodate
      PD patients with varying levels of disability, participants will have the option to complete
      the survey online, on paper, or over the phone. The information obtained from this study will
      be used to support future treatment development efforts (i.e., phone and internet based
      interventions, community based trainings with local providers) intended to improve access and
      quality of mental health care for people with PD. To the best of the investigators knowledge,
      this is the first study to systematically examine barriers to mental healthcare utilization
      in PD in a national sample.

    <measure>Most Commonly Reported Past Barrier to Mental Health Services: &quot;Anyone in my Situation Would be Struggling&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Lifetime</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this study was to assess the 3 most commonly reported past and future barriers to mental health services. This outcome represents the most common past barrier to mental health services reported by survey respondents. The outcome reported is the percentage of all respondents surveyed who endorsed this particular past barrier. This barrier can best be described as low mental health literacy.
NOTE: This is an anonymous, cross-sectional survey study. Not all participants responded to every item, so sample size varies between outcome measures.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this study was to assess the 3 most commonly reported past and future barriers to mental health services. This outcome represents the 2nd most common past barrier to mental health services reported by survey respondents.

This barrier can best be described as limited knowledge of PD amongst treatment providers.

        <title>2nd Most Commonly Reported Past Barrier to Mental Health Services: &quot;Doctors Are Not Sensitive Enough to PD-related Issues&quot;</title>
        <description>The purpose of this study was to assess the 3 most commonly reported past and future barriers to mental health services. This outcome represents the 2nd most common past barrier to mental health services reported by survey respondents. The outcome reported is the percentage of all respondents surveyed who endorsed this particular past barrier. This barrier can best be described as limited knowledge of PD amongst treatment providers.
NOTE: This is an anonymous, cross-sectional survey study. Not all participants responded to every item, so sample size varies between outcome measures.</description>
