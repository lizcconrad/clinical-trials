  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a safe, noninvasive investigation where a patient
      walks on a treadmill or cycles whilst attached to an ECG and with a mask that measures the
      air breathed in and out. It has numerous clinical uses, such as diagnosing the main cause in
      patients with breathlessness, deciding on timing for heart transplantation and assessing
      whether patients are safe for a general anaesthetic.

      A patient's peak oxygen consumption, the maximum amount of oxygen taken up by the blood from
      the lungs when breathing increases during exercise, is the main measurement taken from CPET.
      It is low in heart disease and has been used to predict the risk of death and therefore plan
      treatments for patients. However this is also low in numerous other diseases including lung
      disease; reduced oxygen consumption in patients with two conditions may be wrongly thought to
      be because of the heart leading to inappropriate action and distress to the patient.

      Newer measurements of exercise capacity from the same exercise test are better at predicting
      death in heart failure.

      We propose that they are more specific for heart failure over other diseases, for example
      lung disease, when compared with peak oxygen consumption, and are superior when a single best
      test for heart failure is required.

      This research aims to identify which measurement of exercise capacity is most specific for
      heart failure. We will perform the test on many patients with different diseases, and before
      and after procedures such as the implantation of special pacemakers, and heart valve
      operations. This should lead to a more accepted use of this investigation and the more
      appropriate identification of which patient should have which procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure, where the heart muscle is damaged and is unable to pump blood efficiently,
      affects 9% of those aged 55 or more and is responsible for about 2% of the hospital
      admissions in the UK. The first symptom many patients complain of is breathlessness on
      exercise and an inability to perform their normal daily activities. Unfortunately these
      symptoms are similar to those experienced in numerous diseases of the heart and lungs.
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, through measuring numerous values taken from breathing
      during exercise can tell us which disease is causing the symptoms.

      The leading parameter from a CPET, peak VO2, has for many years been the single value used to
      guide management of patients following a diagnosis of many diseases from the heart and lungs.
      Newer measures predict outcome from heart failure (our principal area of interest) better. We
      believe this may be because they are less affected by lung disease than peak VO2 and we know
      that many patients have both heart and lung diseases.

      By showing the best CPET variable for each individual disease state, we will be able to
      ensure patients are correctly put into a level of risk for their condition and that they will
      be followed-up with the most accurate marker from exercise testing, rather than a &quot;one size
      fits all&quot; approach of peak VO2.

      With regards to heart valve disease, standard exercise testing just using ECG leads, rather
      than cardiopulmonary exercise testing, is starting to be used more in identifying patients
      without symptoms for possible surgery. The inaccuracy of this test will inevitably lead to
      patients being wrongly categorised. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a much more accurate
      way of establishing the impact of any disease on the heart or lung over traditional exercise
      testing and therefore we believe that evidence of its role around the time of surgery could
      be used as further support for its role in improving decision making for patient.

      Ultimately the greater knowledge of this test and when we should use it will help patients
      with very common heart conditions to be treated appropriately, potentially helping many
      patients.

In the Interventional Cohort Study the primary outcome is the change in a variable (peak VO2, VE/VCO2, OUES, Tau, AT) from before to after an intervention which is required on clinical grounds.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged over 18 years of age.

          2. Able to perform cycle ergometry and agree to perform between 2 and 3 tests.

          3. If previously undergone echocardiography there is evidence of reasonable echo windows
             (good views).

          4. Agree to the full study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant coexistent pathologies of the groups tested unless specifically in that
             group of mixed pathologies in the &quot;Observational Study&quot;. This includes any combination
             of COPD or restrictive lung disease alongside heart failure and valvular disease.
             Therefore all cardiac conditions should have no significant limitation on spirometry,
             and all patients with lung disease should have good left ventricular function with no
             significant increases in pulmonary vascular pressures as seen on echocardiography.
             Patients with atrial fibrillation/ flutter will be excluded. Patients with more than
             mild valvular lesions will be excluded from all groups except the joint group and the
             group with mitral valvular disease

          2. Symptomatic coronary disease, or significant ischaemia noted on cardiopulmonary
             exercise test (unless accounted for by aortic valve disease, in which case a prior
             coronary angiogram would have been undertaken if significant coronary disease then
             they will not be invited to participate).

          3. Anaemia (Hb &lt;12 in men, &lt;11 in women).

          4. Obesity (BMI &gt;30) which could lead to limitation independent of the cardiovascular or
             respiratory condition.

          5. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3 or above (estimated GFR &lt;60ml/hr as calculated by
             Cockcroft Gault equation). The metabolic acidosis associated with this condition will
             affect ventilatory equivalents.

          6. Poor echocardiographic windows so that a full data set is not achievable.

          7. Inability to perform a symptom limited cardiopulmonary exercise test.

          8. Inability to perform spirometry.

          9. Inability to consent/make decisions (lack of competence)

         10. Vulnerable adult/current detainee in prison/elsewhere.

         11. Significant neurological or musculoskeletal abnormalities.

         12. Inability to complete all the investigations at the time intervals agreed in the
             protocol.

         13. Permanent Pacemaker unless in the biventricular pacemaker group in the Interventional
             Study. These patients in this group will be excluded if they are pacing dependent
             (when the biventricular function is disabled they do not have a normal intrinsic
             rhythm) and if they have significant first degree AV block at rest or on exercise
             (will activate right ventricular pacing after a sinus beat).

         14. Patients in the atrial fibrillation interventional group will be excluded if they
             revert back to atrial fibrillation after the procedure, or the procedure never
             restores sinus rhythm. These patients will still be eligible for inclusion in the
             observational study.

         15. Recent (recovery within &lt;1month) decompensation of their underlying cardiac or
             respiratory disorder.

         16. Uncontrolled hypertension.

         17. Untreated life threatening arrhythmia.

         18. Recent surgery (within 10 weeks).
