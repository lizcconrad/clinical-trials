      Objective: To compare the clinical effectiveness and hospital costs, the initial empirical
      treatment, Oxacillin / Ceftriaxone and Amoxicillin / Clavulanate in children with Community
      Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) severe.

      Methods: Clinical prospective randomized study in children aged two months to five years of
      age with a diagnosis of severe CAP, according to criteria of World Health Organization (WHO),
      admitted to the Pediatrics Ward of the Hospital of the Medical School of Botucatu- UNESP. We
      excluded children with comorbid disorders (primary and secondary immunodeficiency) with acute
      or chronic kidney disease, referred patients receiving antibiotics proposal and history of
      allergy to antibiotics proposed. We included 104 children who were randomized into two groups
      to receive: Oxacillin / Ceftriaxone IV (GCO, n = 48) and Amoxicillin / Clavulanate IV (GAA, n
      = 56). Patients of the GAA, after clinical improvement, has been receiving the same oral
      antibiotic, and maintaining clinical stability, were discharged from hospital, the GOC
      received any IV treatment. The outcomes analyzed were time to clinical improvement (fever and
      tachypnea), duration of oxygen therapy, hospitalization time, need to expand the
      antimicrobial spectrum progression to pleural effusion / empyema (DP / E) and hospital costs.
      Treatment failure was determined by the need to expand the antimicrobial spectrum after 48
      hours of hospitalization.

      eligibility: Children aged two months to five years with diagnosis of severe community
      acquired pneumonia, requiring hospitalization.

      Outcomes measures: time to clinical improvement (respiratory rate and fever), duration of
      oxygen therapy, length of stay in the Division of Pediatrics, evolution with clinical
      complications, need for broadening the spectrum antimicrobials.
