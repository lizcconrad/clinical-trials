    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ascending, 3-way crossover
      study in healthy adult male volunteers. The primary objective of the study is to assess the
      pharmacokinetics of 14 days dosing of GW870086X administered via nebules formulation. The
      secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of nebulised
      GW870086X.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GW870086X is a potent glucocorticoid agonist in human in vitro functional assays that is
      under development as an inhaled treatment for asthma in children. This study will determine
      the PK characteristics and assess the safety and tolerability of the nebules formulation of
      GW870086X in healthy volunteers after 14 days of dosing.

      This is the first clinical study that will be assessing the nebules formulation. The purpose
      of this study is to ensure that the doses that have been selected have a good safety profile
      in line with what has been found in the previous DPI formulation studies, and to assess the
      PK profile after single (Day 1) and repeat dose (Day 14) to select appropriate doses for
      future studies with the nebules formulation. This study will also provide additional safety
      cover with the nebules formulation given over a longer duration than studied previously with
      the DPI formulation before moving into the paediatric programme. This study is designed to
      give at least 5-fold cover for the highest dose to be studied in future paediatric
      programmes. During this study cortisol production will be assessed by measuring 24 hour
      cortisol profile in serum and urine as well as performing an ACTH stimulation test. Two doses
      (5mg and 8.75mg) have been selected. These doses are 5 and 10 times higher than the
      anticipated maximum clinical dose. The doses have been selected to ensure sufficient safety
      cover in future paediatric studies as well as to confirm the absence of significant adrenal
      inhibition at doses that would be expected to cause complete inhibition of cortisol
      production with traditional steroids.

                  Block.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
             criteria apply:

                  result within 3 months of screening.

               2. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary
                  abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic

               5. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

                  For EU sites: an average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males. One unit is
                  equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (125 ml) of
                  wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits.

               6. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an
                  investigational product within the following time period prior to the first
                  dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of
                  the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).

               7. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the
                  first dosing day.

               9. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or
                  a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or
                  GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

              10. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood
                  products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.
