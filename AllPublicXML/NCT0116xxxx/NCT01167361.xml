      This study aims to prospectively estimate the incidence of Respiratory virus (RV) infections
      in children with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or lower respiratory
      tract infection (LRTI) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) using the FilmArrayTM
      System, a novel highly sensitive and rapid assay for RV detection. An aliquot from the
      leftover sample remaining after clinical diagnostic testing will be used for FilmArrayTM
      analysis. Patients will be accrued on the study over a one year period.

      The Primary Objective of the study is:

        -  Prospectively estimate the incidence of Respiratory virus (RV) infections in children
           with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or lower respiratory tract
           infection (LRTI) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital(SJCRH).

      The Secondary Objectives of the study are:

        -  Study the association between RV infections and clinical variables.

        -  Prospectively estimate the duration of RV infections in symptomatic children at SJCRH.

        -  Compare the sensitivity and specificity of the current molecular method of analysis of
           respiratory viruses with the FilmArrayTM method.

    <description>Respiratory Virus infections in children who are symptomatic with either an Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and/or Lower Respiratory Tract Infections is determined by using a novel highly sensitive and rapid assay for RV detection. An aliquot from the leftover sample remaining after clinical diagnostic testing will be used for FilmArrayTM analysis. Specimens collected will include nasopharyngeal washes, nasopharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage as ordered by the treating physician. Diagnostic studies on this specimen will be performed as ordered and the results will be available to the treating physicians after reporting.</description>
