  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder which
      affects 3 to 5 % of school age children. This disorder persists in the adulthood for 60 % of
      subjects. Children with ADHD are sleepier during the day than normal children. However, there
      is no information concerning the diurnal sleepiness of adults with ADHD and the impact of
      this sleepiness on their driving capacity. The investigators postulate that the negative
      impact of ADHD is due to an awakening disorder which adds to the attentional disorder. The
      aim of this study is to estimate both the sleepiness by a Maintenance Wakefulness Test (MWT)
      and the capacity to drive in adults with ADHD.

      The main objective of this study is to estimate both the sleepiness by a Maintenance
      Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the capacity to drive in adults presenting an ADHD. Duration of
      participation for each patients will be 7 days. Four days after inclusion, patients will have
      to stop all psychostimulant treatment. Participants will then spend 24 hours (on days 6 and
      7) at the &quot;Groupe d'Etudes Neurophysiologie Pharmacologie Sommeil et Sommnolence&quot;(GENPPHASS)
      in the &quot;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire&quot;(CHU) of Bordeaux. During this time, they will
      undergo complete polysomnography.The next day, they will perform a Maintenance Wakefulness
      Test (MWT). A neuropsychological evaluation of one hour will also be done. Finally, a driving
      test on a simulator will be performed.

      Study significance: patients will benefit from an objective exploration of their sleep (with
      possibly, a sleep disorder discovery) and from a specific treatment. This study will
      demonstrate the necessity to investigate daytime function (sleepiness and performance) and
      the sleep quality of patients with ADHD. It will also demonstrate that part of the adults
      with ADHD handicap is based on an awakening disorder which adds to the attentional disorder.
