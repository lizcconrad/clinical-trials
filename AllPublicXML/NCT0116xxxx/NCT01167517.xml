  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of breast milk expression discharge instructions in
      digital video disc (DVD) format for home use by mothers of very low birth weight infants on
      the dose and duration of mother's breast milk feeding in their infants compared to breast
      milk expression discharge instructions in printed format. The investigators hypothesize that
      infants whose mothers receive breast milk expression discharge instructions via DVD will
      receive a larger dose of maternal breast milk and for longer duration during the initial
      neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization than infants whose mothers receive discharge
      instructions in printed format.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight (VLBW; &lt;1500 g) infants who receive maternal breast milk, as opposed to
      infant formula, are less likely to experience the serious illnesses and poor developmental
      outcomes associated with VLBW. However, a disparity exists in breast milk feeding. Infants
      whose mothers have low educational attainment and low income are less likely to receive
      maternal breast milk than infants whose mothers who do not have low educational attainment
      and low income. The primary objective of this proposed research is to determine the effect of
      lactation discharge instructions in an audio-visual format provided to mothers for home
      viewing on the dose and duration of maternal breast milk received by their VLBW infants
      during the neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization.

      Methods. Forty mothers of VLBW infants will be randomly assigned to receive a breast milk
      expression instruction digital video disc (DVD) in addition to standard of care lactation
      education or assigned to receive written instructions in addition to standard of care
      lactation education. In addition to comparing infant intake of maternal breast milk intake,
      pre and post intervention lactation and breast milk expression knowledge will be compared
      between groups and DVD viewing frequency and acceptability will be determined with a log and
      questionnaire to be completed by the intervention group and collected the first month after
      delivery.
