  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on preclinical (animal) studies showing that infusing bone marrow-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells into the spinal fluid may contribute to improving neurologic function
      in animal models with spinal cord injuries. Bone marrow (BM) contains several types of stem
      cells that can produce functional cells. This includes cells that could help the healing
      process of damaged neurologic tissue.

      The primary objective of this study is to see if the injection of these cells, obtained from
      your own bone marrow, is safe. A secondary objective is to evaluate if the treatment can
      provide functional improvements (neuromuscular control and sensation) in the affected areas.

      A Phase I, single-center trial to assess the safety and tolerability of an intrathecal
      infusion (lumbar puncture) of autologous, ex vivo expanded bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells in a well-defined population of spinal cord injury patients.

      Safety will be evaluated by neurological and non-neurological tests performed after
      short-term (1 to 30 days) and long-term (2 to 12 months)follow-up evaluation periods after
      cell infusion.
