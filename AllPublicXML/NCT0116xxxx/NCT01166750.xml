  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized wait-list controlled trial with repeated measures. There will be
      two groups: (1) standard medical care (wait-list control), and (2) standard medical care plus
      the adjunctive Jointstrong pain coping skills CD-ROM program (treatment). The study will have
      four phases: Pre-intervention Baseline (2 weeks); Intervention (4 weeks); immediate
      post-intervention follow up (2 weeks); and 12-week post-intervention follow up (2 weeks). The
      purpose of this study is to determine if using a CD-ROM program for juvenile arthritis can
      help children learn how to improve their symptoms on their own and reduce the frequency of
      symptoms.

      If your child is eligible and decides to participate in this study, this participation will
      last approximately eight weeks. Please refer to the table at the end of this consent form.

      Your child's participation in this study will involve the completion of daily questionnaires
      during a one-week baseline period and a one-week follow-up period. These questionnaires will
      contain various questions about your child's arthritis and his/her ability to do various
      activities. The questionnaires will take approximately 15-30 minutes each week to complete.

      Your child will be randomly assigned to complete one of two CD-ROM programs. One of the
      CD-ROM programs is a &quot;control&quot; program that contains educational information about arthritis
      and medical treatments and the other is the &quot;treatment&quot; program and contains the same
      educational information as the control program plus information on behavioral strategies for
      controlling symptoms of arthritis. Your child's participation in this study will involve
      working through one of these CD-ROM programs over a one-month period. Your child will also
      continue to receive medical treatment from the rheumatologist treating your child for
      arthritis. The CD-ROM programs involve working through developmentally appropriate lessons on
      the nature of arthritis and how to treat it. The CD-ROM programs are divided into weekly
      &quot;modules&quot; and are designed to be completed within four weeks. Lessons take an average of 15
      minutes to complete (plus &quot;homework&quot;), and there is an average of 4 lessons to complete each
      week.

      Your participation in this study will involve the completion of questionnaires and helping
      your child understand any parts of the study that he or she does not understand.

    <description>Children in the control group will continue to follow recommendations and prescriptions by their treating rheumatologist. After an 8-week wait-list control condition that involves measurement phases identical to those of the Jointstrong Treatment Group but no Jointstrong treatment, the children in the control group will enter the Jointstrong program and will then have the same immediate post-treatment measures that the Treatment Group received. The Control Group will not, however, have the Treatment Group's 12-week follow-up phase.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria. Patients recruited for this study will meet the following inclusion
        criteria: (a) are 8-12 years of age; (b) have a diagnosis of JA by a pediatric
        rheumatologist using established criteria, and (c) have JA-related (joint) pain occurring
        on an average of at least once per week by patient report [9]. Participants in the age
        range 8-12 years will be recruited because the intervention will be tailored to children
        (future studies will involve creating and testing a version of Jointstrong for
        adolescents). Although access to a home computer with a CD-ROM drive is required for the
        study, this will not be an inclusion criterion, and we expect the lack of access will be
        rare, as our pilot data on 37 children with headaches found that only 2% (1 child) did not
        have adequate home computer access [15]. So as not to exclude the few children without
        access who otherwise qualify for the study, we will lend laptop computers to these
        children. All children meeting symptom inclusion criteria will therefore be able to use the
        adjunctive CD-ROM programs in a home setting.

        Exclusion Criteria. Patients will be excluded from the study if (a) their parents or
        rheumatologist report they have been diagnosed with a mental health condition or they are
        receiving concurrent psychotherapy; or (b) their 14-day baseline pain diaries indicate they
        have pain, on average, less than one day per week; or (c) they do not speak English.

          <title>CD-ROM-treatment</title>
          <description>CD-ROM : Treatment Group will continue to follow their treating rheumatologist's recommendations and prescriptions. The program will contain information on the multiple components of pain (the &quot;pain puzzle&quot;) as a treatment rationale and will then teach children to use cognitive-behavioral techniques for pain management. The information will be presented via visual displays, narration, and interactive menus. Children will be able to navigate through the different lessons at their own pace and will be required to take simple quizzes to assess their learning. Various passwords and homework assignments are embedded within the program to ensure that children are going through the material.</description>

          <title>Wait-list Control Group</title>
          <description>Wait-list Control Group : Children in the control group will continue to follow recommendations and prescriptions by their treating rheumatologist. After an 8-week wait-list control condition that involves measurement phases identical to those of the Jointstrong Treatment Group but no Jointstrong treatment, the children in the control group will enter the Jointstrong program and will then have the same immediate post-treatment measures that the Treatment Group received. The Control Group will not, however, have the Treatment Group's 12-week follow-up phase.</description>
