      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial in 25,871
      U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin D3 (2000
      IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (OmacorÂ® fish oil, 1 gram) reduces the risk of developing cancer,
      heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these illnesses.

    <textblock>
      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial of vitamin D
      (in the form of vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic
      acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Existing data from laboratory studies, epidemiologic research,
      small primary prevention trials, and/or large secondary prevention trials strongly suggest
      that these nutritional agents may reduce risk for cancer or CVD, but large primary prevention
      trials with adequate dosing in general populations are lacking.

      VITAL will test the independent effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
      on risk for developing cancer and CVD (primary, secondary, and other outcomes are specified
      in the Outcome Measures section). VITAL will also explore (a) whether vitamin D and omega-3
      fatty acid supplements exhibit synergistic or additive effects on cancer and CVD risk and (b)
      whether the effect of each supplement on cancer and CVD risk varies by baseline blood levels
      of vitamin D and EPA+DHA, race/ethnicity (for vitamin D), and body mass index (for vitamin
      D), as well as age, sex, sunlight exposure, calcium and phosphorus intakes, and baseline risk
      factors for cancer and CVD.

      Eligible participants were assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to one of four groups: (1)
      daily vitamin D and omega-3; (2) daily vitamin D and omega-3 placebo; (3) daily vitamin D
      placebo and omega-3; or (4) daily vitamin D placebo and omega-3 placebo. Participants had an
      equal chance of being assigned to any of these four groups and a 3 out of 4 chance of getting
      at least one active agent.

      Participants in all groups take two pills each day -- one softgel that contains either
      vitamin D or vitamin D placebo and one capsule that contains either omega-3 or omega-3
      placebo. Participants receive their study pills in convenient calendar packages via U.S.
      mail.

      Participants also fill out a short (15-20 minute) questionnaire each year. The questionnaire
      asks about health; lifestyle habits such as physical exercise, diet, and smoking; use of
      medications and dietary supplements; family history of illness, and new medical diagnoses.
      Occasionally, participants may receive a phone call from study staff to collect information
      or to clarify responses on the questionnaire.

      At baseline, 16,954 VITAL participants provided an optional blood sample. Approximately 6,000
      of these participants provided a follow-up blood sample during years 1-4 of the trial.

      At baseline, year 2, and year 4 of the trial, a subcohort of 1,054 VITAL participants living
      within driving distance of Boston, Massachusetts received detailed in-clinic health
      assessments at the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) of Brigham and Women's
      Hospital. During CTSC visits, participants have a clinical exam, including measurement of
      height, weight, other anthropometrics, blood pressure, and physical performance. They also
      provide fasting blood and urine samples, and undergo 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing,
      lung function testing (spirometry), electrocardiograms, bone mineral density testing,
      2D-echocardiography, and assessments of thinking and mood.
