        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of:

               -  Multiple myeloma (MM)

               -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) / Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)

               -  Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)

               -  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)

          -  Refractory to/relapsed after and/or intolerant of one or more standard therapies or
             for which no standard therapy exists.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, cardiovascular, renal and hepatic function

          -  Recovery from all adverse events due to prior therapies

          -  Contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, investigational agents, or radiation
             therapy (involving ≥ 30% of the active bone marrow) within 14 days prior to the first
             dose (note nitrosoureas and mitomycin are not permitted for at least 42 days before
             the first dose of RGB-286638).

          -  CNS involvement of the hematological malignancy.

          -  Active or unstable cardiac disease and/or history of myocardial infarction within 6
             months and/or history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias.

          -  Concomitant therapies that are known to prolong the QT interval and are associated
             with a risk of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) are not permitted within 7 days before the
             first dose; however, amiodarone is not permitted within 90 days before the first dose.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled and unstable intercurrent illness.

          -  Concomitant therapy with inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP450 3A4 within 1 week of the
             first dose.

          -  Bleeding disorder unrelated to hematological malignant disease.

          -  HIV or HIV-related malignancy.

          -  History of other malignancies except: (i) adequately treated basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin; (ii) curatively treated, a) in situ carcinoma of the uterine
             cervix, b) prostate cancer, or c) superficial bladder cancer; or (iii) other
             curatively treated solid tumor with no evidence of disease for ≥ 2 years.

          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures.
