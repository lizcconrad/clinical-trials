  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid 5 mg
      intravenous (i.v.) relative to placebo in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients with osteoporosis
      and to support the optimal use of zoledronic acid for this indication. Primary objective is
      the change of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at lumbar spine (L1-L4) and total hip region
      assessed by T-Score at month 12 relative to screening as measured by Dual X-ray
      Absorptiometry (DXA). This double-blind period will be followed by a 52-week open-label
      treatment phase to assess long-term efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in these patients.

    <description>The course of disease in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients was measured comparing results from the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) from screening and month 12. EDSS is a scale, ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It is based on a weighting scheme of eight functional systems. The functional systems are Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel&amp;Bladder, Cerebral and Other functions. EDSS was assessed by the treating neurologist.</description>

        <title>Change in Bone Mineral Density of the Femoral Neck at 24 Months</title>
        <description>Change in bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck was measured using Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at screening and at month 24.
A DXA scanner is a device that uses x-ray beams to measure the amount of minerals in the bone.</description>

        <title>Course of Disease in Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>
        <description>The course of disease in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients was measured comparing results from the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) from screening and month 12. EDSS is a scale, ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It is based on a weighting scheme of eight functional systems. The functional systems are Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel&amp;Bladder, Cerebral and Other functions. EDSS was assessed by the treating neurologist.</description>
