  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will measure levels of reproductive hormones and metabolic markers in
      subjects with isolated GnRH deficiency disorders and compare them to healthy control
      populations. Our goals are (1) to chart the range of hormonal and metabolic biomarkers in
      healthy subjects and those with reproductive disorders and (2) to correlate reproductive and
      metabolic phenotypes with genetic changes within patients with reproductive disorders and
      healthy controls.
