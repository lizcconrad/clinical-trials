  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to compare the local anaesthetic ropivacaine to local anaesthetic
      levobupivacaine in converting the standard patient controlled labour epidural to provide
      anaesthesia for an emergency Caesarean section. This is a technique commonly known as an
      epidural top-up. The investigators set out to disprove the hypothesis that there is no
      difference between the 2 local anaesthetics in the time of onset and number of times epidural
      top-up needs supplementing during surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomised controlled trial involving 45 patients the speed of onset of the effects of
      20mls of 0.75% ropivacaine was found to be similar to that of 20mls of 0.5% bupivacaine1.
      However it was also found to be more efficacious at preventing 'breakthrough' pain and
      therefore had a lower intra-operative supplementation rate. Unfortunately the study was
      probably not powered adequately to confirm this finding. Bupivacaine has now largely been
      replaced in the this field by the less cardio-toxic stereoisomer levobupivacaine. A trial
      comparing 0.75% ropivacaine to 0.5% levobupivacaine and a lignocaine/adrenaline/fentanyl
      mixture was conducted in Singapore in 20082. It did not show a clinical difference between
      any of the agents. Whether the population studied is comparable to that in the UK is doubtful
      and it was not adequately powered to detect a difference in intra-operative supplementation
      rate. Local experience has shown ropivacaine 0.75% to provide a block with a rapid onset that
      has little requirement for supplementation intra-operatively. The need to supplement a local
      anaesthetic block during surgery means that the mother is experiencing a degree of pain that
      is unacceptable and we view this as a major consideration in choice of local anaesthetic for
      an epidural top-up. Whilst speed of onset is important, in that it influences the decision to
      delivery time of the baby, the evaluation of intraoperative supplementation will be a major
      focus of this trial.
