  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze tumor tissue from patients with known genetic mutations (BRCA1,
      BRCA2, CHK2, etc) who have tumor tissue available from two surgeries, either
      primary/recurrent, or two different anatomical sites.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit individuals with known BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations or mutations in
      similar cancer causing genes such as CHK2 or PALB2 who have had a cancer removed by surgery
      or biopsied two or more times with available pathological blocks. We wish to enroll
      individuals who have had more than one surgery or biopsy for cancer allowing us to obtain
      tumor blocks from more than one time point. Such patients would include those with one cancer
      which has recurred or more than one separate cancer. We will conduct a brief interview with
      the subject to obtain personal information about medical and treatment history. In addition,
      we will collect clinical information from their treating physician(s) to correlate molecular
      findings with clinical responses to treatment and survival and recurrence data. We will
      collect background clinical information and family history information and a copy of the
      genetic test results documenting their cancer causing mutation. We will recruit only patients
      with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations or known mutations in other cancer causing genes such as
      CHK2 or PALB2 and will not perform genetic testing on non-tumor tissue for any new
      information on genetic susceptibility in patient samples. Enrolled subjects will donate a
      blood sample that will be obtained locally and shipped to the research laboratory, and this
      cost will be entirely covered by the research group.
