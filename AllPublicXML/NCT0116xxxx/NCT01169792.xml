  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The genetic polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 may influence on the metabolism of
      tamoxifen.

      The investigators want to

        -  evaluate the frequency or incidence of the genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450
           subfamilies(CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C19) in breast cancer patients, and

        -  analyze the association between the genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 subfamilies
           and clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients treated by adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.
