    <textblock>
      This study investigates the prevalence and pathophysiology of dental and periodontal
      involvement in pediatric patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux
      (GER) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Primary objectives are to compare the
      prevalence of oral disease in children with and without a diagnosis or symptoms/signs of GERD
      in a cross-sectional study. Secondary objectives are to examine factors that might lead to
      the pathogenesis of the dental and periodontal lesions observed in this group of subjects.

      The primary hypothesis is to prove that children aged 10-18 years diagnosed with or having
      symptoms or signs of GERD have a significantly higher amount of dental erosions in comparison
      to a matched control group.

      Secondary hypotheses are that children aged 10 - 18 years diagnosed with or having signs of
      GER have higher DMFS (Decayed, Missing, Filled permanent tooth Surfaces) rates, higher SBI
      (Sulcus Bleeding Index) rates, worse Periodontal status, and lower saliva buffering capacity.
