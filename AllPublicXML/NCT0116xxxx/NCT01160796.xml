  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, phase III
      superiority trial.

      The main objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy of Lcr35® by comparing the mean
      time before the onset of the first clinical recurrence confirmed by laboratory tests in
      patients with bacterial vaginosis treated with Lcr35® versus placebo.

      Patients with bacterial vaginosis will be enroll by private gynecologists. Each patient will
      receive a treatment for the initial episode(Metronidazole)and a treatment to prevent the
      recurrence of bacterial vaginosis (Lcr35®).
