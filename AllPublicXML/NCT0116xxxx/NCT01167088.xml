  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a new medicine, called mitoquinone, will
      reduce raised liver enzymes due to NAFLD and to see if it is safe.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent

          2. NAFLD as determined by raised ALT (&gt; 1.5 x ULN corresponding to &gt;29U/L for females and
             &gt;45U/L for males] in the screening period and on at least two other occasions in the
             previous 6 months) and ultrasound evidence of steatosis (in the previous 12 months).

          3. Be aged between 18 - 70 years on the day of consent

          4. Expect to not require or make any changes in all their current concomitant medications
             (prescribed and over-the-counter) for the duration of their participation in the study

             within 14 days prior to start of trial and must agree to use a medically acceptable
             method of contraception throughout the treatment period and for 1 month after
             discontinuation of treatment. Acceptable methods of contraception include IUD, oral
             contraceptive, subdermal implant and double barrier (condom with a contraceptive
             sponge or contraceptive pessary)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Alcohol consumption &gt; 14 units/week for females and 21 units/week for males

          2. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or suspicion of HCC

          3. Presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV)

          4. Renal impairment (creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN) or hepatorenal syndrome

          5. Chronic pancreatitis

             the course of this trial

         13. A history of a malignancy other than treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin; those with a history of malignancy that has been treated with no recurrence
             within the last 2 years are not excluded

         14. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding

         15. Use of Coenzyme Q10, either prescribed or purchased over-the-counter, are prohibited
             during the study, except for doses of up to 25mg/day which have been stable for 30
             days prior to baseline. Higher doses require a 7 day washout prior to baseline.

         16. Use of Vitamin E, either prescribed or purchased over-the-counter, are prohibited
             during the study, except for doses of up to 200IU/day which have been stable for 30
             days prior to baseline. Higher doses require a 90 day washout prior to baseline.

         17. Any changes to prescription medication in the 30 days prior to baseline

         18. A history of a hypersensitivity reaction to any components of the study drug or
             structurally similar compounds including Coenzyme Q10 and idebenone

         19. Unable to swallow tablets whole

         20. Patients with histological or clinical evidence of established cirrhosis

         21. Suffering from any other disease or condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, means that it would not be in the patient's best interest to participate
             in this study
