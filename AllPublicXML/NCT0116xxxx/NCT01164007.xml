  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity and safety profile of a
      combination of bevacizumab and dacarbazine in participants with unresectable/metastatic
      melanoma not previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 6 years (assessed at Baseline, every 12 weeks on treatment, thereafter every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments were performed using RECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with normalization of tumor markers. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. Both were to be confirmed at a follow-up visit at least 4 weeks from the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR during the study was reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Death or Disease Progression Following a Previous Assessment of CR or PR According to RECIST</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 6 years (assessed at Baseline, every 12 weeks on treatment, thereafter every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments were performed using RECIST. Disease progression was defined as ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to smallest sum on study or the appearance of new lesion(s). CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with normalization of tumor markers. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. The percentage of participants who died or demonstrated disease progression among those with a previous assessment of CR or PR was reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 6 years (assessed at Baseline, every 12 weeks on treatment, thereafter every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments were performed using RECIST. DOR was defined as the time from first assessment of CR or PR to the time of death or disease progression, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to smallest sum on study or the appearance of new lesion(s). CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with normalization of tumor markers. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. DOR was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology and expressed in months.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 6 years (assessed at Baseline, every 12 weeks on treatment, thereafter every 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments were performed using RECIST. Disease progression was defined as ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to smallest sum on study or the appearance of new lesion(s). CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with normalization of tumor markers. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to quality for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression, using smallest sum of LD on study as reference. The percentage of participants who died or demonstrated disease progression among those with a previous assessment of CR, PR, or SD was reported.</description>
