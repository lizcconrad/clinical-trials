      Prospective randomized controlled trial to be conducted in the Respiratory Intensive Care
      Unit (RICU) of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education And Research (PGIMER),Chandigarh.
      The study is approved by the Institute Ethics committee. In view of lack of previous outcome
      data in such patients, all patients requiring RICU admission for acute respiratory distress
      syndrome(ARDS) between January 2010 and June 2011 are being enrolled in this pilot study.

      The patients meeting the aforementioned criteria will randomly assigned to ventilation with
      assist control mode ventilation (ACMV group) as per the ARDSnet strategy or adaptive support
      ventilation (ASV group). Being the first RCT of its type, patients will be first stabilized
      on ACMV for 1 hour to determine the adequate minute ventilation. The randomization sequence
      will be computer generated. The assignments will placed in sealed opaque envelopes and each
      patient's assignment was made on admission to the RICU by the attending physician. Blinding
      of treatment is not possible.

      All patients will be ventilated only by Galileo Gold ventilators (Hamilton medical systems,
      Bonaduz, Switzerland). Patients randomized to the ACMV group will be ventilated according to
      low tidal volume strategy of 6ml/kg with Fio2/PEEP as per ARDSnet table to achieve a
      saturation between 88-95% with the lowest possible Fio2 to maintain plateau pressures &lt; 30
      cms H2o and PH &gt; 7.3 with option to reduce tidal volume to 4 ml/kg and increase respiratory
      rate to 35/ min to achieve the above said goals11.These patients will be weaned as per
      standard protocol of spontaneous breathing trial of 30 minutes once they are recognized
      eligible as per statement of the sixth International consensus conference on weaning.
