      The purpose of the study is to test the efficiency and efficacy of the Distress Thermometer
      of patients admitted to the tertiary Burn and Wound Center. The American Cancer Society and
      the National Comprehensive Cancer Network published treatment guidelines in 2005 adopting the
      use of the Distress Thermometer as the preferred adjunct assessment tool of a patient's
      emotional well-being. A literature search provided extension of the tool to a Cardiac
      Follow-up Clinic. The Distress Thermometer is currently used with oncology patients at Saint
      Elizabeth.

      The emotional well being of patients and their significant others is a hallmark of wholistic
      care. The simple Likert scale of 0-10 has a trigger for further assessment and/ or
      intervention at four. The validity testing of the tool was done against the Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18).

      The purpose of this study is to measure the efficiency and efficacy of the documentation of
      the Distress Thermometer to patients admitted to a tertiary Burn and Wound Care Center. The
      frequency of the documentation will be counted and type of documentation will be categorized.
