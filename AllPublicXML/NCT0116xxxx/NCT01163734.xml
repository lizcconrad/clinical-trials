    <textblock>
      Patients with CAD and clinical symptoms of heart failure or patients with suspected heart
      failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) will be enrolled. Study drug will be given
      as continuous IV infusion followed by oral treatment for 13 days. LV pressures and
      hemodynamic data will be measured prior to and after administration of study drug. In
      addition, Doppler ECHO, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), and NT-pro-BNP determination
      will be performed. Adverse events and safety labs will be collected and monitored.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study of ranolazine
      in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients will be
      randomized to receive ranolazine or placebo in a 1.5:1 ratio (12 ranolazine: 8 placebo).

      Treatment will consist of intravenous infusion of study drug followed by oral treatment for a
      total of 14 days treatment period. Study contact will be made approximately 14 days after the
      treatment period to assess safety.

      Cardiac catheterization will be performed for LV pressures and hemodynamic measurements
      before and after drug administration. Doppler ECHO, CPET, and NT-pro-BNP determination will
      be performed at screening and at end of study. Adverse events and safety labs will be
      monitored and collected.
