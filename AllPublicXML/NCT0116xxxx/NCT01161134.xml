        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must be a healthy male or female volunteer.If the volunteer is female. she
             must demonstrate β-CG levels consistent with the nongravid state at the medical
             screening visit and at check-in for Period 1 and agree to remain abstinent or use
             double-barrier contraception (partner using condom and female volunteer using
             diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, spermicide, or IUD). If the female is post-menopausal
             or is surgically sterile, she is exempt from this requirement. (Postmenopausal is
             defined as no menses for the previous 1 year. If cessation of menses is within 18
             months, FSH and/or LH must be documented prestudy as elevated into the postmenopausal
             range.).

          2. The subject must be between the ages of 18 - 55 years old (inclusive).

          3. The Subject's body mass index (BMI) must be within 19.0 - 30.0 (Kg/m2).

          4. The subject must be a non-smoker and not using any nicotine products.

          5. The subject must sign the written consent form (Research Subject Information and
             Consent Form) prior to study entry.

          6. The subject must have clinically acceptable results from the screening procedure
             including blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, physical exam, medical history, hematology,
             biochemistry, urinalysis. and infection screen (Hepatitis B Antigen, Hepatitis C
             Antibody, HIV)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a history of clinically significant gastro-intestinal, dermatological,

             disease in the last 12 months.

          2. Subjects determined by the Investigator to have any medical condition which may affect
             the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the investigational product,
             or that could jeopardize their health or prejudice the results (e.g. history of
             surgery of the gastro-intestinal tract, except for appendectomy).

          3. Subjects with a known allergy to meloxicam (Mobic) or other nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) [e.g. Motrin® (ibuprofen), Celebrex® (celecoxib).
             Vioxx® (rofecoxib). Naprelan® and Anaprox®, (naproxen sodium), Lodine® (etodolac),

          4. Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or are likely to become pregnant.

          5. Subjects with any clinically significant illness within four weeks prior to Period 1
             dosing.

          6. Subjects with a positive saliva alcohol test at check-in for any period.

          7. Subjects with a history of alcohol, drug or substance abuse in the past 12 months.

          8. Subjects who have used any prescription medication within 14 days of Period 1 dosing
             or over-the-counter medication within 14 days of Period 1 dosing.

          9. Subjects deemed uncooperative or noncompliant.

         10. Subjects who have consumed alcohol within 48 hours prior to Period 1 and Period 2
             dosing.

         11. Subjects who have consumed xanthine-containing products (including caffeine,
             theobromines, etc.) within 48 hours prior to Period 1 dosing.

         12. Subjects who have consumed food or beverages containing grapefruit (e.g. fresh,
             Canned, or frozen) within 14 days prior to the administration of the study medication.

         13. Subjects who have had an abnormal diet within 30 days prior to Period 1 dosing.

         14. Subjects who have participated in an investigational drug study or who have donated
             more than 100 mL of blood within 30 days prior to Period 1 dosing.
