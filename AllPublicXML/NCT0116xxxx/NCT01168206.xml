  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association of nutritional supplement TK3 to conventional treatment of cancer patients
      reduces the intensity and frequency of toxic effects and side effects caused by adjuvant or
      palliative treatments for the protection of healthy tissues, resulting in a better quality of
      life.
