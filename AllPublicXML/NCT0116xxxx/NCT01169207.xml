      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),
      is a idiopathic, chronic and frequently disabling inflammatory disorder of the intestines
      characterized by a dysregulated mucosal immune response that affect more than a million
      Americans. This current protocol was established in 1996 with the goal of identifying the
      genetic and environmental components that contribute to the development of IBD, especially in
      families.

      We initiated this research study in 1996 with the overall goal of identifying IBD
      susceptibility genes. In the beginning, our major focus was recruitment of multiply affected
      IBD pedigrees for linkage studies, but we have since expanded our study to include singleton
      cases and spousal/friend as well as population controls for comparison purposes Our
      recruitment goal is 2500 subjects.

      Blood samples obtained from participants are used to isolate lymphocytes for storage, serum
      for serological analysis of antibodies and other proteins relevant to IBD and DNA for
      genotyping or sequencing. Lymphocytes may be transformed with EBV to establish immortalized
      lymphoblastoid cell lines. These cell lines can be used as a secondary DNA source or to study
      IBD relevant gene, protein expression and cell function

        Inclusion Criteria:

        ADULTS:

          -  Patients with IBD and their family members who have or do not have IBD.

          -  People that do not have IBD nor have a family member with IBD needed for comparison
             purposes.

        CHILDREN:

          -  Children age 5 or older with IBD and their family members who have or do not have IBD.

          -  Children that do not have IBD nor have a family member with IBD needed for comparison
             purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The only exclusions are age parameters and health reasons that would preclude their
             enrollment; such as, for anemic patients. Blood-draws on anemic patients may, in
             certain medical cases, pose a health risk to them; therefore, we request that if they
             are anemic that they present a letter from their personal physician giving explicit
             permission for them to join if at the time it is clinically advisable.
