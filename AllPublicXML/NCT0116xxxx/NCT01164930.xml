  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an
      empirically supported psychosocial treatment, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, in
      facilitating improved quality of life, benefit-finding, and cortisol rhythm in breast cancer
      patients in an outpatient clinical oncology setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research indicates that breast cancer patients may demonstrate disrupted diurnal
      cortisol rhythms compared to healthy individuals, and that these disrupted rhythms may be
      related to recurrence and earlier mortality in some patients. Interestingly, improvements in
      cortisol regulation in previous intervention studies for cancer patients have not necessarily
      been related to decreased distress. Rather, improvements in post-traumatic growth,
      benefit-finding, and meaningfulness have also accounted for improved neuroendocrine and
      immunological changes.

      Traditional breast cancer groups, however, may not adequately address these areas because
      existing interventions often target the reduction of distress as the primary vehicle to
      improve psychosocial, quality of life, and biophysical outcomes. Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy (ACT) is an empirically-supported, mindfulness-based psychological treatment that has
      been shown to enhance meaningful behavior change thorough increasing emotional acceptance of
      difficult psychological experiences such as distress, without the goal of changing or
      eliminating them.

      The current study seeks to determine the preliminary effect of an 8-week ACT group in
      increasing positive life changes and corresponding increase in salivary cortisol slope in 40
      distressed breast cancer patients, who will be randomly assigned to ACT or a wait list
      control group.

      The hypotheses for the present study include:

        -  Patients receiving ACT will demonstrate improvements in Quality of Life (QoL),
           Benefit-finding (BF), and health behavior compared to control group participants

        -  ACT participants will demonstrate improvements in mean cortisol levels and cortisol
           reactivity compared to control group participants

        -  These changes will be the result of increased mindful acceptance of cancer-related
           distress and meaningful behavior changes, rather than a reduction in distress.
