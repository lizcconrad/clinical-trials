  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was primarily designed to assess the role of acupuncture in reducing the need for
      epidural analgesia for pain relief during induced labour. The other outcomes of labour were
      to be observed in addition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was limited to women in their first pregnancy having labour induced for prolonged
      pregnancy or mild hypertension. The study involved randomised groups managed with manual
      acupuncture, electro acupuncture, sham acupuncture and a no-treatment control group.

    <description>Sterile needles were inserted intramuscularly to a depth of 15-20mm until an unusual (De-Qi) sensation developed and remained inserted for 30-60 minutes and were manually manipulated during this time. The following bilateral acupoints on the hands and feet at Hegu (LI 4), Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) Kunlun (BL 60) and Zhiyin (BL 67)were used.</description>

    <description>Sterile needles were inserted intramuscularly to a depth of 15-20mm until an unusual (De-Qi) sensation developed and remained inserted for 30-60 minutes and were either electronically simulated withm2 Hz pulses of 0.5 msec duration for 30 minutes sufficient to cause non-painful muscle contractions. The following bilateral acupoints on the hands and feet at Hegu (LI 4), Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) Kunlun (BL 60) and Zhiyin (BL 67)were used.</description>

    <description>Sterile needles were inserted adjacent to the specific acupuncture sites identified for the manual and electro groups to a depth of 1-1.5mm only and insufficient to provoke an unusual sensation and left in position for a 30-60 minutes. Those randomised to 'sham-manual' received no stimulation and those randomised to 'sham-electro' were connected to the electrical stimulator but the current not activated.</description>
