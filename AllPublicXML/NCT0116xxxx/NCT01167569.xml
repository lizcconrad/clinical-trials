  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that the stress that occurs during cardiac surgery leads to early decrease
      of many of the body's resources such as Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) which may contribute to
      complications after surgery.

      This study will investigate the effects of high doses of intravenous (IV) Vitamin C on the
      outcome and complications after cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at significant risk for multiple major complications
      beyond those associated with other major operations. Most patients survive these events, but
      up to 10% develop injury to organ systems including the kidneys, lungs, pancreas, brain, etc.
      It has been shown that the stress that occurs during this critical period (cardiac surgery)
      leads to early decrease of many of the body's resources such as Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)
      which seem to contribute to these complications.

      This study will investigate the effects of high doses of intravenous (IV) Vitamin C
      administered before, during and after the cardiac surgery.
