  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies giving leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate
      together with or without vismodegib followed by surgery to see how well they work in treating
      patients with prostate cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph
      nodes. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as
      leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body.
      Vismodegib may slow the growth of tumor cells. Giving antihormone therapy together with
      vismodegib may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the difference in less than or equal to 5% tumor involvement between patients
      between the two arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess differences in hedgehog signaling, androgen signaling, markers linked to high
      grade prostate cancer (PCa) progression, proliferation, apoptosis, and the expression of
      androgen producing enzymes in the tumor microenvironment between the two arms.

      II. To assess safety of preoperative GDC-0449 (vismodegib) in combination with luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH).

      III. To assess the difference in proportion of patients with negative disease surgical
      margins between the two arms.

      IV. To collect and archive tissue from the primary tumor, bone marrow and blood (serum,
      plasma), bone marrow aspirate for future study.

      V. To assess difference in relapse rate (biochemical, objective) and time to progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (androgen-ablation therapy and vismodegib): Patients receive LHRH analogue comprising
      leuprolide acetate intramuscularly (IM) or goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and
      vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (androgen-ablation therapy): Patients receive LHRH analogue comprising leuprolide
      acetate or goserelin acetate as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 16 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients undergo radical prostatectomy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 8 years.
