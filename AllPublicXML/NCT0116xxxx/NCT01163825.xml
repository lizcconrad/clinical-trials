  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain project widely to the cerebral cortex and
      hippocampus. These neurons depend on nerve growth factor (NGF) from their target areas for
      survival. Impaired NGF supply is part of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and the
      degeneration of these neurons correlates with the cognitive decline in these patients. The
      objective of encapsulated cell biodelivery (ECB) is to maintain normal levels of NGF to
      support cholinergic function. NsGene's NGF secreting ECB device (NsG0202) combines the
      potential benefits of targeted gene therapy with the safety of a retrievable implantable
      device.

      The study is an open label, single centre, 12-month, dose-escalation phase Ib study in
      patients with mild to moderate AD. The primary objective is safety and tolerability, while
      secondary outcomes measure include cognition, behaviour, neuropsychology, activities of daily
      living (ADL), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and electroencephalography (EEG).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 50-80 years

          2. All patients must fulfil the NINDNDS-ARDRA criteria of Alzheimer's disease.

          3. The subject must have a score between 15-24 inclusive, on the mini-mental state
             examination (MMSE).

          4. The subject must have a caregiver who is able and committed to assist the subject to
             comply with the trial protocol, and who is willing to provide the information required
             at assessment interviews.

          5. Informed consent must be obtained from the subject together with a close caregiver, in
             accordance with the requirements of the ethical committee.

        Exclusion Criteria:
