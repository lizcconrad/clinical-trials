  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder which presents with abdominal pain or
      discomfort in association with altered bowel habit. IBS is further subcategorized as three
      types according to the predominant bowel movement pattern: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS
      with diarrhea (IBS-D), and mixed-IBS (IBS-M). The exact causes of IBS remain incompletely
      understood, but proposed mechanisms include abnormal motility, visceral hypersensitivity,
      abnormal brain-gut interactions, psychological distress, and altered GI tract motility.

      Lubiprostone, a novel drug that works by activating the colonic Chloride channel type
      2(ClC-2), has been approved for use in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation and
      recently approved for the treatment of IBS-C in women aged 18 and older. By activating the
      ClC-2 chloride channel in the colon, lubiprostone allows more fluid secretion into the
      intestinal lumen which leads to softer stool consistency. In phase III clinical trials,
      patients with IBS-C receiving lubiprostone have reported improvements in many symptoms such
      as abdominal pain and constipation. However, there is limited physiologic data to explain how
      exactly lubiprostone improves IBS-C symptoms.

      The Smartpill is a novel non-digestible capsule that is capable of measuring intraluminal pH,
      pressure, and temperature in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Smartpill has been shown to
      accurately measure whole gut as well as regional (i.e. stomach, small bowel, colon) transit
      time.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of lubiprostone on whole GI tract
      transit, colonic transit, motility, and intraluminal pH in patients with IBS-C through
      evaluation with the Smartpill. The investigators propose to study the effect of lubiprostone
      vs. placebo on these parameters, and secondarily to evaluate changes in these parameters with
      differing doses of lubiprostone.

      The investigators hypothesize that lubiprostone will increase whole GI and colonic transit
      compared to placebo in patient with IBS. the investigators do not expect a change in
      intraluminal pH with lubiprostone compared to placebo.

    <baseline>
      <population>The baseline data is given for those persons who actually completed the study, so the two people who dropped out were not included in the baseline measures. We determined this to be the more useful way to identify the effects of the three randomized procedures. Therefore the baseline data is based on the 50 participants who completed the study.</population>
