  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are often
      limited. In most cases, they are not amenable to local therapies including surgery or
      radiofrequency ablation. The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib has shown to increase overall
      survival in this patient group for about 3 months.

      Radiation therapy is a treatment alternative, however, high local doses are required for
      long-term local control. However, due to the relatively low radiation tolerance of liver
      normal tissue, even using stereotactic techniques, delivery of sufficient doses for
      successful local tumor control has not be achieved to date.

      Carbon ions offer physical and biological characteristics. Due to their inverted dose profile
      and the high local dose deposition within the Bragg peak precise dose application and sparing
      of normal tissue is possible. Moreover, in comparison to photons, carbon ions offer an
      increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE), which can be calculated between 2 and 3
      depending on the HCC cell line as well as the endpoint analyzed.

      Japanese Data on the evaluation of carbon ion radiation therapy showed promising results for
      patients with HCC.

      In the current Phase I-PROMETHEUS-01-Study, carbon ion radiotherapy will be evaluated for
      patients with advanced HCC. The study will be performed as a dose-escalation study evaluating
      the optimal carbon ion dose with respect to toxicity and tumor control.

      Primary endpoint is toxicity, secondary endpoint is progression-free survival and response.
