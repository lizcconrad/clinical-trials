  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of the combination regimen of
      bortezomib-bendamustine-dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After relapse after or early progression on first-line treatment the prognosis of multiple
      myeloma patients is unfavourable, with no remaining chance for cure. Therefore the search for
      new treatment regimens, including drugs with novel, and different, mechanisms of action is
      mandatory.

      Both bendamustine and bortezomib are not yet established parts of standard first-line
      regimens, but showed to have high activity both in chemo-naïve and pre-treated patients. The
      novel mechanism of action of the proteasome inhibitor and the non-cross resistance of
      bendamustine to other alkylating agents established in the first-line treatment of multiple
      myeloma seem to recommend a combination of the two drugs for salvage therapy. The promising
      response data in a series of relapsing MM patients treated with bendamustine, bortezomib and
      prednisone support this assumption, as well as the feasibility and tolerability of the
      combination.

      In summary, there is some evidence for a favourable risk/benefit ratio for the combination of
      bendamustine, bortezomib and a glucocorticoid drug, warranting the exploration in a larger,
      prospectively designed multicenter phase II study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age min. 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

          -  Measurable disease, defined as any quantifiable monoclonal protein value, defined by
             at least one of the following three measurements: Serum M-protein ≥ 10g/l; Urine
             light-chain (M-protein) of ≥ 200 mg/24 hours; Serum FLC assay: involved FLC level ≥10
             mg/dl provided sFLC ratio is abnormal

          -  Relapsed or refractory MM in stage II or III after autologous SCT or conventional
             chemotherapy (histologically or cytologically proven/ Salmon and Durie criteria) in
             need of therapy

          -  All previous cancer therapy, including cytostatic therapy and surgery, must have been
             discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment in this study, except corticosteroid
             therapy (dosage 40 to max. 160mg). Localised radiation therapy is allowed, but the
             increased risk of leukocytopenia, erythrocytopenia and thrombocytopenia based on the
             combination of a polychemotherapy and radiation therapy has to be considered and a
             close monitoring of the patients has to be assured.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 at study entry

          -  Laboratory test results within these ranges:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count min. 1.5 x 109/L

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain of grade 2 or greater intensity, as defined
             by NCI CTCAE, version 3.0.
