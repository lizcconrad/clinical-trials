      The primary purpose of the Research Database is to have a comprehensive source of
      observational data that can be used to study HSC transplantation and cellular therapies.

      A secondary purpose of the Research Database is to have a comprehensive source of data to
      study marrow toxic injuries.

      Objectives:

      To learn more about what makes stem cell transplants and cellular therapies work well such
      as:

        -  Determine how well recipients recover from their transplants or cellular therapy;

        -  Determine how recovery after a transplant or cellular therapy can be improved;

        -  Determine how access to transplant or cellular therapy for different groups of patients
           can be improved;

        -  Determine how well donors recover from the collection procedures.

        Eligibility to Participate in the Research Database

        Recipient Eligibility Criteria:

          -  Any recipient of an unrelated or related donor or autologous HSC transplant in a
             CIBMTR center is eligible to participate in the Research Database. This includes
             adults with and without decision making capacity, and children.

        Individual with Marrow Toxic Injury Eligibility Criteria:

          -  Any individual who is treated for a marrow toxic injury at a center participating in
             the NMDP's Radiation Injury Transplant Network (RITN) is eligible to participate in
             the Research Database. This includes adults with and without decision making capacity,
             and children. Eligible individuals may have received supportive care only, growth
             factor support, HSC transplant or other appropriate medical treatment for marrow toxic
             injury. Treatments applied are at the discretion of the care facility, and are not
             determined by the NMDP or CIBMTR.

        Unrelated Donor Eligibility Criteria:

          -  All donors registered on the NMDP Registry who have been requested to donate a product
             for a recipient are eligible to participate in the Research Database.

          -  All maternal cord blood donors are enrolled in the NMDP Cord Blood Bank
             Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol, and sign an informed consent document
             specific to that protocol. Data collected as part of the Cord Blood Bank protocol are
             included in the Research Database.
