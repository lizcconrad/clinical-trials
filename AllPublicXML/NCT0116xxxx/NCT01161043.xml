      The purpose of this study is to assess performance of a new subcutaneous glucose sensor over
      a seven day sensor life when used with currently marketed Medtronic Diabetes devices. In
      addition performance of the new sensor will be calculated for use of the new sensor with
      proposed new devices using new calibration algorithms.

      The first generation Medtronic MiniMed Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor (Sof-Sensor) was
      originally approved by the FDA for commercialization as part of the Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring System (CGMS) on June 15, 1999 (PMA 980022). The Sensor is composed of a
      microelectrode with a thin coating of glucose oxidase beneath several layers of biocompatible
      membrane. This same sensor was used as part of subsequent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
      systems, such as the Guardian REAL-Time and Paradigm REAL-Time sensor augmented insulin pump.
      The current configuration of sensor has undergone in vitro and in vivo testing. A new
      second-generation glucose sensor (herein referred to as the Comfort Sensor) has been
      developed. The first-generation glucose sensor was approved with reported sensor accuracy
      (MAD) of 18%; it was labeled for maximum use duration of 72 hours, using only the abdomen as
      an insertion site. The new sensor is shorter and has a smaller diameter, with a smaller gauge
      introducer needle. The new sensor inserter is designed to be used with the new sensor. The
      objectives of this study are to 1) Assess performance of the Comfort Sensor when used over a
      period of seven days with currently available devices, and 2) Assess performance of the
      Comfort Sensor when used over a period of seven days using new calibration algorithms
      (post-processed with algorithm for future devices). Accuracy data will be calculated based on
      comparing calibrated glucose sensor values to glucose meter values during in-home testing.
      The devices that will be used for gathering sensor data during this study will be: 1) the
      Comfort Sensor, 2) the MiniLink (Transmitter), and 3) the Guardian REAL-Time Display Device.

          3. Willingness to perform required study and data collection procedures and to adhere to
             operating requirements of the Guardian REAL-TIME System

          4. Willingness to perform at least 4 capillary blood glucose tests per day while wearing
             the Guardian REAL-TIME System

          5. Subject agrees to comply with the study protocol requirements

          6. Informed Consent, Assent, HIPAA Authorization, and California Experimental Subject
             Bill of Rights (if applicable) signed by the subject and/or parent/guardian

          7. The Subject is willing to wear the Guardian REAL-Time System for 14 days (~340 hours).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             enrollment

          2. The Subject has any skin abnormality (e.g. psoriasis, rash, staphylococcus infection)
             in the area of sensor placement that have not been resolved at the time of enrollment
             and would inhibit them from wearing the sensors
