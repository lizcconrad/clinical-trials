  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is by far the most common disorder in the group of
      irreversible causes of visual disability. AMD leads to dysfunction and loss of photoreceptors
      in the central retina. Neovascular AMD (nAMD) affects visual function early in the disease
      process and severely compromises the highly developed functions of the macula, such as
      perception of details, central fixation, color vision, and reading ability. AMD-related
      visual impairment is associated with a loss of autonomy and quality of life. Current
      therapeutic approaches target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has been
      identified as a main cytokine in the pathogenesis of nAMD. Ranibizumab, the fab-fragment of
      an antibody targeting VEGF is approved for the treatment of nAMD applied intravitreally in
      monthly intervals until the disease activity is stopped. However, a significant proportion of
      patients with nAMD suffer from persistent or recurring disease with the need of continuous
      anti-VEGF therapy over months and years, often leading to irreversible changes in the
      photoreceptor layer and the pigment epithelium.

      Recent studies regarding the treatment of nAMD utilized different forms of therapies,
      combining photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT) and ranibizumab, as well as therapeutic
      regimen containing steroids. Even though these studies did not provide evidence that
      combination therapies are superior to ranibizumab monotherapy, studies were only conducted
      with patients with previously untreated nAMD. Therefore, currently there is no alternative
      therapeutic approach for patients with recurrent or persistent form of nAMD after multiple
      treatments with ranibizumab monotherapy.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the treatment effect of reduced fluence PDT and
      intravitreal ranibizumab versus intravitreal dexamethasone and ranibizumab versus
      intravitreal ranibizumab monotherapy in patients with persistent or recurrent choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD.

      The investigators hypothesis is that these findings will offer new insights in the management
      of persistent or recurrent CNV secondary to AMD.

    <description>Patients will receive intravitreal dexamethasone using a special drug delivery system and same day intravitreal ranibizumab.
Study medications are initially given at the baseline visit. At each subsequent monthly follow-up visit, ranibizumab is administered if further visual deterioration or persistence of sub-/intraretinal fluid is detected in the examination. At month 3, 6, 9 and 12 further treatments with intravitreal dexamethasone in combination with intravitreal ranibizumab are given if leakage is detected in fluorescein or indocyanine green (FLA or ICG) angiography, in case of further vision decrease or persistence of sub-/intraretinal fluid in OCT.</description>
