      VHL patients may benefit from sunitinib. This study will investigate the following objectives
      :

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

        -  To determine the objective response rate according to RECIST criteria, in VHL patients
           with advanced tumors or tumors untreatable by other means, and treated with sunitinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sunitinib in VHL patients according to the
           NCI-CTC criteria Version 3.0.

        -  To determine the following time-to-event endpoints: overall survival, time to disease
           progression, progression free survival, time to response and duration of response.

        -  To evaluate quality of life in VHL patients receiving sunitinib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with sunitinib, 50 mg PO daily, 6 weeks courses with schedule 4/2 (4 weeks of
      treatment followed by 2 weeks of rest).

      Treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Dose reduction depending on type and severity of toxicity. At the end of treatment period
      (after 8 courses), responding and well tolerating patients will be allowed to receive
      sunitinib upon investigator's opinion.

      Follow-up for up to 24 months from inclusion.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Patients must have genetically or clinically confirmed VHL disease and have symptoms
             from VHL that are no longer controllable by conventional approaches.

          2. Patients must have at least one of the following lesions :

               -  Eye : retinal hemangioblastoma that can no longer be treated by laser therapy or
                  cryotherapy and resulting in progressive loss of vision;

               -  CNS : cerebellar, bulbar, spinal, or cerebellopontine angle haemangioblastoma or
                  endolymphatic sac tumor causing neurological symptoms that are not amenable to
                  further surgery, or have recurred after a first surgery;

               -  Kidney: multiple or bilateral tumors not accessible to conservative surgery, or
                  tumors having recurred after surgery and/or radiofrequency ablation or
                  advanced/metastatic RCC;

               -  Pancreas: inextirpable or advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

          3. Patients previously treated for VHL with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy are
             considered eligible for this study under the condition that these treatments were
             completed more than 4 weeks prior starting the study treatment. Previously radiated
             lesions will be considered as target lesions only if they demonstrate unequivocal
             evidence of growth upon imagery.

          4. Male or female, at least 18 year-old.

          5. Performance status ECOG 0-2

          7. Biological/clinical values within the following limits:

               -  Total serum bilirubin = 1.5 x ULN (patients with Gilbert's disease are not
                  eligible)

               -  Serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatases = 2.5 x ULN, or in case of
                  underlying malignancy (hepatic metastasis) = 5x ULN

             activity or pharmacokinetics of sunitinib (CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers among which
             ketoconazole, theophylline, phenobarbital, coumadin/warfarin) will be decided after
             review by the principal investigator of possibility to interrupt or switch to other
             medications. Otherwise, patient is not eligible. Anticoagulants drugs (among which
             coumadin/warfarin) may be, either switched to low-molecular-weight heparin, or be
             subject to individual dose adaptation in order to maintain INR in the target range
             with regard to patient's history, all along his participation in the study.

          9. Signed and dated informed consent document stating that the patient, or legally
             representative, has been informed of all the aspects of the trial prior to enrollment

         10. Willingness and ability to comply with all protocol assessments, schedule of visits,
             and procedures that are or could be requested as part of this study.

         11. Affiliated to French social security system

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radiofrequency or surgery within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study or not complete recovering from adverse events due to drugs administered

             ongoing infection, unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic or renal
             disease, psychiatric condition, laboratory abnormality that would impart, in the
             judgment of the investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or which would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the
             trial.

         11. Any medical condition (gastric or small intestine pathology, malabsorption syndrome)
