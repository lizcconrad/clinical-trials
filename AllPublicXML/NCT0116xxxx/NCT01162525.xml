    <textblock>
      Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is introduced as regular treatment option for fecal
      urge continence at the Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen. During this introduction phase
      efficiency und adverse events will be monitored in this observational study.

      Before treatment patients will have a proctological exam, a proctoscopy, endosonography and
      anorectal manometry. Incontinence scores (Wexner, Vaizey, Hanley) and quality of life scores
      (FIQL, VAS) will be recorded.

      Treatment consists of 4 phases with decreasing frequency of percutaneous tibial nerve
      stimulations (pTNS).

      During phase 1 weekly stimulations of 30 mins are applied for 12 weeks. After 6 and 12 weeks
      incontinence scores are recorded. Additionally after the end of phase 1 quality of life is
      measured and an anorectal manometry is preformed.

      Phase 2 lasts for 8 weeks, with 2-3 stimulations/month Phase 3 lasts for 8 weeks, with
      stimulations every 3 weeks Phase 4 consists of one stimulation in one month.

      After phase 4 incontinence scores und quality of life are measured.

    <description>A 34 gauge needle in placed close to the tibial nerve about 2-3 cm above the ankle. A self-adhesive surface electrode is placed on the skin. Needle and surface electrode are connected to an electric stimulator and the stimulating current (0 - 10 mA) is increased in 20 steps. When the patient feels a tingling sensation in the foot, stimulating current is set back for one step and the treatment is started (30 min stimulation).</description>
