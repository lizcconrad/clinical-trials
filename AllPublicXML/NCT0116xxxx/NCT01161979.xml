    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of Dr. Reddy's
      Zonisamide 100 mg Capsule to that of ZonegranÂ® 100 mg Capsule after a single, one-capsule
      dose in subjects fed a high standard fat meal.

      This was an open label, randomized, balanced, single dose, two-period, two-treatment,
      two-sequence crossover study, performed under fed conditions. Subjects were confined to the
      SFBC Clinical Research Facility from at least 10 hours prior to drug administration, until
      after the 24-hour post-dose blood draw, in each period. The treatment phases were separated
      by a washout period of 28 days.
