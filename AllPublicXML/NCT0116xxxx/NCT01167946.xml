  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Pulse Glucocorticoids have been shown to be effective in widespread Alopecia areata
      but not the totalis, universalis or ophiasic type. Whether the failure is due to inadequate
      dosing, inadequate frequency or other factors is a matter of debate. The investigators
      decided to conduct this study using the oral pulse steroid, however with higher doses and
      more frequent pulses to patients with severe forms of Alopecia areata.

      This will be a single-center, prospective, randomized study conducted in King Khalid
      University Hospital. Patients diagnosed with either Alopecia universalis, Alopecia totalis or
      Ophiasic alopecia will be included in the study. Patients with contraindications such as
      diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer, hypertension, infection, psychosis, heart or kidney disease,
      endocrine disorders (apart from a subclinical hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis) will
      be excluded. Children less than 5 years of age and those who received systemic or topical
      treatment within the last 4 weeks before enrollment will be also excluded. Those of child
      bearing potential had to have a negative urine pregnancy test result at baseline visit and
      should practice a reliable method of contraception throughout the study. 42 eligible patients
      will be randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups. Enrolled patients must provide
      written informed consent. Institutional review board approval will be obtained.
