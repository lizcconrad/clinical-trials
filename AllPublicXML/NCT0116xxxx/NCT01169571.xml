      The objective of this study is to characterize the hemodynamic effects of Precedex
      (dexmedetomidine (DEX)) during 3 loading-dose paradigms in mechanically ventilated
      post-surgical subjects in an intensive care setting.

    <measure>Incidence of clinically meaningful hemodynamic abnormality (CMHA)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first 2 hours of study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically meaningful hemodynamic abnormalities (CMHA) consist of (any):
Heart Rate (HR): A native HR &lt;40 bpm (beats per minute); HR &lt;50 bpm requiring pharmacological intervention; systolic BP &lt;80 mm Hg; if pacing wires are in situ, use of a pacemaker after the start of study drug.
Vasoactive Agent Use (i.e. vasopressor or inotrope): the need to add an additional agent to maintain BP; doubling of the dose of any vasoactive agent that was infusing at the start of the study drug.
Paradoxical hypertension: the need to add an additional vasodilating agent for control of hypertension; doubling of the dose of any vasodilating agent that was infusing at the start of the study drug.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or the subject's legally authorized representative has voluntarily signed and
             dated the informed consent document approved by the Research Ethics Board (REB).

          2. Initially intubated and mechanically ventilated adult post-operative subjects in an
             intensive care setting (e.g., post operative care unit, post anesthesia care unit,
             etc.) that are expected to require sedation for at least 2 hours.

          3. Has an American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification of 1, 2, 3 or 4.

             ASA Physical Status Classification System

               -  P1 A normal healthy subject

               -  P2 A subject with mild systemic disease

               -  P3 A subject with severe systemic disease

               -  P5 A moribund subject who is not expected to survive without the operation

               -  P6 A declared brain-dead subject whose organs are being removed for donor

             ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or practicing at least one of the
             following methods of birth control:

               -  hormonal contraceptives (oral, parenteral or transdermal) for at least 3 months
                  prior to study drug administration

          2. Subjects with a 2nd degree Mobitz Type II or 3rd degree heart block, unless the
             subject has a permanent pacemaker or pacing wires are in situ.

          6. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have any other condition where the
             risks of dexmedetomidine would be expected to outweigh its benefits (e.g., cardiogenic
             shock on &gt;2 vasopressors, death anticipated within 48 hours).
