  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of azacitidine and
      gemcitabine in subjects with previously untreated and unresectable pancreatic cancer. Also to
      determine the effect of azacitidine therapy on DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells.

      This is a Phase I single arm study designed for subjects with newly diagnosed, unresectable
      pancreatic cancer who have received no prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery with
      curative intent for pancreatic cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have pathologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma

          -  Must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST. RECIST evaluation must have
             occurred within 4 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Must have newly diagnosed, unresectable disease and have received no prior
             chemotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery with curative intent for pancreatic cancer

          -  Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 70%

          -  Other significant medical conditions must be well controlled and stable in the opinion
             of the investigator for at least 30 days prior to Study Day 1

          -  Women of child bearing age must have negative serum pregnancy test prior to treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known central nervous system tumor involvement

          -  Evidence of other active malignancy requiring treatment

          -  Clinically significant heart disease

          -  Active serious systemic disease, including active bacterial or fungal infection

          -  Active viral hepatitis or symptomatic HIV infection. Positive serology alone is not
             exclusionary

          -  Prior surgery with curative intent for pancreatic cancer

          -  Prior or current chemotherapy or radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer. Palliative
             radiation for distant metastases (excluding metastases in the abdominal region) is
             allowed

          -  Breast feeding, pregnant, or likely to become pregnant during the study

          -  known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol
