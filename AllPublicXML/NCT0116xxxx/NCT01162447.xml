      The investigators aim to compare the levels of bone morphogenetic protein-4 and -7 (BMP-4 and
      7) in blood, follicular fluid and ovarian organ culture supernatant obtained from healthy
      subjects and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients.

      Female patients at ages 20-35 diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome and age-matched
      healthy control subjects will be enrolled in this study.

      Blood samples will be obtained at early follicular phase during doctor's visit from PCOS
      patients and control subjects.If the patient is amenorrheic at the time of visit, both random
      blood samples and another sample at early follicular phase after induction of withdrawal
      bleeding with progesterone.

      Follicular fluids will be retrieved during oocyte pick-up procedure in patients undergoing
      assisted reproduction for PCOS and control IVF patients whose infertility is not PCO related.

      Samples from ovaries will be collected at operation from PCOS patients and control subjects
      if they already undergo any gynecologic laparotomi operations.

      Collected samples will be cultured for 7 days and BMP-4 and -7 levels will be measured in the
      culture fluid of the samples using ELISA method.
