  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information about the size and shape of patients'
      hearts in order to design a device.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Correct device design depends on getting good information about the shape and size of the
      different parts of the heart. Measurements from computed tomography images of hearts will be
      studied. By looking at measurements from a wide range of patients, an understanding of the
      differences in the size and shape of the heart chambers will be gained.
