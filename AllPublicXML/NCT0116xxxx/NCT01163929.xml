  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether a combination of chemotherapy,
      Trastuzumab and RAD001 will result in no evidence of microscopic disease at the time of
      surgery in 50% of enrolled patients.

      This is an open-label Phase 2 neoadjuvant study for patients with histologically confirmed,
      HER-2 positive operable breast cancer. All patients will receive 18 weeks of neoadjuvant
      treatment.

      The trial has an initial 2 week &quot;biomarker lead in&quot; phase. During this two week phase
      patients will either receive Trastuzumab alone or Trastuzumab + Everolimus. This two week
      lead in phase will be randomized open label. The rest of the 16 weeks of the neoadjuvant
      trial treatment is non randomized open label.

      For the first two weeks of neoadjuvant treatment the eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned to either receive or not receive Everolimus. This assignment will be accomplished by
      a previously prepared schedule (maintained by the investigational pharmacy), such that
      investigators are unaware of assignment until after the subject has been enrolled on the
      study and received assignment of Everolimus or not.

          -  Not pregnant or breast feeding or adult of reproductive potential using effective
             birth control methods. If barrier contraceptives are used, these must be continued
             throughout trial by both sexes. Hormonal contraceptives not acceptable as a sole
             method of contraception. Women of childbearing potential must have negative urine or
             serum pregnancy test within 7 days before administration of RAD001

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: ANC &gt; 1500/mm3, platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3, and
             hemoglobin &gt; 11 g/dL

          -  Adequate kidney function: serum creatinine of &lt; 1.5mg/dl and/or creatinine clearance
