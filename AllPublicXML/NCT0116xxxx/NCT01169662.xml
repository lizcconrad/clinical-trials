  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrate provides the body with an alternative source of Nitric Oxide which plays a large role
      in promoting blood flow and reducing blood pressure. Nitrate supplementation with
      vegetable/fruit juice has recently been shown to reduce blood pressure and reduce energy
      expenditure during low intensity exercise. Such findings combined with the previously known
      biological effects of nitric oxide would suggest that nitrate supplementation would also
      impact on blood flow. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of dietary nitrate
      supplementation via vegetable/fruit juice drink on cerebral (brain) blood flow (using Near
      Infrared Spectroscopy).
