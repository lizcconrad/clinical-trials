  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with recurrent glioma includes neurosurgical resection, chemotherapy,
      or radiation therapy. In most cases, a full course of radiotherapy has been applied after
      primary diagnosis, therefore application of re-irradiation has to be applied cautiously. With
      modern precision photon techniques such as fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT), a
      second course of radiotherapy is safe and effective and leads to survival times of 22, 16 and
      8 months for recurrent WHO grade II, III and IV tumors.

      Carbon ions offer physical and biological characteristics. Due to their inverted dose profile
      and the high local dose deposition within the Bragg peak precise dose application and sparing
      of normal tissue is possible. Moreover, in comparison to photons, carbon ions offer an
      increase relative biological effectiveness (RBE), which can be calculated between 2 and 5
      depending on the Glioblastoma (GBM) cell line as well as the endpoint analyzed. Protons,
      however, offer an RBE which is comparable to photons.

      First Japanese Data on the evaluation of carbon ion radiation therapy for the treatment of
      primary high-grade gliomas showed promising results in a small and heterogeneous patient
      collective.

      In the current Phase I/II-CINDERELLA-trial re-irradiation using carbon ions will be compared
      to FSRT applied to the area of contrast enhancement representing high-grade tumor areas in
      patients with recurrent gliomas. Within the Phase I Part of the trial, the Recommended Dose
      (RD) of carbon ion radiotherapy will be determined in a dose escalation scheme. In the
      subsequent randomized Phase II part, the RD will be evaluated in the experimental arm,
      compared to the standard arm, FSRT with a total dose of 36 Gy in single doses of 2 Gy.

      Primary endpoint of the Phase I part is toxicity. Primary endpoint of the randomized part II
      is survival after re-irradiation at 12 months, secondary endpoint is progression-free
      survival.
