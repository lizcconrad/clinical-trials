  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy drugs like alkylating agents are frequently used in various combined regimens to
      treat neoplastic and benign diseases. These drugs are definitely associated with premature
      ovarian failure (POF), resulting in an important decrease of the long-term quality of life
      and an increase of morbidity. A recent study showed that the patients treated by alkylating
      agents had a 4.52 fold higher risk to lose their ovarian function compared with those who
      were treated by other agents. The rate of POF after treatment ranged from 40 to 80%,
      according to the age of the patients and the total doses administered.

      Young women who experience POF have to face with the prospects of infertility and to consider
      years of hormonal replacement therapy. The possibility of minimizing gonadal damage by
      administering of protective therapy during chemotherapy represents an attractive option for
      these patients.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective effect on the ovarian function of the
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRha) administered concomitantly to alkylating
      agents. Preliminary data in the literature on animals (rat and monkeys) are promising. Data
      in human are, however, highly controversial.

    <description>Primary endpoint is to evaluate the short and long-term efficacy of triptorelin depot plus progestin versus progestin alone to prevent POF induced by chemotherapy treatment. The ovarian function (FSH, E2, Progesterone, and AMH, presence of spontaneous menstrual cycle and pregnancies) will be evaluated every 3 months during the first 6 months after the end of chemotherapy, every 6 months during the next 18 months and once a year during an additional 5 years. All hormonal treatment has to be interrupted 10 days before the blood test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of the flare-up effect of Triptorelin</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Triptorelin/Norethisterone treatment has to start if possible 10 days before the beginning of the chemotherapy (time necessary to obtain the inhibitory effect of the Gn-Rha on the ovarian function)and at least the same day. The impact of the interval between the triptorelin/noresthisterone treatment and the start of the chemotherapy on the efficacy to protect ovarian function (FSH level at 2 years of follow-up) will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ovarian function during the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the inhibitory action of the treatment on ovarian function during the chemotherapy: the hormonal profile (FSH and estradiol levels) will be evaluated 10 days after the triptorelin/Norethisterone treatment start, before the second injection (3 months) and at the end of the chemotherapy. Adverse effects due to the injection are evaluated 7-10 days after each injection.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Anamnesis including the compliance of the treatment (possible treatment interruption or dosage modification) and the adverse events are performed at each visit. All events expected and directly related to the chemotherapy or the initial pathology will be documented in the Case Report Form adverse events. Specific anamnesis concerning the possible adverse events due to treatment must be completed for each follow-up visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Add back therapy effect</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of concomitant administration of progestin alone as &quot;Add Back Therapy&quot; during the treatment: specific anamnesis including estrogen-deficiency symptoms (hot flushes, vaginal dryness...) is reported at each visit during the treatment. Osteodensitometry is performed after 1 year follow-up.</description>
