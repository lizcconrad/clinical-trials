          -  18 years of age and older;

          -  have claims indicating at least one use of either abatacept, etanercept, adalimumab or
             infliximab for at least 6 months for teh 6 months assessment and 12 months for the 12
             months assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not continuously eligible for health plan benefits for the same evaluation
             periods will be excluded

          -  Patients who are on other biologics in the 6 and 12 month post-index period will be
             excluded (ex. those in the abatacept cohort will be excluded if they also have claims
             for etanercept in the 6 and 12 month post-index period).

          -  Patients on biologics 6 months prior to the biologic index date will also be excluded

          -  Patients with diagnosis for other non-RA conditions commonly treated with biologics
             (ex. Crohn's disease) during the 6 month pre-index period.
