  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a non - inflammatory condition characterized by the presence
      of chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness; FMS is considered to be the
      result of increased processing of pain by the central nervous system.

      Axial spondyloarthropathy is the hallmark of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), an inflammatory
      joint disease involving the axial spine, the sacroiliac joints as well as peripheral joints.

      Although FMS and AS differ vastly in their pathogenesis, a considerable clinical overlap may
      exist between these conditions. Both disorders typically cause chronic nocturnal back pain
      and disturbed sleep may accompany either condition. In addition,the investigators have
      previously described an increased prevalence of (secondary) FMS among female AS patients.

      This overlap may have important clinical implications since the presence of comorbid FMS may
      lead to increased severity results on commonly used instruments in the evaluation of disease
      activity in AS, such as the BASDAI and BASFI .

      Recently, the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis international Society (ASAS) has published
      updated classification criteria for axial spondyloarthropathy. These criteria, which are
      summarized in table 1, are based on the evaluation of patients suffering from chronic back
      pain with an age of onset of less than 45.

      Objective:

      The objective of the current study is to evaluate the prevalence of axial
      spondyloarthropathies among FMS patients, utilizing the new ASAS criteria.
