  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use by people with schizophrenia is associated with family distress and poor
      clinical outcomes. Therefore, an Family Motivational Intervention (FMI) was developed to help
      parents to motivate their child with a diagnoses of recent-onset schizophrenia to reduce
      cannabis use.

      In a single-blind randomised clinical trail with 75 patients with the diagnosis of
      schizophrenia, parents will be assigned to either FMI or to routine care. Assessments will be
      conducted at baseline and at a 10- and 22-month follow-up. The study hypothesis is that FMI
      will be more effective than routine care in reducing (a) cannabis use in patients and (b)
      distress and sense of burden in parents.
