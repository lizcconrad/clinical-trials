      Women will be invited to participate in E-OPTIMAL at their last clinical follow-up visit for
      OPTIMAL (at 24 months post surgery). E-OPTIMAL is an extension of the ongoing OPTIMAL study
      and no new study treatment interventions will be given. Rather an enrollment intervention
      will be investigated with potential E-OPTIMAL participants randomly assigned to watch a
      standardized video prior to consent or undergo the standard informed consent process. The
      standardized video will review the rationale for women's health research, the importance of
      long-term follow-up and a detailed invitation to participate in E-OPTIMAL. The video has
      undergone review by potential subjects, coordinators and physician researchers to ensure that
      the relevance and importance of issues potentially impacting on long-term participation in
      studies such as E-OPTIMAL are covered. Participation in E-OPTIMAL will occur up to three
      additional years. Women will be strongly encouraged to participate in annual examinations and
      annual telephone surveys but may participate in only one of these study parts if needed.

      We propose to test the following null hypotheses:

        1. There will be no difference in time to surgical failure between uterosacral vaginal
           vault ligament suspension (ULS) and sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) up to 5 years
           after surgery.

        2. The addition of a standardized video detailing the importance of long-term follow-up
           studies for POP to the informed consent process will not improve enrollment or retention
           in E-OPTIMAL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this long-term follow-up study is to extend the follow-up of women in the OPTIMAL
      study up to 5 years from the time of surgery and to compare the success and complication
      rates of the two surgical treatment groups over this extended time period. The Operations and
      Pelvic Muscle Training in the Management of Apical Support Loss (OPTIMAL) study is a
      randomized trial designed to compare sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) to uterosacral
      vaginal vault ligament suspension (ULS) and to assess the role of perioperative behavioral
      therapy/pelvic muscle training (PMT) in women undergoing vaginal surgery for apical or
      uterine prolapse and stress urinary incontinence (SUI).

      The OPTIMAL study includes a two-year follow up from the time of surgery, which is too short
      to evaluate the long-term sequelae of the surgical procedures. A further goal of E-OPTIMAL is
      to investigate a strategy for improving enrollment and retention in long-term studies of
      women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and SUI, by randomizing subjects to two
      different recruitment methods.

      The primary aims of this extension study are to compare SSLF and ULS for the following
      outcomes up to 5 years after surgery in women with Stage 2-4 prolapse involving the vaginal
      apex or uterus and stress urinary incontinence:

        1. time to surgical failure;

        2. the long-term functional and health-related quality of life (QOL), adjusted for PMT
           treatment group;

        3. the annual and cumulative incidence, resolution, and persistence of pelvic floor
           symptoms (urinary, bowel, and prolapse), adjusted for PMT treatment group.

      An additional primary aim (aim 4) is to determine whether exposure to a standardized video
      detailing the importance of long-term follow-up studies for pelvic organ prolapse prior to
      the informed consent process will improve enrollment and/or retention in E-OPTIMAL. We will
      utilize a conceptual framework that assesses three concepts (motivation, barriers and
      pragmatic issues) at two levels (study level and personal/individual level). This conceptual
      framework was developed following a review of the scant available literature on the topic, as
      well as during discussions with investigators who are experienced in recruiting and retaining
      participants in pelvic floor disorders studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Completion of the Year 2 OPTIMAL in-person visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to provide informed consent.

          2. Subjects who are long-term residents of a skilled nursing facility (that is, residency
             is not limited to short-term rehabilitation) at the time of enrollment into E-OPTIMAL.
             Note: Subjects unable to return for annual visits are not excluded as they can
             participate in the telephone interview. However, every attempt will be made to
             encourage in-person participation.

        Criteria for termination of participation:

        (Due to evidence or likelihood that the subject can no longer consent for herself)

          1. Subjects 75 years and older that fail the telephone mini-mental status examination. If
             the participant gets 5 or more of the 10 items &quot;incorrect&quot; the interviewer says &quot;thank
             you very much for your time, that completes the interview for today.&quot; In other words,
             the interviewer in no way implies to the participant that they did not &quot;pass&quot; a test
             to continue. The interviewer contacts the appropriate site coordinator immediately
             after the interview to let them know of the outcome.

          2. Subjects younger than 75 who appear to have cognitive deficits during the quality of
             life telephone interview will be administered the mini-mental status examination;
             those who fail will be excluded from further participation. (Proxy respondents will
             not be used.) Subjects who appear to have cognitive deficits during the in-person
             visit or site telephone interview will be withdrawn from the study by the study
             coordinator.

          3. Subjects who become long-term residents of a skilled nursing facility.

          4. Withdrawal of consent. Verbal assent will be obtained prior to each telephone
             interview and each in-person visit.

        Note: Subjects that are unable to complete telephone interviews (for example, because of
        hearing loss) may complete the interview portion of the survey in person, either at the
        site or in the home.
