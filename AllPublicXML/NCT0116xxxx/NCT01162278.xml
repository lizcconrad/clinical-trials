      Patients that have had staging studies identifying them as AJCC stage IV with up to five
      liver metastases will be considered for the study. About 60 patients will take part in this
      study at UT southwestern, Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System, and Methodist Richardson Cancer
      Center. There are four dose cohorts for this study and each cohort will enroll a minimum of 7
      to a maximum of 15 patients depending on tolerance of therapy. The treatment period will last
      for approximately 1 day and the follow-up portion of the study will last 5 years.

      If the patient has met all the eligibility criteria, they will be registered to the study
      After successful registration to the study and treatment planning session, patients will
      receive a single fraction of radiation. The total dose a particular patient receives will
      depend on the dose cohort they are enrolled into. Each treatment will last about one hour and
      will be given in a particular position to help guide the beams of radiation toward the cancer
      area. Although it is not mandatory, it is recommended that patients receive corticosteroid
      premedication (e.g. Decadron 4-10 m.g. p.o. in a single dose or equivalent) 15-60 minutes
      prior to each treatment for the intended purpose of modulating immediate acute inflammatory
      effects and providing anti-emetic support.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed study specific informed consent form.

          -  Age â‰¥ 18.

          -  Zubrod Performance Status 0-2.

          -  Biopsy proven primary malignancy.

          -  Predicted survival of &gt;6 months.

          -  AJCC Stage IV disease with up to 5 liver metastases as seen on a contrast- enhanced
             CT, MRI or PET/CT.

          -  Ability to spare a critical liver volume as defined by the protocol constraints.

          -  Tumors must be located outside the Central Liver Zone defined by contouring the portal
             vein to its bifurcation + a 3-dimensional 2cm margin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of prior irradiation or other treatment to the liver or
             abdomen who after the protocol treatment would have cumulative doses to the liver or
             other normal tissues greater than the protocol defined constraints.

          -  Need or plans for concomitant antineoplastic therapy (including surgery, cryotherapy,
