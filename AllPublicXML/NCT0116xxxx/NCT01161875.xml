  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non invasive ventilation has been proposed to reduce the incidence of ventilatory dysfunction
      following abdominal aortic surgery. However, the nasogastric tube reduces the airtightness of
      the facial mask used to perform non invasive ventilation and induces air leaks. The use of a
      helmet reduces air leaks, thus seems adequate to ensure patient-ventilator interface.
      However, the high dead space related to helmet volume is responsible for asynchrony between
      patient demand and ventilatory support delivery. The investigators hypothesized driving the
      ventilator based on a neural signal (diaphragm electrical activity) would reduce
      patient-ventilator asynchronies.

    <description>In ICU following abdominal aortic surgery, in extubated patient, non-invasive ventilation was performed as follows:
facial mask with non-invasive pressure support ventilation mode to define settings for helmet ventilation
helmet use with non-invasive pressure support ventilation mode to define adequate settings
helmet use with neurally adjusted ventilatory assist mode, based on previous settings</description>
