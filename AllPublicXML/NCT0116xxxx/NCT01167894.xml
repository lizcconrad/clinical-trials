                  the site for participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Bioequivalence studies are usually conducted in healthy adult subjects in order to assess
        and compare the pharmacokinetic profile of test and reference formulations under uniform
        conditions. Therefore it is essential to exclude those subjects who show abnormalities with
        respect to their health parameters. Subjects were excluded to participate in the study
        based on certain criteria. These criteria were made in order to safeguard the health of the
        subjects enrolled into the study.

          -  Any evidence of impairment of renal, hepatic, cardiac, lung or gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, immunologic, neurologic and haematologic function.

          -  Regular smoker who smokes more than ten cigarettes daily and has difficulty in
             abstaining from smoking for the duration of each study period.

             B Surface Antigen or Hepatitis C Virus

          -  Subjects with positive urine screen for drugs of abuse.

          -  Any subject in whom Simvastatin is contraindicated for medical reasons.
