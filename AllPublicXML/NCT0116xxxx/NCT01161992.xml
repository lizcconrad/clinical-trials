    <textblock>
      Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive liver disorder of unknown cause.
      Current evidence suggests that genes, the genetic material we inherit from our parents, in
      combination with environmental factors, likely play an important role in the development of
      PSC.

      This study is being done to investigate whether genes make people more likely to develop PSC.
      Discovery of these genes will help us to better understand how PSC developes and
      subsequently, to apply new approaches for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

    <description>Adult chronic cholestatic liver diseases, such as Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), are progressive liver disorders of unknown cause. Current evidence suggests that genes, the genetic material we inherit from our parents, in combination with environmental factors, likely play an important role in the development of PSC.
This study is being done to investigate whether genes (the inherited genetic material passed from parents to their children) make people more likely to develop PSC. Discovery of these proposed genes will help us to better understand how PSC progresses,</description>
