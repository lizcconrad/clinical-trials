      Primary Objective:

      To compare patient-led titration (intervention group) versus physician-led titration (usual
      standard of care) in optimizing the clinical use of insulin glargine in an Asian population
      of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) uncontrolled on oral antidiabetic drugs
      (OADs).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To determine the difference in glycemic control, safety, quality of life and treatment
      satisfaction between patient-led titration and usual care.
