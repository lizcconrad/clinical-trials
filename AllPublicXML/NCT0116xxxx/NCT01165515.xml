    <textblock>
      Endostatin, a 20-kDa cleavage product of collagen XVIII, is a component of the extracellular
      matrix expressed in the basement membrane. As a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, endostatin
      induces endothelial cell apoptosis and diminishes cell migration, adhesion and proliferation.

      Endostatin may stop the progression of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic heart disease
      involves unwanted tissue growth. By cutting off the blood supply from a plaque the likelihood
      of plaque rupture may eventually be reduced. Recent data indicates that the loss of collagen
      XVIII/endostatin is related to the enhancement of neo-vascularization and vascular
      permeability in atherosclerosis. Plaque neo-vascularization strongly correlates with the
      regional content of inflammatory cells. Furthermore, increased vascular permeability enhances
      lipid accumulation in the vessel walls, hence increasing foam cells.

      Therapeutic angiogenesis is a most promising strategy for the treatment of myocardial
      infarction. However, it remains unknown if and how endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, such
      as endostatin, regulate angiogenesis in myocardial infarction. Rat models showed that after
      myocardial infarction endostatin neutralization displayed adverse left ventricular remodeling
      and severe heart failure compared with controls. Although angiogenesis was increased, tissue
      remodeling and interstitial fibrosis were further exaggerated in post-myocardial infarction
      hearts by endostatin neutralization.

      However, several studies suggest that endostatin may locally modulate coronary collateral
      formation by inhibiting collateral vessel formation in patients with ischemic heart disease.

      During treadmill exercise tests in healthy volunteers a significant increase in circulating
      endostatin levels can be observed. Exercise induces angiogenesis in cardiac and skeletal
      muscles by decreasing endostatin in the muscle tissues to increase blood flow to these
      metabolically active tissues. Thereby endostatin is released into the general circulation.

      In summary, endostatin might be a new weapon to fight against atherosclerotic progression by
      inhibiting neo-vascularization of atherosclerotic plaques.
