          -  Have or are expected to have moderate to severe pain for an extended period of time
             requiring inpatient opioid analgesic treatment for at least 12 hours as this is the
             minimum duration of study period treatment.

          -  In order to receive the first oral dose, patients must have respiratory stability,
             including a sustained SpO2 of at least 92% with or without supplemental oxygen during
             the 15 minute period just prior to dosing.

          -  Must be inpatient for the treatment period of the study.

          -  The patient's anticipated opioid analgesic requirement over the first 12 hours that
             will follow administration of ORF must be equivalent to at least 10 mg of intravenous
             (IV) morphine.

          -  Have adequate pain control during the 6 hours prior to study drug administration,
             based on appropriate clinical assessment.

          -  Must be sufficiently alert to communicate and complete the faces pain scales-revised
             (FPS-R) or 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS).

          -  Females who are of child bearing potential must be using an adequate and reliable
             method of contraception (e.g., barrier with additional spermicidal foam or jelly,
             intra-uterine device, hormonal contraception) or be abstinent.

             the local IRB/EC.

          -  Must be willing to have up to 10 milliliters (mL) of blood collected for blood
             analysis (7 mL for primary PK and 3 mL for secondary PK analysis); and up to 10 mL of
             blood for pre-specified safety laboratory tests, without safety concerns.

          -  Any current history of medical or surgical conditions that might significantly
             interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion

             tract, liver, kidneys, and/or blood-forming organs).

          -  Received oxycodone in the 24 hours prior to study drug administration. .

             aspartate amino transferase (AST) &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age.

          -  Currently taking any medications which are CYP3A4 inhibitors.

          -  Impaired respiratory reserve including severe acute or chronic lung disease, or
             patients receiving mechanical respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation,
             BIPAP, or CPAP 6 hours prior to the first oral dose and during the entire oral
             treatment period.

          -  Impaired cardiovascular stability (e.g., the day of surgery for cardiac surgery
             patients).

          -  Participated in a clinical drug study within 30 days preceding the initial dose in
             this study.

             study drug.
