      Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by fluctuating mental status,
      inattention, and either disorganized thinking or an altered level of consciousness. This form
      of organ dysfunction occurs in up to 50% of hospitalized patients and is associated with
      worsening mortality, prolonged hospital length of stay, higher health care costs, and
      accelerated functional and cognitive decline. Despite the negative consequences of delirium,
      the majority of cases are unrecognized by hospital physicians because it is not routinely
      screened for. In an effort to facilitate delirium screening, we sought to validate two brief
      delirium assessments (&lt;2 minutes) in the hospital setting.

    <textblock>
      Delirium is often missed because physicians do not routinely screen for this diagnosis. Most
      delirium assessments can take up to 10 minutes to perform making them less likely to be
      incorporated into the routine physician assessment. Using brief (&lt;2 minutes) and easy to use
      delirium assessments may ameliorate this quality of care issue. The Confusion Assessment
      Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) possesses these characteristics, but has only
      been validated in mechanically and non-mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients.
      As a result, it still requires validation in the non-ICU hospitalized patients. Recently, we
      also developed the Brief Confusion Assessment Method (B-CAM) which is a modification of the
      CAM-ICU. The benefit is that it takes even less time than the CAM-ICU. However, it also
      requires validation in hospitalized patients. As result, we propose the following and the
      following specific aims:

      Aim #1: To validate the B-CAM in non-ICU hospitalized patients. The B-CAM will be performed
      by a clinical trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in 150 non-ICU hospitalized
      patients that are &gt; 65 years old. This instrument will be validated against a psychiatrist's
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition Text Revision assessment
      as the reference standard.

      Aim #2: To validate the CAM-ICU in non-ICU hospitalized patients. The CAM-ICU will be
      performed by a clinical trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in approximately
      150 non-ICU hospitalized patients that are &gt; 65 years old. This instrument will be validated
      against a psychiatrist's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition
      Text Revision assessment as the reference standard.
