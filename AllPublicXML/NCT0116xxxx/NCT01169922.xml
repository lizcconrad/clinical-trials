  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is examining how genetic and brain factors play a role in adolescents' health
      risk behavior as well as studying behaviors that young people engage in that may place them
      at risk for contracting a sexually transmitted disease like HIV/AIDS, and what kind of
      educational program works best to reduce these risky behaviors.

      A baseline assessment is conducted, including a computer questionnaire assessing personality
      characteristics, attitudes toward and experiences with sex, alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes,
      among other things. The participant also meets with a therapist to conduct a brief
      motivational interview at this time. A &quot;Time-Line Follow-Back&quot; is conducted; this notes
      incidences of sexual intercourse, alcohol use, marijuana use, and cigarette use in a 30-day
      period. An fMRI is conducted, and a saliva sample is gathered. During the second session of
      the study, participants are randomly assigned to either a sex and alcohol risk reduction
      intervention, or a sex risk reduction intervention. After the intervention, participants are
      contacted at 3 month intervals (3 months later, 6 months later, 9 months later, and 12 months
      later) to meet. At these &quot;follow-up&quot; meetings, another Time-Line Follow-Back is conducted,
      along with another computer questionnaire (again assessing attitudes toward and experiences
      with sex, alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes).
