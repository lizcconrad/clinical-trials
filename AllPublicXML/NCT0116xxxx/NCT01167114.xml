  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how effective STA-9090 is in
      treating esophagogastric cancer. The investigators will also evaluate the side effects of
      STA-9090, and examine the relationship between the presence of HSP-90 and how well study
      participants respond to STA-9090. STA-9090 works by blocking a protein in tumor cells called
      HSP90, which is thought to play a role in tumor growth. By interfering with this protein's
      function, STA-9090 may help kill tumor cells. This drug has been used in other research
      studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this agent may help
      to slow tumor growth in esophagogastric cancer.

      -  Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which time the study drug will be administered
           for three consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of no study drug. STA-9090 will be given
           by intravenous infusion.

        -  Participants will come to the clinic on Days 1, 8, and 15 of all cycles. At these
           visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed: Review of current
           medications and any side effects experienced; Performance status evaluation; Physical
           examination; Vital signs; Routine blood tests; CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
           (every 2 cycles) and Optional FDG-PET scan (every 2 cycles).

        -  Participants may remain on this research study for as long as their cancer is responding
           to the study drug and they are not experiencing any severe side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced esophageal,
             gastroesophageal, or gastric cancer. When possible, archived biopsy or resection
             specimens must be available for correlative SNaPshot and FISH studies.

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             20mm or greater with conventional techniques or as 10mm or greater with spiral CT scan
             (per RECIST criteria).

          -  Participants must have progressed through prior 1st-line therapy. For the purposes of
             this trial, neoadjuvant chemoradiation or peri-operative chemotherapy may be
             considered as prior 1st-line treatment in the event of metastatic recurrence.

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks
