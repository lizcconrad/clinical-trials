  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational long-term follow-up study will assess the persistence of direct acting
      antiviral (DAA) resistant mutations and the durability of sustained virological response in
      patients with chronic hepatitis C who have participated in a Roche DAA treatment protocol. Up
      to 5 scheduled monitoring visits for blood sampling during an observational period of up to
      36 months.

        <description>Population sequencing was used for determination of loss of resistance status. Resistance status was reported as either with loss of DNV resistance or without loss of DNV resistance.
Results are reported as per donor protocol. Category 1: Number of participants with loss of resistance in NV22688. A total of 99 participants with resistance at the end of donor study by population sequencing were included in this analysis.
Category 2: Number of participants with no loss of resistance in NV22688. A total of 33 participants with resistance at the end of donor study by population sequencing were included in this analysis.

            <description>Participants enrolled into this arm were those with HCV infection who participated in one of the following donor protocols: NV21075 [NCT00963885], WV21913 [NCT01331850], NP22660 [NCT01185860], NV22776 [NCT01220947], PP25213 [NCT01278134], NP27946 [NCT01483742], NP28266 [NCT01628094]. Patients had developed DNV-associated resistant mutation(s), which persisted or not through to the last evaluation of drug resistance in the donor protocol(s). Participants were monitored up to 18 months.</description>

          <description>Population sequencing was used for determination of loss of resistance status. Resistance status was reported as either with loss of DNV resistance or without loss of DNV resistance.
Results are reported as per donor protocol. Category 1: Number of participants with loss of resistance in NV22688. A total of 99 participants with resistance at the end of donor study by population sequencing were included in this analysis.
Category 2: Number of participants with no loss of resistance in NV22688. A total of 33 participants with resistance at the end of donor study by population sequencing were included in this analysis.
Category 3: Number of participants with loss of resistance in donor study. A total of 30 participants with no DNV resistance at the end of donor study by population sequencing enrolled in NV22688 were included in this analysis.</description>
