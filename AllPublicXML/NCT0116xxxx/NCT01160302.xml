  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable evidence that turmeric consumption may have a protective effect against
      cancer progression. The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term effects of
      supplementation with a turmeric extract, Curcumin C3 Complex®, on biomarkers of head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, exploratory biomarker trial of the food substances Curcumin C3
      Complex® in subjects with newly diagnosed HNSCC. Curcumin, a novel safe nutritional
      interventional agent has exciting potential usage as a preventive/adjuvant agent, and
      prevents tumor formation by inhibiting an important molecular pathway that is shown to cause
      cancer progression, which we will test as a tumor marker in this clinical trial.

      The primary objective is to evaluate biomarker response of HNSCC patients to the food
      substances Curcumin C3 Complex®. This will be done by comparing post-intervention values to
      baseline values. In addition, we will determine the levels of curcumin and its metabolites in
      tumor and adjacent tissue.
