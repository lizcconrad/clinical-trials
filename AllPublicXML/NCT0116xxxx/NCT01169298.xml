The response of PTCL will be assessed by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) response criteria that have been established by the Lymphoma Study Group of the JCOG based on criteria of Cheson et al.in the Report of an International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas</description>
