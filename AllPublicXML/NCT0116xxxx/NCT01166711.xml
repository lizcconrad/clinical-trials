  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the one-time application of Paclitaxel from SeQuent
      Please (Paclitaxel-coated Balloon Catheter) after using the Coroflex Blue (Cobalt Chromium
      Stent) with the slow releasing of small dose of Paclitaxel from the Coroflex Please
      (Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent) stent system in a non-inferiority trial.

    <description>standard techniques will be used
maximal vasodilatation after nitro application
baseline angiography with at least two orthogonal views (showing target lesion free of foreshortening or vessel overlap)
6 French guiding catheter at least
target lesion will be crossed with standard guidewire
direct stenting at the discretion of the investigator
if pre-dilation, a commercially available balloon will be used (length not exceeding the stent to be implanted)
full lesion coverage will be ensured (with one or more stents)

BMS needs to be fully embedded in vessel wall
post-dilation with high pressure is required before treatment with DEB
DEB will be inflated with nominal pressure (balloon equates to vessel diameter)
length of DEB should exceed the BMS by 2-3 mm on each side
if dissection, full length of dissection and optional additional stented area should be treated with additional DEB (to avoid geographic miss)</description>
