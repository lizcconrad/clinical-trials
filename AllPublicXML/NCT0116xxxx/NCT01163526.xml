  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A research study of liver perfusion (how blood flows to the liver over time). We hope to
      learn whether perfusion characteristics of liver masses may be predictive of response to
      treatment and whether liver perfusion characteristics can be used to follow response to
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:3.1.1 Patients with suspected or biopsy-proven liver masses including
        unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), unresectable colon cancer metastases to the
        liver, and metastatic neuroendocrine tumors to the liver will be eligible for enrollment.

        3.1.2 Patients who have undergone prior chemotherapy more than one year prior to the study
        are eligible for enrollment.

        3.1.4 Patients must be 18 years or older. Patients must not be pregnant and, if of
        child-bearing age, must take precautions not to become pregnant.

        3.1.5 No life expectancy restrictions.

        3.1.6 ECOG and Karnofsky Performance Status will not be employed.

        (GFR) must be &gt; 60)

        3.1.8 Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:3.2.1 Patients who have undergone prior chemoembolization of
        hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are ineligible for enrollment. Patients who have undergone
        chemotherapy within one year prior to the study are also ineligible for enrollment.

        3.2.2 No restrictions regarding use of other investigational agents.

        3.2.3 Patients with severe contrast allergy are ineligible.
