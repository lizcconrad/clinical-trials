    <textblock>
      Malignant Melanoma is a deadly skin cancer that can be cured if diagnosed early. To date
      atypical pigmented skin lesions are diagnosed by appearance alone and many moles and lesions
      are excised unnecessarily and on the other hand malignant lesions are missed and diagnosed
      too late. In this study a protein conjugated to a florescent dye is spread on a suspicious
      pigmented lesion, the hypothesis is that this protein binds to malignant cells only and thus
      with a special camera that picks up the dye we can find pigmented lesions with early
      malignant transformation.
