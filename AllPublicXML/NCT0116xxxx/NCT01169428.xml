    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a 12 week Mindfulness-Based Weight Loss
      Maintenance (MBWLM) intervention is effective in maintaining recent loss of 10% or more of
      initial body weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is now recognized as the 2nd leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. and is
      associated with significant impairment. While structured behavioral regimes typically lead to
      significant weight loss, a burgeoning literature reveals less encouraging results for weight
      loss maintenance (WLM). Hence, innovative approaches to WLM are necessary to buffer against
      disease risks associated with weight regain. Interventions utilizing mindfulness meditation
      show promise in treating unhealthy eating behaviors and other obesity-related problems,
      including mood, blood sugar control and addiction. By enhancing self-awareness and emotion
      regulation, such interventions may be particularly useful in facilitating the internalization
      of healthy behavior change. The proposed study aims to develop a novel intervention to
      promote WLM. Specifically, we will develop a 12 week Mindfulness-Based Weight Loss
      Maintenance (MBWLM) intervention and test its efficacy against an attention/education/support
      control (ASC) condition in a two-arm RCT of overweight and obese (BMI &gt; 25) men and women
      (N=95) who recently lost at least 10% of their initial body weight via non-surgical means.
      The primary endpoint will be percent change in weight from baseline to 12-month follow-up. We
      are also interested in testing the efficacy of the MBWLM program on improving secondary
      outcomes, including obesity/adiposity, health behaviors, and psychological well-being. In
      addition, we will study the impact of MBWLM on glucose metabolism, appetite/food intake
      regulation, and systemic inflammation. Outcome data will be collected at baseline,
      post-intervention, 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up. Multilevel (&quot;mixed-effects&quot;)
      modeling will be used to test between-group differences on primary and secondary endpoints.
      Further, path analysis will be used to investigate mechanisms underlying successful WLM.
      Taken together, these data could provide support for the integration of mindfulness
      meditation into comprehensive treatment programs for obesity and weight management.

    <description>This mindfulness-meditation based intervention is designed to increase awareness of the factors that affect weight loss maintenance after successful weight loss. Mindfulness meditation is a technique for training awareness. The program will train subjects to increase awareness of the somatic, cognitive, affective, interpersonal and environmental factors that mediate eating and physical activity by incorporating empirically-supported and theoretically-synergized components, including: general mindfulness meditation skills, mindful and intuitive eating, appetite-satiety awareness, mindful movement and yoga, a mindful approach to exercise engagement, and training in enhancing emotion regulation and stress management skills. In addition, the MBWLM group will be supported by Maintenance Partners who are trained as Integrative Health Coaches.</description>

    <description>Attention/Education/Support Control group, designed to control for educational content as well as nonspecific treatment factors [e.g., natural history (time), amount of time and energy spent in the intervention, attention by group leaders, social support, as well as information &amp; education]. Like the experimental group(MBWLM), this group meet once a week for 2 hours during the 12-week intervention, and then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks post the 12 week intervention. Participants also receive the same amount of telephonic support through Maintenance Partners as the experimental group, but their Maintenance Partners employed empathic listening only rather than myriad coaching techniques.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: 1) Gender: Men and women. 2) Ethnicity: Any, with over-sampling of
        African-Americans. 3) Age: &gt;18 4) Weight: BMI &gt; 20 at study entry. 5) Documented (by
        physician, community weight loss program, personal friend or family member) weight loss of
        at least 9% of total body weight completed within the previous 3 year period and not
        regained greater than half of the 9% loss.

        6) Planning to be in the area through the length of follow-up. 7) Availability of
        telephone. 8) English-speaking and English-literate. 9) Commitment to attend all treatment
        and assessment appointments. 10) If on medication that may affect outcome variables, on
        stable dose with willingness to remain at that dose from baseline through end of weekly
        (12-week) intervention and 12 month follow-up, unless physician orders otherwise.

        11) Willingness to not engage in any other formal weight loss program through the 12 month
        follow-up.

        12) Provides Informed consent. 13) Participants can have a weight loss or gain of more than
        8.8lbs within the 3 month period prior to enrollment. However, due to the possibility that
        this will influence baseline inflammatory bio markers we will document the amount of
        self-reported weight change within the 3 month period prior to their baseline lab
        appointment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent participation in a structured weight loss program, fad diet or use of
             weight loss medication or herbal supplements during 15 month course of the trial. If
             has been taking a weight loss medication or supplement, must go through a 1 month
             washout period before enrollment.

          2. Previous weight reduction surgery, or initiating weight reduction surgery during the
             15 month study period.

          3. Inability to participate fully or behave appropriately in the group setting, as
             observed by (a). interviewing clinician and evidenced by two or more of the
             exclusionary criteria on the Appropriateness for Group Participation Behavioral
             Checklist or (b) baseline acknowledgement of substance abuse, psychotic episode(s),
             psychiatric hospitalization or history of self-harm within the past 2 years, or
             current suicidal or homicidal ideation.

          4. Unstable medical condition, medical condition underlying weight or eating problems
             (e.g., Blood sugar greater than 350, Cancer and currently receiving radiation or chemo
             treatment, Cushing's Syndrome; thyroid disorder) or medical condition requiring strict
             dietary regimen.

          5. Pregnant, breast-feeding, or unwilling to take contraceptive measures to prevent
             pregnancy during the 15 month study. If a woman has recently been pregnant, is

         11. Baseline glucometer reading of &gt;125 for previously unknown diabetics, as this is
             likely to indicate undiagnosed diabetes that would require more intensive treatment.

             glucometer reading &gt; 350 or the inability to maintain a stable diabetes medication
