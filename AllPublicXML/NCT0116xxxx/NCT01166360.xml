  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growth determination factor 15 (GDF-15) and high sensitive troponin-t (hsTnT) are emerging
      humoral markers for risk stratification in clinically stable heart failure patients and in
      patients with stable coronary artery disease. No data are available about the prognostic
      value of these peptides in relation to mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery.

      Primary objective of the present study is to test the hypothesis, that GDF-15 is superior to
      a standard preoperative risk score, the additive Euroscore for the prediction of 30 day
      mortality and postoperative morbidity in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.

      Secondary objectives are to test the predictive value of hsTNT, either alone, or in
      combination with GDF-15 and if GDF-15 adds additional information to NTproBNP levels and
      preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2) levels.

      The study will be based on 2 patient cohorts, a group of patients studied during an
      observation period (2009) and a validation cohort of patients studied in 2008. The 2009
      cohort (about 800 patients) will be analyzed to determine the predictive value of GDF-15 for
      predicting mortality and morbidity. The 2008 cohort (about 1200 patients) will be used to
      validate these findings.

      Besides conventional morbidity markers, new sensitive markers of organ dysfunction (FABP,
      NGAL, sFLT-1, PIGF) will also be tested in the 2009 group.
