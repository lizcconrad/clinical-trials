  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
      regulator (CFTR) gene. The encoded protein, CFTR, is an epithelial chloride ion channel
      responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in
      various tissues. Although the disease affects multiple organs, the leading cause of mortality
      is the progressive loss of lung function. Obstruction of airways with thick mucus, chronic
      bacterial infection of the airways, and inflammatory response are all thought to play a role
      in causing lung damage. Through its function as a chloride channel, CFTR is believed to be
      integral in epithelial ion and water transport and hence, maintaining the normal hydration of
      lung secretions.

      VX-770 (ivacaftor) is a potent and selective potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and
      R117H forms of human CFTR. Based on in vitro studies and pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK),
      and safety profiles, VX-770 has been selected for clinical development as a possible
      treatment for patients with CF.

      Hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance imaging (HG-MRI) is a promising new means of
      assessing lung function by direct imaging of certain non-radioactive isotopes of an inert
      noble gas, such as helium or xenon. Through this technique, high-resolution 3-dimensional
      images of lung ventilation can be obtained in both pediatric and adult patients during a
      single short breath-hold following inhalation of the gas.

      This is a 2-part study to evaluate the effect of VX-770 on hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic
      resonance imaging (3He-MRI), and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-770 in subjects
      aged 12 years and older with CF who have the G551D-CFTR mutation. Part A is a single-blind,
      placebo-controlled study that includes 4 weeks of VX-770 treatment and 4 weeks of placebo
      treatment. Part B is an open-label, 48 week study of long-term effect of VX 770 on
      hyperpolarized 3He-MRI.

    <measure>Part A: Change From Baseline in Total Ventilation Defect Defined by Hyperpolarized Helium 3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3He-MRI) at Day 43</measure>
    <time_frame>Part A: Baseline (pre-dose Day 15), Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects inhaled hyperpolarized helium-3 (3He) gas mixed with nitrogen to make a total volume of approximately one-third forced vital capacity (FVC) to a maximum of 1 liter and hold their breath for 20 seconds or less. Rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed during inhalation/exhalation and/or breath-hold. Areas of decreased ventilation were observed as ventilation defects that are visualized as decreased (and/or absent) 3He intensity in 3He-MRI. The total ventilation defect was defined as the ratio of total ventilation defect volume (L) to total lung volume (L), expressed as a percentage. Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement collected before initial administration of study drug in VX-770 treatment phase (Day 15 to 42).</description>

    <description>Subjects were asked to inhale hyperpolarized 3 He gas mixed with nitrogen to make a total volume of approximately one-third forced vital capacity (FVC) to a maximum of 1 liter and hold their breath for 20 seconds or less. Rapid MRI was performed during inhalation/exhalation and/or breath-hold. Areas of decreased ventilation were observed as ventilation defects that are visualized as decreased (and/or absent) 3He intensity in 3He MRI. The total ventilation defect was defined as the ratio of total ventilation defect volume (L) to total lung volume (L), expressed as a percentage.

          <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Predicted FEV1 (for age, gender, and height) was calculated using the Knudson method. Number of subjects in each percent predicted FEV1 category (less than [&lt;] 70%, greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 70%-&lt;90%, and &gt;=90%) are reported. Data was planned to be reported separately for Part A and Part B of the study. Here “n” signifies subjects who were evaluable for specified part of the study.

        <title>Part A: Change From Baseline in Total Ventilation Defect Defined by Hyperpolarized Helium 3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3He-MRI) at Day 43</title>
        <description>Subjects inhaled hyperpolarized helium-3 (3He) gas mixed with nitrogen to make a total volume of approximately one-third forced vital capacity (FVC) to a maximum of 1 liter and hold their breath for 20 seconds or less. Rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed during inhalation/exhalation and/or breath-hold. Areas of decreased ventilation were observed as ventilation defects that are visualized as decreased (and/or absent) 3He intensity in 3He-MRI. The total ventilation defect was defined as the ratio of total ventilation defect volume (L) to total lung volume (L), expressed as a percentage. Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement collected before initial administration of study drug in VX-770 treatment phase (Day 15 to 42).</description>

          <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Predicted FEV1 (for age, gender, and height) was calculated using the Knudson method.

Respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms (for example, coughing, congestion, wheezing), score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and better health-related quality of life.
