      The purpose of the investigators study is to investigate the impact of a commercial vegetable
      juice on dietary vegetable intake and select cardiovascular risk factors in a generally
      healthy population. The study was a 12 week study with 3 groups who received 0, 8 or 16 fluid
      ounces daily of vegetable juice, along with education on the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop
      Hypertension) diet. All participants came in for 3 study visits at 0, 6 and 12 weeks into the
      study.
