  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of using dexmedetomidine (Precedex) in
      addition to the current standard-of-care for sedation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primarily, this study seeks to explore whether there is a difference in mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) variability, incidence of intracranial hypertension, intracranial pressure
      (ICP) variability, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and Cerebrovascular pressure reactivity
      index (PRx) in two groups of subjects.

      Patients must be submitted to the ICU and be endotracheally intubated and receiving
      mechanical ventilation with continuous IV sedation for less than 24 hours after recruitment
      into the study.

    <measure>Variability of Intracranial Pressure (ICP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Variability of intracranial pressure was assessed and listed as the standard deviation of all measurements within 24 hours. Variability was assessed and listed as the standard deviation of all measurements within 24 hours</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pressure Reactivity Index (PRx)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Using computational methods, the PRx was determined by calculating the correlation coefficient between 20 consecutive, time-averaged data points (60-second periods) of ICP and Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP).
A positive PRx correlation suggests impaired cerebrovascular pressure reactivity, that is, passive transmission of changes in ABP to ICP. A negative PRx correlation indicates good pressure reactivity. Any change in ABP produces inverse changes in ICP.</description>

        <description>Using computational methods, the PRx was determined by calculating the correlation coefficient between 20 consecutive, time-averaged data points (60-second periods) of ICP and Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP).
A positive PRx correlation suggests impaired cerebrovascular pressure reactivity, that is, passive transmission of changes in ABP to ICP. A negative PRx correlation indicates good pressure reactivity. Any change in ABP produces inverse changes in ICP.</description>
