  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this pilot study is to conduct a combined N-of-1 trial (N-1-T) of MPH
      (methylphenidate) for amelioration of fatigue in children with cancer, and to evaluate the
      N-1-T design both for individual clinical decision making and for clinical trials in symptom
      management in pediatric oncology patients.

      -  Because no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will receive
           liquid MPH on some days and a placebo on other days. We will compare how the participant
           feels on MPH days with how they feel on placebo days to determine whether MPH makes a
           difference.

        -  Participants will take 3 days of MPH in a row and 3 days of placebo in a row, which will
           make up one study treatment pair. Participants will receive a total of 3 study treatment
           pairs.

        -  On the days that the participant takes the MPH or placebo, they will answer one question
           asking to rate their fatigue. They will also be asked to complete study drug diary as
           well as a sleep diary.

        -  After every 3 days of either MPH or placebo, the participant will complete an additional
           survey about their fatigue, other symptoms, and possible side effects from MPH.
