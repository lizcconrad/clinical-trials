      A study to compare the safety and efficacy of an aromatase inhibitor in combination with
      lapatinib, trastuzumab or both for the treatment of hormone receptor positive, HER2+
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, multi-center, three arm study of lapatinib plus
      trastuzumab plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI), trastuzumab plus an AI, or lapatinib plus an AI
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these regimens as first- or second-line therapy in
      postmenopausal subjects with hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2-positive metastatic breast
      cancer (MBC) who have received prior trastuzumab and endocrine therapies. Eligible subjects
      will be postmenopausal; have tumors that are ER and/or PgR positive and HER2-positive; have
      Stage IV metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of
      lapatinib/trastuzumab/AI combination versus (vs.) trastuzumab/AI combination for progression
      free survival. The secondary objectives are to evaluate progression free survival in
      trastuzumab/AI vs. lapatinib/AI and trastuzumab/lapatinib/AI vs. lapatinib/AI, overall
      survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, the safety and tolerability of all
      three treatment groups (lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus an AI, trastuzumab plus an AI, or
      lapatinib plus an AI), and quality of life status relative to baseline.

          6. Have a concurrent disease or condition that may interfere with study participation, or
             any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the subject's safety (for

             understanding or rendering of informed consent)

          7. Have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter
             absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels

             chemically related to any of the study agents or their excipients that, in the opinion

          9. Any prohibited medication.

         10. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
