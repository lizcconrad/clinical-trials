  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are two major public health problems in developing
      countries. In these countries, the use of monotonous plant-based diets, low in animal source
      food but high in iron absorption inhibitors such as phytic acid or polyphenol, lead to poor
      iron status or aggravate poor iron status caused by infections. In many West African
      countries sorghum is a major source of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals especially for
      the most poverty-stricken people. Some sorghum varieties are known to contain high levels of
      polyphenols which have an inhibitory effect on iron absorption in humans. Polyphenols are a
      huge group of plant metabolites with varying chemical structures. Depending on their
      structure, the level of complex formation with iron in the intestine and thus the negative
      effect on iron absorption is different.

      Micronutrient deficiency can be combated by fortification of plant-based staples.
      Fortification is a promising food-based approach which can be applied when other strategies
      fail to provide adequate levels of the respective micronutrient in the diet. To fortify foods
      with iron, a wide variety of different iron compounds have been used. The iron compound
      sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetic (NaFeEDTA) overcomes the inhibitory effect of phytate
      on human iron absorption. No information about the potential enhancing effect of NaFeEDTA in
      presence of polyphenol is available.

      The aims of the study are to investigate the effect of different sorghum polyphenol
      concentrations on human iron absorption and to investigate if the negative impact of the
      polyphenols can be overcome by using NaFeEDTA as iron compound. The study will include 32
      apparently healthy young women which will consume sorghum porridges with different polyphenol
      levels and sorghum porridges fortified with ferrous sulfate as compared to NaFeEDTA.
      Furthermore test meals with added vitamin C or added laccase will be compared to a control
      meal. Iron absorption will be determined by stable isotope technique.
