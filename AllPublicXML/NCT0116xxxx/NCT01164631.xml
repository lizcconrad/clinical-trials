  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enlarged tonsils and malocclusion have relationship with sleep disturbance in children. The
      consequences of these features can include deviation of normal craniofacial growth such that
      this may result in a facial morphology more suitable to the development of sleep apnea later
      in life. The aim of this study was to compare the growth redirection, the evolution of
      respiratory symptoms and the pharyngeal size of snoring children with obstructive tonsils
      from the waiting list for surgery treated with the Bioajusta X orthodontic appliance.This new
      protocol of orthodontic treatment promotes maxillary expansion, mandibular advancement and
      proper tongue positioning on swallowing , that together may be helpful on remodeling the
      upper airways.

      Methods-The study population included 40 children, ranging in age from 6 to 9 years old, who
      were on the waiting list for adenotonsillectomy at the ENT Department of FMUSP. The patients
      were randomly divided into two groups and were subsequently compared after a six month
      interval. The first group included 24 patients who where treated with the Bioajusta X
      appliance and the second group included 16 patients who served as controls, and,thus, did not
      received any treatment. Cephalometric analysis was used to assess the growth direction by
      comparing the relationship of the vertical jaw based upon the angle of the palatal plane with
      the mandibular plane (ANS-PNS/Go-M).Pharyngeal size was measured using acoustic
      pharyngometry. The parents filled out a questionnaire with respect to the respiratory
      symptoms of their children.
