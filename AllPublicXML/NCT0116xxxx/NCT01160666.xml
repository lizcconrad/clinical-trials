  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an increase in BAFF
      (BLyS) levels and a resulting B cell hyperactivity. B cells are involved in the pathogenesis
      of SS in both systemic and glandular features, and B cell downregulation may lead to a
      decrease of disease activity. Moreover, pathogenesis of SS is closed to that of Systemic
      lupus erythematosus, where Belimumab has been proven to be effective.

      lupus erythematosus, where Belimumab has been proven to be effective.

      This phase II open-label study has 2 mains objectives:

        -  To evaluate the proof of concept of efficacy of belimumab in subjects with SS

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab in subjects with SS Belimumab will
           be administered (10mg/kg on D0 D14 D28 and every 28 days for 24 weeks, with extension to
           48 weeks if responders) to all patients
