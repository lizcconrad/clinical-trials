  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether corrective surgery done earlier than the
      current standard can better improve the visual and eye movement deficits in children with
      infantile esotropia (crossed eyes in infancy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While there is a uniform agreement among pediatric ophthalmologists that most infantile
      esotropia requires surgical correction, the proper timing of surgery is controversial. In
      North America, the typical age at surgery ranges from 11-18 months. Unfortunately, despite
      successful surgical realignment of the eyes, the sensory and eye movement deficits often
      persist. Recently, some pediatric ophthalmologists have advocated earlier surgery. The
      rationale for early surgery stems from animal and human research showing that early
      realignment of the eyes within an early critical period allows normal development of the
      sensory and eye movement systems.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motion visual evoked potential (mVEPs) asymmetry</measure>
    <time_frame>at age 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>mVEP measures the perception of nasalward and temporalward motion for each eye at the cortical level. A nasal bias index (NBI) is calculated, which will show whether subjects perceive motion better for one direction over the other.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Stereopsis</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 and 5 years of age</time_frame>
    <description>This measures the level of 3D depth perception.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) asymmetry</measure>
    <time_frame>at age 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OKN is measured in both the nasalward and temporalward directions for each eye. From this a nasal bias index (NBI) is calculated, which will show whether subjects perceive motion better in one direction or the other.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Motion Perception</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 and 5 years of age</time_frame>
    <description>Motion perception will be tested using two tasks: motion detection (at age 2 and 5 years) and motion discrimination (at age 5 years).</description>

    <description>Five small sensors are placed on the head which record the brain's response to moving stripes that are displayed on a computer screen. Each eye is tested while the other eye is patched. Each recording trial lasts about 10 seconds, and several trials are done for each eye.</description>

        Patients with infantile esotropia will be enrolled from The Hospital for Sick Children in
        Toronto. Infants with characteristics that indicate low likelihood of spontaneous
        resolution will be studied.
