  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10,000 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are performed
      annually in the US for various indications. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is the most common
      late noninfectious complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
      Prognosis of BO in the allogeneic HSCT setting is dismal and there are no therapies proven to
      be consistently effective. The exact incidence is not clear but may be as high as 30%2 . Risk
      factors include new or ongoing chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), age, antecedent
      obstructive airways disease and viral infections1. BO is characterized physiologically by
      progressive irreversible airflow obstruction and pathologically by luminal occlusion of the
      distal airways due to progressive scarring3. The pathogenesis is not completely understood
      but the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1), important for both tissue repair
      and fibrosis, is thought to play a pivotal role. Bortezomib, an FDA approved proteasomal
      inhibitor inhibits TGF-b1 signaling in vitro and protects against lung injury/fibrosis in
      bleomycin mouse model as well as in a mouse model for skin fibrosis. This is consistent with
      other data in the literature that proteasomal inhibition can prevent the development of
      fibrosis. Thus the investigators propose to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      bortezomib in chronic pulmonary GVHD (BO).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of
             the study.

          -  Day &gt;100 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

          -  Underlying cancer in remission

          -  Decrease in FEV1 of â‰¥12% from the pre-transplant baseline (FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.8)

          -  No evidence of acute infection

          -  ANC &gt;1000

             enrollment.

             days before enrollment.
