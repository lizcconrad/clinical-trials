      The goal of this project is to improve hypertension control at Kaiser Permanente Colorado
      (KPCO) by implementing a population-based multi-factorial intervention that uses home BP
      monitors that can download BP readings to KPCO's health records via internet, interactive
      voice response (IVR) technology, and multidisciplinary care team. Participants will be
      randomized to either the home blood pressure monitoring group receiving the multi-factorial
      intervention or the usual care group who will be receiving Kaiser standard of care. We will
      determine the proportion of patients in each group who achieve their target BP goals at 6
      months, according to national clinical practice guidelines. The study hypothesis is that a
      higher proportion of patients with uncontrolled hypertension in the home blood pressure
      monitoring (HBPM) group will achieve their target blood pressure compared to those in the
      usual care (UC) group.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      â€¢ To determine the proportion of patients in each group who achieve their target BP goals at
      6 months, according to national clinical practice guidelines

      Secondary:

      The following parameters will be evaluated between groups:

        -  Change in BP measures between baseline and at 6 months

        -  Proportion of patients who are receiving antihypertensive treatments in accordance to
           national clinical practice guidelines

        -  Adherence to hypertensive medication regimen during the 6-month follow-up period

        -  Patient satisfaction with the care model.

    <description>Home blood pressure readings are taken at least 3 times a week, uploaded to a Microsoft Health Vault account through American Heart Association Heart360 at least 1 time per week. Patients are followed by a clinical pharmacist, with physician oversight, who will make adjustments to antihypertensive medications or suggest additional medications using national JNC VII and KPCO hypertension guidelines.</description>
