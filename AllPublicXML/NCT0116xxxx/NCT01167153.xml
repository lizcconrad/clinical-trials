    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) at the Study End Point (12 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sitting blood pressure was trough value (23-26 hours after drug administration) measured by sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure was measured on both arms and the arm with higher mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) was used at visit 1 and following visits. Measurement of blood pressure was carried out 3 times at each visit on the selected arm. The results and mean value of three sitting blood pressures were recorded for analysis.</description>

    <description>Effective SBP control rate was defined as proportion of subjects in whom MSSBP &lt; 140 mmHg or MSSBP reduction ≥ 20 mmHg from baseline.
Effective DBP control rate was defined as proportion of subjects in whom MSDBP &lt; 90 mmHg or MSDBP reduction ≥10 mmHg from baseline.</description>

        <description>The sitting blood pressure was trough value (23-26 hours after drug administration) measured by sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure was measured on both arms and the arm with higher mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) was used at visit 1 and following visits. Measurement of blood pressure was carried out 3 times at each visit on the selected arm. The results and mean value of three sitting blood pressures were recorded for analysis.</description>
