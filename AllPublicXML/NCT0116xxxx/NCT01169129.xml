  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in good general condition with resectable brain metastases, looks better with more
      intense treatment of metastases. This local treatment has been accomplished with surgery or
      radiosurgery. However, there are no randomized studies comparing these two types of
      treatment. The purpose of this study is to make this.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in good general condition with resectable 1-3 brain metastases will be randomized to
      surgery and whole brain radiotherapy and whole brain radiotherapy and radiosurgery. Initially
      we will evaluate the feasibility of carrying out the study with 15 patients in each arm, and
      after, we will follow with the primary end-point of comparing the toxicity of the exclusively
      radiotherapy arm with complications of the surgical arm. As a secondary end-point, we will
      evaluate local recurrence-free survival, overall survival, distance cerebral relapse-free
      survival (metachronous brain metastasis), free of neurological progression survival, free of
      neurological death survival, free of dependent life (another person)survival , steroid-free
      survival and quality of life.
