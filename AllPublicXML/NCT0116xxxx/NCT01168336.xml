    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of extended release and standard
      formulations of betahistine when administered as monotherapy and as compared to their safety
      and pharmacokinetics when co-administered with olanzapine and to determine potential dose
      limiting toxicities and/or drug-drug interactions affecting the pharmacokinetics or safety of
      either medication, with particular emphasis on somnolence and weight gain secondary to
      olanzapine treatment
