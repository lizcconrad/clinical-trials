  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory condition affecting elderly people and
      involving the girdles. The mainstay of treatment is oral glucocorticoids (GC), with the
      recent BSR-BHPR guidelines suggesting an initial prednisone dose comprised between 15 and 20
      mg as appropriate. However, probably because of the dramatic response of PMR to GC,
      randomized controlled trials of treatment are lacking. As a result, there is no evidence from
      controlled studies on the efficacy of different initial doses or drug tapering. Objective of
      the study: to test if 12.5 mg prednisone/day is an adequate starting dose in polymyalgia
      rheumatica (PMR) and to evaluate clinical predictors of drug response.

      Methods: 60 consecutive PMR patients will be treated with a starting dose of 12,5 mg/day
      prednisone. Clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic features will be recorded as possible
      predictors of response to prednisone. Remission is defined as disappearance of at least 75%
      of the signs and symptoms of PMR and normalization of ESR and CRP within the first month, a
      scenario allowing steroid tapering.
