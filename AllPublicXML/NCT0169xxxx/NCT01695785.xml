  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known regarding the relationship between perceived and physiological exertion in
      adolescents. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between
      physiological and perceptual markers of effort during exercise and the relationship of these
      markers to other health-related behaviors in healthy weight and obese adolescents.

    <description>Physiological responses to submaximal and maximal treadmill exercise will be assessed during the exercise test and immediately upon completion of the exercise test. The submaximal treadmill exercise will take place at visit 1 and the maximal treadmill exercise test will take place at the 2nd and final visit which will occur 7-10 days from the 1st visit. There is no intervention between visits.</description>
