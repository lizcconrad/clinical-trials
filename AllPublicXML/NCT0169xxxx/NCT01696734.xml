  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if domperidone can help to control
      chronic GI disorders. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Domperidone is designed to stimulate contraction of the stomach to increase its ability to
      empty itself of the food.

      This is an investigational study. Domperidone is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 200 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take domperidone tablets
      with water about 30 minutes before a meal. You may be asked to take the tablets before bed.

      During the study, the doctor may increase the amount of study drug you are taking.

      You will need to record when you take the study drug in a study drug diary. This diary will
      be reviewed at clinic visits.

      Study Procedures:

      Starting 8 weeks after your first dose of the study drug, you will have a study visit every 2
      months for the first year of taking the study drug, and every 6 months after that. During
      these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have an EKG at 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months in the first year and every 6
           months from then on. If the doctor thinks it is needed, this EKG will be repeated. You
           can have the EKG at your regular doctor.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.

        -  You will complete the 2 questionnaires about your GI symptoms

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at 2 months, 6 months, and
           12 months in the first year and then at every follow-up visits from then on. If the
           doctor thinks it is needed, this blood test will be repeated. You can have this blood
           drawn by your regular doctor.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue to take the study drug for as long as you are benefitting. You will no
      longer be able to take the study drug if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable
      to follow study directions.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      If you are taken off study due to results of an EKG, you will be referred to the cardiology
      department for tests.

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom control is defined as a 25% reduction in Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score compared to baseline. For discrete or categorical factors, descriptive statistics include tabulations of frequencies. For continuous data, summary statistics including n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum are computed. Bayesian 95% credible intervals for response rates and extreme toxicity rates are computed. Patient adverse events are tabulated by symptom, grade, and relationship to study drug. All outcome endpoints are examined by patient baseline characteristics such as gender, age, race/ethnicity, symptom manifestations, diagnosis subtype, and prior therapies.</description>

    <description>Domperidone 10 mg 3 times a day at the onset of the study. The physician's decision to increase the dosage will be based on patient self-assessment of symptoms. The maximum dosage used in this study will be 80 mg per day (20 mg 4 times a day), and the minimum dosage will be 30 mg per day (10 mg 3 times a day). Questionnaire completion at baseline, 8 weeks after drug, 6 months, then every 6 months. At 2 weeks and 4 weeks(± 3 days) of treatment, the physician will contact the patient via telephone to assess whether or not a dosage increase is warranted.</description>
