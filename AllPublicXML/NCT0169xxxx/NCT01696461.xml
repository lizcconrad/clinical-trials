    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, two strata, multicenter, prospective study of
      plerixafor-mobilized HLA-identical sibling allografts in recipients with hematological
      malignancies. This study will establish the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous plerixafor
      for this purpose.

    <description>To determine the proportion of donors whose cells can be successfully mobilized and collected with a sufficient CD34+ cell dose using plerixafor as the mobilizing agent, using an intention-to-treat analysis. Donor mobilization following plerixafor will be considered successful if â‰¥ 2.0x106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight are collected in no more than two leukapheresis collections. All donors receiving plerixafor will be included in the analysis of the primary objective based on the intention-to-treat principle.</description>
