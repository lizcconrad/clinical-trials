  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research trial to evaluate the efficacy of delivering exercise therapy for
      knee pain via the Internet utilizing an algorithm designed to adjust a home exercise program
      based on user input. The investigators hypothesize that exercise therapy can be delivered
      safely and effectively with increased participant satisfaction compared to the current
      standard.

    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The screening questionnaires will be evaluated for their safety and efficacy. This will be evaluated by having followup at the 3, 6 and 12 week marks and asking if the participant had any adverse event either via phone calls or survey questionnaire.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive a PDF sheet of 6 exercises that are commonly administered for the treatment of anterior knee pain. They will be asked to perform the exercises three times a week for 6 weeks. A questionnaire will be administered at the three, six and twelve week mark to evaluate efficacy, compliance and safety.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive the same six exercises as provided in the PDF sheet in arm 1 in a video format. They will be asked to perform the exercises three times per week for 6 weeks.
A questionnaire will be administered at the three, six and twelve week mark to evaluate efficacy, compliance and safety.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will be provided a 6 week regimen of exercise videos for their anterior knee pain. Following each exercise session, the participant will be asked for their input concerning each exercise. The algorithm will adjust the exercise regimen for the next session based on the participants input. A questionnaire will be administered at the three, six and twelve week mark to evaluate efficacy, compliance and safety.</description>
