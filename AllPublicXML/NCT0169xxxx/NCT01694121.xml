    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the MEN Count intervention, an
      HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model
      integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case
      management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day
      period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an
      NIH R21, in Boston, MA. A more larger scale, two-armed quasi-experimental controlled trial
      design will be used to test MEN Count among Black men recruited/enrolled from an STD clinic
      and other community-recruitment methods in Washington, DC. Study participants (N=504) will be
      Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex with a woman and 2+ female sex
      partners in the past 6 months] and either current unemployment or homeless in the past 6
      months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN Count, a two-armed quasi-experimental design
      will be conducted in which participants will receive either MEN Count or an attention
      comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure. We will assess program impact on
      reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia,
      gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing, respectively, at baseline and 6 and 12 month
      follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and process evaluation efforts will be conducted
      to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery, as well as to support program
      replication should the model prove effective.
