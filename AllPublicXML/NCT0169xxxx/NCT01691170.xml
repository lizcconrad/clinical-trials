  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is defined as a painful complaint in the anterior
      aspect of the knee, although peripatellar pain and / or retropatellar are also common. In
      general, conservative treatment is the initial option of choice for patients with PFPS,
      however, the lack of a specific causal factor makes it difficult to choose the best treatment
      so early. This way, the purpose of this study is investigate the effects of the quadriceps
      femoris strengthening versus hamstring stretching in patients with pattellofemoral pain.
