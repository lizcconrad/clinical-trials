    <textblock>
      Treatment of cancer, and more particularly of haematological malignancies, partly relies on
      chemotherapy. Most therapeutic regimens display various toxicities, one of the most common
      being haematological toxicity, affecting the three lineages. While anaemia and thrombopenia
      can be overcome by haematological growth factors and transfusion, one of the most severe
      life-threatening toxicity is sepsis that develops during neutropenia. Neutropenia, despite
      the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) and antibiotics, is still a major
      limitation in chemotherapy which is responsible for the majority of treatment-related
      morbidity and mortality and for prolonged hospitalisation.

      In neutropenic patients, sepsis is more frequent and more severe than in non-neutropenic
      patients. While the occurence of neutropenia and sepsis is often unpredictable and thus
      difficult to study in a prospective way, stem cell transplantation represents a quite
      convenient model to study such a question. Autologous stem cell transplantation indications
      in haematology are mainly multiple myeloma and relapsed lymphoma or Hodgkin disease. Briefly,
      after a mobilization procedure, a graft of patient's hematopoietic stem cells is collected by
      cytapheresis and frozen. When the patient has reached complete remission by conventional
      chemotherapy, he benefits from a very high dose myeloablative chemotherapy (called
      &quot;conditioning regimen&quot;). The &quot;conditioning regimen&quot; targeted to have high antitumoral
      activity leads to a &quot;cytokine storm&quot; resulting in a &quot;programmed inflammation&quot;. 36 hours after
      the lasting of the conditioning regimen, the CD34+ cells are thawed and infused to the
      patient. Thus neutropenia usually begins at D4 post transplantation and lasts for 10 days,
      until graft becomes &quot;functional&quot;. Thus, the timing and duration of neutropenia are very
      homogeneous. During neutropenia, fever and sepsis are very frequent (&gt;80% patients), thus,
      most patient will be informative regarding sepsis, and there is an easy possibility of
      biological sampling before&quot; programmed inflammation&quot; (due to conditioning regimen), after
      inflammation before sepsis, then during and after the sepsis. Since the patient is
      hospitalized, the kinetic monitoring is quite easy
