      Intestinal acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication after
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Non-invasive diagnostic procedures are still
      lacking and diagnosis is difficult. We hypothesized that contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      sonography (CEUS) could detect microcirculation changes of the bowel walls during intestinal
      GVHD and help to detect and monitor treatment response. We employed CEUS to prospectively
      evaluate intestinal GVHD in 83 consecutive transplant patients between 2008 and 2011.
      Fourteen /83 patients with biopsy-proven intestinal GVHD were selected as study group.
      Fourteen patients with biopsy-proven stomach GVHD without intestinal symptoms (N=16), normal
      volunteers (N=6) and patients with neutropenic enterocolitis (N=4), were chosen as control
      group. All patients were evaluated with both standard transabdominal ultrasonography (US) and
      CEUS at the onset of intestinal symptoms, during clinical follow up and at flare of symptoms.
      Standard US revealed non-specific bowel wall thickening, and simultaneous involvement of
      multiple intestinal segments in 9/14 patients. CEUS showed three distinct patterns of
      microcirculation changes that correlated with GVHD activity. These findings were not observed
      in the control group. Moreover, CEUS findings correlated with treatment response and
      predicted flare of intestinal symptoms. CEUS is a non-invasive, easily reproducible bed-side
      tool to detect and monitor intestinal GVHD.
