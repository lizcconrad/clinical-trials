  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan a prospective randomized controlled study that compares the treatment
      decisions made by patients who receive decision aids, as compared to patients treated with
      usual care and the American Society for Surgery of the Hand brochures. The investigators
      expect to enroll 126 patients.

      Decision aids are tools that help patients participate in making decisions by providing
      detailed, specific, and personalized information regarding the benefits and risks of various
      potential treatment options for a diagnosis. Decision aids can reduce the level of
      uncertainty and mental anguish associated with choosing a particular course of action, i.e.
      'decisional conflict'. The most common manifestations of decisional conflict include
      verbalized uncertainty about choices or undesired consequences of alternatives, vacillation
      between choices, and delayed decision making.

      Besides the advantages of decision aids in the process of decision-making, the literature is
      not conclusive about the effect of decision aids on patient satisfaction. Of the 86
      randomized controlled trials identified by authors Stacey et al., eleven studies measured
      satisfaction. Of these, four studies reported that people exposed to decision aids had higher
      satisfaction with their choice compared to usual care, and the remaining seven reported no
      statistically significant difference.

      Studies that have directly investigated the effect of decision aids in orthopaedic practice
      are limited and further study is necessary to determine the best way to implement decision
      aids in a clinical orthopedic practice. 7-12 Randomized trials evaluating the impact of
      decision aids on patient knowledge, decisional conflict, satisfaction, and outcomes may have
      substantial impact in hand surgery where most treatments are elective and address quality of
      life.

    <description>Cohort I will be managed with a decision aid (henceforth &quot;DA&quot;), and Cohort II will be managed without one. The patients in Cohort I will receive the DA, which they can complete in a separate room and take home. The decision aids include information on the disease/condition, treatment options, benefits, risks, scientific uncertainties, and probabilities of potential outcomes tailored to the patient's health risks factors. Additionally, it includes values clarifications such as describing outcomes in functional terms, asking patients to consider which benefits and risks matter most to them, and guidance in the steps of decision making and discussing their decision with family/friends. It is interactive and dynamic, helping patients clarify their preferences and come to a decision that feels best to them.</description>
