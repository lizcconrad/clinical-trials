    <textblock>
      To conduct a precision study to assess the microperimetry function of the Spectral OCT/SLO.
      The study will assess variability across measurements taken by three different
      operator-device configuration across clinical sites, variability between subjects within a
      given operator-device configuration, and variability within a subject for a single
      operator-device configuration.

    <measure>Standard Deviation and Mean Test Results of Normal and With Pathology Participants Taken by 3 Different Operator-device Configurations</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>A precision study was conducted that used 3 devices (each with a different operator). Each device was used to measure 4 normal subjects and 4 subjects with relevant eye pathology, with a total of 24 subject eyes (12 normal, 12 with pathology) measured across all three devices. For each subject, one eye was evaluated using 3 tests with repositioning at the start of each test. Test results were given in decibels which is the unit used in microperimetry testing. Overall mean and standard deviation in decibels were calculated for the two groups: normal and with pathology.</description>

Each device was used to measure 4 normal subjects and 4 subjects with relevant eye pathology, with a total of 24 subject eyes (12 normal, 12 with pathology) measured across all three devices.

        Twenty-four subjects, 12 without retinal disease (Cohort 1) and 12 with retinal disease
        (Cohort 2) will be recruited. Any subjects that do not comply with or complete the study
        protocol will be replaced to ensure that a total of 24 subjects complete the protocol.
        Subjects will be screened and recruited based on the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria outlined
        within this protocol. Subjects fulfilling the stated criteria and who are willing to comply
        must sign an informed consent prior form to study participation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be 21 years of age or older.

          -  Subjects recruited to Cohort 1 will have no known retinal disease except for
             refractive errors (-7.5 D to +7.5 diopters).Subjects who are recruited to Cohort 2
             will have one or more of the following retinal pathologies: early and intermediate
             Age-Related Macular Degeneration, Geographic Atrophy, Diabetic Retinopathy (mild,
             moderate, severe), Macular Edema secondary to Diabetes, Retinal Vein Occlusion,
             Central Serous Retinopathy, Pattern Dystrophy, Epiretinal Membrane or Macular Hole.

          -  Subjects who have signed an informed consent form.

          -  Subjects who can comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects younger than 21 years of age.

          -  Subjects who cannot comply with the protocol.

          -  Subjects who cannot complete the Simple Test procedures

          -  Subjects who are not available to be testing 3 times during the day (Morning, Mid -
             Day, and Afternoon).

          -  Subjects with visual acuity worse than 20/100 (Best Corrected).

          -  Subjects with dense media opacities.

          -  Ocular surgery anticipated on the day of the study visit.

        <title>Repeatability of Microperimetry Tests in Normal and With Pathology Participants Based on 3 Microperimetry Tests Taken for Each Participant for a Given Operator-device Combination.</title>
        <description>A precision study was conducted that used 3 devices (each with a different operator). Each device was used to measure 4 normal subjects and 4 subjects with relevant eye pathology, with a total of 24 subject eyes (12 normal, 12 with pathology) measured across all three devices. Test results were given in decibels as that is the standard measurement in microperimetry testing. For each subject, one eye was evaluated using 3 microperimetry tests with repositioning at the start of each test. Overall Repeatability SD and Repeatability SD Limit were calculated for the two groups: normal and with pathology.</description>
