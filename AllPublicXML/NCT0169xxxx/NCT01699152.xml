               5. Fevers &gt;100.5º F or night sweats for more than 2 weeks without evidence of
                  infection.

               6. Progressive lymphocytosis, with an increase exceeding 50% over a 2 month period
                  or a doubling time of less than 6 months.

               7. Need for cytoreduction prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          -  Patients must have relapsed or refractory disease after ≥1 prior line of treatment.

          -  The interval from prior treatment to time of study drug administration should be at
             least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic and noncytotoxic agents.

          -  Low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone &lt;20 mg/ day or equivalent dose) are permitted
             throughout study.

          -  Clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must be resolved to Grade ≤
             1.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2.

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,000/μL in absence of bone marrow involvement

               -  platelets ≥30,000/μL in absence of bone marrow involvement

               -  If patient has extensive bone marrow involvement, minimum ANC and platelet levels
                  are not required.

               -  total bilirubin ≤1.5 X institutional ULN unless due to Gilbert's syndrome,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events (CTCAE Grade &gt; 1) due to agents administered more than 3
             weeks earlier.

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with a CDK inhibitor within 12 months of
             study enrollment.

          -  High-dose corticosteroids (prednisone ≥20mg/day or equivalent dose) must be
             discontinued ≥ 7 days of initiating therapy.

          -  Patients with known central nervous system involvement.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition as TG02 citrate.

          -  Patients with G6PD deficiency.

          -  Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (including but not limited to
             history of ventricular arrhythmia or symptomatic conduction abnormality within 12
