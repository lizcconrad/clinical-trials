  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the acute and chronic [4-week] effects of a
      high-DHA fish oil supplement on fasting and post-prandial (post-meal) biomarkers of
      cardiovascular disease risk, in adults on Statin therapy.

      This study involves fasted and post-prandial components.

      Fasted Study:

      Participants will provide fasting blood samples pre-and post-intervention [4-week
      administration of supplement or placebo] in Treatment Period I. Participants will again
      provide fasting blood samples pre-and post-intervention [4-week administration of supplement
      or placebo, opposite to Treatment Period I] during Treatment Period II.

      There will be a 4-week washout period during the two Treatment Periods.

      Post-prandial study:

      Participants will also complete a post-prandial study pre-and post-intervention during each
      Treatment Period.

    <description>On Day 1 &amp; Day 29, the researcher will obtain anthropometric measurements as specified in the study protocol. A venous catheter will be inserted and a fasted blood sample will be drawn, which will be analyzed for study primary and secondary endpoints. Participants will consume a Breakfast Meal (which will represent t0) and will have blood drawn at a total of 7 time points. Blood samples drawn at30, t60, t120, and t180 will be analyzed for glucose and insulin; blood samples drawn at t60, t120, t180, t240, t300 and t360 will be analyzed for triglycerides. Upon completion of the 6 hour blood draw period, the venous catheter will be removed.
On Day 15, the researcher will obtain anthropometric measurements as specified in the study protocol.</description>
