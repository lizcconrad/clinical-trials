  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about differences of the quality of life in
      patients undergoing Roux-En-Y pouch reconstruction and conventional Roux-En-Y reconstruction.
      To find a better reconstruction for patients who received total gastrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total gastrectomy has been indicated mainly for advanced gastric cancer located from the
      upper to middle third of the stomach or multiple gastric cancers.The most common method of
      creating a way for food is called a &quot;Roux-en-Y&quot;, in which one part of the intestines is
      connected with the end of the esophagus (the swallowing tube) in the abdomen, and another
      connection is made between the intestines ' lower down.

      Patients with total gastrectomy suffer from poor food intake, anemia, and poor digestion
      because of loss of gastric reservoir or a lack of normal hormonal secretion for digestion. It
      often is associated with a limitation of postoperative quality of life (QOL). To improve
      postoperative nutritional status and QOL, surgeons have tried to establish ideal
      reconstruction after total gastrectomy and the optimum procedure for reconstruction has been
      discussed.

      This study will compare the postoperative quality of life (QOL) of gastric pouch
      reconstruction with the usual reconstruction to see if the pouch makes patients feel better.
