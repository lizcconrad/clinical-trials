      A double-blind, multicentre, stratified by centre, randomised, parallel study with two groups
      of adult patients operated on for Crohn's disease, to determine if oral ingestion of
      probiotics could prevent the appearance of Crohn's disease recurrent endoscopic ileo-colonic
      lesions 12 months after surgery. Patients will consume 900 mg/day of active product (N=56) or
      control product (N=56) during one year.
