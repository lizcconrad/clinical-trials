    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single centre, parallel group study to evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of retigabine XR formulation in healthy adult Japanese
      subjects. To compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profile, Caucasian subjects are also
      incorporated. This study is intended to facilitate inclusion of Japanese patients in the
      global phase III program for retigabine XR formulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subject between 20 and 45 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed separately. This criterion must be followed from the
             time of the first dose of study medication until 1 week post-last dose

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Single QTcB or QTcF&lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has made a suicide attempt in the past or, in the investigator's judgment,
             poses a significant suicide risk. Evidence of serious suicide risk may include any
             history of suicidal behavior in the past 6 months and/or any suicidal ideation of type
             4 or 5 on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody or HIV
             antigen/antibody result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including
             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
