    <textblock>
      This prospective observational cohort study aims at studying functional and clinical outcomes
      of patients (N = 329) admitted to 4 geriatric hospital facilities of the St John of God Order
      in Northern Italy during an index period of 4 months. Other areas assessed include variables
      that help or hinder the discharge of patients with sufficient residential autonomy and the
      predictive ability of clinicians compared with the evaluation of selective indicators of
      outcome (clinical and instrumental).

      Patients are followed from the first day of hospitalization until discharge or up to 3 months
      and 1 day after the date of admission (&quot;long-term care&quot; patients).

      At admission a &quot;Patient Form&quot; including social, demographic and clinical informations and a
      series of standardized assessment tools is completed with the help of clinicians, nurses and
      caregivers (when available).

      For each patient, during hospitalization, an analysis of apolipoprotein ApoE polymorphisms is
      performed and adverse events occurred during hospitalization are monitored, as well as the
      predictive abilities of clinicians and any recent CT and MRI. Patients are reassessed at
      discharge (or after 3 months for &quot;long-term care&quot; patients) and at 6 months follow-up of with
      a standardized telephone interview to assess clinical and functional status and possible
      changes in the residential status of the patient.
