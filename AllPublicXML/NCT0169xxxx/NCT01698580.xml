    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial
      falls prevention program in reducing the rate of falls.

      A multifactorial falls prevention program consisting of an individualized medical management
      of the modifiable risk factors, a progressive on-site body balance exercise plus a home-based
      exercise program, an educational/behavioral intervention and a fall prevention booklet will
      reduce the number of falls and fall rates when compared with usual care.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter parallel-group randomized trial among community-dwelling men and
      women aged 60 years and over, who have fallen at least once in the previous year.
      Participants will be recruited in multiple settings in Sao Paulo - Brazil and will be
      randomly allocated to a control group or an intervention group.

    <description>The control group will receive a baseline assessment to identify risk factors for falls and will be referred to their clinicians with a report of individual modifiable risk factors to be managed without any specific guidance: referral to routine services, treatments or any specific orientation will be at the discretion of their primary clinicians. So, further management of each participant in the control group will be individualized, with no specific protocol. Interventions will be recorded. Participants will receive a leaflet with basic orientations for fall prevention.</description>

    <description>The program will consist of progressive balance, including postural orientation and anticipatory postural adjustments sensory-motor activities, and strengthening exercises to enhance balance and postural control and reduce falls. Exercises in the standing position will be prioritised in order to target balance control.Exercises will be both static and dynamic, and will get progressively more challenging, in order to reach the individual optimal level of balance and strength functional status.</description>

    <description>Participants will be provided with a detailed booklet containing safety precautions, instructions and photographs of exercises for use in exercise sessions at home and will be instructed to do the exercises preferably under the supervision of a relative or caregiver, in a suitable place (with good lighting and ventilation) and using proper support (close to a table or chair, or the corner of a wall). In the first four weeks of intervention the patients will stay for 30 minutes after the therapy sessions in order to learn the home exercises. The exercises will be reviewed, if necessary, after each session till the last week of intervention. All necessary equipment to undertake the exercise program will be provided.</description>

Participants will be encourage to report their own experiences and beliefs. The activity will always end with the reinforcement of the core message of the session.</description>
