  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary infection is the most common and serious complication in the evolutionary
      course of cystic fibrosis (CF). Administration of antibiotics adapted to infecting pathogens
      is one of the key issues for its management. However, more than half of patients with CF have
      chronic respiratory infections for which infectious agent remains unknown leading to
      empirical antibiotic therapies that are not adapted to the causative agents. Recently, new
      technologies have been applied for the description and characterization of microbial agents
      in CF patients including molecular biology techniques that allowed us to detect and to
      identify new and/or emerging pathogens. Moreover, more sophisticated molecular techniques
      such as pyrosequencing and PCR amplification and cloning lead us to demonstrate the huge
      microbial diversity associated with chronic bronchopulmonary infections in this population.
      Otherwise, a metagenomic approach revealed the extraordinary complexity of the respiratory
      flora in these patients and, somewhat unexpected, abundance of anaerobes, viruses, and
      bacteriophages. In addition, it has been shown that some antibiotics commonly used in
      clinical practice for the treatment of respiratory infections were able to induce these
      bacteriophages, suggesting the existence of lateral gene transfer by transduction. The human
      microbiome is the set of microbial communities associated with the human body and represents
      all living microorganisms in the body. Its role in the immunity development has recently been
      demonstrated suggesting that changes in this ecosystem play a critical role in evolution of
      several human diseases. For example, in obesity it has been shown that there is a
      relationship between the intestinal human microbiota and nutritional and metabolic status of
      the hosts and specific alterations of these intestinal microbiota may represent a metagenomic
      signature of this disease. Evolution of the respiratory microbiota in patients with cystic
      fibrosis, whose nutritional status is often impaired (chronic malnutrition due to disorder of
      digestive absorption) and receiving regular antibiotic treatments remains unknown to date.
      Characterization of this ecosystem and its role is a critical step to understand the
      evolutionary course of the disease.

      The main objective of this seminal study is to describe and to characterize the respiratory
      microbiota from sputum samples obtained from a limited number of selected patients with CF
      from 5 regional care centers (CRCM) from South of France (Mucomed network) (2 patients per
      center : 6 adults and 4 children), with similar clinical, microbiological and functional
      status before and after a cure of antibiotics. Different microbiological tools will be used
      including axenic culture systems, co-culture on amoebae in order to to isolate and to
      identify the microbial communities. Identification of bacteria will be done using MALDI-TOF
      mass spectrometry and/or molecular techniques. Moreover, 16S rRNA PCR amplification followed
      by cloning and sequencing of PCR products from the same sputum sample will be carried out to
      identify and to compare the bacterial species identified using molecular methods. In a second
      step, once the respiratory microbiota was characterized, it will be interesting to develop a
      dedicated microarray that will allow to detect all the bacteria identified in the first stage
      of the project and to assess its relevance on a larger cohort of patients with CF by studying
      the correlation between the respiratory microbiota and clinical status of patients according
      to the prescribed antibiotic treatments.

      This study will open new clinical perspectives and will help us to determine the potential
      role of antibiotics on the microbiota evolution during treatment according to regional health
      care practices. This will contribute to better understand the role of the microbiota in the
      evolution of these chronic respiratory infections. It could be the first step for innovative
      therapeutic strategies, taking into account the balance of complex microbial flora and
      possibly evolving according to antibiotic therapies. It could also form part of a larger
      preventive strategy against transmission of specific pathogens in CF.
