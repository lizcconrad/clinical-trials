      The main objectives were: 1) To determine the efficacy of both cevimeline and pilocarpine in
      the secretion of saliva in patients with xerostomia, and 2) To compare the side-effects
      between the treatment for xerostomia with cevimeline and with pilocarpine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist with predominant muscarinic action.As such, it acts at
      muscarinic-cholinergic receptors found throughout the body and promotes fluid secretion. Due
      to this, one of the main side-effects of pilocarpine is an increased amount of sweating.
      Thus, not only are the salivary glands stimulated, but all of the body's exocrine glands'
      production is heightened. On the other hand, cevimeline is a drug with a high affinity for
      specific muscarinic receptors (M3) located on lachrymal and salivary gland epithelium. At
      least in theory, cevimeline will produce less side effects compared with pilocarpine because
      of the higher affinity for the muscarinic receptors located in the salivary glands. A limited
      number of human clinical trials in the efficacy of cevimeline and pilocarpine to increase the
      production of saliva and the side effects have been performed with no conclusive results.

      The main purposes of this study were to determine the efficacy of cevimeline and pilocarpine
      in the secretion of saliva in patients with xerostomia, and to compare the side-effects
      between these two medications.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the change of stimulated and non-stimulated saliva in ml from the baseline record.
At each appointment (weekly), participants will provide 2 saliva samples to measure their current salivary output. The first measurement will be obtained by having the patient spit as much as he or she could into a cup for five minutes. The amount of saliva in ml will be recorded.
The second measurement will be obtained in a similar manner with the addition of having the patient chew on a block of unflavored wax. Patients will complete weekly questionnaires to help determine which side-effects they experience as they take the medications.</description>

Each sequence was evaluated for 4 weeks with one week &quot;washout&quot; period in between both sequences. 15 patients were randomly assigned to a specific sequence by a research pharmacist independent from the study authors. The patients received 30mg of cevimeline three times a day and pilocarpine 5mg three times a day.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Potential candidates with the diagnosis of moderate-severe xerostomia were identified from
        the Oral Medicine Clinic at the University Of Kentucky College Of Dentistry, or self
        referrals in response to IRB approved study announcements. Enrollment required no clinical
        evidence of oral lesions, subjective perception of dry mouth and less than 2 mL of saliva
        collected in 5 minutes without stimulation. Exclusion criteria included patients with non
        controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, asthma, cardiac
        arrhythmias, glaucoma, and the current use of any medication with interactions with
        cevimeline and pilocarpine.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Saliva Production in ml.</title>
          <description>The primary outcome measure was the change of stimulated and non-stimulated saliva in ml from the baseline record.
At each appointment (weekly), participants will provide 2 saliva samples to measure their current salivary output. The first measurement will be obtained by having the patient spit as much as he or she could into a cup for five minutes. The amount of saliva in ml will be recorded.
The second measurement will be obtained in a similar manner with the addition of having the patient chew on a block of unflavored wax. Patients will complete weekly questionnaires to help determine which side-effects they experience as they take the medications.</description>
