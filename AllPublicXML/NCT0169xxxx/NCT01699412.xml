  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing
      the topical treatment with clobetasol or dexamethasone for symptomatic oral lesions of
      chronic graft-versus-host disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with symptomatic oral lesions of cGVHD were included in the study. Exclusion
      criteria were patients with 12 years or less of age, history of allergy to any of the studied
      medications and patients already under other topical treatment for oral lesions of cGVHD.
      Patients were randomly assigned between two study groups: one group rinsed with a solution of
      clobetasol propionate 0.05% associated to nystatin 100,000 UI/mL; and another group rinsed
      with a solution of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/ml associated to nystatin 100,000 UI/mL. Patients
      were instructed to use the solution 3 times a day, during 1 minute, for 28 days. Clinical
      exams were performed at baseline and after 28 days. Patients were evaluated by an oral
      medicine expert, previously calibrated for evaluation of oral cGVHD lesions. Oral lesions of
      cGVHD were diagnosed according to NIH 2005 criteria, and graded according to the modified
      oral mucositis rating scale. Evaluation of the symptoms of the oral mucosa and of xerostomia
      were performed through visual analogue scale. Samples for fungal culture were obtained before
      and after the topical treatment. Results were submitted to a descriptive analysis. Chi-square
      was used for the comparison of categorical variables. Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were
      used for the comparison of measurable data inter and intra-groups, respectively. Significance
      level was set at 5%.
