  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial will examine whether genetically reprogramming a patient's disease
      fighting white blood cells may build an immune response to kill cancer cells that express the
      NY-ESO-1 protein. In this study, this genetic therapy will be given during a stem cell
      transplant along with a vaccine therapy. The vaccine will be made using the NY-ESO-1 protein
      and may help to stimulate the engineered immune response to tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether we can safely administer NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor transduced
      autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (up to 1x10^9 cells) along with an
      NY-ESO-1 dendritic cell vaccine and low dose IL-2 to patients with advanced malignancies.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of delivering two patient-specific cell therapies, the
      NY-ESO-1 TCR transgenic peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and NY-ESO-1 (157-165)
      peptide pulsed dendritic cells (DC), within a technically challenging study design that
      requires other significant interventions, like a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen and
      post-infusion of subcutaneous low dose interleukin (IL)-2 (aldesleukin).

      III. To determine the rate of objective tumor responses, by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) objective response criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the persistence of NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered cells. This will be determined by
      temporally analyzing peripheral blood samples for the presence of T cells with the transduced
      NY-ESO-1 TCR by tetramer or dextramer analysis.

      II. To explore the homing and persistence of the adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1
      TCR-engineered PBMC in secondary lymphoid organs and tumor deposits via positron emission
      tomography (PET)-based imaging using the PET tracer fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG).

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -5 to
      -4 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients receive NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced autologous PBMC IV on day 0. Patients
      also receive NY-ESO-1 (157-165) peptide pulsed dendritic cell vaccine therapy intradermally
      (ID) on days 1, 14, and 30 and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-14. Patients may receive 3 additional doses of NY-ESO-1 (157-165) peptide pulsed dendritic
      cell vaccine therapy after day 90.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 45, 60, and 75 days;
      every 3 months for 2 years; every 6 months for 3 years; and annually thereafter.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Previously known hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study.

          -  Received systemic treatment for cancer, including immunotherapy, within one month
             prior to initiation of dosing within this protocol. However, cell harvesting by
             leukapheresis may be performed before one month from prior therapy if the study
             investigators consider that it will not have a detrimental impact on the generation of
             the two cell therapies in this protocol.

          -  History of, or significant evidence of risk for, chronic inflammatory or autoimmune
             disease (eg, Addison's disease, multiple sclerosis, Graves disease, Hashimoto's
             thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             lupus erythematosus, hypophysitis, pituitary disorders, etc.). Patients will be
             eligible if prior autoimmune disease is not deemed to be active (e.x. fibrotic damage
             of the thyroid after thyroiditis or its treatment, with stable thyroid hormone
             replacement therapy). Vitiligo will not be a basis for exclusion.

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other chronic
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea or bleeding, or current acute
             colitis of any origin.

          -  Potential requirement for systemic corticosteroids or concurrent immunosuppressive
             drugs based on prior history or received systemic steroids within the last 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment (inhaled or topical steroids at standard doses are allowed).

          -  HIV seropositivity or other congenital or acquired immune deficiency state, which
             would increase the risk of opportunistic infections and other complications during
             chemotherapy-induced lympho-depletion. If there is a positive result in the infectious
             disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their
             primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist.

          -  Hepatitis B or C seropositivity with evidence of ongoing liver damage, which would
             increase the likelihood of hepatic toxicities from the chemotherapy conditioning
             regimen and supportive treatments. If there is a positive result in the infectious
             disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their
             primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist.

          -  Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding
             or rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this
             protocol.

          -  Clinically active brain metastases. Radiological documentation of absence of active
             brain metastases at screening is required for all patients. Prior evidence of brain
             metastasis successfully treated with surgery or radiation therapy will not be
             exclusion for participation as long as they are deemed under control at the time of
             study enrollment.

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be
             postmenopausal for two years, or must agree to use effective contraception during the
             period of treatment and 6 months after. All female patients with reproductive
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) within 14 days from
             starting the conditioning chemotherapy. The definition of effective contraception will
             be based on the judgment of the study investigators.

          -  Since IL-2 is administered following cell infusion:

               1. Patients will be excluded if they have a history of clinically significant ECG
                  abnormalities, symptoms of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias and have a left
                  ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45% on a cardiac stress test (stress
                  thallium, stress MUGA, dobutamine echocardiogram, or other stress test)

               2. Similarly, patients who are 50 years old with a baseline LVEF &lt; 45% will be
                  excluded.

               3. Patients with ECG results of any conduction delays (PR interval &gt;200ms, QTC &gt;
                  480ms), sinus bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt;50 beats per minute), sinus
                  tachycardia (HR&gt;120 beats per minute) will be evaluated by a cardiologist prior
                  to starting the trial. Patients with any arrhythmias, including atrial
                  fibrillation/atrila flutter, excessive ectopy (defined as &gt;20 PVCs per minute),
                  ventricular tachycardia, 3rd degree heart block will be excluded from the study
                  unless cleared by a cardiologist.

               4. Patients with pulmonary function test abnormalities as evidenced by a FEV1/FVC&lt;
                  70% of predicted for normality will be excluded.

          -  Received 3 or more prior myelotoxic treatment regimens.
