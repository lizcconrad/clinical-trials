  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators intend to investigate analgesic and sensory effects of
      a capsaicin patch 8 %(Qutenza) in patients with severe post-herniotomy pain and sensory
      abnormalities in the skin.

    <time_frame>Pain intensity assessed at baseline and at 1,2,3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Summed pain intensity (SPI) is calculated as median pain intensities at rest, during transition from the supine lying to the standing erect position, and auto-palpation twice each day for the last 3 days at baseline and at 1 months, 2 months and 3 months during follow-up. The primary outcome measure is the maximum difference between the summed pain intensity differences (SPID) for the phases: Baseline, 1 month, 2 month or 3 month. Δ SPID is then calculated as the difference in SPID between capsaicin and placebo treated patients.</description>
