  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of prucalopride in the
      treatment of Filipino patients with chronic constipation whom prior laxatives fail to provide
      adequate relief.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week open label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      multi-center, prospective (the patients are identified and then followed forward in time for
      the outcome of the study) observational study assessing the safety and effectiveness of
      prucalopride among Filipino patients with chronic constipation. Chronic constipation is a
      condition in which bowel movements are infrequent or incomplete for a prolonged time. The use
      of prucalopride should be used in accordance with the approved product label and will follow
      the normal medical practice of the investigators. Patients should take 2 mg prucalopride
      tablet orally once daily. For elderly patients (&gt;65 years old), patients with renal
      impairment not requiring dialysis or patients with severe hepatic impairment, 1mg
      prucalopride once daily should be given. Patients will be asked to fill-up a patient diary
      daily for 12-weeks to monitor the bowel movement during the study period. All adverse events
      and concomitant medications taken by the patients during the study will be documented
      accordingly. Patients will be monitored during the 12-week period of observation while the
      patients are in prucalopride treatment.

    <description>The PAC-SYM questionnaire is a 12-item survey that measures constipation symptoms and associated severity across three domains: stool symptoms, rectal symptoms, and abdominal symptoms. Symptom items are rated on a 5-point Likert severity scale. Item values are scored from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating absence of symptom, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = very severe indicating the worst severity of that symptom.</description>
