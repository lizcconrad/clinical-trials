  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a culturally sensitive self-management (SM)
      intervention, compared to an education only control, will reduce all-cause hospital days in
      patients with mild to moderate heart failure and household income less than $30,000 per year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the CHART research study is to assess the value of a novel multi-level
      intervention for low-income patients recently hospitalized with heart failure relative to
      providing education alone (both strategies are described in detail in the Intervention
      section below). The investigators refer to their novel intervention strategy as 'Enhanced
      Training' and their education-only strategy the investigators refer to as 'Enhanced
      Education'. These two strategies of participant follow-up will be assessed and compared by
      analyzing patient's all-cause hospital days over a 2.5-year follow-up period (the
      investigators note that, for patients with heart failure, the average number of such
      all-cause hospital days over a 2.5-year period has tripled over the past 25 years). The
      Enhanced Training strategy aims to improve patient receipt of evidence-based therapy by: 1)
      activating patients using a culturally sensitive approach that might better resonate with the
      investigators predominantly urban, African-American and Hispanic, target population; 2)
      providing timely and useful information to the primary care provider; and 3) promoting
      effective communication between patients and their primary care provider. The Enhanced
      Education strategy is less intrusive and aims to provide patients and primary care providers
      with appropriate educational materials via mail. The primary aims of this research study are
      to determine if Enhanced Training and/or Enhanced Education will improve: patient adherence
      to drug therapy and salt restriction, health care provider adherence to evidence-based
      guidelines, and patient functional capacity and quality of life. Secondary aims will include
      assessing impact of the interventions on CRP and BNP, which are two key biomarkers of heart
      failure progression.

    <measure>EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with Time Trade-Off (TTO) Utility Score</measure>
    <time_frame>This is a questionnaire that is administered during participant assessments conducted at baseline and at 6 and 30 months following treatment assignment.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D self-report questionnaire consists of a 5-item health state assessment (rated as 1=none, 2=some, 3=severe), to produce an index score. Responses to the health state items can be converted to a time trade-off (TTO) utility score, where 1 represents perfect health and 0 represents death (negative utilities are possible, representing states worse than death). A visual analog scale (VAS) can be applied, scored from 0 to 100, where higher scores are better. EQ-5D index score can be used to produce health utilities and to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained or lost.</description>

    <description>PCP-Level: A PCP randomized to the Enhanced Training (ET) group will receive: 1) a full and pocket sized copy of the current AHA Heart Failure (HF) Guidelines; 2) a summary of their patient's data collected at baseline, 6-month, and 30-month in-person study visits; and 3) an invitation to complete the CHART-designed online course in HF management for CME credit.
Patient Level: The ET patient-level intervention uses Community Health Workers (CHWs) to assist the patient in learning self-management behaviors to reduce the risk of hospitalization. The key objectives are to: improve heart failure knowledge; encourage use of HF management tools; and facilitate development of self-management skills. Each participant receives at least: six AHA educational mailings, six monthly home visits, and 18 phone calls by CHWs within the first six months of the intervention. The CHW then conducts monthly telephone visits for the subsequent two years (for a total of 30 months of follow-up).</description>
