  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a lethal solid malignancy with 5 year
      survival estimates of approximately 50%, and is associated with a high rate of systemic
      immune impairment as well as evasion of a tumor specific immune response. Preclinical and
      clinical data have shown that PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil) can be used to augment immune
      function in HNSCC patients through inhibition of the cancer-induced myeloid derived
      suppressor cells (MDSCs).

      A multi site phase II, randomized, prospective, biomarker endpoint trial to determine optimum
      timing and design of PDE5 antitumor immunotherapy (tadalafil) in conjunction with
      conventional therapy for HNSCC.

      40 patients with biopsy proven HNSCC will be randomized to receive tadalafil (n=25) or
      placebo (n=15) for at least 10-14 days before starting conventional therapy and continuing
      until 90 days after completion of conventional therapy. Tumor-specific T cell responses will
      be assessed using HNSCC cell lines, in blood collected before initiation of tadalafil/placebo
      and at 60 and 90 days after completion of conventional therapy. Number and function of MDSC
      and Treg cells will be assessed before and at 60 and 90 days after completion of conventional
      therapy. Prevnar 13® vaccine will be administered 10-14 days after commencing
      tadalafil/placebo (before conventional therapy begins) and again at 60 days after completion
      of conventional therapy. Vaccine-specific responses assessed at 60 and 90 days
      post-conventional therapy will be used to measure the ability of tadalafil to augment immune
      response to vaccine.
