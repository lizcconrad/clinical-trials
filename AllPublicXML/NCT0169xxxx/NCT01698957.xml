      The purpose of this study is to detect if adding resistance to maternal blood flow from the
      arm will help increase the blood flow through the uterine arteries to the placenta and the
      baby.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the setting of uteroplacental insufficiency, there is little that can be done to increase
      blood flow through the uterus and placenta. Historically, women with growth restricted
      fetuses or oligohydramnios have been placed on bed rest. Unfortunately, this treatment
      modality has met with only limited success. Cardiologists have long recognized the simple act
      of making a fist or otherwise occluding blood flow through a limb dramatically increases a
      person's peripheral vascular resistance. If maternal peripheral resistance can be increased,
      perhaps the increased differential between the maternal peripheral vascular resistance and
      that of the uteroplacental unit will increase flow through the uterus and placenta.
