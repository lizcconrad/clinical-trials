    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled trial to test if offering three visits to a dietician + two visits to
      a physiotherapist over six months + a home sphygmomanometer, will result in a reduction in
      sodium intake and an increase in fitness in people over 75yrs. Volunteers were enrolled from
      Oct 2008 to July 2009.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that both sedentary lifestyle and high sodium diets contribute to
      cardiovascular disease and possibly dementia among the elderly. There is a need to show that
      minimal intervention can reduce sodium intake and increase fitness in the elderly. Finland
      has shown that five dietician visits/year could change diet in respect to fat and fibre. In
      Australia the National Health Insurer (Medicare) funds five allied health visits/year for
      those with chronic disease, hence our use of this model. This is consistent with WHO
      guidelines for a national approach using existing health infrastructure. The elderly
      (75-95yrs) were chosen as this group is thought most difficult to change behaviour and has a
      higher incidence of dementia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the change in morning urine sodium/potassium ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>between enrollment and six months</time_frame>
    <description>this measure is to reflect sodium intake. A 24hr urinary sodium cannot be readily validated as an accurate collection and even in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention study was changed to 8hrs to assist compliance. A spot morning ratio is a useful marker of sodium intake for group evaluation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the increased distance in a six minute walk test</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in systolic BP</measure>

    <description>teaching people to reduce sodium intake and increase fitness may reduce systolic blood pressure as a secondary outcome</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in doses/day of antihypertensive medication</measure>
    <time_frame>between enrollment and six months</time_frame>
    <description>teaching reduction in sodium and increased fitness may mean people need less antihypertensive medication as a secondary outcome</description>

    <measure>change in waist measurement</measure>

    <measure>change in weight &amp; BMI</measure>

    <description>Cognition measurements using the Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination, and the more comprehensive and sensitive Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination to compare those in the intervention group with the highest and lowest quartiles of reduction in sodium intake + increased fitness (equally weighted), as a secondary outcome of teaching these lifestyle changes.</description>
