  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility and potential efficacy of augmenting SRIs with
      minocycline. The study will assess whether the addition of minocycline leads to measurable
      changes in striatal glutamate (Glu) levels. This study will recruit up to 45 youth ages 8-20
      diagnosed with clinically significant OCD who have demonstrated no more than minimal response
      to SRI treatment and are currently on a stable dose of SRI medication for at least 12 weeks.
      Participants will be randomized to receive either 12 weeks of minocycline treatment or pill
      placebo. Randomization will be 2:1 so that 2 of 3 participants receive minocycline. Screening
      for eligibility will take place for 1-4 weeks. Participants will undergo MRS scans to measure
      striatal Glu levels prior to randomization, and again immediately following the treatment
      period. During the treatment period, participants will meet initially weekly and then every
      other week with the study psychiatrist. All participants will be offered three months of open
      medication treatment following participation. The clinical trial will only be conducted at
      NYSPI and the MRS scans may be conducted at Weill Cornell Medical Center or NYSPI.

    <description>The CYBOCS is a semi-structured measure of OCD severity with excellent inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. It is validated in those starting at age 7 and used in studies up to age 20. The CYBOCS differs from the adult YBOCS only in its use of simpler language.</description>

    <description>Those randomized to minocycline will receive approximately 2 mg/kg/day, the FDA-approved dose for minocycline (minimum 50 mg/day and maximum 200 mg/day). After randomization, participants will receive child proofed bottles that contain enough study medication until the next visit with an additional 3 days coverage in case of scheduling issues. All participants will have a minocycline level drawn at week 12 to confirm treatment adherence. Minocycline is FDA-approved in those ages 8 and above for treatment of infections and acne and has a favorable risk-benefit profile.</description>
