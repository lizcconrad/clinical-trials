    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if children and mothers who participate in the
      First Born® Program (FBP) experience better outcomes than they would have in the absence of
      the program. The evaluation employs a randomized trial design to assess the effectiveness of
      the FBP in the Santa Fe County, NM, site. FBP is a home visitation program that uses
      clinically trained professionals to provide first-time parents with information, training,
      and access to resources designed to promote early childhood development. Services are free
      and may begin at any time during pregnancy or up to two months after the baby's birth and may
      continue until the child is three years old. In addition, a nurse postpartum home visit is
      offered to the parents of all participating newborns. The FBP model builds on other home
      visiting and prevention programs that have been shown to improve long-term outcomes of
      children and their families.
