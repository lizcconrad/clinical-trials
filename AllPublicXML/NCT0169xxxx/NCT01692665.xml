      Ocular aberration may play a role in determining optical quality. Recently performed study
      reported that ocular aberration of preocular tear film would be important factor in not only
      diagnosing the dry eye but also determining the efficacy of treatment. Therefore, in this
      study, the investigators will aim to prove the improvement of quality of vision via ocular
      aberration changes indirectly after the proper treatment for moderate and severe meibomian
      gland dysfunction. Also, the investigators will evaluate the changes of keratometric values
      after treatment for moderate and severe meibomian gland dysfunction, which could be
      demonstrated by autokeratometry, IOLMaster, Pentacam, and iTrace.
