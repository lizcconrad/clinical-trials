  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective study based on analysis of medical records of patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma treated at the Hospital Sírio-Libanês (Sao Paulo-Brazil) between 2001 and 2011 with
      diagnosis confirmed by imaging or histological specimen underwent surgical resection with
      curative intent. The study aims to determine the prognostic value of vascular complications
      related to cancer and to evaluate the survival rate of these patients, comparing the data
      with those reported in the literature.
