  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bronchi
      with an increasing prevalence. By 2020, the mortality related to COPD is expected to become
      the 3rd leading death worldwide. COPD is caused by smoking in approximately 90 % of the
      cases. Nevertheless, COPD remains under-diagnosed and more than half of patients remain
      active smokers. Brittany is the second region of France facing an abnormal high death rate
      related to COPD. Smoking cessation is the most effective therapeutic approach to reduce the
      evolution of the disease, the frequency of the exacerbations and the the mortality. Besides,
      smoking cessation is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events and cancer.
      Given the COPD patients' strong addiction, smoking cessation is not easily obtained in such
      population. Furthermore, smoking cessation has been underestimated in several studies. Most
      of these studies evaluated various methods of smoking cessation in COPD patients performed
      after an exacerbation, which has a hospitalization related mortality of approximately 10%.
      Thus, there is an urgent need to find effective pharmacotherapies to help COPD patients to
      cease smoking. Varenicline, a partial agonist at a4ß2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is
      reported to be one of the most effective pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation. However, it
      has never been evaluated at the acute phase of an exacerbation of COPD requiring
      hospitalization.
