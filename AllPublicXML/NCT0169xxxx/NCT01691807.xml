      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between
      ofatumumab and bendamustine in subjects with previously untreated or relapsed indolent B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Ofatumumab and bendamustine will be administered alone and in
      combination in a two-arm, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of ofatumumab and bendamustine.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of ofatumumab
      and bendamustine alone and in combination. Secondary objectives are to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy.

             verified to be CD20+ positive from a previous or current lymph node biopsy.

          -  At least 4 weeks after previous anti-cancer chemotherapy, or radiotherapy treatment.

          -  At least 12 weeks after previous anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy, anti-CD20 antibody
             treatment, and non-anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use a
             contraception method.

          -  Subjects must agree to use contraception until 12 months after the last dose of study
             drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             a HB DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded. If HBV
             DNA is negative, the subject may be included but must undergo Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             DNA monitoring (see Section 7.7.5). Prophylactic antiviral therapy may be initiated at
             the discretion of the investigator.
