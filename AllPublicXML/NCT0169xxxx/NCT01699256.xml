      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether an enhanced strategy of implementation of the
      new guideline will lower the number of patients getting referred to secondary care spine
      centres compared to a normal implementation strategy.

      Introduction:

      There is a need for more knowledge on how to introduce new guidelines effectively in general
      practice. A new low back pain treatment guideline is implemented in Denmark. This guideline
      demands that patients with low back pain who have not improved after eight weeks of primary
      care treatment should be referred to a secondary care spine centre.

      Methods:

      This is a cluster randomized trial. One hundred general practices define clusters and are
      randomly allocated to enhanced or usual implementation of the new guideline. The practices
      are all situated in the North Denmark Region and count two hundred general practitioners
      (GPs).

      General practices in the control group will receive normal implementation of the new
      guideline, which include newsletters and briefings. In contrast the intervention group will
      receive an enhanced implementation strategy, adding visits from a consultant, two different
      stratification tools and feedback on guideline compliance. The two stratification tools: The
      STarT back screening tool (STarT) and a &quot;Social and Occupational Screening&quot; tool (SOS). The
      two screening tools subgroups patients and aids the clinicians in their choice of treatment.

      Discussion:

      To evaluate how change in behaviour may improve guideline adherence and patient treatment we
      plan two Ph.d. studies in relation to this study; one focusing on the clinical and an one on
      the economic aspects of the study. In addition a qualitative study is planned for patients
      refered to specialists in social medicine.
