  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as one of the most common vitamin deficiencies in
      adults in the United States. Vitamin D deficiency has been connected to many chronic health
      diseases. The goal of this innovative research is to identify how vitamin D is able to have
      such wide ranging health benefits. This study will determine which genes are turned on and
      turned off in adults who receive 2000 IU vitamin D3 per day compared to 400 IU vitamin D3 per
      day. Results should provide important new insights about the health benefits of vitamin D for
      adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D, commonly known as the sunshine vitamin, is produced in the skin from sun exposure
      as well as from dietary sources. However, very few foods naturally contain vitamin D and the
      amount of vitamin D in fortified foods typically, 100 IU per serving, has been totally
      inadequate in satisfying adults vitamin D requirement, which is now been estimated to be at
      least 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day. As a result, vitamin D deficiency is rapidly being
      recognized world-wide as the most common vitamin deficiency. Upwards of 50-100% of children
      and adults have been reported as being vitamin D deficient depending on ethnicity, latitude
      and skin pigmentation. The investigators reported in women at the time of delivery that 76%
      of mothers and 81% of newborns were vitamin D deficient despite the fact that the mother was
      taking a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D and drinking two glasses of milk a day.
      The investigators also reported 30-80% vitamin D deficiency rates in white and black
      children, healthy young, middle aged and older adults. There have been numerous epidemiologic
      and clinical observations relating vitamin D deficiency to many chronic diseases and there
      are many isolated but no comprehensive studies evaluating various genes that are either
      suppressed or enhanced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. It has been estimated that
      upwards of 2000 genes are directly or indirectly influence by 1,25(OH)2 D. To date, however,
      there have not been any genomic signatures identified in humans in response to correction of
      vitamin D deficiency. The goal of this pilot study is to determine whether or not vitamin D3
      supplementation will affect biomarkers for calcium and bone metabolism, and how they alter
      gene expression biomarkers, especially genes related to the non-skeletal actions of vitamin
      D.
