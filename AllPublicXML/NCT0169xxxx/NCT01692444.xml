  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway remodelling is an abnormal tissue repair following bronchial inflammation, which
      contributes to none reversible pathological features, such as bronchial and peri-bronchial
      fibrosis. It also influences the prognosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
      and its mechanisms remain largely unknown. The role of fibrocytes has been demonstrated in
      the pathophysiology of asthma, lung fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension. However, the
      recruitment of blood fibrocytes and their involvement in COPD airway remodelling remain
      unknown.

      The main objective of the study is to analyse the distribution and quantify the number of the
      peri-bronchial and blood circulating fibrocytes in patients with different stages of COPD
      compared to control subjects.
