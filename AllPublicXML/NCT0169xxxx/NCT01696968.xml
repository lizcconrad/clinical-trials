      This clinical trial studies whether screening methods used to diagnose cancer of the
      prostate, lung, colon, rectum, or ovaries can reduce deaths from these cancers. Screening
      tests may help doctors find cancer cells early and plan better treatment for lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether screening with chest x-ray can reduce mortality from lung cancer in
      women and men aged 55-74 at entry.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess screening variables, other than mortality, for each of the interventions
      including sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.

      II. To assess the incidence, stage, and survival of cancer cases. III. To investigate the
      mortality predictive value of biologic and/or prognostic characterizations of tumor tissue as
      intermediate endpoints.

      IV. To conduct biomolecular and genetic research into factors associated with cancer
      carcinogenesis and promotion, as well as the early detection of these factors.

      OUTLINE: Participants in the overall PLCO study are stratified by screening center, gender,
      and age (55-59 vs 60-64 vs 65-69 vs 70-74). Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms
      (control vs screening).

      ARM I (Control): Participants receive standard medical care. Participants complete a Diet
      History Questionnaire (DHQ) at baseline.

      ARM II (Lung Screening): Participants undergo a chest x-ray (one postero-anterior view) at
      baseline and annually for 2 years. Participants classified as &quot;smokers&quot; undergo an additional
      chest x-ray at year 3. A scheduling and tracking procedure is implemented to ensure regular
      attendance at repeat screens for participants screened negative or for those who are
      designated suspicious or positive at screening but for whom subsequent diagnostic procedures
      do not reveal lung cancer (follow-up diagnostic procedures are through their own medical care
      environment). Participants diagnosed with lung cancer via a screening test are referred for
      treatment in accordance with current accepted practice for appropriate stage of disease,
      patient age, and medical condition; a procedure is provided for contact with qualified
      medical personnel to insure appropriate therapy.

      Participants complete a Baseline Questionnaire (BQF/M) to assess smoking status. Participants
      complete a Dietary Questionnaire (DQX) at baseline and DHQ at year 3. An Annual Study Update
      (ADU) (previously referred to as the Periodic Survey of Health [PSH] questionnaire) is mailed
      to each participant annually for 13 years to identify all prevalent and incident lung cancers
      as all deaths that occur among both screened and control subjects during the trial.

      After completion of screening, participants are followed up for at least 13 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women who at the time of randomization are less than 55 or greater than or
             equal to 75 years of age

          -  Individuals undergoing treatment for cancer at this time, excluding basal-cell and
             squamous-cell skin cancer

          -  Individuals with known prior cancer of the colon, rectum, lung, prostate (men only) or
             ovary (women only)

               -  This includes primary or metastatic PLCO cancers

          -  Individuals with previous surgical removal of the entire colon, one lung, or the
             entire prostate (men only)

               -  Until October 1996, women with previous surgical removal of both ovaries were
                  excluded from the trial. In order to increase the enrollment of women into the
                  trial, beginning in October 1996, these women were no longer excluded for this
                  reason.

          -  Individuals who are participating in another cancer screening or cancer primary
             prevention trial

          -  Males who have taken Proscar/Propecia/finasteride in the past 6 months

               -  NOTE: Individuals who are already enrolled in the trial when their physician
                  prescribes finasteride are not prevented from taking this medication. As a
                  result, these participants will continue to be screened and followed just as
                  those participants who are not on finasteride.

               -  NOTE: Men who are taking Tamoxifen are not excluded from any part of the PLCO
                  Screening Trial.

               -  Prior to April 1, 1999 women were excluded from the trial if they were currently
                  taking or had taken Tamoxifen or Evista\Raloxifene in the past 6 months. As of
                  April 1999 based on a decision from the PLCO Ovary Subcommittee, women who have
                  or are currently taking Tamoxifen or Evista\Raloxifene are not excluded from
                  participation.

          -  Individuals who are unwilling or unable to sign the informed consent form

          -  Males who have had more than one PSA blood test in the past three years

          -  Individuals who have had a colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or barium enema in the past
             three years
