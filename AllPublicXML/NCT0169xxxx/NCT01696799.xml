  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the pharmacokinetics of Econazole Nitrate Foam with Econazole Nitrate Cream in
      subjects with interdigital tinea pedis aged 12 years to less than 18 years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the results of a previous clinical study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety and
      efficacy of EN Foam versus the reference listed econazole nitrate cream and the foam vehicle
      in adults, the current clinical study is being conducted to provide additional
      pharmacokinetic data for EN in the foam formulation in subjects ages 12 to less than 18 years
      with interdigital tinea pedis to support a clinical bridge for systemic safety to the RLD in
      this pediatric population. The study also includes clinical and safety endpoints.

          -  Be between 12 years and less than 18 years of age and of either sex.

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of interdigital tinea pedis

             fungal culture.

          -  Be in good health and free of any disease or physical condition which might, in the
             Investigator's opinion, expose the subject to an unacceptable risk by study
             participation.

          -  Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating and not intending to become pregnant
