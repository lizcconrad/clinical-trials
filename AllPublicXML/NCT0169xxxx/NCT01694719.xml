    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of a cognitive training
      program when combined with a particular form of psychotherapy (behavioral activation therapy)
      for depression. Behavioral activation therapy targets changes in behavior as a method for
      improving a depressed individual's thoughts, feelings, and overall quality of life. This
      study is designed to test whether a computerized brain exercise called cognitive control
      training can enhance the effects of a 5-session behavioral activation therapy program. CCT
      has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in two other studies, but it has not yet been
      combined with behavioral activation therapy. The investigators hypothesize that individuals
      assigned to the behavioral activation plus cognitive control training condition will
      demonstrate reduced depressive symptoms from pre to post treatment compared with those
      assigned to the behavioral activation plus computerized control condition. The investigators
      hypothesize that these gains will be maintained at one-month follow up.
