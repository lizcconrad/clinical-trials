  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gluococorticoids are commonly prescribed to treat a number of diseases including the majority
      of inflammatory diseases. Despite considerable inter-personal variability in responses to
      glucocorticoids between asthmatics, an insensitivity rate of about 30% and the risk of
      adverse side effects of glucocorticoid therapy, no assay is currently performed to determine
      sensitivity in severe and non-severe asthmatics prior to treatment. The purpose of this study
      is to perform a whole blood ex vivo stimulation assay to interrogate known glucocorticoid
      receptor (GR) up- and down-regulated genes to indicate glucocorticoid sensitivity and compare
      the results between severe and non-severe asthmatics.
