  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the performance of serum free fatty acids as biomarkers for the
      identification of lung cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will compare the concentration of free fatty acids and their metabolites between patients
      with lung cancer and control pulmonary patients without known cancer. The diagnostic accuracy
      will be assessed for potential predictors.
