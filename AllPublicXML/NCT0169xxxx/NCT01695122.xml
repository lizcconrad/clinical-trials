  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of valproic acid to standard
      platinum-based chemoradiation as definitive treatment of locally advanced Head and Neck
      squamous cell carcinoma can improve treatment outcomes, such as response rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Valproic acid is a known histone deacetylase inhibitor. In addition to activating apoptosis
      pathways, cell differentiation and downregulating expression of growth factors, it also
      promotes radiosensitization.

      Most patients with Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed with locally advanced
      disease, in which long term disease control is still a challenge. The incorporation of
      epigenetic regulation into standard treatment could improve results of definitive
      platinum-based chemoradiation in such patients.
