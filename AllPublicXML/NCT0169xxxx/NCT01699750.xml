      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lipid uptake, wetting characteristics, and
      visual performance of AIR OPTIX® AQUA and ACUVUE® OASYS® with HYDRACLEAR® contact lenses when
      used in conjunction with two contact lens care systems.

    <textblock>
      This study will be divided into two phases. In the Pre-Investigational Phase (Phase 1),
      participants will wear PureVision contact lenses for 30 days and use ReNu® Multiplus® for
      contact lens care. Eligible participants will continue into the Investigational Phase (Phase
      2) and be randomly assigned to wear AIR OPTIX® AQUA contact lenses or ACUVUE® OASYS® with
      HYDRACLEAR® contact lenses for a total of two months. For contact lens care, participants
      will use OPTI-FREE® PUREMOIST® MPDS and BIOTRUE® for 30 days each.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Ex-Vivo Total Lipid Uptake Per Lens</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The contact lens was aseptically removed from the eye. Lipids were extracted and analyzed using a proprietary High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique. A lower value indicates a cleaner lens surface. One eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Non-Invasive Pre-Lens Tear Film Break Up Time (NIBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens between the eyelid and the contact lens. NIBUT (i.e., the time elapsed between eye opening after a blink and the appearance of the first dark spot within the tear film) was measured using a diffuse illumination source (Tearscope) and videotography. A longer NIBUT indicates a more stable tear film and greater on-eye lens wettability. One eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>LogMAR Time-Controlled Visual Acuity (TCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Visual performance was measured binocularly (both eyes together) at two contrast levels using a validated Time Controlled Visual Acuity test (TCVA). TCVA was recorded in VA units (1 VA unit=1 VA line=0.1 logMAR), with positive (+) values corresponding with VA better than 20/20 and negative (-) values worse than 20/20.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Comfort Measured With Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The participant rated overall comfort on a 100-millimeter analog scale by marking a line that best corresponds to their eye comfort (0=very poor, 100=excellent). Both eyes were rated together as a single, retrospective evaluation of the previous 3 days of wear.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Dryness Measured With Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The participant rated overall dryness on a 100-millimeter analog scale by marking a line that best describes how dry their eyes feel (0=not at all dry, 100=very dry). Both eyes were rated together as a single, retrospective evaluation of the previous 3 days of wear.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Exposure Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Exposure speed (rate of increase in exposed lens surface % (areas not protected by tear film) after the first tear film break and before the second blink) was measured with a diffuse illumination source (Tearscope) and videotography. Higher speeds indicate worse tear film dynamics. One eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimum Protected Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Minimum protected area (i.e., minimum area of the lens (%) covered by the tear film during the interblink period) was measured using a diffuse illumination source (Tearscope) and videotography. A higher value indicates a larger area of the tearfilm spread evenly over the lens (i.e., less area of tear film breakage). One eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>

        <title>Mean Non-Invasive Pre-Lens Tear Film Break Up Time (NIBUT)</title>
        <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens between the eyelid and the contact lens. NIBUT (i.e., the time elapsed between eye opening after a blink and the appearance of the first dark spot within the tear film) was measured using a diffuse illumination source (Tearscope) and videotography. A longer NIBUT indicates a more stable tear film and greater on-eye lens wettability. One eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>

          <title>Minimum Protected Area</title>
          <description>Minimum protected area (i.e., minimum area of the lens (%) covered by the tear film during the interblink period) was measured using a diffuse illumination source (Tearscope) and videotography. A higher value indicates a larger area of the tearfilm spread evenly over the lens (i.e., less area of tear film breakage). One eye (study eye) contributed to the mean.</description>
          <population>This analysis group includes all participants who had a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement of the primary efficacy endpoint. Two Day 30 measurements per participant (one eye per Day 30) contributed to analysis.</population>
