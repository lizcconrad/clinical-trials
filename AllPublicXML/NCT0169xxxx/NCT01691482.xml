  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the daily variation in bronchodilator response to an
      inhaled short acting beta2-agonist (albuterol/salbutamol) and an inhaled short acting
      anticholinergic (ipratropium) individually and when used in combination in subjects with
      COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta2-agonist and anticholinergics are a principle component of the pharmacologic management
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. It has been demonstrated that the combination
      of a short acting beta2-agonist and a short acting anticholinergic yields greater efficacy as
      measured by FEV1 when compared with the response to the individual short acting
      bronchodilators. However, daily bronchial response to these agents is poorly understood. It
      is also poorly understood how the variation in magnitude of the response to the individual
      agents and how the variation in response for one agent coincides with the variation in
      response to the other agent. This study will seek to define the pattern of response of each
      individual agent and the relationship between them. The study will also explore if the
      combination of the two agents leads to less variation in response compared to the individual
      agents. This is a randomized, open label, two period cross-over study. Eligible subjects will
      be randomized to a sequence of either albuterol/salbutamol via metered-dose inhaler (MDI)
      followed by ipratropium via MDI or the same dose of each bronchodilator given in the opposite
      order. Each study period will consist of 10 clinic visits to be conducted over 10 to 14 days.

    <measure>Variability in Daily FEV1, Estimated by Coefficient of Variation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. During each study period, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry for evaluation of FEV1 was performed at study visits as follows: prior to administration of the first short-acting bronchodilator, approximately 1 hour after administration of the first bronchodilator (1 hour), and approximately 1 hour after administration of the second short-acting bronchodilator (2 hours). Variability in daily FEV1 was measured as the fluctuation around the mean FEV1 data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is the difference between the maximum and minimum FEV1 values.</description>

    <measure>The Maximal Bronchodilator Response for the First Administered Agent</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The maximal bronchodilator response for the first administered agent is defined as the FEV1 (the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second) 1 hour post-dose of the first bronchodilator minus the pre-dose. The maximal bronchodilator response for the second agent is defined as the FEV1 1 hour post-dose of the second bronchodilator minus the FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose of the first bronchodilator. The maximal bronchodilator response for the combination is defined as the FEV1 (the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second) at 1 hour post-administration of the second bronchodilator minus the corresponding pre-dose FEV1. Derived FEV1 response is FEV1 change from 0 hours (0H) for the first agent assessment (at 1 hour [1H]); change from 1H for the second agent assessment (at 2 hours [2H]); and change from 0H for the combination assessment (at 2H). Data were adjusted for FEV1, smoking status, and center.</description>

    <measure>Variability in Daily Inspiratory Capacity (IC), Estimated by Coefficient of Variation</measure>

    <description>IC is the the total amount of air that can be drawn into the lungs after normal expiration. During each study period, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry for evaluation of IC was performed at study visits as follows: prior to administration of the first short-acting bronchodilator, approximately 1 hour after administration of the first bronchodilator (1 hour), and approximately 1 hour after administration of the second short-acting bronchodilator (2 hours). Variability in daily IC was measured as the fluctuation around the mean IC data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficent of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is the difference between the maximum and minimum IC values.</description>

        <title>Variability in Daily FEV1, Estimated by Coefficient of Variation</title>
        <description>FEV1 is the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. During each study period, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry for evaluation of FEV1 was performed at study visits as follows: prior to administration of the first short-acting bronchodilator, approximately 1 hour after administration of the first bronchodilator (1 hour), and approximately 1 hour after administration of the second short-acting bronchodilator (2 hours). Variability in daily FEV1 was measured as the fluctuation around the mean FEV1 data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is the difference between the maximum and minimum FEV1 values.</description>

        <title>The Maximal Bronchodilator Response for the First Administered Agent</title>
        <description>The maximal bronchodilator response for the first administered agent is defined as the FEV1 (the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second) 1 hour post-dose of the first bronchodilator minus the pre-dose. The maximal bronchodilator response for the second agent is defined as the FEV1 1 hour post-dose of the second bronchodilator minus the FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose of the first bronchodilator. The maximal bronchodilator response for the combination is defined as the FEV1 (the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second) at 1 hour post-administration of the second bronchodilator minus the corresponding pre-dose FEV1. Derived FEV1 response is FEV1 change from 0 hours (0H) for the first agent assessment (at 1 hour [1H]); change from 1H for the second agent assessment (at 2 hours [2H]); and change from 0H for the combination assessment (at 2H). Data were adjusted for FEV1, smoking status, and center.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. During each study period, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry for evaluation of FEV1 was performed at study visits as follows: prior to administration of the first short-acting bronchodilator, approximately 1 hour after administration of the first bronchodilator (1 hour), and approximately 1 hour after administration of the second short-acting bronchodilator (2 hours). Variability in daily FEV1 was measured as the fluctuation around the mean FEV1 data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is half the difference between the maximum and minimum FEV1 values.</description>

        <title>Variability in Daily IC, Estimated by Half Range (i.e., Half the Difference Between Maximum and Minimum)</title>
        <description>IC is the the total amount of air that can be drawn into the lungs after normal expiration. During each study period, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry for evaluation of IC was performed at study visits as follows: prior to administration of the first short-acting bronchodilator, approximately 1 hour after administration of the first bronchodilator (1 hour), and approximately 1 hour after administration of the second short-acting bronchodilator (2 hours). Variability in daily IC was measured as the fluctuation around the mean IC data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficent of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is half the difference between the maximum and minimum IC values.</description>
