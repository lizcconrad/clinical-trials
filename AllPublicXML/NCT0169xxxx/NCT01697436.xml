    <textblock>
      This four-period, single-center, open-label, single-dose, randomized, cross-over study will
      assess the bioequivalence and safety of an oral solution of Copegus (ribavirin) compared to a
      Copegus tablet in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be randomized to one of four
      sequences in which they will receive the treatment under fed and under fasted conditions.

          -  Female subjects must be postmenopausal or surgically sterile or they must agree to use
             two reliable forms of contraception one of which must be a physical barrier method,

          -  Participation in an investigational drug study within 60 days or in an investigational
             device study within 30 days prior to screening

          -  Donation of blood over 500 mL from 3 months prior to screening until the end of the
             study; donation of plasma from 7 days prior to screening until the end of the study

          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with, or for which the treatment
             of might interfere with, the conduct of the study or that would, in the opinion of the

          -  Smoker of more than 10 cigarettes per day prior to screening or use of tobacco
             products equivalent to more than 10 cigarettes per day
