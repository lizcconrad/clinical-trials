  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction is the term used to describe a condition where an unborn baby
      does not reach its optimum size. In the short and long term, intrauterine growth restricted
      babies have a higher risk of serious disease and even death. It is well established that very
      low levels of oxygen in the baby's blood can harm the baby's health through a state known as
      oxidative stress. Currently, there is no established treatment available to treat
      intrauterine growth restriction or its complications. In experimental animal studies however,
      the naturally occuring hormone, melatonin, has been shown to significantly reduce oxidative
      stress and improve health of the unborn babies that have suffered from intrauterine growth
      restriction. This study aims to find out if the use melatonin twice per day throughout
      pregnancies affected by intrauterine growth restriction will lower the level of oxidative
      stress experienced by the unborn baby. If this is the case melatonin may help protect the
      unborn baby from damage caused by oxidative stress, this will be studied in a separate future
      study.

    <description>Umbilical artery oxidative stress by measuring levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-isoprostane. Levels of MDA will be assessed using a Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical Item Number 10009055). Levels of 8-isoprostane will be assessed using an 8-Isoprostane Enzyme Immuno Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical Item Number 516351).</description>

    <description>Women with IUGR will take 4mg prolonged release melatonin oral tablets twice daily. Treatment will occur as soon as the diagnosis of intrauterine growth restriction is made and the patient has been enrolled to this study until birth. The overall duration of treatment will vary due to the nature of intrauterine growth restriction.</description>
