  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, single dose (four inhalations), four-way cross over study in healthy
      subjects that will assess the systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) and systemic pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of Fluticasone Furoate, (FF), Umeclidinium, (UMEC) and Vilanterol (VI). Study drug will
      be delivered through a novel single-step activation dry powder inhaler (NDPI) which has a two
      strip configuration. The NDPI will be configured with different combinations of each compound
      and also a new blend of UMEC/VI inhalation powder within a single strip of the NDPI device.
      Study drug will be administered through the inhaled route to healthy subjects in single doses
      (four inhalations). Each subject will receive treatment in a randomized order Treatment A FF
      (400 microgram [µg]) and UMEC (500 µg)/VI (100 µg), Treatment B UMEC (500 µg) and VI (100
      µg), Treatment C FF (400 µg) and VI (100 µg) and Treatment D FF (400 µg) and UMEC (500 µg)
      over four treatment periods. Each treatment period will be separated by a washout of 7 to 21
      days. After the four treatment periods, a follow up visit will take place 7 to 21 days
      following the final dose of study medication and the maximum duration a subject will be
      involved in the study is eighteen weeks.

      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed by the measurement of plasma and urine concentrations of
      FF, UMEC and VI. Safety and PD will be monitored using blood glucose, serum potassium, heart
      rate, 12-lead ECGs and clinical laboratory tests. Plasma samples for PK will be collected
      throughout the study, urine, blood glucose, serum potassium, heart rate, 12-lead ECGs and
      clinical laboratory tests will be assessed on Day 1 only. AEs will be assessed throughout the
      study.
