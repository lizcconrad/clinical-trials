  <brief_title>Bioequivalence of An Oral Mercaptopurine Suspension 100 Mg / 5 Ml Versus Tablet in Healthy Male Subjects Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
  <official_title>A SINGLE CENTER, SINGLE-DOSE, OPEN-LABEL, RANDOMIZED, TWO-PERIOD CROSSOVER STUDY TO ASSESS THE BIOEQUIVALENCE OF AN ORAL MERCAPTOPURINE SUSPENSION 100 mg / 5 mL VERSUS AN ORAL MERCAPTOPURINE TABLET 50 mg (PURINETHOL®) IN AT LEAST 62 HEALTHY MALE SUBJECTS UNDER FASTING CONDITIONS</official_title>

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the test product, mercaptopurine
      oral 100 mg/5 mL suspension, and the reference product, Purinethol® 50 mg tablets are
      bioequivalent. For this purpose the PK profile of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) will be compared
      after administration of a single dose of each of the two formulations, under fasting
      conditions. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of the test
      product, mercaptopurine oral 100 mg/5 mL suspension.

    <description>At each treatment period, pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected through the indwelling venous cannula at the following times: pre-dose and post-dose at 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.33, 1.67, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 10.0 and 12.0 hours.
The primary outcome measures will be
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax).
AUC time zero to time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(0-t))
Area under the plasma concentration versus time data pairs, with extrapolation to infinity (AUC(0-∞)).</description>

             laboratory investigations: Findings clinically acceptable or within laboratory
             reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests, unless the investigator considers
             the deviation to be irrelevant for the purpose of the study.

          -  Non-smokers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another study with an experimental drug, where the last
             administration of the previous IMP was within 8 weeks before the first administration
             of IMP in this study.

          -  Subjects who participated in previous azathioprine/mercaptopurine studies within six
             months will be excluded.

          -  Relevant history or laboratory or clinical findings indicative of acute or chronic
             disease, likely to influence study outcome.

          -  Donation or loss of blood equal to or exceeding 500 mL during the 8 weeks before the
