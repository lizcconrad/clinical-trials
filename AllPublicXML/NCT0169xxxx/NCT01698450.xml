      The aim of this study is to asses the efficacy and the clinical safety of the transcranial
      magnetic resonance guided high intensity focused ultrasound system ExAblate 4000, InSightec
      Ltd. for functional neurosurgery in the treatment of movement disorders. The treatments to be
      conducted in this study are non-invasive, i.e. without opening the skull, and will create
      microthalamotomies in specific target areas such as thalamus, subthalamus and pallidum. The
      data obtained in this study will be used to evaluate the basic safety aspects of this new
      treatment technology and will serve as a basis for the clinical introduction of MR-guided
      ultrasound neurosurgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, between 18 and 80 years, inclusive.

          -  Patients who are able and willing to give consent and able to attend all study visits.

          -  A diagnosis of a MD, such as Essential Tremor (ET), Idiopathic Parkinson's diseases or
             primary Dystonia as confirmed from clinical history and examination by a movement
             disorder neurologist.

          -  A MD refractory to adequate medical treatment, or in whom the indication for Deep
             Brain Stimulation (DBS) would be given, but DBS cannot be performed because of medical
             comorbidities or medical reasons, or because the patient clearly confirms by written
             statement that he does not want to undergo DBS for personal reasons (PD: increasing
             motor fluctuations albeit optimal medical treatment &amp; unbearable side effects of
             medication; ET: failure of adequate tremor control with Propranolol and Primidone
             alone and in combination; Dystonia: dystonia or pain not controlled by oral
             medication). An adequate medication trial is defined as a therapeutic dose of each
             medication or the development of side effects as the medication dose is titrated.

          -  Either the medial thalamic nuclei or the subthalamic or pallidal areas can be target
             by the ExAblate device. The target region must be apparent on MRI such that targeting
             can be performed with either direct visualization or by measurement from landmarks,
             using the &quot;Stereotactic Atlas of the Human Thalamus and Basal Ganglia&quot; by Anne Morel,
             39 analogous to our first clinical FUS study on patients with chronic pain 33.

          -  Able to communicate sensations during the ExAblate MRgFUS treatment

          -  Stable doses of all medications for 30 days prior to study entry and for the duration
             of the study.

             than liquids, bringing liquids to mouth, hygiene, dressing, writing, working, and
             social activities)

                  at work, school, or home (such as repeated absences or poor work performance
                  related to substance use; substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions
                  from school; or neglect of children or household).

               -  Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (such
                  as driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use)

                  disorderly conduct)

               -  Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or
                  interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (for
