    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose level of LY2940680 that can be safely
      given to children with medulloblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma that has returned or doesn't
      respond to initial treatment. The study will also explore the changes in a cancer marker
      levels. Finally, the study will help document any antitumor activity.
