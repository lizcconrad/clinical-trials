    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder in clinical practice. In
      the last two decades the number of hospitalizations for AF has increased two- to three-fold.
      More than 6 million people worldwide suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF), a cardiac disorder
      that results in systemic emboli. Patients with AF are 5 times more likely to have a stroke
      compared with those without AF.

      This registry will collection information on two devices that are used to treat AF. The
      WATCHMAN and LARIAT. The differences in techniques and subsequent effects of the two devices
      on outcomes related to AF has not been studied. This study will look to compare the two
      devices to see how the outcomes may vary.
