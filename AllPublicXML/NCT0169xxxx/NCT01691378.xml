  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to provide further evidence regarding a groundbreaking
      psychological treatment for suicide prevention in individuals with moderate to severe
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), Window to Hope (WtoH). The study will be one of the first five
      randomized clinical trials (RCTs) internationally to evaluate a psychological treatment for
      affective distress after TBI and the first conducted in the United States (U.S.) to
      specifically address suicide risk as an outcome.

      The current project aims to adapt WtoH for U.S. military personnel/Veterans (expert Consensus
      Conference, participant total up to 15), implement the intervention in a VAMC (Pilot Groups
      1-4, participant total up to 12), and replicate the results from the original trial in this
      novel context with a larger sample size (n=70 completed protocols [up to 90 recruited].
      Deliverables are expected to include an intervention suitable for both dissemination and
      larger Phase III trials.

      Prior to implementing the intervention, Dr. Simpson will work with VA study team members
      (e.g., Drs. Brenner, Matarazzo, Signoracci) to modify WtoH manual semantics and graphics to
      meet the needs of the U.S. Veteran population. Dr. Brenner has a long history of working
      within the VHA and is a Diplomate in Rehabilitation Psychology. An expert committee (up to 15
      participants) will also be convened for a meeting focused on the cross-cultural adaptation of
      WtoH. All efforts will be made to include experts in treating TBI and stakeholders (e.g.,
      Veterans with or without TBI and/or family members/support persons) on the committee. Members
      of the research team will contact potential committee members by phone, email, mail or in
      person. Presentations may also be made to Veterans/family members/support persons receiving
      care, participating in patient advocacy activities, or providing peer support. Prior to
      reviewing the content, the expert committee will be provided background on the current state
      of knowledge about suicidality and hopelessness after TBI, available treatment options, and
      information regarding the underlying theoretical basis and key features of the WtoH program.
      The committee will then review the ten sessions to identify potential changes required to the
      therapeutic content, exercises, language and graphics to ensure that it is culturally
      appropriate for the VAMC context. Modifications will be made employing a consensus approach
      among the expert committee.

      The adapted program will then be trialed across four pilot groups. Once the pilot groups have
      been completed (see below) the expert committee will be reconvened for a final review of the
      program. Data collected on acceptability and feasibility will be presented to the committee
      and test therapists. Any necessary final modifications to assessment procedures and/or the
      intervention to ensure that the program is appropriate for the Veterans' condition will be
      made employing a consensus approach.

      The revised version of the manual will be used to conduct the RCT. Up to 90 Veterans will
      participate.

    <description>Time 1 (Baseline for both groups), Time 2 (Post-Intervention for Treatment Group and Baseline 2 for Waitlist Control Group), and Time 3 Assessment (3 month follow up for Intervention Group and Post-Intervention for Waitlist Control Group. The BHS is a 20-item true-false self-report scale that measures the level of negative expectations about the future held by respondents over the previous week. Scores range from 0 to 20 representing nil (0-3), mild (4-8), moderate (9-14), and severe (&gt;14) levels of hopelessness. Beck et al. found that BHS scores equal to or greater than 9 were associated with significantly elevated levels of suicide risk (Beck et al., 1985). As such, to be eligible to participate in this treatment trial individuals must have a score of 9 on the BHS at the time of screening and at the baseline assessment.</description>
