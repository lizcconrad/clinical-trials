      Patients diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis were
      confirmed based on the investigators national diagnostic criteria. Patients who meet all
      inclusion criteria and do not conflict with the exclusion criteria will receive NPB-01
      (intravenous immunoglobulin) 400mg/kg/day for five consecutive days. Subsequently, efficacy
      of NPB-01 for therapy of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis will be
      evaluated the disease evaluation score et al.

      As a safety endpoint, the safety of NPB-01 will be investigated the occurrence of adverse
      events by 20 days after the start of the study treatment.
