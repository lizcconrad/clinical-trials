  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue and bone sarcomas are rare malignant tumors, which encompasses a large family of
      more than 50 histologically distinct tumor subtypes, all of which share a putative
      mesenchymal origin. In the case of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) surgical excision is the
      mainstay of treatment, but despite curative surgery, around half of patients develop distant
      metastases and die from disease. Few therapeutic approaches are currently available to
      patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic STS and only anthracyclines,
      ifosfamide and trabectedin have shown activity, with response rates of 20-40% in previously
      untreated patients. Recent and ongoing trials have investigated a variety of combination
      chemotherapeutic regimens (variously employing ifosfamide, doxorubicin, gemcitabine,
      temozolomide, vincristine, cisplatin, and dacarbazine, among others) as well as targeted
      therapies, which in some cases have yielded improvements in response rate but which have had
      little impact on survival. No other medical option is currently available, and the median
      survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcoma with non-resectable metastases is around 12-15
      months, and approximately 8 months after second line chemotherapy.

      Liposarcomas are STS which account for at least 20% of all STS in adults. They can be further
      classified into 3 histologically and biologically different subtypes: well-differentiated
      liposarcoma/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (ALT-WD), myxoid or round cell liposarcoma and
      pleomorphic liposarcoma.

      ALT-WD liposarcomas are locally aggressive rarely metastasizing tumors characterized by ring
      or giant marker chromosomes on the cytogenetic analysis and by amplification of the 12q13-21
      region on FISH (MDM2, CDK4 and HMGIC). They account for about 40% iv of liposarcomas with a 5
      year OS around 80%. In a series of WD/DD treated with several regimens response rate was
      12.5% OS 15 months and median PFS 3.6 months(95 CI: 3.3-5.9) Mixoid /round cell liposarcoma
      accounts for 45-50% of all liposarcomas. They tend to metastasize to unusual soft tissue and
      bone locations. High histologic grade with more than 5% of round cell component is associated
      with a 5-year OS of 50% approximately. They are characterized by t(23;16)(q13-14;p11) which
      leads to the fusion of CHOP and TLS genes Pleomorphic liposarcoma accounts for approximately
      5-10% of all liposarcomas, characterized by high grade features with frequent and early lung
      metastasis and cytogenetically by high chromosome counts and complex structural
      rearrangements.

      VEGF is expressed in many STS in which increased expression is associated with higher grade
      and worse prognosis.

      Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor that targets mainly VEGFR, PDGFR and c-kit.
      Recently the results of a phase II trial of pazopanib in STS have been published. It was a
      four-cohort 2-stages study. The liposarcoma stratum was closed after the first stage because
      of a PFS at 12 weeks of 17% (3 out of 17 patients did not progressed after 12 weeks). After
      central pathologic review, 2 other patients initially classified as other STS were found to
      have liposarcoma with stable disease at 12 weeks (5/19: 26% PFS12w), thus fulfilling criteria
      for cohort expansion. Phase II study had been completed and in phase III study patients with
      liposarcomas were excluded so therefore data on the liposarcoma cohort are inconclusive.

      Furthermore the positive results of the phase III study PALETTE have been recently
      communicated, encouraging this treatment in other sarcomas: progression-free survival (PFS)
      per independent review was significantly prolonged with pazopanib (median: 4.6 vs 1.5 months;
      HR=0.31, 95% CI 0.24-0.40; P&lt;0.0001). The interim analysis for overall survival shows a
      statistically non-significant improvement of pazopanib vs placebo (median: 11.9 vs 10.4
      months, HR=0.83, 95% CI 0.62-1.09).

      Soluble factors associated with efficacy and toxicity of pazopanib in these patients had been
      also reported. Decreases in VEGFR2 and increase in PlGF were both associated with toxicity
      (HTA and TSH elevation) and poorer prognosis.

             received anthracyclines in the adjuvant setting are not eligible for first line
             therapy with this agent for advanced disease.

               3. Concomitant elevations in bilirubin and AST/ALT above 1.0 x ULN (upper limit of
                  normal) are not permitted.

               4. If UPC ≥ 1, then a 24-hour urine protein must be assessed. Subjects must have a
                  24-hour urine protein value &lt;1 g to be eligible. Use of urine dipstick for

             Lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels (contiguous tumour and vessels) are
             excluded; however, the presence of a tumor that is touching, but not infiltrating
             (abutting) the vessels is acceptable (CT with contrast is strongly recommended to
             evaluate such lesions).
