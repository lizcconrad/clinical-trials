      Database analysis:

        -  To describe how Orencia is prescribed in France in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

        -  To describe joint population of Orencia

        -  To assess the impact of the treatment on health status of the treated population as
           assessed by morbid-mortality criteria

        -  To describe therapeutic strategies and use of health services

      -  Observational Model: Historic cohort generated from Société Française de Rhumatologie's
           (SFR) Orencia and Rheumatoid Arthritis (ORA) registry

        -  Sampling Method: all physicians and sites taking in charge RA patients received an
           invitation mailing to participate to ORA

        -  Minimum Age: 18 years old at Orencia initiation
