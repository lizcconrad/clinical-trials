  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a Chinese herbal
      proprietary medicine, MaZiRenWan (MZRW), by comparing with stimulant laxative western
      medicine (WM), senna, and placebo for patients with functional constipation (FC) in excessive
      TCM syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional constipation (FC) is a common clinical complaint. Despite the effectiveness of
      MaZiRenWan (MZRW) for alleviating FC symptoms has been proofed in the previous study.Given
      the results of the dose determination study and placebo-controlled study of MZRW, we
      hypothesize that MZRW is more useful than senna (senokot), a commonly used WM drug for
      constipation, for FC patients in excessive TCM syndrome.This is a prospective, double-blind,
      double dummy, randomized, controlled trial. After a 2-week run-in, eligible FC patients (Rome
      III) in excessive TCM syndrome will randomly be assigned to CHM arm (MZRW and WM placebo), WM
      arm (senna and CHM placebo) or placebo arm (CHM placebo and WM placebo). Patients will
      undergo an 8-week treatment and an 8-week follow-up.

    <description>a clinically meaningful endpoint by combining an objective measure (number of bowel movement) with a subjective measure (feelings of patients as to completeness of defecation,Patients with a mean increase of ≧1 complete spontaneous bowel movement(CSBM)/wk compared with the baseline(wk1-2) will be defined as responders</description>

    <measure>the changes of colonic transit time</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is estimated by using a commercially available radio-opaque Sitzmarks capsule (Konsyl Pharmaceuticals, US). Each gelatine capsule contained 24 barium sulphate embedded polyvinyl chloride markers measuring 1mmx4.5mm. Plain radiographs of the abdomen will be obtained after the swallow of capsule for five days (120 hours) before and after 8 weeks treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global symptom assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate their impression of change in constipation by comparing with their baseline (Wk2) at the visits during the treatment (Wk6), end of treatment (Wk10) and end of follow-up (Wk18) with scores from 0 to 6 represented markedly worse or better respectively. The response categories were collapsed to simply &quot;improved&quot; for score 4 to 6, &quot;same&quot; for score 3 or &quot;worse&quot; for score 0 to 2.</description>
