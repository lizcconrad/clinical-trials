  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroporation will increase the efficiency of DNA priming in terms of immune responses and
      will lead to a dose sparing DNA vaccine regimen. Furthermore increased DNA vaccine
      concentration will reduce the number of shots necessary to deliver the full dose and induce
      comparable immune responses as with lower DNA vaccine concentrations.
