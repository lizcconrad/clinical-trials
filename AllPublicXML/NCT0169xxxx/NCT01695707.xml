  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with eczema (atopic dermatitis) have an inherent defect in their skin barrier
      as demonstrated by high water loss. In laboratory conditions, studies have shown that
      pioglitazone restores the skin barrier function in skin from eczema patients. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if taking pioglitazone improves the skin barrier function in
      people with eczema.

      Enrolled patients will be randomized to either placebo or pioglitazone. Each randomized
      subject will have a skin biopsy and skin irritancy assay performed prior to treatment and at
      the end of 12 weeks of treatment. Noninvasive barrier measurements including transepidermal
      water loss will be recorded at all study visits.

    <description>Skin biopsies will be performed twice during the study. The integrity of the skin barrier will be assessed in the lab by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability of the biopsy specimens.</description>

    <measure>Skin Irritancy</measure>
    <description>The clinical efficacy of PIO will be assessed by quantifying the skin response to a model irritant, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) at several time points. Subjects will be exposed for 24 h on the dominant inner arm to SLS at three concentrations (wt/vol in water - 0.125, 0.5 and 2%) (Fluka) using standard patch test reagents (Finn chambers of 18-mm diam, Filter Discs &amp; Scanpor tape). Before application and at several time points after removal, TEWL and erythema will be measured at the exposed site and at a control site. Erythema will be measured using a colorimeter (Minolta CR-200).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  i. Moderate to Severe AD: EASI ≥ 10 ii. Active Atopic Dermatitis: Subjects must have
             within the last 3 months according to medical records or by medical exam of the
             investigator:

               -  Pruritus

               -  Eczema (acute, subacute, chronic)

        I. Typical morphology and age-specific patterns - Patterns include (1) facial, neck, and
        extensor involvement in infants and children, (2) current or prior flexural lesions in any
        age group, (3) sparing groin and axillary regions.

        II. Chronic or relapsing history

        iii. Extrinsic they must also meet both of the following: serum total IgE ≥ 1.5 S.D.
        greater than the age-matched norms and positive multi-allergen RAST (Phadiatop).

        Additionally, subjects must have TEWL of nonlesional skin of upper arm that is ≥ 8 gm/m2/h
        at screening visit. This is to ensure that we are in fact studying the subset of AD
        subjects who have a skin barrier defect.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwillingness or inability to complete the Informed Consent process

          -  Subjects with a history of keloid formation

          -  History of lidocaine or Novocain allergy

          -  Subjects with a systemic infection requiring a course of systemic antibiotics or
             antivirals within the last 2 weeks

          -  Subjects with MD diagnosed Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Subjects with NYHA class III or IV cardiac status

          -  Subjects with a history of liver disease (EtOH, viral hepatitis, drug-induced
             hepatitis or other)

          -  Subjects with evidence of an underlying systemic disease based on history and physical
             (other than the above diagnostic categories (and associated allergic disorders), or
             well-controlled hypertension, or hyperlipidemia).

          -  History of cancer other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer or cervical dysplasia

          -  Participants enrolled while on a systemic treatment for their atopic dermatitis (e.g.
             cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil) must remain on a stable dose for the duration of
             the study
