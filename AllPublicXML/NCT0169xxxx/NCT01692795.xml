  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large randomised trials have shown that cardiovascular medications prescribed to patients at
      high cardiovascular risk are effective in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events.
      Their use is recommended in the United Kingdom and international guidelines (e.g. the
      National Institute of Clinical Excellence). However, these medications do not prevent
      cardiovascular events in all patients and there is now a body of research investigating the
      effects of cardiovascular medications on outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI), including
      clinical presentation, infarct size and post-MI mortality. However, the independent effects
      of cardiovascular drugs on post-MI all cause mortality are unclear, and there are limitations
      to many of the published studies in terms of their cardiovascular drug exposure data. This
      project utilizes prospectively collected data on cardiovascular drug use, and links to MI
      data from hospital and mortality records.

        The study population is comprised of patients with a first myocardial infarction who are
        registered at those General Practice Research Database (GPRD) practices that agreed to the
        linkage with the MINAP database, and whose practices are &quot;up to standard&quot; according to GPRD
        criteria. Practices taking part in the GPRD are chosen to be representative of all United
        Kingdom (UK) practices, and 98% of people in the UK are registered with a General
        Practitioner (GP). Therefore the GPRD should be a representative sample of the UK
        population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients in GPRD practices which are deemed &quot;up to standard&quot; by GPRD criteria will be
        included if their practice agreed to be linked to the Myocardial Ischaemic National Audit
        Project (MINAP), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS)
        datasets.

        Patients must have at least one year of GPRD &quot;up to standard&quot; registration before the date
        of first myocardial infarction.

        Age over 18. First myocardial infarction occurring between 1st January 2003 and 31st
        December 2008, as recorded in the HES data or MINAP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded if they do not fulfil one of the inclusion criteria.
