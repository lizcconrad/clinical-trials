  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to compare two different treatments, continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) versus breathing of atmospheric pressure, in subjects with obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA)recovering from weight loss surgery in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). WE
      hypothesize that subjects with OSA will have a higher Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) with
      desaturation and the investigators expect that post-operative CPAP treatment in the PACU will
      significantly improve the AHI and therefore improve patient safety in the PACU. The
      investigators also hypothesize that subjects with OSA have a greater decrease in oxygen
      saturation in response to opioid administration by patient-controlled opioid analgesia (PCA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with morbid obesity have an approximately 60-80 percent incidence of OSA depending
      on the criteria used for making diagnosis, and they are suggested to be at increased risk to
      develop serious perioperative complications, especially during the postoperative period.
      Weight loss might be considered as an appropriate treatment of OSA but in turn it has
      recently been reported that OSA is an independent risk factor for development of
      perioperative complications, importantly oxygen desaturation, in patients undergoing weight
      loss surgery. It seems logical to evaluate if these patients would benefit from
      post-operative CPAP treatment in the PACU. The results of this multidisciplinary study will
      have an impact on PACU treatment of patients with OSA and will further optimize patient care
      at MGH.

Subsequently, the AHI is assessed during the patient's stay in the post-anesthesia-care unit (PACU) during which time they receive CPAP and oxygen treatment.</description>
