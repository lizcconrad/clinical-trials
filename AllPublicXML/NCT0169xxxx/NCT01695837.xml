    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects on lipids and diet of a low-intensity
      dietary counseling intervention provided by the primary care physician (PCP), in patients at
      risk for cardiovascular diseases

      The objective of this study is to design and evaluate the feasibility and the effect on diet
      quality and blood lipids a new dietary counseling intervention that will be sustainable in
      the &quot;real-world&quot; settings of the current clinical practice. The intervention will be
      initiated by the primary care physician during the routine office visits and will use paper
      and web-based counseling materials. Internet based healthcare, or e-healthcare, is a consumer
      focused health care delivery paradigm that physicians and the healthcare system can no longer
      ignore. Lifestyle counseling and preventive medicine are potentially ideal areas of patient
      care that could be provided efficiently through this emerging venue of healthcare delivery.
      Internet access is near-universal for Americans under the age of 60: 90% of 18-29 year-olds,
      85% of 30-49 year-olds, and 70% of 50-64 year-olds.

      The aims of this study are: 1) - develop a patient self-administered, computerized version of
      the paper-based Rate-your-Plate dietary screening Questionnaire; 2) - create counseling
      materials on diet and cholesterol and build a secure, HIPAA compliant, interactive web-based
      counseling application that will allow patients to receive personalized counseling base on
      the results of the screening dietary questionnaire and the goals chosen by the patients; 3) -
      to test the feasibility of this intervention in the clinical settings of primary care, and
      evaluate its effect on lipids panel at 3 and 6 months .

    <description>Group A Visit #1 - Weight, height, blood pressure and pulse were measured at the beginning of the visit. During a &quot;focused office visit&quot; the primary care physician (PCP) reviewed the results of the fasting lipid panel and diet test with the patient; the PCP provide the patient with written educational materials and access to the counseling website. Weekly automatic emails sent to patient reminding to visit the counseling website
Visit #2 - Same as visit #1. Weekly automatic emails sent to patient reminding to visit the counseling website.
Visit #3 - Weight, blood pressure and pulse were measured at the beginning of the visit. During a &quot;focused office visit&quot; the PCP reviewed the results of the new fasting lipid panel and diet test with the patient.</description>

Visit #2 - Weight, blood pressure and pulse were measured at the beginning of the visit. During a &quot;focused office visit&quot; the PCP reviewed the results of the two fasting lipid panels ; the PCP provide the patient with written educational materials and access to the counseling website. Weekly automatic emails sent to patient reminding to visit the counseling website

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligibility required documentation of a LDL-cholesterol level of 130 mg/dL or higher
             within the 12 months prior to enrollment. Potential subjects were also required to
             have access to the Internet and an active email account. The use of lipid lowering
             drugs was not an exclusion, but patients taking these drugs had be on the same
             medication and dose for at least 3 months prior to enrollment, with no changes
             anticipated for the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We excluded patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (defined by HbA1c&gt;9%),
             serum creatinine above 1.5 mg/dL, malignancy, cirrhosis, eating disorders, acute
             coronary syndrome in the last three months, congestive heart failure NYHA class lll
             and lV, ongoing warfarin therapy, uncontrolled hypo- or hyperthyroidism, ongoing
             weight loss, history of bariatric surgery, pregnant women, and patients who scored
             more than 250 (on a scale of 100 to 300) on a food frequency questionnaire
             administered on the day of enrollment. Patients with a history of triglycerides &gt;400
             mg/dl were also excluded, since we used the Friedewald formula [LDL-C=Total
             cholesterol-(TGs/5+HDL-C)] to calculate LDL-cholesterol levels.
