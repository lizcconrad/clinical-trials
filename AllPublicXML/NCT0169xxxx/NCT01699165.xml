    <measure>Effect of active nasal filters compared to placebo filters in the same patient group as measured by difference in maximum Total Nasal Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and day 15</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of active nasal filters on symptoms development in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) exposed to air-born allergens compared to the same patients in an exposed environment with a placebo nasal filter determined by their maximum Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) out of the nine samples taken during a trial day. The statistical analysis will be done using non-parametric paired Wilcoxon signed rank test.</description>

    <measure>Effect of active nasal filters compared to placebo filters as measured by acoustic rhinometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and day 15</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of active nasal filters on intranasal volume in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) exposed to air-born allergens compared to the same patients in an exposed environment with a placebo nasal filter. The assessment will be based on the difference between minimum and maximum volume as determined by acoustic rhinometry measurements pre- and post-exposure on each study day. The statistical analysis will be a parametric paired t-test.</description>
