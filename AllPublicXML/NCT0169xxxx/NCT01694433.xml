  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of topical Vitamin D cream (Calcipotriene,
      also known as Dovonex) on the face and on the bacteria that cause acne. The information
      gained from this study may lead to new treatments for acne. In this study, Calcipotriene will
      be compared with a placebo, a cream that looks like Calcipotriene, but contains no active
      ingredients.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blinded, parallel group comparison of calcipotriene
      vs. placebo cream. Patients with acne will use calcipotriene or placebo cream 2x/day for 12
      weeks and will be assessed at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. Each group will have 24 subjects as
      calculated by power analysis. Three additional subjects for each group will be recruited for
      possible dropouts and total of 27 subjects will be recruited for each group. Primary endpoint
      (lesion count) and secondary endpoints described in aims 3.2-3.4 will be determined. Lesion
      counts will be assessed by one of the investigator physicians or nurse practitioner. Adverse
      effects including irritation, dry skin, inflammation and worsening of the lesions will be
      noted at each visit. Photographs will be taken to aid in assessing the clinical changes.
