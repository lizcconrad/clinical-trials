    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of different capecitabine
      based chemotherapies, alone or in combination with other therapies, as first line treatment
      of metastatic colorectal cancer in participants during everyday clinical practice.

    <measure>Median Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first, evaluated up to Day 1254</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and is defined as the time from the first dose of indicated treatment to disease progression (PD) or death, whichever occurred first. Participants who did not progress or died while being followed were censored on the date of the last visit. Participants without post-baseline tumor assessments were conservatively censored on the date of first study medication, which is PFS was assigned a value of 1 day. PD: at least 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to the smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm); progression of existing non-target lesions; or presence of new lesions. Median PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>PFS was assessed using RECIST v1.1 and is defined as the time from the first dose of indicated treatment to PD or death, whichever occurred first.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Overall Response as Assessed by Investigator Using RECIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first, evaluated up to Day 1254</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response is defined as a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) as determined by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1 on 2 consecutive occasions at least 6 weeks apart. Participants were evaluated for tumor response per RECIST v1.1 and assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than (&lt;) 10 mm). No new lesions.PR was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit as Assessed Using RECIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first, evaluated up to Day 1254</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit was defined as having a confirmed CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks on study according to RECIST v1.1.CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease,with the exception of nodal disease.All nodes,both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm).No new lesions.PR: &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions.The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes,while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions.No unequivocal progression of non-target disease.No new lesions.SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD,taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.PD:at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to the smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions,or presence of new lesions.</description>

Participants without post-baseline tumor assessments were conservatively censored on the date of first study medication, which is PFS was assigned a value of 1 day.

All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than (&lt;) 10 mm). No new lesions.PR was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease.
