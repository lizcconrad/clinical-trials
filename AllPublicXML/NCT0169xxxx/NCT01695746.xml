  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the use in clinical practice and efficacy of Mircera
      (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) in stage III-IV chronic kidney disease patients
      not on dialysis receiving Mircera for the treatment of chronic renal anemia. Eligible
      patients will be followed for 24 weeks.

    <measure>Mean Time to Achieve Target Hemoglobin Range (10-12 Gram/Deciliter)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Correction of anemia was evaluated in participants with Hb &lt; 10 gram/deciliter (g/dL). Hemoglobin levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 24. The mean time required to achieve target Hb range (10-12 g/dL) was calculated using the following formula: Time to achieve target range = (Date of Hb evaluation when participant achieves target range at first time - visit date of first dosing) + 1.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Maintaining Hemoglobin Level Within 1 Gram/Deciliter of Baseline Value</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Maintenance of Hb levels was to be evaluated for participants on Erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) with Hb levels 10-12 g/dL. None of the participants in the enrolled population had received treatment with other ESAs and had pre-therapy Hb level as 10 g/dL or above. Therefore, the percentage of participants who had received treatment with other ESAs and were maintaining Hb level within 1 g/dL of baseline value during the study could not be evaluated. Baseline is defined as Week 0.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Correction of anemia was evaluated in participants with Hb &lt; 10 g/dL at enrollment. Hemoglobin levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 24. The percentage of participants achieving the target Hb range (10-12 g/dL) at least once during the study is presented.</description>

    <measure>Mean Time Spent in the Hemoglobin Target Range (10 - 12 Gram/Deciliter)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Hb concentration was recorded for all the participants at enrollment and different time points throughout the study up to Week 24. The mean time spent (in weeks) by the participants in the target range (10 - 12 g/dL) is presented.</description>

    <measure>Mean Dose of C.E.R.A. Administered</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The mean dose of C.E.R.A. administered during the study is reported. This accounts for the study drug injected through subcutaneous route at a frequency of every 4 weeks or once a month and every 2 weeks or fortnightly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Doses of C.E.R.A. Administered by Different Routes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The number of doses of C.E.R.A. administered by the intravenous or subcutaneous route is presented. The number of doses for total population is calculated by summation and presented in table below as per routes of administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Received Concomitant Treatment for Anemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Medications that were used during the study treatment period (from the date of first dose of study medication to the end of the study) were included as concomitant medications. The number of participants taking concomitant medications prescribed for the treatment of anemia (for example iron) is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions which worsened during this study were reported as AEs. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>Participants with chronic renal anemia Stage III-IV, not on dialysis, will be administered Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator (C.E.R.A.) according to routine clinical practice and will be followed up for the treatment duration of 24 weeks (6 months).

Dosing instructions as per the local label are - For correction of anemia: 0.6 microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg) of C.E.R.A. once every two weeks, and for Maintenance of hemoglobin (Hb) levels: Conversion to C.E.R.A. dose (120, 200, or 360 mcg either once monthly; or 60, 100, or 180 mcg once every 2 weeks) depending on the previous weekly epoetin or darbepoetin dose.</description>

        <description>Correction of anemia was evaluated in participants with Hb &lt; 10 gram/deciliter (g/dL). Hemoglobin levels were recorded for each participant at enrollment and at different time points during the study up to Week 24. The mean time required to achieve target Hb range (10-12 g/dL) was calculated using the following formula: Time to achieve target range = (Date of Hb evaluation when participant achieves target range at first time ‚Äì visit date of first dosing) + 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions which worsened during this study were reported as AEs. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

            <description>Participants with chronic renal anemia Stage III-IV, not on dialysis, were administered C.E.R.A. according to routine clinical practice and were followed for the treatment duration of 24 weeks (6 months). Dosing and titration of C.E.R.A. treatment was at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with local clinical practice or prescribing information. Dosing instructions as per the local label were - For correction of anemia: 0.6 mcg/kg of C.E.R.A. once every two weeks, and for Maintenance of Hb levels: Conversion to C.E.R.A. dose (120, 200, or 360 mcg either once monthly; or 60, 100, or 180 mcg once every 2 weeks) depending on the previous weekly epoetin or darbepoetin dose.</description>
