  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cartilage pathology has grown due to the ageing population, and the increase
      in sports participation and its associated trauma. The aim of the treatment of symptomatic
      osteoarthritis consists in reducing pain and improving the knee function in order to limit
      the sport, professional and social negative impact in the youngest patients.

      The symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis associates painkillers and non steroid anti
      inflammatory drugs (nsad). In case of ineffectiveness of the oral drugs intra articular
      injections are proposed.

      Intra articular injections of hyaluronic acid are recommended by the American College of
      Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism for the treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis. Nevertheless their efficacy remain non predictable in patients so as the
      duration of clinical improvement which does not exceed 6 months.

      The articular cartilage has a limited capacity for self-repair due to the low mitotic
      activity of chondrocytes and its avascularity.

      Platelet-rich plasma is a natural concentrate of growth factors: PDGF, TGF b, IGF-1, FGF and
      the cytokines, liberated by platelet degranulation. The influence of these growth factors in
      the cartilage repair is being widely investigated in vivo and in vitro. These factors could
      stimulate the chondral reparation via a neovascularization, a collagen synthesis and an
      activation of the chondrocytes.

      The hypothesis is that the intra articular injection of PRP, with its capacity to enhance
      articular cartilage repair, could be a therapeutic alternative to hyaluronic acid in the
      treatment of knee osteoarthritis resisting the oral drugs.

      Material and methods: We intend to conduct a comparative, monocentric prospective randomized,
      double-blind study on 80 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis to compare the results
      of 2 intra articular treatment: platelet-rich plasma and hyaluronic acid.
