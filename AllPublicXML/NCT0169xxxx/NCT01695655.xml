      Corneal transplantation is the most commonly performed human tissue transplant worldwide.
      Over 40,000 corneal transplants occur in the US each year. .

      This study will determine specific corneal neovascularization (CN) patterns in human corneal
      allograft recipients to determine the characteristics that worsen the prognosis for graft
      survival. We will test the hypothesis that specific characteristics of CN are prognostic for
      corneal allograft rejection.

      The investigators hope to enroll 240 subjects into the study. These patients will be enrolled
      prior to penetrating keratoplasty. They will be examined by the full protocol preoperatively,
      and postoperatively at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. During these visits slit lamp
      biomicroscopy will be used to study CN patterns, and take slit lamp photographs if there is
      any neovascularization detected, permitting us to develop algorithms of CN characteristics
      that are predictive for corneal allograft rejection and failure. The corneal tissue removed
      during these patients' surgeries will be evaluated histopathologically to identify
      inflammation and neovascularization to confirm and compare to what is seen clinically. There
      will be two short questionnaires conducted at each visit to assess stress levels.
