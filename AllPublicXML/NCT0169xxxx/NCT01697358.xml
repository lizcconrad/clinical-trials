    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
      using the Medtronic Specify® 5-6-5 multicolumn surgical lead plus optimal medical management
      (OMM) versus OMM alone in patients suffering from predominant low back pain due to failed
      back surgery syndrome (FBSS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has a multi-center, prospective, randomized (1:1), open-label, parallel-group
      design of two alternative treatments:

        -  SCS group (SCS+OMM)

        -  OMM group

    <intervention_model_description>Period I (from randomization to 6 months) is the randomized parallel group comparative phase. Day zero for the study is the point of randomization. The randomization ratio is 1:1 (SCS+OMM to OMM). For the SCS+OMM arm, the screening test and/or implant occurred after randomization. Period II (6 to 24 months) is the long-term observational follow-up phase.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Compare Proportion of Subjects With ≥50% Reduction in Low Back Pain Intensity Between the Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the proportion of subjects with a ≥50% reduction in low back pain intensity, as measured by the NPRS, from baseline to the end of Period I in the SCS group with that in the OMM group. Subjects reported average low back pain using a 11-point NPRS pain diary (0 = no back pain, 10 = worst low back pain imaginable) two times per day for a 7-day period at baseline and prior to 6-month visit. Percent reduction in low back pain intensity was calculated as average NPRS at (6-month visit - baseline) / baseline. Subjects with ≥50% reduction in average low back pain were considered as responders.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare Change in Low Back Pain Intensity, as Measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Between the Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Compare change in low back pain intensity, as measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), from baseline to the end of Period I for subjects in the SCS group with that in the OMM group. Subjects reported average low back pain using a 11-point NPRS pain diary (0 = no back pain, 10 = worst low back pain imaginable) two times per day for a 7-day period at baseline and prior to 6-month visit. Change in low back pain intensity is calculated as NPRS at baseline - NPRS at 6-month visit, with a positive change indicated as an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare Change in Leg Pain Intensity, as Measured by the NPRS, Between the Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Compare change in leg pain intensity, as measured by the NPRS, from baseline to the end of Period I for subjects in the SCS group with that in the OMM group. Subjects reported average leg pain using a 11-point NPRS pain diary (0 = no back pain, 10 = worst low back pain imaginable) two times per day for a 7-day period at baseline and prior to 6-month visit. Change in leg pain intensity is calculated as NPRS at baseline - NPRS at 6-month visit, with a positive change indicated as an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare Change in Functional Disability, as Measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Between the Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is a validated questionnaire of 10 subject-reported sections on the ability to perform activities of daily living. These 10 sections are pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life (if applicable), social life, and traveling. Each section was scored on a 0 to 5 scale with 0 indicating no limitation of function due to pain and 5 indicating major functional disability due to back pain. A raw ODI score was calculated from the total score of 10 sections (minimum is 0 and maximum is 50). This ODI raw score was then normalized to a scale of 0 to 100, with 0-20 categorized as minimal disability, 20-40 as moderate disability, 40-60 as severe disability, 60-80 as severely disabled, and 80-100 as bed-bound patients. The ODI was assessed at baseline and subsequent scheduled study visits. Change in functional disability is calculated as ODI at baseline - ODI at 6-month visit, with a positive change indicated as an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare Change in Quality of Life (QoL), as Measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS), Between the Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The QoL scores were collected using the SF-36 questionnaire, which included the scores in the following 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health. The raw score of 0 represents poor health and 100 represents best health. The Physical Component Summary (PCS) score is a norm based score calculated from the raw scores of these 8 domains with a focus on physical health using 1998 US population. Change in PCS is calculated as PCS at 6-month visit - PCS at baseline, with a positive change indicated as an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Compare Proportion of Subjects With ≥30% Reduction in Low Back Pain Intensity Between the Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This additional analysis was pre-specified to support the analysis of primary objective. The 30% responder which is defined in the following paragraph was considered as clinical relevant to the SCS therapy in back pain. Compare the proportion of subjects with a ≥30% reduction in low back pain intensity, as measured by the NPRS, from baseline to the end of Period I in the SCS group with that in the OMM group. Subjects reported average low back pain using a 11-point NPRS pain diary (0 = no back pain, 10 = worst low back pain imaginable) two times per day for a 7-day period at baseline and prior to 6-month visit. Percent reduction in low back pain intensity was calculated as average NPRS at (6-month visit - baseline) / baseline. Subjects with ≥30% reduction in average low back pain were considered as 30% responders.</description>

          <title>SCS + OMM</title>
          <description>Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) using multicolumn surgical lead + Optimal Medical Management (OMM): In addition to the OMM described under the OMM group, subjects underwent an SCS screening test and, if successful, received an INS implant. Any SCS group subject not implanted continued to be treated with OMM and were followed as part of the SCS group.</description>

          <title>OMM Alone</title>
          <description>Optimal Medical Management (OMM) alone: Pain treatment was evaluated, and medical management of subjects’ pain was optimized. The investigator and subject determined an individual OMM treatment plan, which should include non-investigational pharmacologic agents (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, opioid analgesics or tramadol, antiepileptics, or lidocaine) and/or interventional therapies (e.g., therapeutic injections, radiofrequency, acupuncture, and physical therapy) as appropriate. Excluded from OMM is intrathecal drug delivery (IDD), peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS; not an approved indication in the USA), back surgery at the location related to the subject’s original back pain complaint and experimental therapies. Data regarding pain treatments implemented during the study were collected to reveal how medical management was optimized.</description>

        <description>Compare the proportion of subjects with a ≥50% reduction in low back pain intensity, as measured by the NPRS, from baseline to the end of Period I in the SCS group with that in the OMM group. Subjects reported average low back pain using a 11-point NPRS pain diary (0 = no back pain, 10 = worst low back pain imaginable) two times per day for a 7-day period at baseline and prior to 6-month visit. Percent reduction in low back pain intensity was calculated as average NPRS at (6-month visit - baseline) / baseline. Subjects with ≥50% reduction in average low back pain were considered as responders.</description>

        <title>Compare Change in Functional Disability, as Measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Between the Treatment Groups</title>
        <description>ODI is a validated questionnaire of 10 subject-reported sections on the ability to perform activities of daily living. These 10 sections are pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life (if applicable), social life, and traveling. Each section was scored on a 0 to 5 scale with 0 indicating no limitation of function due to pain and 5 indicating major functional disability due to back pain. A raw ODI score was calculated from the total score of 10 sections (minimum is 0 and maximum is 50). This ODI raw score was then normalized to a scale of 0 to 100, with 0-20 categorized as minimal disability, 20-40 as moderate disability, 40-60 as severe disability, 60-80 as severely disabled, and 80-100 as bed-bound patients. The ODI was assessed at baseline and subsequent scheduled study visits. Change in functional disability is calculated as ODI at baseline - ODI at 6-month visit, with a positive change indicated as an improvement.</description>

            <description>Optimal Medical Management (OMM) alone: Pain treatment was evaluated, and medical management of subjects’ pain was optimized. The investigator and subject determined an individual OMM treatment plan, which should include non-investigational pharmacologic agents (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, opioid analgesics or tramadol, antiepileptics, or lidocaine) and/or interventional therapies (e.g., therapeutic injections, radiofrequency, acupuncture, and physical therapy) as appropriate. Excluded from OMM is intrathecal drug delivery (IDD), peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS; not an approved indication in the USA), back surgery at the location related to the subject’s original back pain complaint and experimental therapies. Data regarding pain treatments implemented during the study were collected to reveal how medical management was optimized.</description>

          <title>Compare Change in Quality of Life (QoL), as Measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS), Between the Treatment Groups</title>
          <description>The QoL scores were collected using the SF-36 questionnaire, which included the scores in the following 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health. The raw score of 0 represents poor health and 100 represents best health. The Physical Component Summary (PCS) score is a norm based score calculated from the raw scores of these 8 domains with a focus on physical health using 1998 US population. Change in PCS is calculated as PCS at 6-month visit - PCS at baseline, with a positive change indicated as an improvement.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) - included all randomized subjects and analyzed as randomized, regardless the subjects' status at 6 months. Subjects in the SCS+OMM group received screening tests after the randomization, and might not have proceeded to implant of the neurostimulator. Subjects with missing data at 6 months were imputed as having no change.</population>

        <description>This additional analysis was pre-specified to support the analysis of primary objective. The 30% responder which is defined in the following paragraph was considered as clinical relevant to the SCS therapy in back pain. Compare the proportion of subjects with a ≥30% reduction in low back pain intensity, as measured by the NPRS, from baseline to the end of Period I in the SCS group with that in the OMM group. Subjects reported average low back pain using a 11-point NPRS pain diary (0 = no back pain, 10 = worst low back pain imaginable) two times per day for a 7-day period at baseline and prior to 6-month visit. Percent reduction in low back pain intensity was calculated as average NPRS at (6-month visit - baseline) / baseline. Subjects with ≥30% reduction in average low back pain were considered as 30% responders.</description>
