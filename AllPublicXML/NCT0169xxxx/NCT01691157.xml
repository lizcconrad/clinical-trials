  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of an evidence based exercise
      program for shoulder impingement. Approximately 1% of adults consult their General
      Practitioner (GP) with shoulder pain each year, making it the third most common reason for
      musculoskeletal GP consultations in the UK. A further 50% of these patients are diagnosed
      with subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) (shoulder impingement syndrome) and commonly
      referred for physiotherapy treatment. This trial aims to compare the effectiveness of an
      evidence based exercise protocol with usual physiotherapy care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapy management of shoulder impingement frequently involves exercise, however there
      is little evidence underpinning exercise prescription and outcomes are poor. Few trials have
      investigated which muscles should be targeted and how they should be strengthened with
      respect to the mode, frequency, duration, intensity and progression. This is a randomized
      controlled trial(RCT) investigating the effectiveness of an evidence based exercise program
      for shoulder impingement. This research may have an impact on how physiotherapists provide
      exercise programs to patients with shoulder impingement.
