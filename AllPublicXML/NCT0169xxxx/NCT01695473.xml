    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, study of BKM120 in patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer.
      Eligible patients will be enrolled and scheduled to have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the
      prostate to confirm high-risk disease and collect prostate tissue for analysis. Two weeks
      after the biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given at
      this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy at University of
      California, San Francisco. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last
      dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be tken after the radical prostatectomy.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, prospective, pharmacodynamic study of BKM120 in high-risk, localized
      prostate cancer. After informed consent and central pathology review of the core prostate
      biopsy, eligible patients will be enrolled and scheduled to have an ultrasound-guided biopsy
      of the prostate to confirm high-risk disease and collect tissue for molecular analysis. Two
      weeks after the biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given
      at this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy at University
      of California, San Francisco. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last
      dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be administered after radical prostatectomy.

      Up to 24 patients, or 21 evaluable patients, will be enrolled through the Department of
      Urology or Genitourinary Medical Oncology at the University of California, San Francisco for
      this pharmacodynamic study. Toxicity will be assessed during BKM120 administration, and will
      involve a clinic visit on Day 14 ± 2 (i.e. before surgery). Follow-up with safety evaluations
      will be at 90 ± 7 days post-operatively and involve a toxicity questionnaire, blood tests,
      and clinic visit. Toxicity will be monitored and reported using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria
      version 4.0 guidelines.

      A patient symptom diary will be distributed to each patient at baseline for symptom
      self-recording and BKM120 dose self-administration. In addition, a patient identifier card
      (wallet-sized) will be distributed to each patient after informed consent and registration.
      This information will contain the patient's age, study name and number, investigator and
      study coordinator contact information, and expected adverse events that may be present as a
      result of BKM120 administration.

        albumin) within normal limits (biphosphonate use for malignant hypercalcemia control is not
        allowed) 9. Magnesium ≥ the lower limit of normal 10. Potassium within normal limits for
        the institution 11. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
        within normal range 12. Serum bilirubin within normal range (or total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN
        with direct bilirubin within normal range in patients with well documented Gilbert
        Syndrome) 13. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or 24-hour clearance ≥ 50 mL/min 14. Serum
        amylase ≤ ULN 15. Serum lipase ≤ ULN 16. Fasting plasma glucose ≤ 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L)
        17. INR ≤ 2 18. Men of reproductive potential and their female partners must use highly
        effective contraception during treatment, for 5 half-lives (8 days) after stopping
        treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug discontinuation)
        and should not father a child in this period The highly effective contraception is defined
        as either:

          1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          2. Sterilization: Female partners have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
             without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed
             by follow up hormone level assessment.

          3. Male participant sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
             the absence of sperm in the ejaculate).

          4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

               1. Female partner with prior placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or
                  intrauterine system (IUS)

               2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

                    -  Oral contraception use by female partners, injected or implanted hormonal
                       methods are not allowed as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of
                       hormonal contraceptives.

                    -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving
                       offspring must use condom during treatment, for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after
                       stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after
                       study drug discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period.

        19. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          4. Hormonal therapy with GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists or high dose biclutamide within
             1 month of enrollment unless serum testosterone is within normal limits.

          5. Following mood disorders as judged by the investigator and/or symptom management
             service co-investigator, or as a result of patient's mood assessment questionnaire:

               -  Medically documented history of or active major depressive episode, bipolar
                  disorder (I or II), obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of

         11. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of BKM120 (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea,
