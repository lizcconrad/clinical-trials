  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that lung hyperinflation
      contributes to cardiac dysfunction in COPD and that the treatment of lung deflation with
      FF/VI Inhalation Powder 100/25 mcg administered once daily (QD) will result in the reversal
      of this cardiac dysfunction compared with placebo. This will be assessed by measures of right
      and left global and regional systolic and diastolic cardiac function as assessed using a 30
      minute CMR.

      A secondary objective will be to investigate the effect of FF/VI inhalation powder 100/25mcg
      QD on measures of arterial stiffness in the form of pulse wave analysis and distensability in
      the pulmonary and systemic circulation.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a Phase IIIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over,
      single-centre study to investigate the acute effects of FF/VI inhalation powder 100/25mcg QD
      in lung deflation on cardiac biventricular function and arterial stiffness in adults with
      COPD.

      Subjects will visit the clinic a minimum of 4 times over a 28-day period with a further
      contact which can be either a telephone contact or clinic visit (Visit/Contact 4). A 7-day
      run-in period will be followed by two 7-day (maximum 14-day) treatment periods separated by a
      7(±2) day wash-out period. The first dose of treatment will be taken the day after
      randomisation. A safety Follow-up contact (either visit or telephone) will occur 7(±2) days
      post the last treatment day.

      Subjects will be prescribed appropriate COPD therapy at the end of Treatment Visit 5, if
      required. There are no plans to provide the study drug for compassionate use following study
      completion.

      It is planned to have 44 completed evaluable subjects. Subjects who withdraw early will be
      replaced. In order to ensure 44 evaluable subjects, assuming a 10% protocol deviation rate,
      49 subjects will be randomised. The total duration of subject participation, including the
      follow-up period, will be approximately 36 days.

    <time_frame>Baseline and end of Treatment Period (7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>RVEDVI is a measure of the volume of blood in the right ventricle at the end of diastole, normalized over body surface area and was measured using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging. RVEDVI is calculated as the right ventricular end diastolic volume (RDEDV) divided by the body surface area (BSA). The change from Baseline in RVEDVI was analyzed using a mixed model analysis with period, treatment group, and Baseline RVEDVI fitted as fixed effects and participants fitted as a random effect. The Baseline is defined as the assessment performed pre-dose at Day 1 of Treatment Period 1. The change from Baseline is calculated as the RVEDVI value at the end of each treatment period minus the Baseline value. The Per Protocol (PP) Population was comprised of all participants in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) Population not identified as having deviations considered to impact the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Right Ventricular End Diastolic Volume Index (RVEDVI) at the End of the Overall Treatment Period</title>
        <description>RVEDVI is a measure of the volume of blood in the right ventricle at the end of diastole, normalized over body surface area and was measured using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging. RVEDVI is calculated as the right ventricular end diastolic volume (RDEDV) divided by the body surface area (BSA). The change from Baseline in RVEDVI was analyzed using a mixed model analysis with period, treatment group, and Baseline RVEDVI fitted as fixed effects and participants fitted as a random effect. The Baseline is defined as the assessment performed pre-dose at Day 1 of Treatment Period 1. The change from Baseline is calculated as the RVEDVI value at the end of each treatment period minus the Baseline value. The Per Protocol (PP) Population was comprised of all participants in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) Population not identified as having deviations considered to impact the primary efficacy analysis.</description>
