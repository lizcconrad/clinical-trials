  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is primarily designed to investigate whether treatment with vitamin D may influence
      migraine in a placebo-controlled, blinded study. The hypothesis is that vitamin D may serve
      as a prophylactic treatment of migraine. The hypothesis is tested by examining the changes in
      the pain and symptom patterns associated with migraine by treatment with Vitamin D, by means
      of quantitative sensory testing, diaries and blood samples for measurement of vitamin D.
      Other pain biomarkers are also measured to evaluate whether the levels of these biomarkers in
      the blood is changed by the treatment with vitamin D. The hypothesis here is that levels of
      those biomarkers will change following the treatment.
