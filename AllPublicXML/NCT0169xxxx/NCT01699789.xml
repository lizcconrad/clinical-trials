      CPIC is a community initiative and research study funded by the NIH. CPIC was developed and
      is being run by community and academic partners in Los Angeles underserved communities of
      color. CPIC compares two ways of supporting diverse health and social programs in
      under-resourced communities to improve their services to depressed clients. One approach is
      time-limited expert technical assistance coupled with culturally-competent community outreach
      to individual programs, on how to use quality improvement toolkits for depression that have
      already been proven to be effective or helpful in primary care settings, but adapted for this
      study for use in diverse community-based programs in underserved communities. The other
      approach brings different types of agencies and members in a community together in a 4 to
      6-month planning process, to fit the same depression quality improvement programs to the
      needs and strengths of the community and to develop a network of programs serving the
      community to support clients with depression together. The study is designed to determine the
      added value of community engagement and planning over and above what might be offered through
      a community-oriented, disease management company. Both intervention models are based on the
      same quality improvement toolkits that support team leadership, care management, Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy, medication management, and patient education and activation.
      Investigators hypothesized that the community engagement approach would increase agency and
      clinician participation in evidence-based trainings and improve client mental health-related
      quality of life. In addition, during the design phase, community participants prioritized
      adding as outcomes indicators of social determinants of mental health, including physical
      functioning, risk factors for homelessness and employment. Investigators hypothesized by
      activating community agencies that can address health and social services needs to engage
      depressed clients, these outcomes would also be improved more in the collaboration condition.
      Investigators also hypothesized that the collaboration approach would increase use of
      services.

    <textblock>
      Underserved communities of color in low income, largely ethnic-minority neighborhoods face an
      excessive burden of illness from depression due to higher prevalence of depression and lower
      access to quality care. Evidence-based quality improvement (QI) programs for depression in
      primary care settings—where many low-income and minority patients receive their only mental
      health care—can enhance quality of depression care and improve health outcomes. These
      programs are under-utilized in community-based health care settings, and have not been
      adapted for use across diverse agencies (social service, faith based, primary and specialty
      care) that could partner to support disease management for depression. Partners in Care
      (PIC)and WE Care are interventions designed to improve access to evidence-based depression
      treatments (medication management or psychotherapy) for primary care patients and, in WE
      Care, social service clients. PIC evaluated a services delivery intervention while WE Care
      was an effectiveness trial with study-provided treatments. Both studies promoted use of the
      same evidence-based treatments. Both PIC and WE Care programs improved use of evidence-based
      treatments for depression and health outcomes for African Americans and Latinos. The PIC
      interventions reduced health outcome disparities evident in usual care in the first follow-up
      year and at five-year follow-up. While these findings offer hope to underserved communities,
      such communities have poor resources to support implementation of these programs, and may
      have historical distrust in research and health care settings. There is no evidence-based
      approach to support agency networks in underserved communities in implementing QI programs
      for depression. To address this information gap, investigators created Community Partners in
      Care (CPIC), a group-level randomized, controlled trial, with randomization at the level of
      an agency site or &quot;unit.&quot; The trial is being fielded in two underserved communities,
      Hollywood and South Los Angeles, and conducted through a community- participatory, partnered
      research (CPPR) approach.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To engage two underserved communities in improving safety-net care for depression.

        2. To examine the effects of a community-engagement approach to implementing evidence-based
           depression quality improvement toolkits (PIC/WE Care) through a community collaborative
           network across services sectors, compared to technical assistance to individual programs
           from the same services sectors coupled with culturally-competent outreach to implement
           the same toolkits. The outcomes are: a) client access to care, quality of care and
           health outcomes, with the primary outcome being mental-health related quality of life
           and additional outcomes reflecting social determinants of mental health of interest to
           the community (physical health, homelessness risk factors, employment); b) services
           utilization and costs; c) agency adoption of PIC/WE Care; d) and provider attitudes,
           knowledge and practice.

        3. To describe the process of implementation of the community engagement intervention.

      CPIC was awarded funds from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in 2013
      to accomplish the following 3 aims:

        1. To compare the long-term (3-year) effectiveness of community engagement and planning
           versus agency technical assistance to implement depression QI and improve depressed
           clients' health status and risk for homelessness

        2. To determine how depressed clients in under-resourced communities prioritize diverse
           health and social outcomes and identify their preferences for services to address
           priority outcomes

        3. To identify capacities of providers to respond to depressed clients' priorities and to
           generate recommendations for building capacity to better address clients'priorities.

      We hypothesize that community engagement and planning will be more effective than technical
      assistance in improving 3-year outcomes and that clients will prioritize quality of life. We
      expect to find gaps in provider capacities to address client priorities that network
      strategies could address.

      Our primary outcome for the long-term follow-up is mental health related quality of life and
      secondary outcomes are use of healthcare and community services for depression and physical
      functioning and homeless risk factors.

      In 2014, CPIC was awarded funds from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health
      Disparities (NIMHD) to use existing quantitative CPIC data and collect new qualitative data
      to describe pathways to reducing disparities. The funding allows us to longitudinally track
      the implementation of the CEP model in a new county-wide initiative to develop community
      networks to promote healthy neighborhoods. The aims under this additional funding are:

        1. To determine pathways to reducing mental health and social disparities by conducting
           community-academic partnered analyses of CPIC data by 1) examining intervention effects
           for disparity subgroups (African Americans, Latinos, gender groups, insurance and
           housing status groups); 2) identifying predictors and mediators of barriers to
           access/services and client outcomes; 3) analyzing intervention effects on provider
           workforce diversity; and 4) generating explanatory models for intervention effects and
           their sustainability by interviewing CPIC administrators and providers, as well as prior
           and current clients.

        2. To explore the generalizability and replicability of the CPIC partnered model and, more
           broadly, to inform the process of incorporating science into policy by conducting a
           longitudinal case study of the CEP model implementation in a county-wide &quot;neighborhood
           health&quot; initiative in Los Angeles to reduce mental health and social disparities.

      As a result of this study, we will be able to explain how community-engaged and participatory
      models of intervention implementation can reduce health and social disparities and ultimately
      achieve public health impact. Study findings will be disseminated widely using traditional
      academic, community-valued, and policy-relevant dissemination channels.

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support.

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support.

            <description>RS offers time-limited technical assistance to individual agencies and outreach from a community engagement specialty, to review components of the QI Program Intervention as implemented by the RS Expert Team.
QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

            <description>CEP supports 4 months of planning for the CEP Council of representatives from assigned programs in biweekly 2-hr meetings to fit trainings in the QI Program to the community and develop strategies across programs to collaborate as a network. The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

            <description>RS offers time-limited technical assistance to individual agencies and outreach from a community engagement specialty, to review components of the QI Program Intervention as implemented by the RS Expert Team.
QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

            <description>CEP supports 4 months of planning for the CEP Council of representatives from assigned programs in biweekly 2-hr meetings to fit trainings in the QI Program to the community and develop strategies across programs to collaborate as a network. The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>
