  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study aims to investigate the utility of Pivotal Response Treatment
      (PRT), a behaviorally derived intervention, to improve the quality and frequency of
      communication and social engagement of toddlers with siblings who have an autism spectrum
      disorder (SIBS - ASD) and who demonstrate developmental delays and impairments in social
      interaction between 12 and 15 months of age.

Attendance. Attendance to parent education sessions will be recorded by the therapist.
Parent utilization. To assess the acceptability of the PRT approach, parents will be asked to keep a weekly log of procedure use, including overall estimated duration and choice of activities.</description>
