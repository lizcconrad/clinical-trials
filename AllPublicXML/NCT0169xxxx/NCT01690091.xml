  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of metformin on myocardial function, insulin
      resistance and selected metabolic markers in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure
      (HF+DM+) in a cross-over, randomized, placebo controlled trial.

      Hypothesis:

      Metformin treatment in HF+DM+ group will lead to better myocardial function and load
      tolerance in comparison to placebo. The degree of improvement will be linked to selected
      metabolic parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients with HF and DM without previous diabetes treatment will be randomized into 2
      groups (A succession: MET-placebo, B succession: placebo-MET) - stratified randomization with
      following parameters weighted: HF etiology (ischemic /non-ischemic), diabetes duration,
      gender, BMI, age, NYHA, smoker/non-smoker). After 3 months the treatment will be switched.
      All participants will undergo standardized selection of metabolic and cardiovascular tests
      (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with indirect calorimetry, measurement of endothelial
      function, echocardiography, spiroergometry, proton/phosphor MR spectroscopy, adipose tissue
      biopsy, selected cytokines in plasma and adipose tissue at the beginning and the end of each
      intervention period (3 times in total).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. chronic heart failure will be defined by the following criteria (all must be
             included):

               -  diagnosis of HF known for at least 6 months
