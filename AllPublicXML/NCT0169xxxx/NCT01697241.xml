  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that patients with severe hip osteoarthritis
      postpone time to hip replacement surgery following participation in a patient education and
      supervised exercise program when compared to patients receiving patient education alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip replacements are performed at an increasing rate, also in younger and less disabled
      patients. Recent studies indicate non-surgical interventions being effective in reducing pain
      and disability also at later stages of disease when hip replacement is considered. Possible,
      non-surgical treatments can be used to postpone hip replacement. The effect of education and
      supervised exercise on time to hip replacement is largely unknown

    <description>Cost-effectiveness analysis will be estimated as the ratio between cost of the intervention and the effect it produces. The total cost will be estimated from register-based costing of primary care, secondary care and patient's out-of-pocket costs (transportation expenses and time spent on transportation and receiving health care). Patient-reported values are weighted using Danish tariffs</description>

    <description>The entire duration of the intervention is 12 weeks, and consists of 24 sessions each lasting 60-70 minutes. Patients will receive two types of exercises, delivered on separate days. One type of exercise is individualized, goal-based neuromuscular training (NEMEX) in groups with progression guided by the patient's neuromuscular function (12 sessions). The other type of exercise is individualized, intensive resistance training (RT) in groups with each exercise progression guided by load (12 sessions).</description>

    <description>Patients in the exercise groups will receive two types of exercise, delivered on separate days. One type of exercise is individualized, goal-based neuromuscular training (NEMEX-TJR) in groups with progression guided by the patient's neuromuscular function. The other type of exercise is individualized, intensive resistance training (RT) in groups with each exercise progression guided by load. Each of the two types of exercise will be offered weekly during the 12 week intervention period in sessions lasting 60-70 minutes. Thus, the entire exercise intervention consists of 24 sessions</description>
