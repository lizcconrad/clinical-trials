    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that there is a statistically significant decrease of
      Natriuretic Hormone Peptides (NHPs) in subjects with asthma exacerbation compared to levels
      following treatment of an exacerbation of asthma.

      Overall Study Design

        1. Measurement of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides in individuals suffering from exacerbation
           of asthma.

        2. Measurement of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides 5-7 days after initiation of treatment of
           exacerbation of asthma.

        3. Measurement of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides 10-14 days after initiation of treatment of
           exacerbation of asthma.

      3 comparisons of Natriuretic Hormone Peptides levels will be made:

        1. Exacerbation compared to 5-7 days after initiation of treatment

        2. Exacerbation compared to 10-14 days after initiation of treatment

        3. 5-7 days after initiation of treatment compared to 10-14 days after initiation of
           treatment.

      Samples of blood will be secured in the Division of Allergy/Immunology at the University of
      South Florida, Joy McCann Culverhouse Airways Disease Center. All samples will be
      appropriately coded to maintain confidentiality. Blood specimens will be held at minus 20
      degrees Celsius.
