  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope is a common problem that many clinicians may encounter in various outpatient
      settings. Neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) is a benign condition characterized by a self
      limited episode of systemic hypotension. Patients are usually managed with education on
      syncope, anxiety management, and coping skills.

      It has been established that practice of Yoga could relieve stress and anxiety. In a
      different study, they also found that Yoga positively influences cardiovascular function by
      decreasing the heart rate and blood pressure. The main objective of Yoga is to achieve
      control over the autonomic nervous system and able to control functions like heart rate,
      blood pressure and respiratory rate.

      Based on the findings that Yoga relieves stress and reduces heart rate, the investigators
      propose to study if Yoga can decrease the frequency of NCS and also reduce the symptoms
      associated with these episodes.
