  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite good vaccination coverage, included in national immunization programs in developed
      countries, the number of reported pertussis cases is rising, also in very young infants.
      Current immunization strategies fail to protect infants too young to be immunized with the
      licensed vaccine. Different strategies are possible to close the gap of susceptibility
      between the loss of maternal antibodies and protection by vaccination. The main aim of the
      present study is to measure the influence of an adult pertussis booster in pregnant women, on
      the titer and duration of maternal antibodies in their infants. Early humoral immunity will
      be assessed and the influence on vaccine response of the infant measured. The present study
      offers the opportunity to have new insights in neonatal immunological mechanisms against
      pertussis and a better understanding in strategies to protect infants against pertussis.

    <measure>Assessment of pneumococcal immune response in infants whose mothers received Tdap vaccination during pregnancy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The present trial on pertussis vaccination during pregnancy, offers the opportunity to add evidence for a possible blunting effect of infant immune responses to pneumococcal infant vaccination after maternal Tdap vaccination. Pneumococcal antibodies will be measured in serum samples taken from infants after a primary series of 2 pneumococcal vaccine doses (2 and 4 months of age) and after a third vaccine dose (at 12 months of age). Infants are born from either vaccinated or unvaccinated mothers.</description>

          -  Received already a pertussis vaccination during pregnancy, as advised by gynaecologist
             or general practitioner.
