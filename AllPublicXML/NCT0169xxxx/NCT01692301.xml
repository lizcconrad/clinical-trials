    <textblock>
      The study examined the efficacy of LCZ696 in comparison to the ARB olmesartan on Central
      Aortic Systolic Blood Pressure (CASP) and other measures of central hemodynamics and arterial
      stiffness in elderly patients with an elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and widened
      pulse pressure (PP).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Central Aortic Systolic Pressure (CASP) at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Central aortic blood pressure was derived from peripheral pressure waveforms recorded noninvasively from the brachial artery using a cuff-based device. This technique uses the brachial pressure and a signal processing algorithm to transform brachial signals into central blood pressure (BP) waveforms. When the aortic pressure waveform was derived, key pulse wave analysis (PWA) parameters, such as CASP was calculated by the system software.
At the first study visit, the arm with the highest systolic blood pressure (SBP) was used for all subsequent PWA. Brachial PWA measurements were performed on the same arm that the office blood pressures were taken. Two pulse waveform measurements, meeting all quality control criteria were captured at baseline and at week 12 visits.</description>

    <description>Pulse wave velocity recordings were performed on patient while in a supine, face-up position.
Tonometry was performed on the carotid simultaneously with the cuff inflation over the femoral artery. Two pulse wave velocity measures, meeting all quality control criteria were captured at baseline, week 12 and week 52.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the first study visit, the patient had his/her blood pressure (BP) measured in both arms; the arm in which the highest sitting SBP was found was used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, SBP were measured 3 times using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1- to 2-minute intervals and the mean of those 3 measurements was used as the average sitting office BP for that visit.</description>

    <description>At the first study visit, the patient had his/her blood pressure (BP) measured in both arms; the arm in which the highest sitting SBP was found was used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, DBP were measured 3 times using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1- to 2-minute intervals and the mean of those 3 measurements was used as the average sitting office BP for that visit.</description>

    <description>An Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor (ABPM) measured a participant's blood pressure over a 24 hour period using an automated validated monitoring device at baseline, week 12 and at week 52 starting one day before each visit. The 24 hour maSBP was calculated by taking the mean of all ambulatory systolic blood pressure readings for the 24 hour period.</description>

    <description>Randomized patients received LCZ696 once daily for four weeks, then they force-titrated to a higher dose at Week 4 and stayed on this dose of LCZ696 once daily for the remainder of the treatment period. At week 12, patients with uncontrolled BP allowed to have amlodipine then hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) added at intervals of 4 weeks from Week 12 up to Week 24. To maintain the double dummy, double-blind design, 2 tablets (LCZ696, its matching placebo) and 1 capsule (olmesartan matching placebo) were given during the entire study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Central Aortic Systolic Pressure (CASP) at 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>Central aortic blood pressure was derived from peripheral pressure waveforms recorded noninvasively from the brachial artery using a cuff-based device. This technique uses the brachial pressure and a signal processing algorithm to transform brachial signals into central blood pressure (BP) waveforms. When the aortic pressure waveform was derived, key pulse wave analysis (PWA) parameters, such as CASP was calculated by the system software.
At the first study visit, the arm with the highest systolic blood pressure (SBP) was used for all subsequent PWA. Brachial PWA measurements were performed on the same arm that the office blood pressures were taken. Two pulse waveform measurements, meeting all quality control criteria were captured at baseline and at week 12 visits.</description>

        <description>At the first study visit, the patient had his/her blood pressure (BP) measured in both arms; the arm in which the highest sitting SBP was found was used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, SBP were measured 3 times using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1- to 2-minute intervals and the mean of those 3 measurements was used as the average sitting office BP for that visit.</description>

To maintain the double dummy, double-blind design, 2 tablets (LCZ696 matching placebo) and 1 capsule (olmesartan) were given during the entire study.</description>

          <description>At the first study visit, the patient had his/her blood pressure (BP) measured in both arms; the arm in which the highest sitting SBP was found was used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, SBP were measured 3 times using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1- to 2-minute intervals and the mean of those 3 measurements was used as the average sitting office BP for that visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean 24-hour Diastolic Blood Pressure (maDBP)</title>
        <description>An Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor (ABPM) measured a participant's blood pressure over a 24 hour period using an automated validated monitoring device at baseline, week 12 and at week 52 starting one day before each visit. The 24 hour maDBP was calculated by taking the mean of all ambulatory systolic blood pressure readings for the 24 hour period.</description>

            <description>Randomized patients received LCZ696 once daily for four weeks, then they force-titrated to a higher dose at Week 4 and stayed on this dose of LCZ696 once daily for the remainder of the treatment period. At week 12, patients with uncontrolled BP allowed to have amlodipine then hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) added at intervals of 4 weeks from Week 12 up to Week 24. To maintain the double dummy, double-blind design, 2 tablets (LCZ696, its matching placebo) and 1 capsule (olmesartan matching placebo) were given during the entire study.</description>
