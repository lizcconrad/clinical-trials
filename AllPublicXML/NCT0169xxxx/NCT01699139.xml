  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supine positioning was reported to increase upper airway collapsibility, apnea frequency and
      duration. Positional therapy, designed to minimize supine sleep, was reported to be
      beneficial in the general sleep apnea population. As supine sleep is very common in stroke
      patients, positional therapy might also have therapeutic effects. Given differences between
      stroke patients with sleep apnea and the general sleep apnea patient, such as rolling
      ability, body mass index and daytime sleepiness, positional therapy results in the general
      population may not be applicable to the stroke patient.

      The effects of positional therapy in ischemic stroke patients with OSA have not been
      well-investigated. We therefore performed a pilot randomized, controlled, cross-over study to
      test the following hypotheses: (1) positional therapy reduces the amount of nocturnal supine
      positioning in patients with subacute ischemic stroke, and (2) severity of sleep apnea
      improves, as reflected by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), during positional therapy. The
      tolerability of positional therapy over a 3-month period in patients with ischemic stroke was
      also evaluated.

      Phase 1:

      In the first phase, a randomized, controlled, two-period cross-over study design (AB/BA) was
      used with no washout period. After an acclimatization period (3 days), during which the
      compliance of the Positional Device was monitored, each patient was randomized into either
      Group I (sequence AB) or Group II (sequence BA). After commencement of treatment, the outcome
      measures were repeated on the last day of each treatment period. On the control night (B),
      subjects used the lumbar corset and were positioned ad lib.

      Phase 2:

      In the second phase of the study which began immediately after attainment of the first phase,
      subjects were randomized on a 1:1 basis, in a parallel group design, to 3 months of
      positional devices or sleeping ad lib. At 3 months later all subjects were interviewed face
      to face to determine the Barthel index and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression
      scale. Subjects in the positional devices group were also evaluated about devices adherence
      using the following questions: use of the device all nights, most nights, some nights, or no
      nights.

    <description>The shape of the pressure waveform of an artery provides a measure of arterial stiffness and can be assessed by the technique of pulse wave analysis. Radial artery pulse waveforms were recorded using a pressure tonometer and dedicated software as previously described (SphygmoCor; At-Cor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Augmentation index, which quantifies augmentation of central aortic pressure (due to the reflected component of the pulse pressure waveform) and typically increases with age as the arteries become less compliant, is then calculated as the difference between the second (P2) and first systolic peak pressure (P1), expressed as percentage of the central pulse pressure (PP):
Augmentation index (%) = ((P2-P1)/PP)Ã—100(1)</description>

    <description>The SphygmoCor System measures the pulse wave velocity of the blood pressure waveform travelling between any two arterial sites that can be measured non-invasively. The velocity of the blood pressure pulse waveform is dependent on the stiffness of the artery along which the pulse is travelling. Measurements are performed by recording pressure waveforms at the carotid artery followed by the femoral artery, with an ECG signal recorded simultaneously.</description>

    <description>Avoidance of supine positioning was achieved by use of the commercially available ZZoma Positional Device, which is the FDA cleared class II positional medical device. The device is 12 x 5.5 x 4 inches in size and made of lightweight semi-rigid synthetic foam. It is contained in the nylon material with an associated Velcro belt. Zzoma is a positioner worn around the upper torso to restrict patient movement from side to supine.</description>
