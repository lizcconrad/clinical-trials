  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to analyse the effect of perioperative systemic
      infusion of lignocaine on postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting and
      perioperative levels of inflammatory mediators in patients undergoing elective open abdominal
      surgeries.

      The secondary parameters which will be observed during the study are the time to passage of
      flatus and stools postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized into two groups- A and B, to receive an intravenous infusion of
      lignocaine or saline,respectively, as a bolus of 1.5mg/kg at the time of intubation followed
      by an infusion at a rate of 1.5mg/kg/hr continued throughout the surgery and till one hour
      postop. Postoperative analgesia will be provided through Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA)
      pump providing morphine. Postoperative pain scores will be noted at immediate postoperative
      and at 6, 18, 24 hours post surgery. The number of PCA demands and cumulative morphine
      consumption till 24 hours post surgery will be noted. The incidence of postoperative nausea
      and vomiting is recorded. The time to first passage of flatus and stools postoperatively will
      be noted. Levels of total leukocyte count, c-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6(IL-6)
      will be noted in preoperative, immediate post operative and 24 hours post surgery.
