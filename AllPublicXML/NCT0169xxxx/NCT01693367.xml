  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of Dynamic Locking Screws (DLS) used
      to stabilize the shaft component of distal femur fractures in comparison to standard locking
      screws (SLS). The hypothesis is that DLS will lead to better functional outcomes (WOMAC
      score) due to increased and more symmetrical callus formation and fewer non-unions.

    <description>The TUG measures the time (in seconds) that it takes for an individual to rise from an armchair (chair seat height = 45 cm / 1.5 feet), walk 3 meters (= 10 feet) to a line drawn on the floor, turn around and return to the chair. The time is measured from a seated position (back against the backrest) with a stopwatch started on the command &quot;ready - go&quot; and stopped when the seated position is reached again.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The multicenter international study enrolled patients with distal femur fractures which were either stabilize with a Dynamic Locking Screw or a standard locking screw. The study was stopped due to implant breakages observed after planned implant removals in non-study patients treated with the DLS 5.0mm.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Five patients signed the informed consent form and were enrolled in the study before it was terminated. Three of the five patients were post-enrollment drop-outs and only two patients completed all study follow-up visits.</pre_assignment_details>
