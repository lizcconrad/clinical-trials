      The objectives of this Phase I/II study are:

        1. To find out the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PG2 in patients with advanced malignancy
           receiving chemotherapy and to define a &quot;Study Dose&quot; for Phase II.

        2. To evaluate the hematopoietic and immunological responses after administering of PG2.
           Primarily to study the biological response of PG2, defined as WBC count in this study,
           and secondarily to study the immunological factors, IL-2, IL-6, TGF-beta, and G-CSF.

      This study is the first step for PG2 clinical development in Taiwan in order to further
      establish its safety and efficacy profile and to build the basis for larger trials.

    <description>For phase I study, the primary endpoint is to determine a safe dosage of PG2 by the dose escalation design.
For phase II study, the primary endpoint is to compare the WBC level between PG2 plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone.</description>
