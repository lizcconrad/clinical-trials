      This study is undertaken to determine the effect of intravitreal long acting dexamethasone
      implant,(Ozurdex®)in patients with diabetic macular edema.Diabetic macular edema is important
      cause of visual impairment in patients with diabetes mellitus. Focal/ grid laser
      photocoagulation is the standard of care in its management. Several adjuncts including
      intravitreal corticosteroids, Pegabtanib Sodium ,Ranibizumab, Bevacizumab, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, laser photocoagulation have been tried.
      Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide (TA), a water insoluble steroid, has been shown to
      reduce the retinal thickness and improve the visual acuity. However, recurrence of macular
      edema in patients who receive intravitreal TA is a major concern as the patients need
      multiple repeat injections because of its short half life. A more potent steroid,
      dexamethasone has also been tried as an alternative to TA for macular edema; however, its
      short half life of only 3 hours prevents its clinical application. In search for the ideal
      corticosteroid preparation, a Dexamethasone Posterior Segment Drug Delivery System
      (Dexamethasone DDS - Ozurdex®, Allergan Inc, Irvine, California) was recently developed.
      Promising results have been shown in certain patients with retinal vein occlusions, uveitis
      receiving this intravitreal drug delivery system with improvement in visual acuity. The
      present study introduces a novel concept of using Ozurdex ® implant in patients with diabetic
      macular edema.
