      The purpose of this study is to verify the function of p16 methylation diagnostic reagents in
      early diagnosis of oral cancer.

      Background:Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is one of the common precancerous lesions among
      Chinese adults. To investigate the clinical predictive value of p16 methylation diagnostic
      reagents in the early diagnosis of oral cancer, the investigators carried out the prospective
      multi-center double-blind cohort study.

      Methods:180 patients with histologically confirmed mild or moderate OED were included in the
      present study. The investigators using p16 methylation diagnostic reagents to analysis of the
      p16 methylation status in these patients. Building two follow-up queue by p16-methylated and
      p16-unmethylated. The Statistical analysis used SAS6.12 software. All P-values were
      two-sided. P&lt;0.05 was considered to test for statistical significance difference.

    <description>152 participants were p16 methylated informative. 29 participants were NOT informative because enough DNA was not extracted from their paraffin slides.
Among these informative cases, oral specimens from 48 patients were p16 methylation positive and 104 patients were p16 methylation negative. The cancer rate in the p16 methylation positive patients during the followup period will be compared with that in the p16 methylation negative patients statistically.</description>

        180 patients with mild or moderate oral epithelial dysplasia were selected. 81 of them were
        from Peking University of Stomatology and 68 were from Capital Medical University School of
        Stomatology and other 31 were from Fourth Military Medical University School of
        Stomatology.All of the patients with OED had been diagnosed pathologically by at least two
        senior pathologists using the criteria from '2005 WHO Classification System' and The oral
        tissue pathology diagnostic criteria (oral histopathology Edition Sixth).All cases involved
        primary lesions without any LASER, radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
