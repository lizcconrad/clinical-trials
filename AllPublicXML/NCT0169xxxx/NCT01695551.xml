  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a life-threatening, fast heart rhythm that starts in the
      lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles). This fast heartbeat is caused by abnormal
      electrical pathways located in the heart tissue. A standard procedure called a catheter
      ablation has been used for several years to help correct these abnormal pathways and, in some
      cases, improve or even eliminate the ventricular tachycardia.

      During a VT ablation it is routine to monitor your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate,
      and oxygen saturation in your blood). If you choose to participate in this study we will also
      monitor your cerebral oximetry, the amount of blood flow and oxygen saturation to your brain
      during the ablation.

      By doing this study, we hope to have a better understanding of patients' blood and oxygen
      flow to their brain during an episode of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT).
