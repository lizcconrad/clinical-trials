      This observational study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, quality of life and
      predictive/selection factors for Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with
      carboplatin/paclitaxel in first line in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian
      tube or primary peritoneal cancer in clinical practice. Data of eligible patients will be
      collected during up to 15 months of treatment and 12 months of follow-up. A second
      recruitment phase has been opened to focus on patients &gt;/= 70 years.
