  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells show cytolytic activity against tumor. Radiation therapy
      uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining Radiation therapy with adoptive
      cellular therapy after surgery may be more effective than uses radiation therapy alone in
      treating esophageal cancer.

DC-CIK cellular therapy:Mononuclear cells were collected aseptically with blood cell separator composition apheresis 3 days before radiation, and cultured DC-CIK cells for 10 days. Cells were infused back to the patients in 3 times between the radiation intermittent period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  cytologically or histologically confirmed esophageal carcinoma

          -  Tumor extension beyond muscularis propria and/or nodal involvement without evidence of
             M1 disease

          -  Prior en bloc resection, with curative intent, of all known tumor

          -  No metastatic disease

          -  Age: &gt; 18

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70

          -  At least 3 weeks since prior surgery

          -  Normal functions of heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow

          -  Blood exams qualified for chemotherapy, which included hemoglobulin ≥9 g/dl,
             neutrophil ≥1.5×109/L and platelet (PLT) ≥100×109/L, creatinine ≤1.5 UNL

          -  All patients must be evaluated by a radiation oncologist prior to enrollment to ensure
             patient is appropriate for radiotherapy

          -  Informed consent signed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic disease.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Patients with poor bone marrow, liver and kidney functions, which would make radiation
             therapy intolerable

          -  Patients with contraindication for irradiation: complete obstruction of esophagus,
             deep esophageal ulcer, fistula to mediastinum, or haematemesis
