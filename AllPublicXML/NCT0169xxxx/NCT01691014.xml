  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to further explore if development of antibodies against TNF-α
      blocking agents is associated with reduced clinical effect/worsened clinical outcome. An
      important aspect of the study is to carry out an exploratory analysis of the immunogenicity
      of the 4 recommended TNF-α blockers in the treatment of RA in Denmark, using the same
      cell-based assay.

    The study was terminated on 10DEC2014 due to the inability to enroll the planned number of
    patients. There were no safety concerns.

    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>

    <description>Presence of active drugs in serum 6 months after treatment with Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept and Infliximab were to be measured in serum samples using a validated commercially available cell-based reporter-gene assay.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Between Formation of Antibodies to Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept or Infliximab 6 Months After Initiation of Treatment and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) 12 Months After Initiation of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Association between formation of antibodies to Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept, Infliximab and DAS28 was to be analyzed using Pearson and Spearman correlations across and within each of the four treatment groups. DAS28-4 was calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) using 28 joint count, C-reactive protein (CRP) in milligram per liter (mg/L) and participant global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with total score ranging from 0 [good condition] to 10 [worst condition]; higher score indicates worse condition). DAS28-4 total score range: 0 (no disease activity) to 9.4 (maximum disease activity), higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Between Formation of Antibodies to Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept or Infliximab 6 Months After Initiation of Treatment and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) 12 Months After Initiation of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Association between formation of antibodies to Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept, Infliximab and HAQ scores was to be analyzed using Pearson and Spearman correlations across and within each of the four treatment groups. HAQ was a self-reported, valid assessment of functional disability in rheumatoid arthritis based on ability of participants to perform daily activities. HAQ total score range: 0 (normal functioning) to 3 (worst functioning), where higher score indicates worse functioning.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Between Formation of Antibodies to Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept or Infliximab 6 Months After Initiation of Treatment and Cessation of Therapy Between Month 6 and 12 Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Association between formation of antibodies to Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept and Infliximab and cessation of therapy was to be analyzed. Cessation of therapy between month 6 and month 12 was the time to withdrawal from study due to either adverse events or lack of effect between the 6 month visit and the 12 month visit.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Between the Formation of Anti-drug Antibodies to Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept or Infliximab and Concomitant Methotrexate Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Association between formation of anti-drug antibodies to Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept and Infliximab and concomitant Methotrexate treatment (weekly dose of 7.5 milligram) was to be analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count (DAS28) After Initiation of Treatment With Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept or Infliximab at Month 3, 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-4 was calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) using 28 joint count, C-reactive protein (CRP) in milligram per liter (mg/L) and participant global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with total score ranging from 0 [good condition] to 10 [worst condition]; higher score indicates worse condition). DAS28-4 total score range: 0 (no disease activity) to 9.4 (maximum disease activity), higher score indicates more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity.</description>
