      Hypothesis: The UAS Immunotherapy protocol is efficacious and at least as efficacious as
      protocols described in the Allergy literature.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be assessed for efficacy of the immunotherapy protocol by completing
      Consented-IRB approved clinical, medication, quality of life survey questions comparing
      current status while on therapy in contrast to 12 months before the inception of therapy.
