  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial assessing the harms and
      benefits of screening for dementia, compared to no screening for dementia, among 4,000 older
      adults, cared for in typical, primary care practices.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to address the question of whether the benefits outweigh
      the harms of routine screening for dementia among older adults in primary care when the
      screening program is coupled with primary care practices prepared to provide care for those
      who screen positive.

      The specific aim of the study is to conduct a pragmatic randomized clinical trial assessing
      the harms and benefits of screening for dementia, compared to no screening for dementia,
      among 4,000 typical, older adults, cared for in typical, primary care practices, prepared to
      deliver best practices dementia care.

      Primary Specific Aim 1:

      Test the impact of dementia screening on health-related quality of life of the patient at 12
      months.

      Primary Specific Aim 2:

      Test the impact of dementia screening on the mood and anxiety symptoms of patient at 1 month
      (i.e., primary potential harms).

      Secondary Aims: Estimate the cost effectiveness of dementia screening.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the HRQOL measured at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months among the entire 4,000 enrollees. The study will use the 15-item Health Utility Index (HUI) to determine the subject's HRQOL. The HUI is a generic, utility-based HRQOL instrument applied in patients with a wide range of medical conditions. It has eight attributes: Vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain. The individual health domain scores range from 0.00 (maximum impairment) to 1.00 (no impairment) and the multi-attribute (HUI index) scores, a multiplicative function of individual attribute levels, range from 0.36 to 1.00 with anchors 0.00 = dead and 1.00 = perfect health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a nine-item depression scale with a total score from 0 to 27. It has a good internal consistency and test-retest reliability; as well as convergent, construct, criterion, procedural and factorial validity for the diagnosis of major depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a seven-item anxiety scale with a total score from 0 to 21. It has a good internal consistency and test-retest reliability; as well as convergent, construct, criterion, procedural and factorial validity for the diagnosis of general anxiety disorder.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Care Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will obtain consent at enrollment from all subjects for permission to review their medical records. The Indiana Network for Patient Care (a fully operational Health Information Exchange) will also be used to identify any episode of ambulatory or acute care that occurred within the following 12 months of enrollment date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Advanced Care Planning</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will measure the subjects' advanced care planning including having power attorney for health care and/or financial affairs, having a living will, and having life and additional insurance policies at baseline and 12 months.</description>
