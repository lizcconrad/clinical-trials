  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practices and processes related to the administration of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in
      the adult intensive care unit (ICU) of the University hospital of Lausanne will be recorded
      by an investigator at the bedside. The effect of the NIV treatment on various respiratory
      parameters ( respiratory rate, expired tidal volume, minute ventilation) will also be
      recorded using a pneumotachograph. Finally patient's comfort during NIV treatment will be
      evaluated.
