    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study for patients with MM who will
      receive treatment with a SC bortezomib-containing combination regimen that does not contain
      thalidomide or vincristine. The patients will be required to have received a prior IV
      bortezomib containing combination regimen that did not contain thalidomide or vincristine and
      that differs from the SC bortezomib-containing one. In between the time that the patient
      received the IV bortezomib-based combination regimen and enrollment onto this study, patients
      may have received other non-bortezomib-based regimens as long as these treatments did not
      contain thalidomide or vincristine. This study will enroll patients who have relapsed or have
      become refractory to their prior IV-administered bortezomib-containing combination regimen as
      demonstrated by progressive disease while on or following that regimen. Patients must have
      received 4 doses of a minimum of 1.0 mg/m2 of bortezomib administered IV in no more than 4
      weeks per cycle. Patients must have received at least one cycle meeting this definition and
      have shown progressive disease to be considered eligible. Patients who have relapsed or have
      become refractory to their most recent IV bortezomib-containing combination regimen are
      eligible regardless of when they received that regimen, as long as they meet the above
      criteria.

      The study will consist of a screening period, followed by up to eight open label treatment
      cycles, a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle, and a
      follow-up period.

      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To establish the safety and tolerability of treatment with a SC bortezomib containing
      combination regimen for MM patients who have demonstrated progressive disease from a prior
      and different IV bortezomib containing combination regimen:

        -  To compare the incidence of PN between IV bortezomib and treatment with SC bortezomib in
           a subsequent anti-MM combination regimen

        -  To compare the severity of PN between IV bortezomib and treatment with SC bortezomib in
           a subsequent combination anti-MM regimen

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the overall response rate [combined CR + very good partial response (VGPR) +
           PR + MR] following treatment with a SC bortezomib-containing combination regimen for MM
           patients who have demonstrated progressive disease from a prior and different IV
           bortezomib containing combination regimen

        -  To compare disease parameters following treatment with a SC bortezomib containing
           combination regimen for MM patients who have demonstrated progressive disease from a
           prior and different IV bortezomib containing combination regimen as follows:

             -  time to progression

             -  progression free survival

             -  time to first response

             -  duration of response

             -  overall survival

        -  To determine the incidence and severity of injection-site reactions with SC
           administration of bortezomib

    <time_frame>Subjects eligible for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of eight 28 day treatment cycles.</time_frame>
    <description>Definition of incidence: the number of participants enrolled in the study experiencing treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy. Emergence of peripheral neuropathy is determined via neurological assessment conducted on Day 1 and Day 11 of each treatment cycle as well as during the End of Study visit.
Definition of severity: the severity of any treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy experienced by a patient on-study. Peripheral neuropathy severity is determined via neurological assessment conducted on Day 1 and Day 11 of each treatment cycle as well as the End of Study visit and is graded on a 0-4 scale based on CTCAE criteria.

        <title>The Primary Objective of This Study Will be to Investigate the Incidence and Severity of Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by a Prior Intravenous VELCADE-containing Regimen in Comparison to That Caused by a Subcutaneous VELCADE-containing Regimen.</title>
        <description>Definition of incidence: the number of participants enrolled in the study experiencing treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy. Emergence of peripheral neuropathy is determined via neurological assessment conducted on Day 1 and Day 11 of each treatment cycle as well as during the End of Study visit.
Definition of severity: the severity of any treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy experienced by a patient on-study. Peripheral neuropathy severity is determined via neurological assessment conducted on Day 1 and Day 11 of each treatment cycle as well as the End of Study visit and is graded on a 0-4 scale based on CTCAE criteria.

          <description>Bortezomib was administered SC at a dose of 1.0 mg/m2. Doses were administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 28-day cycle. When administered subcutaneously, sites for each injection (thigh or abdomen) were rotated and reported. All other drugs used in combination with the SC bortezomib were recorded in the Case Report Forms along with their corresponding doses and schedules.</description>
