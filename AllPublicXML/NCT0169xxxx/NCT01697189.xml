  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of the study is to promote safe, economic, and environmental-friendly driving
      among long-haul truck drivers. To do this, the investigators will conduct an on-road study on
      i) the relationship of driver sleepiness and stress with driving behaviour and fuel
      consumption and ii) effectiveness of an educational intervention in mitigating sleepiness at
      the wheel. The educational intervention is designed to be employed by occupational health
      care professionals in the future. This solution clearly facilitates the implementation of the
      intervention into practice if it turns out to be effective.

      The investigators specified research questions are the following:

        -  Do truck driver sleepiness and stress at the wheel reach levels that affect driving
           behaviour, fuel consumption and carbon emissions?

        -  What are the sources of sub-optimal arousal at the wheel in truck drivers?

        -  Can truck driver sleepiness be mitigated by an educational intervention, and if yes,
           does it improve driving behaviour and decrease fuel consumption and carbon emissions as
           well?
