  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare two active psychological treatments for PTSD. One is an
      established therapy, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) which operates as a control condition
      for a newly developed intervention, an integrative Gestalt-based trauma therapy, Dialogical
      Exposure Therapy (DET). There is no inactive control condition. We expect the two therapies
      to perform on a similar level, which would constitute evidence for the efficacy of DET.

    <description>Even though participants are assessed by a clinical interview before entering the study, the primary outcome measure is the PDS which is applied before and after treatment as well as at 6-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Symptom change (IES-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from pretreatment to posttreatment (planned duration 12 weeks on average) to follow-up (six months after posttreatment). Also measured at each session (up to 24 time points between pre- and posttreatment).</time_frame>
    <description>The IES-R is a short instrument for the measurement of PTSD symptom severity. In this study, the IES-R is applied before every session in order to measure symptom change over the time of the therapy.</description>
