  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is the most common childhood disease. Treatment of diabetes requires personal
      checks of blood sugar levels, injecting insulin, changing eating habits and physical
      exercise, which requires a real change in the life of the child &amp; adolescent and can cause
      significant damage to the quality of life as well.

      Compliance to treatment is a major challenge for all patients and mostly to adolescence,
      which often worsen their diabetes control at that age.

      The Michael Method is a unique, holistic program to develop and realize an individual's
      emotional, intellectual and behavioral potential, which is based on the belief that every
      human being can excel in every field they choose. The method was developed in 1988 by a
      multi-disciplinary team of professional academic in Israel. Today the Israeli education
      system implements the method in Junior High Schools and High Schools in diverse educational
      sectors. The program is taught at many other various frameworks: teachers' continuing
      education programs, colleges, programs run by the Ministries of Defense and Social Welfare,
      the National Insurance Institute, the National Electric Corporation and in many other public
      and private frameworks.

      The proposed study is aimed to assess whether the Michael Method can be used as a tool for
      improving metabolic control and quality of life among uncontrolled adolescence with type 1
      diabetes
