      The purpose of this study is to determine how aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as Arimidex,
      Aromasin or Femara affect a woman's oral health and oral health related quality of life.
      Patients, dental professionals and medical oncologists will benefit from a greater
      understanding of the best oral care follow up practices of breast cancer survivors using
      aromatase inhibitors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      This cross-sectional prevalence study seeks to investigate the incidence and severity of oral
      health changes, specifically of periodontal conditions, among breast cancer survivors and the
      ways in which these outcomes affect their quality of life.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the prevalence and severity of oral conditions in postmenopausal women with
           early stage breast cancer using adjuvant AI therapy as compared to postmenopausal women
           not using adjuvant AI therapy.

        -  To determine if adjuvant AI therapy use is associated with greater alveolar bone loss or
           increased levels of bone turnover biomarkers in postmenopausal women with cancer
           undergoing adjuvant AI therapy compared to postmenopausal women not receiving AI
           therapy.

        -  To determine the oral health-related quality of life among postmenopausal women with
           early stage breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant AI therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Postmenopausal as defined by NCCN (any of the following)

          -  Prior bilateral oophorectomy

          -  Age equal to or greater then 60 years of age

          -  Age less then 60 and amenorrheic for 12 or more months in the absence of chemotherapy,
             tamoxifen, toremifen or ovarian suppression and FSH and estradiol in the
             postmenopausal range

          -  If taking tamoxifen or toremifen and age less then 60y, then FSH and plasma estradiol
             level in postmenopausal ranges

        Informed consent- Individuals capable of consenting and self administering the survey
        instrument Dentate- At least 15 teeth present.

        AI users:

          -  Diagnosis of BCa- Histologic confirmed diagnosis of BCa: Stage 0, I, II, or III with
             no evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Treatment- AI as clinically indicated (AI may be anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole)
             &gt; 1 month. Subjects may have had prior tamoxifen or raloxifene. Subjects may have had
             chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Must be within the first year of consecutive AI
             therapy. If a subject started AI, discontinued, then restarted, they will be accepted
             into the study.

        Controls:

          -  No Diagnosis of cancer.- Patients must not have a diagnosis of any cancer (Not
             including a history of localized thyroid or skin cancer).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Medical history

          -  Metastatic BCa (AI treated group: fully resected locally recurrent disease is
             permitted if the patient has been rendered without evidence of disease).

          -  Significant psychiatric illness/social situations that would preclude completion of
             questionnaire.

        Medications

          -  Chronic medications known to affect the periodontal status (calcium antagonist,
             anti-convulsives, immunosuppressives (&gt; prednisone 7.5mg daily). NSAIDS and
             bisphosphonates are permitted.

          -  Premedication- Conditions that require antibiotic therapy will be evaluated on a
             case-by-case basis. (Patients taking prophylaxis for joint replacements will not be
             excluded.)
