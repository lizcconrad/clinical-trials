      The Gastroparesis Registry 2 (GpR 2) will enroll new patients and patients from the initial
      NIDDK Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium Gastroparesis Registry (GpR) of
      gastroparesis patients which was initiated in February 2007 and completed in March 2011.

      To continue to follow and expand the data collections of a well-characterized cohort to
      further define the natural history and clinical course of gastroparesis.

      To provide a reliable source for recruitment of well-characterized patients with
      gastroparesis for therapeutic clinical trials, pathophysiological, molecular,
      histopathologic, or other ancillary studies. These subsequent clinical trials or ancillary
      studies will be conducted under separate study protocols with separate consent processes.

        This study will enroll patients with gastroparesis and delayed gastric emptying. These
        patients can have either diabetic, idiopathic, or post-Nissen fundoplication gastroparesis.
        In addition, patients with symptoms similar to gastroparesis, but with normal gastric
        emptying will be enrolled as a reference group.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptoms of gastroparesis of at least 12 weeks duration (do not have to be contiguous)
             with varying degrees of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, post-prandial fullness,
             and/or abdominal pain

          -  An etiology of either diabetic, idiopathic, or post-Nissen fundoplication
             gastroparesis

          -  Gastric emptying scintigraphy of solids and liquids test using 4 hours Egg Beaters®
             protocol within the last 6 months with either:

               -  Abnormal gastric emptying rate defined as an abnormal 2 hour (&gt;60% retention)
                  and/or 4 hour (&gt;10% retention) result based on a 4-hour scintigraphic low fat Egg
                  Beaters® gastric emptying study performed at a GpCRC clinical center.

               -  Patients with a normal gastric emptying rate but with symptoms of gastroparesis
                  may be enrolled and classified as possible gastroparesis or gastroparesis-like
                  with normal gastric emptying

          -  Age at least 18 years at initial screening visit

          -  Upper endoscopy results within last 2 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to comply with or complete the gastric emptying scintigraphy test (including
             allergy to eggs)

          -  Presence of other conditions that could explain the patient's symptoms:

          -  Pyloric or intestinal obstruction as determined by endoscopy, upper GI series or
             abdominal CT scan

          -  Active inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Known eosinophilic gastroenteritis

          -  Primary neurological conditions that could cause nausea and/or vomiting such as
             increased intracranial pressure, space occupying or inflammatory/infectious lesions

          -  Acute liver failure

          -  Advanced liver disease (Child's B or C; a Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score of ≥7 )

          -  Acute renal failure

          -  Chronic renal failure (serum creatinine &gt;3 mg/dL) and/or on hemodialysis or peritoneal
             dialysis

          -  Total or subtotal (near complete) gastric resection, esophagogastrostomy,
             gastrojejunostomy, or gastric bypass. Note: patients with prior fundoplication will be
             eligible for enrollment.

          -  Any other plausible structural or metabolic cause

          -  Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with
             study requirements

          -  Inability to obtain informed consent
