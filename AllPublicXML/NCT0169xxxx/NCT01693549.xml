Moreover, evaluation of p53,BCL2,BIM,γ-actin,LIMK2, TGFBI,Aurora-A,as well as the expression of the enzyme CYP3A and multidrug transporters such as P-glycoprotein. The abovementioned factors will be assessed by immunohistochemistry at the protein level and by quantitative real-time PCR at the RNA level.
Also, given the clinical significance of the anti-angiogenic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy,we will investigate the effect of treatment on surrogate biomarkers of angiogenesis, such as VEGF-A as well as the effect of chemotherapy on kinetics of soluble biomarkers,using ELISA.
In addition,genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, such as the CYP3A and ABCB1 genes, will be explored in blood DNA and their association with the toxicity and efficacy of cabazitaxel will be assessed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Female patients aged 18 to 75 years

          -  Patients must have received 1st-line chemotherapy for locally recurrent / metastatic
             disease

          -  Prior taxane-containing treatment (paclitaxel, docetaxel or nab-paclitaxel), either
             for advanced disease or as neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. In case of early relapse
             (relapse during neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy or disease-free interval less than 6
             months), neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy will be considered as 1st-line treatment

          -  Diagnosis of HER-2 negative (HER-2 &lt;2+ by immunohistochemistry and/or FISH or CISH
             negative) metastatic breast adenocarcinoma confirmed by the pathology department of
             the enrolling institution

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) of 0-1

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Measurable disease by the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) method
             (at least one measurable lesion)

          -  Laboratory values within the specified ranges within 1 week of study enrolment:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               2. Absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L

               3. Thrombocyte count of ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

               4. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN). If creatinine 1.0 - 1.5 x
                  ULN, creatinine clearance will be calculated according to CKD-EPI formula and
                  patients with creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min should be excluded

               5. SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN, total
                  bilirubin ≤ ULN (the same limits also refer to patients with liver metastases)

          -  Previous treatment for loco-regional disease is allowed, including surgical procedures
             or palliative radiotherapy (such treatments must have been completed at least 4 weeks
             before enrolment)
