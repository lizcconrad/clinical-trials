  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if insoles with removable pegs could effectively
      reduce the plantar aspect pressure with the aid of in-shoe plantar pressure analysis for
      guidance of peg removal.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators tested the effect of plantar pressure reduction in four conditions:

        1. insole of the original shoe

        2. peg assist insole but the pegs are not yet removed

        3. peg assist insole and the pegs were removed

        4. condition3. plus arch support to the insole

    <description>In-shoe plantar pressure measurements were performed in 26 patients with diabetic neuropathic feet at baseline condition, and 52 regions of interest (ROIs, with mean peak pressure &gt; 200kPa or with the highest mean peak pressure in the forefoot area) were identified as suitable areas for removal of pegs. Data of in-shoe plantar pressures of the three insole conditions (pre-peg removal, post-peg removal, and post-peg removal plus arch support) were collected. Mean peak pressure (MPP) and pressure-time integral (PTI) were recorded for analysis.</description>
