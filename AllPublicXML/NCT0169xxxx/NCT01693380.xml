      Children and adolescents play an important role in sustaining the transmission of influenza.
      Moreover, with the occurrence of influenza in children, there are important socioeconomic
      consequences to families affected by the disease, related to absenteeism, expenditure on
      health services and medication use. This study presents an evaluation of direct and indirect
      effectiveness of influenza vaccination in school age children and their unvaccinated
      household contacts. It was conducted in 2009, in Sao Paulo - Brazil, through a randomized
      double-blind community trial, with six months of follow up. For the evaluation of vaccine
      effectiveness, the influenza vaccine was used for the experimental group, and meningitis
      conjugate and varicella vaccines for the control group. After vaccination, the volunteers and
      their families were followed for six months, in order to identify cases of acute respiratory
      infection (ARI) and to collect biological samples for testing with RT-PCR for diagnosis of
      influenza.
