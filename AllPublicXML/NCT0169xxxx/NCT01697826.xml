    <textblock>
      Randomized, Parallel Group, Active Controlled Trial to compare effectiveness and tolerability
      of 2 different vaginal formulations containing 200mg clotrimazole and clindamycin phosphate
      equivalent to 100mg clindamycin for 3 days in women clinically diagnosed to have infective
      vaginitis.

      -  This is a Randomized, Comparative, Prospective, Open label, Single center study to
           compare the 3 day treatment course of intravaginal soft gelatin capsule containing
           clindamycin and clotrimazole versus intravaginal ER tablets of clindamycin and
           clotrimazole in patients with vaginal discharge and clinical diagnosis of bacterial,
           trichomonal, candidal or mixed vaginitis with respect to efficacy and tolerability; and
           to study the in vitro drug release pattern of intravaginal soft gelatin capsule and
           intravaginal ER tablets containing clindamycin and clotrimazole.

        -  The study will be conducted in B.J. Medical College &amp; Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune.
           The study will be completed in 60 patients [30 patients in each group].

        -  The primary outcome measure is absence of any clinical sign suggestive of infective
           vaginitis and a vaginal swab that is negative for bacterial, trichomonal or candidal
           vaginitis at 8th day after start of treatment [Effectiveness in inducing a remission].

        -  The secondary outcome measures will be

             1. absence of any clinical sign suggestive of infective vaginitis and

             2. a vaginal swab that is negative for bacterial, trichomonal or candidal vaginitis at
                29th day after start of treatment [Effectiveness in maintaining a remission] and
                ability to complete the 3day course without any break or experiencing intolerable
                side effects [Tolerability].
