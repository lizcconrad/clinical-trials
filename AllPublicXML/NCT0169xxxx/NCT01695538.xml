  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is an uncommon form of atrial tachycardia. The term
      &quot;inappropriate&quot; in medicine is commonly defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats per
      minute at rest or with minimal physiological challenge. IST is characterized by an increased
      resting heart rate with an exaggerated response to exercise or stress.

      Yoga has been used extensively around the world as an alternative medicine approach in
      treating numerous chronic and debilitating diseases. Studies have been conducted in various
      countries to determine the benefits of Yoga as therapy for these chronic diseases. Several
      studies have confirmed that yoga can reduce anxiety and regulate the stress response.

      Studies in the past have shown that Yoga relieves stress, one of the most common triggers for
      the arrhythmia and increased heart rate in IST. Based on past studies we hypothesize that
      patients with IST might benefit by practicing yoga. Yoga may also help in better rate and
      rhythm control with yoga when employed in combination with usual medical arrangement.
