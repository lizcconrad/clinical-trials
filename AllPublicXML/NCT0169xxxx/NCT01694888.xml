      Midwives are responsible for documenting and keeping care facts in midwifery departments.
      Inaccurate documentation or even minute error in reporting may lead to burdensome
      responsibility for midwives. This study has been conducted aimed to compare midwifery
      students' performance before and after teaching fundamentals of documentation. In this
      quasi-experimental study, 28 midwifery students were participated. Data were collected by a
      questionnaire including a. demographic data and b. Scenarios (1) and (2) of an imaginary
      patient with physician order and a checklist contain 11 elements of documentation
