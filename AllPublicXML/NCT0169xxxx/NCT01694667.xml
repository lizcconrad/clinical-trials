  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an internet-based, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      which will assess changes in hyperactivity in children ages five through eight with an autism
      spectrum disorders (ASD) and elevated levels of hyperactivity. In order to answer this
      question, this study will assess changes in hyperactivity as measured by the Aberrant
      Behavior Checklist (ABC) in children with ASD and elevated baseline levels of hyperactivity
      who are randomly assigned to use 1.3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids daily compared to placebo.
      The overwhelming majority of study procedures, including recruitment, informed consent,
      assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and collection of baseline and outcome
      measures will take place over the internet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Families and caregivers of children enrolled in the IAN Research between the age 5-8 and with
      an established diagnosis of autism will be invited to participate in the study by e-mail. All
      of these families have previously given consent to be contacted about research opportunities.
      Families who respond to the e-mail recruitment letter will undergo a brief screening process
      to determine if the child has any exclusion criteria and to ensure the child is age 5-8, has
      an autism spectrum disorder, and has elevated baseline levels of hyperactivity. Families will
      undergo an on-line informed consent process including assent of the child. All participants
      will be given an opportunity to speak with a study team member should they have any questions
      about the study or the informed consent process. Participants will sign the informed consent
      using an electronic signature, a process that has been used previously in the IAN network and
      approved by the John's Hopkins Institutional Review Board (IRB). Families meeting all
      eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned and mailed the study medication (omega-3 or
      placebo) which will be administered to children by the parents twice daily for six weeks.
      Both the study medication and the matching placebo are an orange-flavored pudding that is
      specifically designed to be palatable for young children. Assessment of child hyperactivity,
      social functioning, and overall disease severity will be measured at baseline, three and six
      weeks by the parents, who will complete on-line standard questionnaires; ABC, Social
      Responsiveness Scale (SRS), clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI).

      Side effects will be assessed every week by e-mail, and any report of a side effect will
      immediately be followed-up with telephone contact from the PI. Although omega-3 fatty acids
      are extremely safe in the prescribed doses, the PI or another study physician will still be
      on call 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week to speak to participants about possible adverse events
      or new medical problems (all enrolled families are provided with this 24-hour emergency phone
      contact information).

      As part of the weekly e-mail reminder, parents will also be asked to log the medication that
      was provided to their children each day of the previous week to measure medication adherence.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks (3 week value to be collected)</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a 58-item survey. Items are rated on a 4-point scale from &quot;0=no problem&quot; to &quot;3=major problem.&quot; Higher scores indicate greater severity. Scores can be computed for five subscales: hyperactivity, lethargy, stereotypical behavior, irritability, and inappropriate speech. The hyperactivity subscale is comprised of 16 items. The outcome measure is the change from baseline to 6 weeks. The total score ranges from 0 to 48.</description>

    <description>Social interaction will be assessed with the SRS.

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the clinical impression of improvement on a 7-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 - very much improved - to 7 - very much worse) is a commonly used measure of overall improvement in intervention studies of children with ASD. This tool will be completed by the parent and caregiver, and is therefore considered a modified version of the instrument, which is normally completed by a clinician. This is considered an exploratory analysis of this outcome tool since it is being used in a non-standard fashion. The number of participants who &quot;responded&quot; in each group is the number where the parents reported that their child was improved, much improved, or very much improved.</description>

Items are rated on a 4-point scale from &quot;0=no problem&quot; to &quot;3=major problem.&quot; Higher scores indicate greater severity. Scores can be computed for five subscales: hyperactivity, lethargy, stereotypical behavior, irritability, and inappropriate speech. The hyperactivity subscale is comprised of 16 items. The outcome measure is the change from baseline to 6 weeks. The total score ranges from 0 to 48.</description>

        <title>Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Irritability Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a 58-item survey. Items are rated on a 4-point scale from &quot;0=no problem&quot; to &quot;3=major problem.&quot; Higher scores indicate greater severity. Scores can be computed for five subscales: hyperactivity, lethargy, stereotypical behavior, irritability, and inappropriate speech. The irritability subscale is comprised of 15 items. The outcome measure is the change from baseline to six weeks in the scale. Total score ranges from 0 to 45.</description>

        <description>Social interaction will be assessed with the SRS. This scale examines the presence and extent of autistic social impairment and is administered by parents or teachers of children with ASD. Higher scores are indicative of greater severity. Normative data have been derived from a sample of over 1,600 children.</description>

        <description>Measures the clinical impression of improvement on a 7-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 - very much improved - to 7 - very much worse) is a commonly used measure of overall improvement in intervention studies of children with ASD. This tool will be completed by the parent and caregiver, and is therefore considered a modified version of the instrument, which is normally completed by a clinician. This is considered an exploratory analysis of this outcome tool since it is being used in a non-standard fashion. The number of participants who &quot;responded&quot; in each group is the number where the parents reported that their child was improved, much improved, or very much improved.</description>
