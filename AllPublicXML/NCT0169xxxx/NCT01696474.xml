    <textblock>
      This multicenter, phase II, open label study will enroll patients with chronic cold
      agglutinin disorder. A single course of Bortezomib will be given at the dose of 1,3 mg/sqm iv
      on days 1, 4, 8, 11.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on its activity in MM, single agent Bortezomib was tested in phase II trials in
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, the disorder most frequently associated with CAD, and achieved
      40-80% responses. These striking clinical responses indicate that proteasome activity is
      critical for the survival of immunoglobulin-secreting cells. The resolution of transfusion
      requirement in two patients with refractory CAD associated with IgMk monoclonal gammopathy
      has been reported after treatment with a short course of Bortezomib. It may be interesting to
      test the efficacy of Bortezomib in a larger series of patients with refractory CAD,
      idiopathic or associated with an otherwise asymptomatic B cell clonal disorder, and to
      evaluate the duration of clinical benefit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic cold agglutinin disorder requiring or with a hemoglobin
             concentration below 10g/L determined at least monthly during the two months before
             entering the trial;

          -  Failure of at least one previous treatment attempt;

          -  Hemoglobin level assessment;

          -  Presence of serum cold agglutinin (CA). If an overnight incubation is used for CA
             detection, a titer at 4°C of 64 or higher is required;

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a concomitant lymphoproliferative disorder requiring specific treatment
             for reasons other than cold agglutinin related hemolytic anemia;

          -  Preexisting peripheral neuropathy;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Bortezomib;

          -  Non-cooperative behaviour or non-compliance;

          -  Psychiatric diseases or conditions that might impair the ability to give informed
             consent;

          -  Patients who are pregnant (women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test). Post-menopausal women must be amenorrhoic for at least 24 months to
             be considered of non-childbearing potential. Male and female patients must agree to
             employ an effective barrier method of birth control throughout the study and for up to
             3 months following discontinuation of study drug.
