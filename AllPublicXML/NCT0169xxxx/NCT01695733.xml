    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the best time to administer the influenza vaccine to patients
      with non-hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Giving the vaccine at different
      times relative to chemotherapy may affect how well it works to help the body build an immune
      response and prevent influenza in these patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have biopsy-confirmed non-hematological malignancy

          -  Patients must be scheduled to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy (adjuvant or metastatic
             setting), excluding immunotherapy

          -  Patients must be of age &gt;=18 years.

          -  Patients must have an absolute lymphocyte count &gt;= 1,000/mcL immediately prior to
             influenza vaccination

          -  Ability of the patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) to
             understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have already received the influenza vaccine during the season in which
             they are considered for eligibility will be excluded

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to the influenza vaccine or egg allergies

          -  Previous history of Guillian-Barre syndrome within the previous 6 weeks to influenza
             vaccination

          -  Patients must not be receiving chronic steroid therapy, defined as &gt;= 14 days, unless
             used as part of a chemotherapy regimen

          -  Patients must not be on any other agents that can suppress the immune system

          -  Planned concurrent therapy with radiation

          -  Uncontrolled illness at time of enrollment or influenza vaccination including, but not
             limited to, ongoing or active febrile illness

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Known immunosuppression eg. history of organ transplantation or known human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy
             are ineligible because they may not be able to mount an appropriate immune response

          -  History of influenza-like illness, defined as a temperature &gt; 37.8 degree C with cough
             or sore throat starting October 1, 2011 throughout the duration of the study

          -  Patient may not be scheduled to receive chemotherapy on a weekly basis.
