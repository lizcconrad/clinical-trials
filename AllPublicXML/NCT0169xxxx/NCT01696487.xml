  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spectrum of NAFLD as emerging epidemic ranges from steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH),
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Disease progression is poorly understood and
      treatment options are limited. Fructose overconsumption has been associated with gut
      permeability and progression of NAFLD. To unravel the mechanisms of fructose-induced
      intestinal changes, volunteers will receive a 4-week fructose challenge prior to assessment
      of intestinal permeability/translocation using endomicroscopy, sugar probes, serum markers of
      intestinal damage, inflammation, iron/copper homeostasis and histological/molecular analysis
      of intestinal biopsies. Findings in volunteers will be compared with liver patients
      undergoing study procedures without fructose challenge. Translational in vitro experiments
      will explore cellular responses to fructose and endotoxin. This project should provide novel
      insights into dietary induced alterations of the gut integrity in progression of NAFLD to
      NASH.
