    <textblock>
      To confirm the efficacy of CPX-351 compared to 7+3 as first line therapy in elderly patients
      (60-75 yrs) with high risk (secondary) Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The primary efficacy endpoint

               -  Therapy related AML: t-AML must have a documented history of prior cytotoxic
                  therapy or ionizing radiotherapy for an unrelated disease

               -  AML with a history of myelodysplasia: MDSAML must have bone marrow documentation
                  of prior MDS

               -  AML with a history of CMMoL: CMMoLAML must have bone marrow documentation of
                  prior CMMoL

               -  De novo AML with karyotypic abnormalities characteristic of MDS: de novoAML must
                  have cytogenetics with abnormalities per WHO.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 50% by echocardiography or MUGA

          -  Patients with second malignancies in remission may be eligible if there is clinical
             evidence of disease stability for a period of greater than 6 months off cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, documented by imaging, tumor marker studies, etc., at screening.
             Patients maintained on long-term non-chemotherapy treatment, e.g., hormonal therapy,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Except for CMMoL, patients with history of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (defined
             as a history of essential thrombocytosis or polycythemia vera, or idiopathic
             myelofibrosis prior to the diagnosis of AML) or combined MDS/MPN are not eligible.

             for control of blood counts. For example, a patient with MDS that changes HMA dose and
             schedule after the diagnosis of AML is excluded. AML-type therapy, such as cytarabine
             alone (&gt;1g/m2/day) or cytarabine plus an anthracycline as well as prior HSCT are also
             excluded.

          -  Administration of any therapy for MDS (conventional or investigational) must be
             completed by 2 weeks prior to of the first dose of study drug; in the event of rapidly

             of study treatment. Toxicities associated with prior MDS therapy must have recovered
             to grade 1 or less prior to start of treatment.

          -  Any major surgery or radiation therapy within four weeks.

             daunorubicin (or equivalent).

             would prevent obtaining informed consent

          -  Patients with myocardial impairment of any cause (e.g. cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart
             disease, significant valvular dysfunction, hypertensive heart disease, and congestive

             (Class III or IV staging)

          -  Active or uncontrolled infection. Patients with an infection receiving treatment
             (antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral treatment) may be entered into the study but must
             be afebrile and hemodynamically stable for ≥72 hrs.

          -  Current evidence of invasive fungal infection (blood or tissue culture); patients with

EFS was defined as the time from study randomization to the date of induction treatment failure (persistent disease), relapse from CR or CRi or death from any cause, whichever came first. Subjects alive and not known to have any of these events were censored on thee date they were last examined on study.</description>
