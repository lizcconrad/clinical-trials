  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single arm, dose finding study to assess safety and tolerability of
      the oral combination of Panobinostat and Ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) in
      chronic and accelerated phase.

    <textblock>
      Phase I/II open label, single institution, combination therapy trial of induction Ruxolitinib
      followed by combination with Panobinostat in dose escalation cohorts with a primary endpoint
      of determining the safety and tolerability of combination therapy in patients with
      myelofibrosis (MF) in chronic and accelerated phase. A 3+3standard dose escalation scheme
      will be employed and the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be captured and
      the occurrence of such events will determine dose cohort escalation by predetermined and
      established rules. In addition to establishing the DLTs, maximally tolerated dose (MTD), and
      recommended phase II dose (RPTD) in the phase I portion of this trial, exploratory biomarkers
      will be evaluated within phase I as well. Pharmacodynamics and exploratory genetic and
      epigenetic biomarkers will be explored as predictors of response to therapy. The RPTD cohort
      will be expanded to incorporate a total of 22 patients, including 6 from phase I, in order to
      assess clinical response as assessed by International Working Group for Myelofibrosis
      Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) as a primary endpoint for the phase II portion of this
      trial.

             study and any related procedures being performed

                  Patients with stable atrial fibrillation can be enrolled provided they do not
                  meet other cardiac exclusion criteria.
