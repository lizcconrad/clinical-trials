  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soy protein has a high biological value, and contains several potential health-related
      nutritional factors, i.e. its amino acids pattern, biological active peptides and non-protein
      compounds such as isoflavones. In the field of obesity and blood lipids soy protein is
      well-studied and appreciated; it improves circulating blood lipids and is associated with
      weight reduction. The effect of soy on insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis and the
      metabolic syndrome is less frequently studied. However, several molecular mechanisms of
      action of soy protein make it a promising approach.

      Objective: The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a high soy
      protein diet on insulin resistance and glycemic control in participants with characteristics
      of the metabolic syndrome. Secondly, the present study will evaluate whether reduced
      low-grade inflammation is a possible mechanism underlying the improvement in insulin
      resistance and glucose homeostasis. Finally, it will be assessed whether soy protein has
      beneficial effects on components of the metabolic syndrome, such as cardio-metabolic risk
      factors, blood lipid profile, blood pressure and endothelial function, fat storage in the
      liver and gene-expression in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue.

      Study design: Single-blind, cross-over strictly-controlled dietary intervention.
