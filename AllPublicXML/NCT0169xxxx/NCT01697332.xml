  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of our study are to determine the capabilities of hyperpolarized 129Xe
      MRI to measure lung function and its potential to sensitively detect pulmonary disease and
      its progression in COPD. We hypothesize that measurement of alveolar surface area, septal
      thickness, and capillary transit time measured with hyperpolarized 129Xe will correlate
      better with quality of life measures in COPD subjects than traditional diagnostic measures
      such as spirometry and Computed Tomography.

    <description>Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI scans will be performed on healthy subjects and the uptake of 129Xe in the pulmonary septal tissue will be measured as a function of time. From this data, the mean and distribution of three pulmonary functional parameters will be determined. The three measures are alveolar surface area per unit volume, septal thickness and capillary transit time through the gas exchange region.</description>

          <title>Baseline Statistics of Healthy Subjects</title>
          <description>Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI scans will be performed on healthy subjects and the uptake of 129Xe in the pulmonary septal tissue will be measured as a function of time. From this data, the mean and distribution of three pulmonary functional parameters will be determined. The three measures are alveolar surface area per unit volume, septal thickness and capillary transit time through the gas exchange region.</description>

Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas: 800cc of a gas mixture containing 129Xe and nitrogen will be inhaled by a subject. The subject will hold their breath for no more than 16 seconds while a MRI scan is performed. The gas mixture can contain between 20 and 100% xenon.</description>
