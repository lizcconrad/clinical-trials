  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound has been used to guide a needle to inject local anesthetics around nerves. This is
      usually done in the same plane as the ultrasound beam in America and is known as an in-plane
      technique. When done correctly, the entire needle is visualized on the ultrasound screen as
      it approaches the nerves which are also seen on the same screen the entire time. The
      ultrasound probe can be held perpendicular or parallel to the shoulders of the person
      performing the in-plane technique. Our hypothesis is that holding the ultrasound probe
      perpendicular to the shoulder is superior to holding the probe parallel to the shoulder
      during an in-plane ultrasound guided regional anesthesia technique.

      Right handed volunteers with no prior exposure to ultrasound techniques are used in this
      study. They will be randomly assigned to be shown an instructional video on how to perform an
      in-plane ultrasound guided needling technique on a realistic simulation target. The two
      videos are identical with the exception of the probe position. A blinded assessor will time
      the volunteers performance behind a screen and note the duration in which the needle is not
      visualized in the ultrasound screen.
