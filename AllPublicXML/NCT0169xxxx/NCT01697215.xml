  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the ability of the SonarMed AirWave to provide clinicians with information that
      enables them to confirm continuous proper placement of the endotracheal tube. This initial
      study is prospective, observational, looking at CXR results, and comparing those to AirWave
      system output data.

    <description>Use of the AirWave in the study group to calculate ETT tip distance from the carina will demonstrate a strong positive correlation with chest x-rays results. Specific endpoints will include:
• Compare CXR tube tip movement/distance to carina measurement results to AirWave tube tip movement/distance to carina calculation results (from the AirWave baseline location) within 24 hours after intubation.</description>
