    <textblock>
      Very few human data are currently available on the fatty acid composition of cardiomyocytes
      membranes. Preoperative omega-3 supplementation for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass is correlated with a decreased frequency of postoperative
      complications in type of arrhythmia atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most
      common complication: 30 to 50% after myocardial revascularization. The occurrence of atrial
      fibrillation increases morbidity and mortality after surgery for sure. The pathophysiological
      mechanisms of common atrial fibrillation treated in heart rhythm units are different from
      those of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Indeed, atrial fibrillation is a common disease
      primarily of the left atrium, although atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery is a
      multifactorial disease with implication of various pathogens such as inflammation without
      precise anatomical support. The preventive use of polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-3
      long-chain (LC-AGPIω3), prior cardiac surgery is far from widespread due to a Lack of
      information dissemination, by insufficient number of published studies, despite the existence
      of a number of ongoing clinical trials and a complete ignorance of biological mechanisms of
      action. A human clinical study is needed. In a context of cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass and without deleterious side effects of preoperative enrichment in
      omega-3, it seems appropriate to conduct a feasibility study to provide information on
      structural changes in membranes of cardiomyocytes.
