      The objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the AHPV-GT Assay using the PANTHER System
      in cervical cancer screening.

      This objective will be accomplished in the ASC-US Study by evaluating the performance
      characteristics of the AHPV-GT Assay using the PANTHER System in a sample population of women
      with ASC-US Pap test results who were 21 years of age or older (&quot;≥21 years of age&quot;) at the
      time of their Pap visit. For the Adjunct Study, this objective will be accomplished by
      evaluating the ability of the AHPV-GT Assay using the PANTHER System to identify women at
      increased risk of cervical disease in a sample population of women with negative
      (NILM)cytology results who were ≥30 years of age at the time of their Pap visit.

        Samples from subjects who attended colposcopy from the Adjunct Study and subjects who had
        positive APTIMA HPV Assay results in the APTIMA HPV Assay TIGRIS System Study or the APTIMA
        HPV Assay PANTHER System Study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who were previously enrolled into the prospective, multicenter US clinical study
        for the APTIMA HPV Assay on the TIGRIS System (protocol 2007HPVASCUS30) will be eligible
        for inclusion in the study of the AHPV-GT Assay using the PANTHER System described in this
        protocol. All evaluable ASC-US Study subjects ≥21 years of age will be eligible for
        inclusion.

        Evaluable Adjunct Study subjects ≥30 years of age will be eligible if the following
        criteria are met:

          -  the subject attended the colposcopy visit, or

          -  the subject did not attend the colposcopy visit but the referral Pap sample had a
             positive APTIMA HPV Assay result in the APTIMA HPV Assay TIGRIS System study (protocol
             2007HPVASCUS30) or in the APTIMA HPV Assay PANTHER System study (protocol
             AHPVPS-US11-003).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Eligible subjects will be excluded if they do not have an evaluable sample. This may be due
        to insufficient volume or because the sample was deemed unsuitable for testing (eg, stored
        under unacceptable conditions).
