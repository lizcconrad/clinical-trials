  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major catechin in green tea, is postulated to modulate
      dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and amyloid beta
      precursor protein (APP) gene overexpression in the brains of Down syndrome mouse models. The
      clinical study is aimed at demonstrating that normalization of Dyrk1A and APP functions is a
      therapeutic approach to improve cognitive performance and decelerate AD (Alzheimer's disease)
      like progression.

             function or alter any key biomarkers and biochemical parameters analyzed.

          -  Having suffered from any major illness or undergoing major surgery in the last three
             months before the study.

             alter processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug, or
             that might suggest gastrointestinal irritation to drug.
