    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulative
      therapy for pain management and improved function in active duty service members with low
      back pain that do not require surgery. The study will also measure the impact of a tobacco
      cessation program delivered to participants allocated to the chiropractic arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the most common cause of disability worldwide, but it is even more
      prevalent in active duty military personnel; more than 50% of all diagnoses resulting in
      disability discharges from the military across all branches are due to musculoskeletal
      conditions. LBP has been characterized as &quot;The Silent Military Threat&quot; because of its
      negative impact on mission readiness and the degree to which it compromises a fit fighting
      force. For these reasons, military personnel with LBP need a practical and effective
      treatment that relieves their pain and allows them to return to duty quickly, but also one
      that preserves function and military readiness, addresses the underlying causes of the
      episode and protects against re‐injury. Currently a clear &quot;gold standard&quot; medical treatment
      for low back pain does not exist and studies show that evidence‐based guidelines are rarely
      used in general practice. Thus, there is a need to consider innovative treatment options for
      chronic diseases such as LBP. Therefore the primary purpose of this study is to assess the
      effectiveness of chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT) for pain management and improved
      function in active duty service members with orthopedic injuries or disorders of the low back
      that do not require surgery. This multi‐site Phase II Clinical Comparative Effectiveness
      Trial is designed to rigorously compare the outcomes of CMT and conventional medical care
      (CMC) to CMC alone. Chiropractic treatment will include CMT plus ancillary physiotherapeutic
      interventions. CMC will be delivered following current standards of medical practice at each
      site. At each of the four participating sites, active military personnel, ages 18‐50, who
      present with acute, sub‐acute or chronic low back pain that does not require surgery will be
      randomized to one of the two treatment groups. Outcome measures include the Numerical Rating
      Scale for pain, the Roland‐Morris Low Back Pain and Disability questionnaire, the Back Pain
      Functional Scale for assessing function, and the Global Improvement questionnaire for patient
      perception regarding improvement in function. Patient Expectation and Patient Satisfaction
      questionnaires will be used to examine volunteer expectations toward care and perceptions of
      that care. Pharmaceutical use and duty status data will also be collected. The PROMIS-29 will
      be utilized to compare the general health component and quality of life of the sample at
      baseline. In addition, doctors of chiropractic are well positioned to provide information to
      support tobacco cessation. Thus this clinical trial will include a nested study designed to
      measure the impact of a tobacco cessation program delivered by a doctor of chiropractic. The
      results from this randomized clinical trial, with a nested tobacco cessation intervention,
      will provide critical information regarding the health and mission‐support benefits of
      chiropractic health care delivery for active duty service members in the military

    <measure>Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NRS) for prior week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and all endpoint visits (week 2, week 4, week 6, week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Volunteers will be asked to rate their average level of pain during the prior week on an ordinal 11-box scale (0=no LBP; 10=worst LBP possible) at baseline and at all of the follow-up assessments. The NRS has excellent metric properties, is easy to administer and score, and has received much use in LBP research. Pain data will be collected at baseline and at all endpoint visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and all endpoint visits (week 2, week 4, week 6, week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a volunteer self-report modified 24-item version of the RMDQ to assess LBP-related disability. The RMDQ may be the most common and respected LBP assessment instrument in LBP outcomes research. It is a one page questionnaire related to LBP disability with documented reliability and validity. It can discriminate between different forms of treatment for back pain, and it is sensitive to clinical change. The RMDQ has been chosen for a number of clinical trials of LBP treatments for its excellent metric properties, ease of use, patient acceptance, and high face validity. This questionnaire will be administered at baseline and at all endpoints.</description>

    <measure>Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NRS) for past 24 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and all endpoint visits (week 2, week 4, week 6, week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Volunteers will be asked to rate their level of pain on that day on an ordinal 11-box scale (0=no LBP; 10=worst LBP possible) at baseline and at all of the follow-up assessments. The NRS has excellent metric properties, is easy to administer and score, and has received much use in LBP research. Pain data will be collected at baseline and at all endpoint visits. The question will capture information pertaining to pain over the last 24 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bothersomeness of Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and all endpoint visits (week 2, week 4, week 6, week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The bothersomeness of symptoms commonly associated with LBP will be measured using an existing measure from the LBP literature. Bothersomeness questions are practical and have demonstrated good internal consistency, construct validity, and responsiveness to change with time in patients with LBP and sciatica.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare Utilization &amp; Medication Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and all endpoint visits (week 2, week 4, week 6, week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the pilot study, volunteers will most likely have been seen by other healthcare providers and prescribed pain medication by a primary care provider prior to being enrolled in the study, this questionnaire will ensure that we collect all healthcare and medication use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 and week 12</time_frame>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS was a recently developed scoring system consisting of a battery of assessment tools that measure patient-reported health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Back Pain Functional Scale (BPFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and all endpoint visits (week 2, week 4, week 6, week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The BPFS is a 12-question functional status survey designed for use as an individual patient decision-making tool. Each of the 12 questions is answered using a 5-point Likert-type scale and therefore scores for this scale will range from 0-60. In recent studies, the BPFS is improved sensitivity to change than the RMDQ. This scale will be administered at baseline and all endpoint visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Tobacco Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>As part of the nested cohort study, smokers will be asked about their tobacco use with the questionnaire by Gordon et al. The 7-day abstinence will be determined from the point-prevalence of tobacco use. Prolonged abstinence will be defined as no tobacco use in the prior 6 months. Other variables will include annual quit attempts, number of cigarettes smoked per day, extent of current tobacco use, and current readiness to quit.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Tobacco Dependence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>As part of the nested cohort study, the level of tobacco dependence will be evaluated as in Fagerstrom &amp; Schneider. We will ask how long the volunteer has smoked, how soon after waking the first cigarette is smoked, and if there are strong cravings when going two hours without a cigarette.</description>
