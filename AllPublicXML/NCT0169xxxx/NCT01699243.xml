  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Machine learning techniques and algorithms originally developed for use in the field of
      robotics can be applied to continuous, noninvasive physiological waveform data to discover
      hidden, hemodynamic relationships. Newly developed algorithms can, in real-time: 1) predict
      cardiovascular collapse well ahead of any clinically significant changes in standard vital
      signs, 2) monitor and estimate fluid resuscitation needs, 3) estimate acute blood loss
      volume, and 4) estimate intracranial pressure. The investigators hypothesize that these same
      methods can be used to predict functional hypovolemia during regional anesthesia for labor or
      fetal intervention.

      Specific aims:

        1. Collect noninvasive physiological waveform data from patients undergoing regional
           anesthesia for labor or fetal intervention at the University of Colorado Hospital and
           Children's Hospital Colorado.

        2. Combine the physiological data from patient monitors with clinical and demographic data,
           including maternal problem list, medications, volume infused, use of vasopressors,
           arterial and venous pressures, fetal heart rate, fetal umbilical artery Doppler
           velocimetry, maternal uterine artery Doppler waveform, fetal and neonatal outcomes etc.
           for use in developing mathematical model for early detection of maternal functional
           hypovolemia.

        3. Develop robust, real-time, computational models for:

             -  estimating maternal volume status prior to administration of epidural anesthesia

             -  estimating effective intravascular volume loss during maternal regional anesthesia

             -  predicting an optimal, individual specific requirement for IV resuscitation and/or
                need for vasopressor agents while providing adequate analgesia using regional
                techniques and optimizing the fetal outcomes

             -  identifying mothers susceptible to epidural induced hypotension
