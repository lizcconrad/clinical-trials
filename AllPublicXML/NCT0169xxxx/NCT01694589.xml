  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that administration of LDE-225 in humans with pancreatic cancer will result in
      inhibition of paracrine HH signaling in the pancreatic tumor stroma while having no effect on
      autocrine signaling in the tumor cell compartment. Furthermore we hypothesize that treatment
      with LDE-225 will result in changes in the tumor stroma (decreased desmoplasia, increased
      vascularity) that will result in improved tumor blood flow.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if, where and how LDE-225 works in pancreatic
      cancer. A cancer cell's growth can depend on the cells and tissue around it. The cells and
      tissue make chemical signals to influence the cancer's growth. This research study is
      evaluating LDE-225 designed to interfere with one of the growth signals causing pancreatic
      cancer growth.

             discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment. If it is essential
             that the patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be
             used with extra caution.

             initiation of study treatment. NB: Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise,
             that can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided whilst
             on LDE225 treatment.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 4 months after stopping study treatment.

          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and
             for 6 months after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.
