      This study examined the impact of using a motivational mobile text messaging intervention to
      increase step count among older community-dwelling African Americans. Secondary aims were to
      study the effects of text messaging on self-reported leisure time exercise behavior.

      Hypothesis:

      Participants in the motivational mobile text messaging group will have an increase step count
      after 6-weeks.

      Background: Older minority populations can benefit from increased physical activity,
      especially walking. Text messaging interventions have the potential to encourage positive
      changes in health behavior in these groups.

      Purpose: To examine if a six week program of motivational text messaging increases physical
      activity (step count) among older African Americans in an urban setting.

      Design: Randomized, controlled trial pilot study with assignment to motivational text
      messaging group or a control group.

      Setting/Participants: Thirty-six African Americans aged 60 to 85.

      Intervention: The intervention group received motivational text messages three times a day,
      three days a week, for six weeks. Both groups received pedometers and walking manuals to
      record step counts. Study was conducted and analyzed in 2011.

      Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure was step count. Secondary outcome measure was
      perceived activity levels assessed by the Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ).
