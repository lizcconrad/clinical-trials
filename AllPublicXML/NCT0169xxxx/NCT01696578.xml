  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the effects of biofeedback supported cognitive behavioral therapy
      (BF-CBT) and group physiotherapy intervention in victims of torture and massive violence in
      Kosovo. The investigators aim to restore physical and psychosocial functioning of the victims
      of torture and massive violence with available rehabilitation practice and integrate them
      into the community. It is also our objective to build local knowledge and expertise to apply
      measurement principles and CBT methods in the Balkan region.

      The primary objective of this project is to contribute to the promotion of evidence-based
      health intervention which is dealing with the long-term consequences of trauma in the
      post-conflict Kosovo.

      This is the second phase of a series of multi-site case studies. Based on the knowledge
      generated in the first phase of project in 2007-2009, the investigators conclude that there
      is a need to continue with health interventions in northern Kosovo among those who are still
      suffering from the long-term effects of trauma. Many problems need to be addressed, ranging
      from unemployment and sleep disturbances to a high suicide rate. As our study shows, the
      situation is frequently complicated by co-morbidity between mental and physical problems, in
      particular, anger, hatred, severe depression and chronic pain.

      At this phase, the investigators aim to provide the available rehabilitation service to the
      victims of torture and massive violence in northern Kosovo. The investigators undertake an
      integrated intervention approach; that is a biofeedback supported cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (BF-CBT), which involves anger management, anxiety and phobia treatment (based on
      prolong exposure therapy)and a group physiotherapy intervention, which promotes physical
      fitness and social participation. The ultimate goal of this project is to determine both
      feasibility and the effectiveness of combined interventions in the countries with limited
      resources.
