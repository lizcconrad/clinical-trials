    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Scores (Quality of Life and Outcome Assessments Measures: Participant Reported Outcomes [PRO])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI is a participant reported questionnaire that measures disease-associated disability (physical function). It consists of 24 questions with 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other daily activities. The disability section scores the participant's self-perception on the degree of difficulty (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do), covering the 8 domains. The HAQ-DI is a composite ranging from 0-3 with lower scores indicating less functional disability. The reported use of special aids or devices and/or the need for assistance of another person to perform these activities is assessed. Least Square (LS) mean was calculated using Mixed Model Repeated Measurements (MMRM) analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARD) experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score Fingernail Involvement at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The NAPSI scale is used to evaluate the severity of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps by area of involvement. The fingernail is divided into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the fingernail) and fingernail matrix Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the matrix), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant. The sum of all fingernails equals the total NAPSI score range is from 0 (no effect) to 80 (more severe psoriasis). LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Leeds Dactylitis Index-Basic (LDI-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The LDI-B measures the severity of dactylitis. In each digit, the ratio of the circumference of the affected digit to the circumference of the digit on the opposite hand or foot measured in mm. Each dactylitic digit was defined by a minimum increase of 10% in circumference over the contra-lateral digit. If the same digits on each hand or foot were thought to be involved, the clinician referred to a table of normative values for a value which was used to provide the comparison. The calculated ratio was multiplied by a tenderness score of 0 (not tender) or 1 (tender). Tenderness was assessed in the area between the joints. The results of each digit were then added to produce a total score. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is a self-administered measure used to answer 6 questions with a 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) VAS pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of axial activity. To give each symptom equal weighting, the mean of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score was divided by 5 to give a final 0 to 10 BASDAI Score. BASDAI ranges from 0-10. Higher scores represent greater disease activity. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Scores (Quality of Life and Outcome Assessments Measures: Participant Reported Outcomes [PRO])</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is a participant reported questionnaire that measures disease-associated disability (physical function). It consists of 24 questions with 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other daily activities. The disability section scores the participant’s self-perception on the degree of difficulty (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do), covering the 8 domains. The HAQ-DI is a composite ranging from 0-3 with lower scores indicating less functional disability. The reported use of special aids or devices and/or the need for assistance of another person to perform these activities is assessed. Least Square (LS) mean was calculated using Mixed Model Repeated Measurements (MMRM) analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARD) experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <description>The mTSS measures the extent of bone erosions (20 joints per hand and 12 joints per foot) and joint space narrowing (20 joints per hand and 6 joints per foot), with higher scores representing greater damage. An increase from baseline represents disease progression and / or joint worsening. Scores range from 0-528. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, and baseline cDMARD experience, visit, treatment by visit interaction.</description>

        <description>The LEI was developed specifically for use in PsA. It measures enthesitis at 6 sites (lateral epicondyle, left and right; medial femoral condyle, left and right; Achilles tendon insertion, left and right). Each site was assigned a score of 0 (absent) or 1 (present); the results from each site were then added to produce a total score (range 0 to 6). LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, treatment by visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fatigue Severity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Score (Quality of Life and Outcome Assessments Measures: Participant Reported Outcomes [PRO])</title>
        <description>The Fatigue Severity NRS is a participant-administered single-item 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no fatigue” and 10 representing “as bad as you can imagine.” Participants rated their fatigue (feeling tired or worn out) by circling the 1 number that described their worst level of fatigue during the past 24 hours. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Joint Space Narrowing Score (JSN) And Bone Erosion Score (BES)</title>
        <description>JSN score (a component of the modified Total Sharp Score [mTSS]) measures the extent of joint space narrowing in peripheral joints. JSN (20 joints per hand and 6 joints per foot), with higher scores representing greater damage. JSN score range is 0 (no narrowing) to 208 (high narrowing). Increase from baseline represents disease progression and / or joint worsening. BES (a component of the [mTSS]) measures the extent of bone erosion in peripheral joints. BES measures the extent of joint erosions (20 joints per hand and 12 joints per foot), with higher scores representing greater damage. Erosion score range is from 0 (no erosion) to 320 (high erosion). LS mean was calculated using linear extrapolation for ANCOVA analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, and baseline cDMARD experience.</description>

        <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a self-administered 16-item instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. A participant is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have felt for the past 7 days. Each item scaled from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (all symptoms). The 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains are summed to give a single score ranging from 0 to 27, with higher scores denoting greater symptom severity. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

A participant is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have felt for the past 7 days. Each item scaled from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (all symptoms). The 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains are summed to give a single score ranging from 0 to 27, with higher scores denoting greater symptom severity. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score (28 Diarthrodial Joint Count) Based on C-ReactiveProtein (DAS28-CRP) Measure: Non-Arthritic Disease</title>
        <description>The DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in 28 joints that consists of a composite numerical score with the following variables: TJC28, SJC28, hs-CRP (measured in mg/L), and Participant’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity recorded by participants on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) VAS. For DAS28-CRP, the Tender Joint Count 28 (TJC28) and Swollen Joint Count (SJC28) are a subset of TJC and SJC, and include 14 joints on each side of the body: 2 shoulders, 2 elbows, 2 wrists, 10 metacarpophalangeal joints, the 2 interphalangeal joints of the thumb, the 8 proximal interphalangeal joints, and the 2 knees. DAS28 values range from 0 to 9.4. Higher values indicate more severe symptoms and greater functional impairment. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score Fingernail Involvement at Baseline</title>
        <description>The NAPSI scale is used to evaluate the severity of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps by area of involvement. The fingernail is divided into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the fingernail) and fingernail matrix Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the matrix), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant. The sum of all fingernails equals the total NAPSI score range is from 0 (no effect) to 80 (more severe psoriasis). LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Leeds Dactylitis Index-Basic (LDI-B)</title>
        <description>The LDI-B measures the severity of dactylitis. In each digit, the ratio of the circumference of the affected digit to the circumference of the digit on the opposite hand or foot measured in mm. Each dactylitic digit was defined by a minimum increase of 10% in circumference over the contra-lateral digit. If the same digits on each hand or foot were thought to be involved, the clinician referred to a table of normative values for a value which was used to provide the comparison. The calculated ratio was multiplied by a tenderness score of 0 (not tender) or 1 (tender). Tenderness was assessed in the area between the joints. The results of each digit were then added to produce a total score. LS mean was calculated using MMRM analysis with treatment, baseline score, geographic region, baseline cDMARD experience, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

To give each symptom equal weighting, the mean of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score was divided by 5 to give a final 0 to 10 BASDAI Score. BASDAI ranges from 0-10. Higher scores represent greater disease activity.
