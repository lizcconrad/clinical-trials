  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In high-income societies the use of health care and medication is steadily increasing.
      Children have high morbidity, many visits at the general practitioner, an increasing number
      of hospitalisations, and an increasing use of medication. And, when children are ill, someone
      has to stay home to care for them. An un-explained global increase in the incidence of the
      allergic diseases eczema, wheezing, asthma and allergies means that 25% of high-income
      populations are affected. Cheap preventive measures are highly warranted. Recent studies have
      shown a positive, non-specific effect of early Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) immunisation on
      neonatal mortality in low-income countries and suggested a positive, non-specific effect on
      allergic disease in high-income countries. &quot;Non-specific&quot; means that the vaccine effect goes
      beyond prevention of the targeted disease, i.e. the BCG vaccine benefits the health status of
      the immunised individual in ways unrelated to protection against tuberculosis (TB). For
      instance, in a recent randomised trial in West Africa the investigators showed that the BCG
      vaccine at birth was safe in low birth weight (LBW) infants and significantly reduced
      neonatal mortality in these children, with a significant long-lasting effect on infant
      mortality in the smallest newborns with a birth weight &lt;1.5 kg. There is an urgent need to
      explore the huge potential of the BCG's beneficial immune-stimulatory effects among children
      in high-income populations.

      Therefore, the investigators will carry out a large prospective randomised clinical trial in
      Denmark primarily designed to test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at
      birth experience 20% fewer hospitalisations during early childhood.

      Secondary outcomes

        1. To test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth are prescribed less
           antibiotics during early childhood than non-BCG-immunised infants.

        2. To test the hypothesis that Danish infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth develop less
           eczema, asthmatic bronchitis/wheeze and food allergy at 3 and 12 months of age:
           self-reported, diagnosed by a physician, or found at clinical examination; and are
           prescribed less anti-eczema/asthma/allergy medication during early childhood than
           non-BCG-immunised infants.

        3. To test the hypothesis that infants who receive the BCG at birth respond in paraclinical
           measures: Specific IgE, thymic gland size, leucocyte count and differentiation, monocyte
           memory, cytokine profiles, and antibody titres following immunisation against
           diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcus, hemophilus.

        4. To test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth respond in growth
           measures: weight, length and head circumference.

        5. To test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth respond with
           decreased morbidity: common cold, pneumonia, febrile episodes, diarrhoea and vomiting,
           acute otitis media, febrile convulsions.

        6. To test the hypothesis that premature infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks
           who get the BCG vaccine at birth have unaffected psychomotor development measures: Ages
           and Stages scores.

        7. To test the hypothesis that infants who get the BCG vaccine at birth has unaffected
           coverage with the subsequent vaccinations in the Child Vaccination Programme.

        8. To test the above mentioned hypotheses specifically in the strata of premature and
           low-birth-weight Danish infants.

    <description>After parents having made the decision about whether to accept vaccination of their newborn through participation in The Danish Calmette Study, O'Connor's Decisional Conflict Scale was used to identify decisional conflicts. The score ranges from 0 (no decisional conflict) til 100 (maximum decisional conflict). Scores lower than 25 are associated with implementing decisions; scores exceeding 37.5 are associated with decision delay or feeling unsure about implementation; so a low score reflects a low level of doubt about the decision about participation/decline participation in the trial, and a high score reflects a high level of doubt.</description>

    <description>To test that the use of telephone and internet was acceptable in the study population using the Quality of Informed Consent (QuIC) questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into six categories; five on study comprehension and one on satisfaction with the information process. The items in the first five categories could be answered with &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;do not know&quot;. The last category was rated on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 being &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; and 7 being &quot;very satisfied&quot;. The primary outcome was the sum of the score for comprehension items and satisfaction items. Comprehension items were scored 1 point for each correct answer and 0 points for each incorrect answer. Satisfaction items were scored as rated on the 7-point Likert scale. Total score ranged from 7 to 69 points, comprehension score from 0 to 20 points and satisfaction score from 7 to 49 points. The higher score, the better comprehension and satisfaction.</description>

          <description>To test that premature infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks who get the BCG vaccine at birth have unaffected psychomotor development measures: ASQ: Ages and stages questionnaire – a parent reported questionnaire that measures child psychomotor development. Total range of ASQ score: 0 to 300 points. Higher scores indicate higher level of psychomotor development.</description>

        <title>Thymic Gland Size at 3 Months of Age</title>
        <description>To test that infants who receive the BCG at birth respond in thymic gland size defined by ultra sound examination. First, the thymus gland was identified in a horizontal scanning plane and the largest transverse diameter of the thymus was obtained. Second, in a sagittal scanning plane, the area of the largest lobe was assessed. Both measurements were obtained twice, and in case of more than 15% difference, both measurements were repeated. The mean of the two measurements were multiplied and defined as the thymic index.</description>

        <population>This outcome was a sub-study to The Danish Calmette Study with 301 (BCG 153, Control 148) participating children.</population>

        <title>Decisional Conflict Scale Score</title>
        <description>After parents having made the decision about whether to accept vaccination of their newborn through participation in The Danish Calmette Study, O’Connor’s Decisional Conflict Scale was used to identify decisional conflicts. The score ranges from 0 (no decisional conflict) til 100 (maximum decisional conflict). Scores lower than 25 are associated with implementing decisions; scores exceeding 37.5 are associated with decision delay or feeling unsure about implementation; so a low score reflects a low level of doubt about the decision about participation/decline participation in the trial, and a high score reflects a high level of doubt.</description>
        <time_frame>The decisional conflict score was measured before randomisation</time_frame>
        <population>This outcome was a sub-study to The Danish Calmette Study with 667 participating mothers and 320 declining mothers.</population>

        <description>To test that the use of telephone and internet was acceptable in the study population using the Quality of Informed Consent (QuIC) questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into six categories; five on study comprehension and one on satisfaction with the information process. The items in the first five categories could be answered with &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;do not know&quot;. The last category was rated on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 being “very dissatisfied” and 7 being “very satisfied”. The primary outcome was the sum of the score for comprehension items and satisfaction items. Comprehension items were scored 1 point for each correct answer and 0 points for each incorrect answer. Satisfaction items were scored as rated on the 7-point Likert scale. Total score ranged from 7 to 69 points, comprehension score from 0 to 20 points and satisfaction score from 7 to 49 points. The higher score, the better comprehension and satisfaction.</description>
