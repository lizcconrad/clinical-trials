    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in patients with advanced COPD and depression is twofold:

        1. Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session e-counseling intervention

        2. Determine the efficacy of the e-counseling intervention on depressive symptoms

      We hypothesize that patients who participate in e-counseling will have improved depressive
      symptoms compared to patients receiving usual care at 8 weeks.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of the death in the
      US. Although COPD is mostly preventable, there is no cure. Thus, care of patients with COPD
      is primarily focused on symptom palliation with the goal of improving quality of life for
      both patients and their families. These goals are highly consistent with core principles of
      palliative care. Dyspnea is the most distressing symptom for patients. Even optimal
      disease-directed treatment provides only partial relief from dyspnea. Depression is
      consistently associated with worse dyspnea, but the mechanisms underlying this relationship
      are poorly understood. Since existing treatment for dyspnea has only limited success and
      there is evidence that treating depression alleviates pain, we propose that by improving
      mood, we may be more successful in alleviating dyspnea. Psychosocial-behavioral therapy (PBT)
      which is focused on increasing pleasant events and improving problem solving skills has been
      shown to have immediate and sustained effects on depressive symptoms in patients with
      dementia and post-stroke holds tremendous promise for efficacy in advanced COPD. Testing the
      use of novel technologies to provide efficacious interventions such as PBT to patients with
      advanced disease is critical for translational palliative care research
