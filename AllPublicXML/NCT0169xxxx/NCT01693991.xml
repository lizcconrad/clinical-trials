      Research questions: Pilot study research questions: Primary: 1)Can we recruit a sufficient
      number (i.e., at least 60 patients over 9 months) and retain a sufficient proportion of both
      men and women (i.e., at least 80% at 2, 4, or 6 months post-randomization) with advanced
      cancer in all 3 trial arms to allow completion of a full study in 4 years?; 2)Is MMi
      acceptable: to a general ACP? to both men and women?; Secondary: 1)Is it feasible to complete
      the intervention in 3-4 weeks? 2)How long is it feasible to test MMi effects: 2, 4 or 6
      months post-randomization(retention rate=80%)? 3)Which recruitment strategies are most
      helpful? 4)What sample size is needed for a full study? Full-study research questions:
      Primary: Does adding the MMi to usual care (experimental group or EG) enhance meaning in life
      among newly diagnosed ACP, compared with those receiving usual care plus meetings with an
      empathic non-professional visitor (i.e., attention-control group or AC) or usual care alone
      (UC), at x months post-randomization? (time determined in pilot) &quot;Meaning in life&quot; (primary
      outcome) is defined as the belief that one's life has significance and purpose (i.e., global
      meaning) and &quot;newly diagnosed ACP&quot; is defined as the 6 months after first occurrence of,
      progression toward, or recurrence of stage III or IV cancer (TNM classification system).
      Secondary: In our future full-study, we plan to evaluate MMi effects on secondary outcomes
      such as existential wellbeing (MQOL existential wellbeing) and posttraumatic growth
      (Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory). We also plan to test a theoretical model where sense of
      meaning in life has a protective (moderating) effect on tertiary outcomes such as physical
      QoL (MQOL physical subscale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      (HADS)), and overall QoL (MQOL Total) in EG patients. Methodology: RCT pilot study with 60
      newly diagnosed ACP (stages III or IV) within 2 months of referral and 6 months of
      randomization, assigned randomly to: (1) EG, (2) AC, or (3) UC. Patients will complete
      self-report questionnaires (including outcome measures, as well as sociodemographic and
      medical variables) at 2, 4 and 6 months post-randomization.

    <description>Is the MMi acceptable to at least 80% of men and women with advanced cancer, as indicated by 80% positive responses on the Pilot-Study Questionnaire (PSQ; adapted from the CSQ-8; Attkisson &amp; Zwick, 1982) Q#7 (score 3 or 4), Q#8, and Q#9 (score 5, 6 or 7).
PSQ Q#7: Would you recommend those types of meetings to other people in your situation? 1= no, definitively not; 2= no, I don't think so; 3= yes, I think so; 4= yes, definitively PSQ Q#8: Were the meetings acceptable? PSQ Q#9: On the whole, how positive or negative was your experience of the meetings? 1= Totally negative; 2= Very negative; 3= A little negative; 4= Neutral; 5= A little positive; 6= Very positive; 7= Totally positive</description>

    <description>Which recruitment strategies are most effective, defined as the strategies recruiting the largest % of participants. Strategies recruiting &lt;5% of participants will be considered unhelpful. All participants will be queried as to how they found out about the study. Recruitment strategies will include: being recruiting directly through the treating team, posted ads in recruiting oncology clinics, use of local media (newspaper and radio interviews), and creation of a website linked with the Jewish General Hospital and the McGill University Health Centre.</description>

    <description>MMi and attention control sessions will take place weekly for 3 weeks at the patient's home or hospital, as the patient prefers. We will try to limit delays to no more than 1 week if needed (e.g., for recovery from treatment side-effects), but because the feasibility of this schedule is one of the research questions, if more flexibility is required we will not withdraw people from the study if the delay is longer, since a longer intervention period could be incorporated in a full-scale RCT. Dates and duration of each session will be tracked. MMi sessions will be conducted by 2 bilingual mental health professionals (nurse, social worker, or psychologist) with at least 1 year of clinical oncology experience and will be initiated within 1 week after randomization.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: 1) Diagnosed with advanced cancer (stage III or IV --TNM classification
        system; 117); first occurrence, progression or recurrence) of any type of solid tumour &lt;2
        months at referral and &lt;6 months at randomization. 2) Willing to participate in weekly MMi
        or AC sessions. 3) &gt;18 years. 4) Alert and capable of giving free and informed consent. 5)
        Able to speak and read English or French. Exclusion Criteria: 1) Karnofsky Performance

        Oncology Group (ECOG) Common Toxicity Criteria or with more than 3 markers with a score of
        2 (moderate side-effects), as evaluated by the treating physician (in consultation with the
        radiotherapist. 3) Suicidal. Present a score of ≥2 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)
        suicide item (item #9), administered by the RC or RA during the consent meeting. 4) Known
        diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 5) Planning a trip within 2 months
