  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchoscopy is a technique which currently allows the investigation of many respiratory
      diseases (infections, neoplasia, inflammation…) as well as endobronchial therapeutic
      procedures.

      Good flexible bronchoscopy diagnostic practices suggest the use of anxiolytic premedication
      before endoscopy, but practices concerning the use of sedation further to the completion of
      the endoscopy are very heterogeneous.

      We thus propose to compare, during a randomize, controlled trial, respiratory tolerance to
      I.V. versus sublingual sedation in two groups of patients indergoing bronchoscopy
