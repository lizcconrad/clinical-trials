  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses new methods called &quot;genome sequencing&quot; that allow the investigators to study
      part or all of a person's genome. The genome is the collection of all of a person's genes.
      Genes carry the instructions that our bodies need to develop and function. Genes are passed
      on from one generation to the next. Genome sequencing can study all of a person's genome
      (whole genome sequencing) or just parts of their genome (whole exome sequencing). In the
      study, the investigators refer to all these research methods as 'genome sequencing'. Genome
      sequencing typically shows a large number of gene changes, known as &quot;variants.&quot; Some (but not
      all) of these genetic variants may be linked to increased risks of diseases other than
      cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to learn what kinds of genetic variants the patient wants to
      learn about from their genome.

    <description>of receiving incidentally identified disease risk results from whole genome/exome sequencing. Safety is defined as no more than 20% of participants experiencing clinically meaningful levels of distress at 1 week follow-up, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale (HADS; score &gt; or = to 8 on the anxiety sub-scale). Patients will be considered evaluable for the primary outcome if they are not distressed at baseline and have completed the 1 week follow-up assessment.</description>

    <description>A week before the participants return to the clinic to learn of their results, the RSA will call each participant to complete the Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale (HADS), revised Impact of Events Scale (IES-R), &amp; a questionnaire about their health behaviors, to establish baseline distress levels &amp; health behaviors. A week later, participants will return to the Clinical Genetics Service to review their results with the genetics provider &amp; discuss resultant therapeutic &amp; management recommendations for the participants &amp; their relatives. A week later, the RSA will call each participant to complete the HADS, IES-R again, to establish the safety of receiving these results. Participants will also be asked to complete the revised Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment (MICRA) measure. The RSA will also invite participants to complete an in-depth telephone interview.</description>
