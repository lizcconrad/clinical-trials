    <description>The procedure is performed under transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) guidance. After a transseptal puncture is performed, a pigtail catheter is maneuvered into the LAA to perform an LAA angiogram. Through the use of a combination of this angiographic and TEE information, a Watchman device, ranging in size between 21 and 33 mm in diameter, is selected. The device comes prepackaged in a catheter-based delivery system that is advanced into the LAA through a 12F transseptal sheath (outer diameter, 14F). Proper positioning and stability of the device are verified by TEE and angiography before device release.</description>

    <description>The left atrium (LA) and pulmonary veins (PVs) were explored through a transseptal approach. Real-time three-dimensional (3D) LA maps were reconstructed by using a nonfluoroscopic navigation system (CARTO, Biosense-Webster Inc.). The ipsilateral left and right PVs were encircled in 1 lesion line by circumferential PV isolation. Radiofrequency energy was delivered at 43◦C, 35 W, 0.5 cm away from the PV ostia at the anterior wall, and was reduced to 43◦C, 30 W, 1 cm away from the PV ostia at the posterior wall, with a saline irrigation speed of 17 mL/min. Each lesion was ablated continuously until the local potential amplitude decreased by &gt;80% or RF energy deliveries exceeded 40 seconds. The endpoint of circumferential PV isolation was PV isolation; this was confirmed when Lasso mapping showed the disappearance of all PV potentials or the dissociation of PV potentials from left atrial activity.</description>

    <description>Warfarin was discontinued in 45 days after procedure in case of no trombus by TE for &quot;Watchman group&quot;
All patients in &quot;Warfarin group&quot; continued to receive Warfarin during hole study period with IMR from II to III.</description>
