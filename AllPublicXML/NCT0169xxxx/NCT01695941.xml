      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of alisertib and bortezomib when
      given together with rituximab in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma or B-cell low
      grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does
      not respond to treatment (refractory). Alisertib and bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving
      alisertib and bortezomib together with rituximab may be a better treatment for relapsed or
      refractory mantle cell lymphoma or B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of alisertib (MLN8237) and bortezomib when
      combined with rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell and B-cell low grade
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the rate of overall response (complete response and partial response) for
      patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell and B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      treated with the combination of MLN8237 plus bortezomib and rituximab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical significance of Aurora A over-expression and the proliferative
      index in initial tumor biopsy specimens from patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell
      and B-cell low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with the combination of MLN8237 plus
      bortezomib and rituximab.

      II. To evaluate and compare in paired biopsy specimens pre-treatment and on day 8: apoptosis
      and G2M arrest, and the expression level of cell cycle related proteins including: cyclin D1,
      p53, BIM-1, p27, p21, noxa, puma and survivin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib and bortezomib.

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7; bortezomib
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, and 15; and rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Note: *After 8 courses, treatment with rituximab repeats once every 3 courses (12 weeks) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
