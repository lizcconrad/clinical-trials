    <textblock>
      Focused Ultrasound Focused ultrasound is an attractive method for non-invasive thermal
      ablation of soft tissue tumors. Treatment begins by acquiring a series of MR images of the
      target organ. The physician then identifies a target volume in the MR images and delineates
      the treatment contours on the images. Therapy planning software calculates the parameters
      required to effectively treat the defined target volume. During the treatment an ultrasound
      transducer generates and focuses ultrasound energy to a focal point, called a sonication. The
      sonication raises the tissue temperature within a well-defined region to a degree, which
      causes thermal coagulation. MR images acquired during sonication provide a quantitative,
      real-time temperature map of the target area to confirm the location of the sonication and
      the size of the coagulated region. The sonication process is repeated at multiple adjacent
      points to cover the entire prescribed treatment volume.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ages over 18 years old that give informed written consent to
             participate in study. Females in reproductive age have to provide a negative serum
             pregnancy test.

          2. Patients with primary diagnosis (biopsy proven) of a malignant glioma or a recurrent
             glioma, that do not accept a conventional tumor resection or where a conventional
             tumor resection is not indicated according to both the neurosurgeon in charge and the
             neuro-oncology colloquium at the Kantonsspital Aarau.

             Or:

             Patients with a supratentorial brain metastasis of a malignant tumor, that do not
             accept a conventional tumor resection or where a conventional tumor resection is not
             indicated according to the neurosurgeon in charge and the neuro-oncology colloquium at
             the Kantonsspital Aarau.

          3. The portion of the tumor to be treated during one intervention is less than 3.0 cm in
             diameter, corresponding to a volume of ca. 14 cc.

             If the total size of the tumor is larger than 3.0 cm in diameter then eventual
             complementing ablations will not be performed before 2 week after the first treatment.

          4. The tumor to be treated is clearly defined and can be well distinguished from
             surrounding brain tissue.

          5. The border of the targeted tumor volume has in all directions a distance of at least
             2.5 cm from the inner table of the skull. Portions of the tumor that are not planned
             to be treated due to this safety margin will be marked.

          6. Patients must have an ASA score 1-2, and a Karnofsky score 70-100

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All tumor Types

          1. Clinical or neuroradiological signs of increased intracranial pressure.

          2. Significantly increased vascularization of tumor in preoperative MR-angiogram or in
             digital subtraction angiography (DSA).

          3. Tumor mass effect that causes midline shift or a shift of the third (3rd) ventricle of
             more than 5 mm, even after steroid therapy.

          4. The border of the tumor portion to be treated is less then 5mm away from a main branch
             of a brain vessel, the venous sinuses, the pituitary gland or the cranial nerves.

          5. The tumor is in immediate proximity to a cystic formation.

          8. Tumors with presumably high risk of bleeding

          9. Oral anticoagulant or thrombocyte aggregation suppression (e.g. ASS) that was not
             stopped at least 5 days before the intervention.

             pacemaker.

         11. Clips and other implants in the sonication path or in the target area.
