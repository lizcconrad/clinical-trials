    <textblock>
      Seasonal influenza (flu) is a significant and sometimes serious health issue in the U.S. The
      Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that over 200,000 people are hospitalized in the
      U.S each year related to the flu. Public health campaigns advocate widespread vaccination for
      the flu, and especially for high risk people. People with cancer are high risk, with an
      increased risk of developing complications from the flu, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, or
      worsening of other medical conditions. As part of their vaccination campaign, the CDC
      strongly encourages inpatients to be vaccinated prior to hospital discharge. Accordingly,
      Stony Brook Hospital has enacted a policy that mandates screening all hospital inpatients for
      vaccination prior to discharge. While physicians or patients can opt not to vaccinate, the
      default is to proceed. Surgical oncologists have several concerns about vaccinating their
      patients after major surgical procedures. Patients with cancer have impaired immunity, and
      the ability of our patients to mount an effective immune response to the vaccine is unclear.
      Conversely, due to their immunocompromised state, our patients may be more susceptible to
      complications from the vaccine, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI), or have higher rates of
      postoperative complications due to the additional immune challenge of the vaccine. Previous
      studies have evaluated the flu vaccine in patients receiving chemotherapy, or after organ
      transplantation, but the combination of cancer and major surgery remains unstudied.

      This is a collaborative study with Infectious Diseases and Microbiology to evaluate the
      response to the flu vaccine in patients with pancreatic or gastric cancer, soft tissue
      sarcoma or peritoneal surface disease (i.e. carcinomatosis from appendiceal or colon
      cancers). Patients will be randomly selected to receive the vaccine either 2 weeks
      preoperatively or postoperatively at the time of discharge. Serum antibody response, rates of
      ILI and post-op complications will be analyzed. The long term goal of this study is two-fold:
      to determine the optimal time to vaccinate this group of patients in relation to their
      surgery, and to improve compliance with vaccination.
