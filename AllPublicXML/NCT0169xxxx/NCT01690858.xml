  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the role of complement dysregulation and its impact on
      antiangiogenic factors (soluble Flt1 and endoglin) in patients with foetal losses.

    <textblock>
      Females with medical history of repeated foetal losses will have blood sampling to perform
      analyses. If pregnant, blood sampling will be performed at different times throughout the
      pregnancy.

      Controls will be females without medical history of repeated foetal losses. They will also
      have blood sampling to perform analyses. If pregnant, blood sampling will be performed at
      different times throughout the pregnancy.

      Blood analyses will focus on :

        -  mutations in genes coding for molecules that modulate complement activity

        -  serum levels of sFlt1 and endoglin and their link to complement activation
