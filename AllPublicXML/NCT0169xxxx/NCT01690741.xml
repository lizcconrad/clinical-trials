    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to test the anti-cancer peptide Nerofe in humans. It will
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic behavior, and pharmacodynamic and clinical effects of
      Nerofe given intravenously every other day to patients with advanced malignant disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 single-center, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be
      conducted in 2 phases. The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of Nerofe and evaluate its safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
      immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical effects. The subsequent Dose Confirmation Phase will
      be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD of Nerofe. Subjects will be treated with IV doses
      of Nerofe thrice weekly (on alternating days) in consecutive, 28-day cycles. Subjects will be
      evaluated regularly for safety. Subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience
      progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or meet any of the other withdrawal criteria may
      continue to receive Nerofe for up to 6 cycles, at the discretion of the Principal
      Investigator. Throughout the trial, oversight will be provided by the Clinical Safety
      Committee.

         20. Men who partner with a woman of childbearing potential, unless they agree to use
             effective, dual contraceptive methods (ie, a condom, with female partner using oral,
             injectable, or barrier method) while on study drug and for 3 months afterward.

         21. Any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with
             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the investigator's opinion, would make the
             patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
