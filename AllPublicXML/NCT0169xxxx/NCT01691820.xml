      The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence of CMV secondary infections
      (re-infections/re-activations) and the incidence of CMV primary infections in adolescent
      females.

             requirements of the protocol.

          -  Written informed assent and/or consent obtained from the subject and/or the
             parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject.

          -  Subject is likely to remain in the area and/or return for required study Site Visits
             and complete Sample Collection Visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care.

          -  Use or planned use of any investigational or non-registered antiviral drug or vaccine
             during the study period.

          -  Known medical history of any recurrent clinical herpes episodes requiring episodic or
             chronic suppressive treatment with oral or parenteral antiviral treatment such as
             acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir or any other anti-herpes virus anti-viral during
             the year preceding enrolment. Topical anti-viral are allowed.

          -  Subjects with history of previous vaccination against CMV.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6
