      -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of
           PRLX 93936 administered IV 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for 3 weeks
           followed by a 9 day rest period, as treatment for patients with relapsed or
           relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

        -  To establish the dose of PRLX 93936 recommended for future studies.

        -  To characterize potential toxicities of PRLX 93936.

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of PRLX 93936.

        -  To evaluate response to treatment, time to response (TTR) and duration of response.

        -  To evaluate time to progression (TTP).
