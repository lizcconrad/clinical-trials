      This study is designed to look at that involvement of a process in the brain called the
      glutamate system in depression. Participants will undergo a screening session, up to two
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans, and up to three Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) scans, as well as cognitive testing at each scan session. For one of the PET
      scans, a drug (either ketamine or n-acetyl cysteine) will be administered.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize administration of ketamine or n-acetylcysteine
      (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills
      after drug challenge.

      Hypothesis 3: The investigators hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in
      MRI measures post drug challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis.

      Hypothesis 4: We expect there should not be a significant difference in reduction in mGluR5
      availability due to differences in ABP688 radiotracer infusion.

      Aim 1: To determine the acute effect of medication-induced glutamate release on mGluR5
      availability in human subjects. Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize administration of ketamine or
      n-acetylcysteine (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5 availability.

      Aim 2: To determine if glutamate release via administration of ketamine or NAC has pro
      cognitive benefits.

      Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills after drug
      challenge.

      Aim 3: To determine if there is synaptogenesis detectable by PET and MRI post ketamine or NAC
      within a week of drug challenge (at the time of greatest antidepressant response). Hypothesis
      3: We hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in MRI measures, post drug
      challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis.

      Aim 4: To determine if there is a difference in reduction of mGluR5 availability after
      ketamine administration when radiotracer is administered bolus as compared to bolus to
      constant infusion in the same subjects (ABP688 radiotracer only).

      Hypothesis 4: We expect there should not be a significant difference in reduction in mGluR5
      availability due to differences in ABP688 radiotracer infusion.

          <title>Change in Glutamate Levels at Baseline and After Ketamine Administration as Confirmed by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging</title>
          <description>PET imaging obtained in healthy and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) subjects. Glutamate levels determined by radiotracer uptake in PET images.</description>
          <population>13 healthy (6 males, 7 females) and 14 MDD non-smokers (4 males, 10 females) Mean age: 33.5 ± 13.2 yrs reasons for discrepancy (participant flow module): some data was not able to be analyzed due to elevated metabolites; some subject did not tolerate ketamine and had to be pulled out of scanner so we could not obtain data.</population>
