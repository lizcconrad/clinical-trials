  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased postprandial plasma triglycerides are associated with increased cardiovascular
      risk. Chronic consumption of carbohydrates is associated with increased levels of
      triglycerides. Very few studies have assessed the effect of acute consumption of
      carbohydrates on plasma triglycerides and lipoprotein production and clearance. The present
      study aims to assess the effects of acute administration of glucose and fructose on hepatic
      and intestinal lipoprotein production.

      Each subject will be studied twice 4-6 weeks apart in random order in this single blinded
      study. A nasoduodenal tube will be sited under fluoroscopic guidance the day prior to the
      study.In study A they will receive intraduodenal intralipid (20% at 60 ml/hour) alongside 60
      ml/hour of 20% dextrose or fructose for 15 hours starting at 4am. In study B they will
      receive 60 ml/hour of intraduodenal intralipid with 60ml/hour of normal saline for 15 hours
      from 4am. A pancreatic clamp (octreotide with replacement glucose, insulin, glucagon and
      growth hormone) will be started at 7am. From 9am an iv bolus of deuterated-glycerol
      (d5-glycerol) along with a regular infusion of deuterated leucine (L-[5,5,5-2H3]. Regular
      blood samples will be drawn to assess lipoprotein kinetics.
