      This is an observational study of lone Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting procedures with
      endoscopic vein graft harvesting using best harvesting practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational study of 100 patients who
      will undergo routine coronary artery bypass grafting. Eligible candidates will undergo lone
      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) procedures with endoscopic vein harvesting using best
      harvesting practices, defined as: systemic heparinization prior to vein manipulation,
      standardization of vein graft harvesting techniques, pressure limiting syringe and 3 month
      use of dual anti-platelet therapy. Patients will undergo a CT angiography at 30 days and 12
      months to assess vein graft patency.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimal Improvement of Vein Graft Patency Long Term by the Implementation of Novel Endoscopic Harvesting Techniques</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate improved vein graft patency rates at 12 months for endoscopically harvest saphenous vein grafts by employment of modifications to existing techniques in vein graft handling during harvests. Vein graft patency will be measured at 30 days post CABG and at one year post CABG as evaluated by cardiac CT angiography or cardiac catheterization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OPTION</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To develop a standardized approach for harvesting, handling and preparing vein grafts in the endoscopic approach. By capturing the following:
Incidence of vein graft failure at the time of initial CABG as evaluated by transit time graft flow measurements
Incidence of vein graft failure at post-operative day 30 as evaluated by cardiac CT angiography or cardiac catheterization
Incidence of vein graft failure at each interval (30 day and 12 month) as categorized by:
Harvested vessel
vein graft destinations
vein graft quality</description>
