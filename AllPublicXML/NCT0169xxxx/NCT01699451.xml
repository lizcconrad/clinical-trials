      This study is intended to obtain clinical information and establish a repository of DNA, RNA,
      peripheral blood monocyte, lymphocyte and skin tissue samples from people with ALS and
      related neurodegenerative motor neuron diseases, people with a family history of these
      conditions, and healthy people with no family history of these disorders. The samples will be
      used in future research to learn about how these disorders affect people, what causes these
      conditions, and how the investigators can tell when someone has this kind of disease. Future
      research may also include the generation of stem cells from stored blood cell and skin cell
      samples. Participants will not be paid for taking part in this study.

      This study will establish a repository of stored DNA, RNA, monocyte, lymphocyte and skin
      fibroblast samples from people with ALS and ALS-FTD, subjects with a family history of ALS
      who do not have ALS or ALS-FTD, and subjects with no personal history of ALS or dementia, to
      support future translational and basic research studies on ALS and related neurodegenerative
      disorders.

  <eligibility>

      <textblock>
        Eligible patients will be female or male, &gt; or = 18 years of age. ALS and control subjects
        will meet eligibility criteria. Control subjects will be similar in age to ALS patients. No
        special classes of subjects are specifically sought or excluded from the protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ALS Patient

               1. Clinical diagnosis of possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable or
                  definite ALS according to modified EL Escorial criteria, suspected ALS according
                  to original El Escorial criteria, or diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder
                  with evidence of ALS plus extramotor features

               2. &gt; or = 18 years of age and willing to provide consent, or assent, if unable to
                  consent

          -  Subject with family history of ALS or other relevant neurodegenerative disease

               1. No personal history of ALS, ALS-FTD or other motor neuron disease

               2. Family history of ALS, ALS-FTD in a first, second or third degree blood relative

               3. &gt; or = 18 years of age and willing to provide consent

          -  Control

               1. No personal or family history (first or second degree blood relative) of ALS,
                  dementia, Parkinson disease or other relevant neurodegenerative disorder

               2. &gt; or = 18 years of age and willing to provide consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ALS Subject and subject with family history of ALS/ALS-FTD or other neurodegenerative
             motor neuron disorder but no personal history of such conditions

               1. History of medical disorder that leaves in question whether neurological signs
                  and symptoms potentially related to a neurodegenerative disease may be
                  contributed to by an acquired condition

               2. Limited mental capacity rendering the subject unable to comply with skin punch
                  biopsy or standard phlebotomy procedures

               3. For collection of skin punch biopsy, an increased risk of bleeding complications
                  or allergy to local anesthetic administered at the time of skin biopsy

          -  Healthy Control Subject

               1. Personal or family history of dementia or other neurodegenerative disease
                  (Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, etc.)

               2. Limited mental capacity rendering the subject unable to provide written informed
                  consent or comply with standard phlebotomy procedures

               3. For collection of skin punch biopsy, an increased risk of bleeding complications
                  or allergy to local anesthetic administered at the time of skin biopsy
