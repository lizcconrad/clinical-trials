  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of ceramic water filters to reduce the burden
      of waterborne diarrheal illness among infants in selected villages in Kenya. In Kenya very
      young children are given drinking water or water is used in reconstitution of their food. We
      hypothesize that ceramic water filters will remove Cryptosporidium from drinking water
      reducing infection in infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhea is a major cause of illness among children in Africa. Cryptosporidium is a protozoan
      waterborne diarrheal pathogen resistant to chlorine. Ceramic filters are effective at
      improving drinking water quality, including removal of protozoa. In a recent preliminary
      analysis of &gt;22,000 children &lt;5 years enrolled in the Global Enterics Multi-Center Study
      (GEMS) case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, Cryptosporidium was identified as a
      leading cause of diarrhea in infants across all four participating African sites. This pilot
      is the first Cryptosporidium specific intervention trial of household ceramic water filters
      to reduce the burden of cryptosporidiosis acquired through drinking water in rural Kenya.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Children 4-10 months old living in selected villages in the Asembo Health and Demographic
        Surveillance System (HDSS) study area in Kenya whose primary caretakers consent on their
        behalf to be visited weekly for 6 months to carry out weekly illness surveillance, and have
        a follow up home visit one year after initial enrollment into the trial. The household in
        which the child resides must be a consenting participant in the HDSS. As the children
        included in the trial are infants, the child's primary caretaker will be invited to
        participate and be administered questionnaires. Random selection will be at the compound
        level. Only one household per compound will be eligible for selection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children 4-10 months old whose households are not active consenting participants in the
        HDSS will not be eligible for inclusion. Only the subset of children 4-10 months old who
        are randomly selected in the sample will be eligible for participation.

Ceramic water filter: In total, 120 households with a child 4-10 months old will receive a Cera Maji ceramic water filter for treatment of drinking water at initial entry into the study (intervention group), and 120 households with a child 4-10 months old at initial entry into the study will not receive a ceramic water filter (control group). The study duration will be 6 months. All households in the control group will receive a Cera Maji ceramic water filter when the study ends.</description>
