  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate dosing regimen of fosaprepitant,
      when administered with ondansetron (with or without dexamethasone), for the prevention of
      CINV in children from birth to &lt;17 years of age. Fosaprepitant is a prodrug to aprepitant.
      All participants who completed the randomized Cycle 1 could elect to receive open-label
      fosaprepitant during optional Cycles 2-6.

      Under Amendment 01, 0517-029 enrolled participants in the following age cohorts: 2-&lt;6, 6-&lt;12
      and 12-17 years old. The study was randomized, partially-blinded, with parallel group
      assignment. Participants were randomized to one of three fosaprepitant doses or the control
      group. (Amendment 02 and Amendment 03 were country-specific amendments in Brazil that were
      required as per local regulations with no change in study design.) Under Amendment 04, the
      12-17 year-old cohort was closed since that cohort fully enrolled. An additional
      fosaprepitant dose was added and all participants were allocated to this one treatment group.
      Amendment 04 was open-label and enrolled participants in the following age cohorts: 0-&lt;2,
      2-&lt;6 and 6-&lt;12 years old.

    <description>Fosaprepitant is a pro-drug that is rapidly converted to aprepitant. Because of this rapid conversion to aprepitant, fosaprepitant cannot be assessed directly. The pharmacokinetics for each fosaprepitant dose were determined by analyzing aprepitant in plasma. The C24hr for aprepitant was determined by measuring aprepitant levels in the time frame of 23 to 25 hours post-infusion.</description>

    <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE.</description>

        <title>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Aprepitant in Participants 0 to &lt;2 Years of Age</title>
        <description>Fosaprepitant is a pro-drug that is rapidly converted to aprepitant. Because of this rapid conversion to aprepitant, fosaprepitant cannot be assessed directly. The pharmacokinetics for each fosaprepitant dose were determined by analyzing aprepitant in plasma. The Cmax for aprepitant was determined by measuring aprepitant levels at pre-infusion, immediately after infusion, and 2-4, 5-7, 8-10, 23-25, and 46-50 hours post-infusion.</description>

        <title>Concentration of Aprepitant After 24 Hours (C24hr) in Participants 0 to &lt;2 Years of Age</title>
        <description>Fosaprepitant is a pro-drug that is rapidly converted to aprepitant. Because of this rapid conversion to aprepitant, fosaprepitant cannot be assessed directly. The pharmacokinetics for each fosaprepitant dose were determined by analyzing aprepitant in plasma. The C24hr for aprepitant was determined by measuring aprepitant levels in the time frame of 23 to 25 hours post-infusion.</description>

        <description>Fosaprepitant is a pro-drug that is rapidly converted to aprepitant. Because of this rapid conversion to aprepitant, fosaprepitant cannot be assessed directly. The pharmacokinetics for each fosaprepitant dose were determined by analyzing aprepitant in plasma. The AUC 0-∞ for aprepitant was determined by measuring aprepitant levels at pre-infusion, immediately after infusion, and 2-4, 5-7, 8-10, 23-25, and 46-50 hours post-infusion.</description>

          <description>Fosaprepitant is a pro-drug that is rapidly converted to aprepitant. Because of this rapid conversion to aprepitant, fosaprepitant cannot be assessed directly. The pharmacokinetics for each fosaprepitant dose were determined by analyzing aprepitant in plasma. The C48hr for aprepitant was determined by measuring aprepitant levels in the time frame of 46 to 50 hours post-infusion. The C48hr was only planned to be measured in the 5 mg/mL dose for each age group.</description>

The AUC 0-∞ for aprepitant was determined by measuring aprepitant levels at pre-infusion, immediately after infusion, and 2-4, 5-7, 8-10, 23-25, and 46-50 hours post-infusion.</description>

        <title>CL/F of Aprepitant in Participants 6 to &lt;12 Years of Age</title>
        <description>Fosaprepitant is a pro-drug that is rapidly converted to aprepitant. Because of this rapid conversion to aprepitant, fosaprepitant cannot be assessed directly. The pharmacokinetics for each fosaprepitant dose were determined by analyzing aprepitant in plasma. The CL/F for aprepitant was determined by measuring aprepitant levels at pre-infusion, immediately after infusion, and 2-4, 5-7, 8-10, 23-25, and 46-50 hours post-infusion.</description>

        <description>Fosaprepitant is a pro-drug that is rapidly converted to aprepitant. Because of this rapid conversion to aprepitant, fosaprepitant cannot be assessed directly.

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE) in Cycle 1</title>
          <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE.</description>
