  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether sustainable daily physical activity is
      effective in improving biological indicators of health and self-reported quality of life in
      men with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Living with prostate cancer is a unique challenge faced by millions of men across the globe.
      Existing research has indicated many potential methods of attenuating prostate cancer
      progression and preserving patients' quality of life, but is lacking in definitive
      conclusions regarding the effectiveness of these methods in practice. This study seeks to
      further investigate the impact of post-diagnosis physical activity on biological indicators
      of health and self-reported quality of life in a cohort of men with prostate cancer in
      Sweden. Participants are randomized to either a walking intervention group, which encourages
      walking 10,000 steps per day for one year, or to a standard-or-care control group, and
      followed for 11 weeks.

    <description>Participants are provided with the current standard of prostate cancer care, and are additionally encouraged to walk 10,000 steps per day, as measured by pedometers provided at start of intervention. Once a week, participants will take part in a group walk with 7-8 other participants and a research nurse. Participants are also encouraged to keep a walking journal, in which they record the number of steps they walk each day. This journal is submitted to investigators at the end of the intervention period.</description>
