    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of tivantinib on the QTc interval in
      patients with solid tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to estimate the maximum change in QTcF (change from baseline) between
      placebo and multiple-dose tivantinib. A tivantinib oral dose of 360 mg BID has been selected
      for this study because this is the highest dose currently being evaluated in clinical
      studies.
