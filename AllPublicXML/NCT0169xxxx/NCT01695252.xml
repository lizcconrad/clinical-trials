  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Providing feedback on patient progress to therapists improves clinical outcomes for patients,
      particularly those who are failing to improve with therapy. The encouraging research has been
      carried out by a small group of researchers, largely working in the United States health care
      context. The samples studied have been young people attending university counselling
      services, suffering from mild mental health disorders. The group studies are therefore not
      similar to patients seen for psychological therapy in the NHS. Also given that therapists are
      not necessarily alert to treatment failure, have an overly optimistic view of their patients
      progress even when provided with evidence to the contrary, clinical supervision may be a more
      effective method through which to provide patient informed clinical outcomes than directly to
      therapists themselves.

      We will assess if providing feedback through the supervision process is more effective than
      providing this information to therapists themselves in terms of improving clinical outcomes,
      particularly for patients who are failing to improve with routine NHS Psychological therapy.
