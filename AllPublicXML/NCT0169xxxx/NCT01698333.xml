    <textblock>
      Adrenal suppression effects of corticosteroids are among the most important safety concerns
      for this group of products. This study is designed to determine the adrenal effects of the
      investigational formulation of 122-0551 and characterize the steady state pharmacokinetics of
      the formulation.
