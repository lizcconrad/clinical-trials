  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether individuals who suffer from depression and obesity are able to lose
      weight and show improvements in mood and cardiovascular disease risk factors following 20
      weeks of a combined treatment of cognitive-behavior therapy for depression and behavior
      modification for weight loss. Participants will be assigned to one of three treatments: 1)
      cognitive-behavior therapy for the treatment of depression combined with an alternative
      approach to weight loss, 2) a weight loss intervention combined with a depression support and
      education , or 3) cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression combined with a weight loss
      intervention.
