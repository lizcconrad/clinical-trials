      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate in
      male Filipino patients with advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
      who have received prior chemotherapy containing a taxane.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), observational study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate in male Filipino patients with
      advanced metastatic CRPC who have received prior chemotherapy containing a taxane.
      Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled. Abiraterone acetate will be administered
      according to the approved product insert with a low-dose glucocorticoid (prednisone or
      prednisolone). Patient assessments will be based on the accepted clinical practice in the
      Philippines. Patients will be monitored for 40 weeks.

             uncontrolled infection

          -  Abnormal liver function

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;=160 mmHg or diastolic blood

          -  Known brain metastasis

          -  History of gastrointestinal disorders (medical disorders or extensive surgery) that
             may interfere with the absorption of the study drug

          -  Any acute toxicities due to prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy that have not resolved
             to a NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0) Grade of &lt;=1

          -  Prior systemic treatment with an azole drug (eg, fluconazole, itraconazole,
