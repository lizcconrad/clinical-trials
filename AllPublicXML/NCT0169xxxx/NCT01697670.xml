      Objectives:

      Primary: The primary study objective is to determine a clinical response as assessed by the
      Mayo score to low dose PDT in patients with moderate to severe active distal UC.

      Secondary: The secondary study objectives are to assess the effect on inflammation and the
      safety and tolerability of low dose PDT in patients with moderate to severe active distal UC.

      This is a multicenter, open phase II study that will enroll a maximum of 20 eligible patients
      with moderate to severe active distal UC. The first 10 eligible patients, the first cohort,
      will receive PDT at a 10 Joule per square centimetre (J/cm2) dose intensity. If no clinical
      response is observed in the first 7 eligible patients, the study will be stopped due to lack
      of efficacy. If at least 1 clinical response is observed in the first 7 patients, the first
      cohort will be completed to a total of 10 eligible patients

      Subsequently, the following algorithm will apply:

        -  &gt;3 clinical responders at SD8, then another 10 patients, the second cohort, will be
           exposed to the same PDT dose intensity

        -  &lt;3 clinical responders, without adverse proctosigmoidoscopic observations at SD8, then
           the second cohort, will be exposed to the next higher PDT dose intensity 15 J/cm2

        -  &lt;3 clinical responders, with adverse proctosigmoidoscopic observations at SD8, then the
           second cohort, will be exposed to the next lower PDT dose intensity 5 J/cm2

        -  The safety will be continuously evaluated throughout the study.

      The screening phase consists of 1 week (SD-7 - SD0), the treatment phase of 4 weeks
      (SD1-SD29), and the follow-up evaluation phase of 4 weeks (SD30-SD57), equating to an overall
      duration of 9 weeks per patient. It is foreseen to have at least 3 participating
      investigational sites to complete accrual of the first cohort in 3 months, and the second
      cohort, if appropriate in an additional 3 months. In case of low recruitment, extra sites
      will be asked for participation. Hence the study duration from study initiation until last
      patient whom completed the study is 8 months to reach the primary analysis of the study. The
      follow-up analysis will be completed about 3 months later.

      Stopping rules:

      Requirement for prohibited medication or surgical procedure Requirement to increase the dose
      of permitted medication SAE thought to be attributable to PDT Grade III and IV toxicities
      (CTC v3.0) thought to be attributable to PDT Patients request to be withdrawn Lost to
      follow-up

      Investigational Medicinal Device:

      All patients will drink 50 ml orange juice containing 15 mg/kg 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA).
      After 3 hours, the lesions will be illuminated with red light at 635 nm using a cylindrical
      light diffuser (Model RD, Medlight SA) in a white diffusing inflatable balloon catheter
      (model CDB OEB, Medlight SA) at a fluence rate of 65.5 mW/cm2 over 153 seconds resulting in a
      total light dose of 10 J/cm2. The first cohort will be treated at a ligh
