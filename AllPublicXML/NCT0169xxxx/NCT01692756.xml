  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is the first of its kind and will allow health care professionals and
      researchers to answer many questions about the reasons why anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      injury leads to knee pain and disability and osteoarthritis. We also hope that this study
      will be the beginning of new, more powerful and safer drugs to help patients with ACL
      injuries heal sooner and return to sports or daily activities pain free. Study participants
      will be recruited from the University of Kentucky and Vanderbilt University.

      The purpose of this research is to gather information on how safe and effective Kenalog® is
      in alleviating knee pain following ACL rupture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injury to the knee during sports participation often involves partial of full detachment of
      the ACL. ACL tears cause pain, swelling and inflammation. While the swelling and inflammation
      usually goes away in time, individuals with ACL injuries may experience pain and notice knee
      instability (knee slipping, etc.). Often surgery can repair or replace the ACL within the
      joint, allowing individuals the ability to walk or run again pain free or participate in
      sports. Unfortunately, osteoarthritis of the knee, which also causes pain and swelling, can
      occur in that same knee 10-20 years later for reasons which are not well understood.

      In this research study, we hope to prevent and reduce the initial post-operative pain. The
      reduction of pain will allow for earlier movement of the knee joint and preparation for
      surgery. It may also reduce the risk to develop osteoarthritis in individuals with ACL
      injuries by treating them within 1-2 days after their injury.

    <description>This trial will use the standardized patient self-report Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) instrument to assess pain and function in response to the intervention for acute ACL injury.

    <description>Biomarkers to be tested include IL-1α, IL-1β, Collagen type I (NtxI) and collagen type II (CTXII) breakdown products, cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) and glycomsaminoglycan (GAG) and Xanthine Oxidase. Additionally, the change in IL-1α/β levels in the IL-1Ra treated and placebo individuals will be evaluated specifically for association with pain and function outcomes.</description>
