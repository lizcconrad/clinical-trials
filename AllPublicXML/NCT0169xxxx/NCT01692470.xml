      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of rilpivirine
      hydrochloride in combination with other anti-retroviral (ARV) medications for the treatment
      of ARV-naive (patients who have not been exposed to ARV) Filipino patients with human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the study medication), multi-center,
      observational (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe the patients and measure
      their outcomes) study. The total duration of the study will be 3 years, and approximately 60
      patients who would use rilpivirine hydrochloride in routine clinical practice with a dosing
      regimen stipulated in the product insert (ie, 25 mg once a day) will be enrolled. As this is
      an observational study, assessment of patients will be based on the accepted clinical
      practice in the Philippines. Patients will be monitored from baseline and throughout the
      48-week (2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 24th, 36th and 48th weeks) treatment period of rilpivirine
      hydrochloride.
