        All study subjects will be selected from pre-existing patient databases in Germany and the
        Netherlands. All chronic periodontitis cases and controls will be subjects who were at
        least 35 years old at time of enrollment. Classification of chronic periodontitis will be
        based on extent of alveolar bone loss with consideration of tooth loss.
