    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the effects, good and/or bad, of the drug Abraxane in combination
      with gemcitabine and gemcitabine with concurrent radiation therapy for patients with locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. All of the medications used in
      this study are FDA-approved for use in patients with pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term goal is to improve survival of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.
      Additional potential benefits include increased probability of local control and decreased
      distant metastases.

    <description>Patients will receive 2 cycles of gemcitabine and abraxane prior to the start of chemoradiation. Chemoradiation will commence 2 week after the completion of second cycle of gemcitabine/abraxane. Patients will receive an additional 2 cycles of gemcitabine and abraxane to start 2-4 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. After the last two cycles of chemotherapy, if well tolerated with continued tumor response additional cycles of chemotherapy may be given.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven carcinoma of the pancreas that is locally
             advanced

          -  ECOG performance status 0- 2

          -  Adequate labs

          -  No prior abdominal radiation therapy

          -  No other concurrent clinically evident malignancy, except inactive nonmelanoma skin

          -  All disease must be encompassed within a radiotherapy portal

          -  Not pregnant or nursing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  systemic therapy.

          -  Patient has known active infection with HIV, hepatitis C or hepatitis B

          -  Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems such
             that the Investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive an experimental
             research drug.

          -  Patient is deemed to be have obvious resectable disease at presentation

          -  Received any investigational agent within a month prior to enrollment.
