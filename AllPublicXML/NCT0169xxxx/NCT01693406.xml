  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a critical global public health concern. Breastfeeding is the ideal
      choice for infant nutrition. However, rapid and excess weight gain during infancy predicts
      later, even among breastfed infants. This risk is higher if mothers are obese and/or
      diabetic. Composition of bioactive components of breast milk may differ based between mothers
      who are normal weight (NW), overweight, or who have diabetes. Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes are
      associated with overall increases in inflammation and oxidative stress, but how breast milk
      composition is affected remains unknown. The investigators overarching goal is to determine
      how maternal obesity and Type 2 Diabetes impacts human breast milk composition and how
      differences in composition may impact infant growth and fat development. The investigators
      are undertaking a study that follows 20 Normal Weight, 20 Obese, 20 Gestational Diabetic, and
      20 Type 2 Diabetic mothers and their infants over the first 4 months of life. The
      investigators will track infant weight and fat gain and monitor maternal glucose control. The
      investigators will also collect breast milk samples over the first 4 months and measure
      concentrations of growth and appetite hormones, cytokines, markers of oxidative stress and
      nutrient composition in milk. The investigators predict that concentrations of
      growth-regulatory hormones (insulin and leptin) in addition to the inflammatory cytokines and
      markers of oxidative stress will be lowest in breast milk from NW mothers, higher in breast
      milk from obese and gestational diabetic mothers, and highest in Type 2 Diabetic mothers'
      breast milk. The investigators expect these differences will be most pronounced in the first
      2 weeks after birth. The investigators also predict that breast milk concentrations of these
      biomarkers will be associated with infant fat gain. What the investigators find will help
      understand how early infant nutrition and growth may affect that child's later risk of
      obesity.
