  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study addresses the following research question: What is the role of obesity in
      modulating inflammation and innate immune function, as well as the overall responsiveness of
      innate immune cells (such as macrophages, neutrophils, and other peripheral leukocytes) in
      patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis?

      The investigators hypothesize that obesity will lead to increased inflammation in patients
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammation is highly prevalent in ESRD and associated with adverse outcomes. For
      example, chronic exposure of the peritoneal cavity to PD solution leads to induction of
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, generating peritoneal membrane inflammation which
      results in functional decline of ultrafiltration. Obesity is characterized by a state of
      chronic low-grade systemic inflammation stemming from expanded adipose tissue mass. Animal
      studies from our group and others suggest that obesity is associated with exacerbated
      prolonged inflammatory responses in the peritoneal cavity. The shifting demographic
      characteristics of the ESRD population, with a rise in elderly patients and those with
      obesity, is as a significant challenge for management of dialysis patients. Specifically, a
      2-fold increase in the percentage of obese patients in the ESRD population has been reported.
      The caloric burden of PD glucose-containing solutions adds an additional risk for development
      or exacerbation of obesity and diabetes in patients using this dialysis modality. Few studies
      have directly evaluated the association between degree of adiposity and inflammation in PD
      patients. Data obtained from the proposed experiments will help clarify the connection
      between obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular and infectious diseases in the PD
      population. These data will also further our knowledge of the basic pathophysiology of both
      obesity and ESRD and enhance our understanding of factors involved in successful delivery of
      PD. Results may lead to enhanced nutritional recommendations for PD patients and/or the use
      of low-glucose or non-glucose alternatives, with a resultant reduction in local and/or
      systemic inflammation and CVD and other risk factors.

    <description>Peritoneal dialysate effluent (PDE) and peripheral blood will be obtained from peritoneal dialysis (PD) subjects. Levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adipokines, and acute-phase reactants will be evaluated in PDE and plasma. The ability of peripheral leukocytes to respond to microbial stimuli will be studied using whole blood cultures. We predict percentage of body fat will be significantly associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors both systemically and locally and with reduced ability of peripheral leukocytes to respond to microbial stimuli.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The composition of leukocytes from peritoneal dialysate effluent (PDE) will be analyzed to evaluate the absolute and relative amounts of leukocyte subclasses. The phenotype of peritoneal macrophages (pMac) will be evaluated by flow cytometry, by real time RT-PCR, and by measurement of mediators characteristic of each activation type following ex vivo culture. We predict that we will observe a significant shift from an anti- to a pro-inflammatory pMac phenotype as adiposity increases</description>

      Blood Collection: Venous blood after overnight fast will include: (1) heparinized tube (green
      top) for whole blood (WB) cultures; (2) EDTA tube (lavender top) for CBC and measurement of
      cytokines and adipokines, and (3) serum-separator (red top) for determination of lipid panel,
      glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c. Glucose and insulin will be used to calculate HOMA-IR
      (index of insulin resistance).

      Collection of peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE): To minimize variability, 2.5% glucose
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and 4h dwell time will be used for all patients on test
      day. Immediately after collection, PDE will be chilled before further processing.
