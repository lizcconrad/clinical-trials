      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Avelox Tablet 400 mg
      (hereinafter as &quot;Avelox&quot;) in treating secondary infection of chronic respiratory disease.It
      is a local prospective and observational study of patients who have received Avelox tablets
      for Laryngopharyngitis, Tonsillitis, Bronchitis acute, Pneumonia, Secondary infection in
      chronic respiratory diseases, Sinusitis. A total of 500 patients are to be enrolled and
