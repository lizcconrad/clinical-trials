  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a prospective cross-over study to evaluate the effects of
      vitamin D supplementation on diabetes control and the pro-inflammatory markers involved in
      microvascular complications in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes. The investigators expect to
      see a significant improvement in glycemic control and a reduction of serum pro-inflammatory
      markers in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, who
      are treated with vitamin D.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Between 13 to 21 years of age, with at least Tanner stage 4 sexual maturity for males
             or post-menarchal females, and T1DM for at least 1 year. To ensure that inclusion
             criteria for sexual maturity are met, a physical exam for research purposes will be
             performed.

          2. HbA1c between 7 to 9%

          3. Adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL in males and &lt; 1.2 mg/dL in
             females) and adequate liver function (AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of
             normal)

          4. Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (25-OH vit D level &lt; 30ng/mL) which will be
             determined on initial screening labs after consenting subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 13 or greater than 21 years of age

          2. Less than Tanner stage 4 sexual maturity for males or pre-menarche

          3. HbA1c less than 7% or greater than 9%

          4. T1DM for less than 1 year

          5. Vitamin D sufficient (25-OH vit D level &gt; 30 ng/mL)

          6. Currently taking any medication that can interfere with vitamin D synthesis or
             metabolism, including but not limited to Orlistat, Phenobarbital, Dilantin,
             Anti-tuberculosis drugs

          7. Currently taking any medication other than insulin that alters blood glucose levels,
             including but not limited to systemic glucocorticoids

          8. Inadequate renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dL in males and &gt; 1.2mg/dL in
             females) or inadequate liver function (AST and ALT &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of
             normal)

          9. Evidence of malabsorption or short gut.
