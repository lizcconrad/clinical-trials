      To examine the feasibility of improving stroke patients' physical functional recovery and
      social participation through improving caregiver's care capability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the hospital, most rehabilitation units are like sheltered workshops and the therapists
      work with stroke patients in well-designed, but non-home-like, environment to improve the
      stroke patient's functional ability. After returning home, stroke patients face new
      challenges and also need to assume more responsibility for daily activities. Without
      continuing rehabilitation training or proper support, the patients can easily fall into a
      sedentary lifestyle and lead to declines in functional ability.However, providing home-based
      exercise by therapists directly would increase the health care cost and may not be practical
      for chronic stroke patients. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine
      whether a caregiver-mediated, home-based intervention program is effective for improving
      stroke patients' functional ability and social participation.
