  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A difficult tracheal intubation can be a problem, even if one has taken all precautions. A
      possible solution can be using a videolaryngoscope in conjunct with the Bonfils® intubation
      scope. As such, the videolaryngoscope can be used to achieve the best possible view and space
      of the laryngeal inlet for the insertion and manoeuvring of the Bonfils® intubation scope.

      In this blinded, unrandomised trial the investigators would like to investigate the change in
      Cormack and Lehane grade when using both videolaryngoscope (Macintosh videolaryngoscope, Karl
      Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) and Bonfils® (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). They also want to
      record the success of intubation and the time needed until successful endotracheal intubation
      when using this technique as well as complications (trauma to the oral cavity, dental trauma,
      and regurgitation seen by the anaesthesiologist) that may occur. Also saturation (SpO2) at
      the end of the procedure will be noted and adjuncts that are used.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cormack and Lehane grade achieved when using the combination technique compared with the Cormack and Lehane grade achieved earlier when using the Macintosh (video)laryngoscope alone.</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed during induction of anesthesia, an average of 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The operator will score these grades during the process of intubation. Pictures will be taken of the first and the second Cormack and Lehane grade, and these pictures will later be scored by two anaesthesiologists, blinded for the technique used (videolaryngoscopy alone or videolaryngoscopy combined with the Bonfils®).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time until successful endotracheal intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed during induction of anesthesia, an average of maximal 3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Time until successful endotracheal intubation will be defined as the time from the moment the blade of the Macintosh videolaryngoscope is placed between the teeth until the time the anaesthesiologist confirms the endotracheal tube to be in the trachea.</description>

    <measure>Complications rendered on during the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed during induction of anesthesia, an average of 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Complications that will be recorded are: trauma to the oral cavity (defined as any amount of bright red blood in the oral cavity), dental trauma, and regurgitation seen by the anaesthesiologist. Also oxygen saturation (SpO2) at the end of the procedure will be noted, a saturation of less than 90% will be defined as hypoxia.</description>

    <measure>Adjuncts being used</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed during induction of anesthesia, an average of 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Adjuncts that can be used are: gum elastic bougie, stylet and the BURP manoeuvre (performed by a second operator).</description>

    <description>First, the Macintosh videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) will be used to achieve the best possible view and space of the laryngeal inlet for the insertion and manoeuvring of the Bonfils® (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). Once the anaesthesiologist considers the view achieved to be the best view possible, a picture will be taken using C-CAMTM for C-MAC (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), not showing any part of the videolaryngoscope. Thereafter the Bonfils® intubation scope, which will be preloaded with the endotracheal tube, will be brought into position in front of the laryngeal inlet. Again a picture not showing any part of one of the two devices will be taken. Once the Bonfils® has entered the trachea, the tracheal tube will be placed in the correct position.</description>
