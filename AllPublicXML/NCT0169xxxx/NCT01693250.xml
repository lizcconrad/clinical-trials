  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children is coupled with the
      increased prevalence of childhood obesity in the last two decades. Obesity during the
      adolescent years is associated with many adverse health consequences, including T2DM,
      hyperlipidemia, and psychosocial problems. The first step toward effective obesity management
      and T2DM prevention is monitoring of physical activity (PA) and dietary intake. With the
      rapid expansion of cellular networks, and advancements in smartphone technologies, it is now
      possible to monitor PA and dietary intake and at the same time to transmit data digitally to
      their primary care providers (PCP). The proposed pilot study will include the collaboration
      among UCSF, North East Medical Services (NEMS), mHealth teams, and overweight and/or obese
      adolescents. The study will adapt and implement smartphone-based technologies and integrate
      these technologies with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) to increase PA and dietary intake.
      Two specific aims of this proposed study include: (1) adapt fitbit Ultra applications for the
      smartphone-based technologies and EHR and (2) and assess the feasibility and estimate the
      effect for patient outcomes (self-efficacy, physical activity, dietary intake, BMI, and lipid
      profile), at 3 months post intervention between the intervention and control groups. The
      smartphone app for the intervention group will allow the teens to graphically compare daily
      PA and dietary intake with the goal, participate in a reward program where they can collect
      virtual points for achieving the goal, and play interactive games related to PA and diet. A
      total of 40 overweight and/or obese adolescents at NEMS will be recruited and randomized to
      the feasibility study (Aim 2). Findings from this study will be used to plan for a NIH R01.
