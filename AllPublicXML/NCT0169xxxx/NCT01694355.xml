    <textblock>
      It is well known that postmenopausal women are at risk for osteoporosis. The study hypothesis
      is that vitamin D deficiency (≤17.5nmol/L) is frequently associated with osteomalacia and
      will cause low BMD estimation in DXA scan due to insufficient bone mineralization.

      We assume that among these postmenopausal women, Vitamin D treatment will improve bone
      mineralization and will cause a rapid increase in BMD. According to the results,
      bisphosphonates therapy may be an unnecessary treatment.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of severe vitamin D deficiency and its
      correction on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in postmenopausal women.
