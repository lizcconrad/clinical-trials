  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the hypothesis that mechanical embolectomy with the Solitaire FR device is
      superior to medical management alone in achieving favorable outcome in the distribution of
      the modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days in subjects presenting with acute large vessel
      ischemic stroke &lt; 8 hours from symptom onset.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, open, blinded-endpoint trial with a
      sequential design. The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of mechanical embolectomy with the
      CE MARK approved stentriever Solitaire FR® versus medical management alone. Randomization
      will be done under a minimization process using age, baseline NIHSS, therapeutic window and
      vessel occlusion site. For the primary endpoint, subjects will be followed for 90 days
      post-randomization.

      Interim analysis will be performed as preplanned and interpreted by the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) after the first 174, 346 and 518 patients representing 25%, 50% and
      75% of the planned sample size have completed their 90-day follow-up. The DSMB will advise
      the executive committee (EC) on recommendations to stop the trial early either for reasons of
      safety, efficacy, futility or to adjust the sample size. The latter may be necessary as given
      the paucity of data regarding natural history of the non-treated patients assumptions
      regarding rates of favorable outcomes in this group of patients may be incorrect. Of note,
      sample size adjustment based on different than expected outcomes rates is permitted, but it
      is not permitted to adjust the sample size based on change in the pre-specified treatment
      effect which is set at 10%.

      Subject population: Subjects presenting with acute ischemic stroke within 8 hours from
      symptom onset and whose strokes are attributable to an occlusion of the internal carotid or
      proximal MCA (M1) arteries. Subjects are either ineligible for IV alteplase or have received
      IV alteplase therapy without recanalization.

             the treatment is contraindicated (e.g., subject presents beyond recommended time from
             symptom onset), or where patient has received IV thrombolytic therapy without
             recanalization after a minimum of 30 min from start of iv tPA infusion

          -  2. No significant pre-stroke functional disability (mRS ≤ 1)

          -  3. Baseline NIHSS score obtained prior to randomization must be equal or higher than 6

          -  7. Informed consent obtained from patient or acceptable patient surrogate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical criteria

             nursing home type setting or who live at home but are not fully independent in
             activities of daily living (toileting, dressing, eating, cooking and preparing meals,
             etc.)

          -  15. Unlikely to be available for 90-day follow-up (e.g. no fixed home address, visitor
             from overseas).

        Neuroimaging criteria:

          -  16. Hypodensity on CT or restricted diffusion amounting to an ASPECTS score of &lt;7 on

          -  18. Significant mass effect with midline shift.

          -  19. Evidence of ipsilateral carotid occlusion, high grade stenosis or arterial
             dissection in the extracranial or petrous segment of the internal carotid artery that
             cannot be treated or will prevent access to the intracranial clot or excessive
             tortuosity of cervical vessels precluding device delivery/deployment
