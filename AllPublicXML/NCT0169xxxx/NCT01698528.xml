  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using a diabetes management technology system,
      including a tablet computer, to track diabetes care and communicate with a clinician coach (a
      doctor or nurse from the Joslin Clinic) makes starting and adjusting insulin easier and safer
      for people with type 2 diabetes. Hypothesis: The use of a diabetes management technology
      system with a clinician coach helps more individuals starting basal insulin achieve better
      glycemic control with less hypoglycemia compared with standard clinical practice at Joslin
      Diabetes Center.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The volunteer's satisfaction with their diabetes care will be measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) was used for assessing the satisfactory level. DTSQ consisted of 8 questions, each question with a score scale of 0-6 (very dissatisfied to very satisfied), leading to a final score range of 0-48. The change in the DTSQ comparing before (time 0) and end of the study (t=3months) was measured. The average change in the intervention group and control group were listed in the outcome measure data table.</description>

        <title>Change in Average Participation Satisfaction</title>
        <description>The volunteer's satisfaction with their diabetes care will be measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) was used for assessing the satisfactory level. DTSQ consisted of 8 questions, each question with a score scale of 0-6 (very dissatisfied to very satisfied), leading to a final score range of 0-48. The change in the DTSQ comparing before (time 0) and end of the study (t=3months) was measured. The average change in the intervention group and control group were listed in the outcome measure data table.</description>

This arm will communicate with his or her provider through the tablet computer to initiate and titrate basal insulin dose based on the 303 protocol. The individuals in this arm will also track their glucose values and medication adherence using the tablet computer by documenting when medication was taken or insulin was injected.
