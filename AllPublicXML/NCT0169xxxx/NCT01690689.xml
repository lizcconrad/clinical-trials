      The purpose is to assess the safety profile and performance of a femoral resurfacing implant
      for localized chondral lesions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The implant's safety profile will be assessed by incidence of any subject having any of the
      seven identified implant-related clinical undesirable side effects. This will be analyzed
      with a one-side exact binomial test on significance level 0.05, at 24 months
      post-operatively.

    <description>The primary efficacy analysis in this study is to ascertain that the incidence of at least one subject having any of the seven identified clinical undesirable side effects is lower than 38 % (risk profile of the comparator) up to the 24 months analysis in the PP population. This will be analyzed with a one-side exact binomial test on significance level 0.05</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female

          2. Age 30 ≤ 65 years

          3. Chondral defects of the femoral cartilage ICRS grade 3 (severely abnormal cartilage
             defects &gt; 50% of the cartilage depth) or grade 4 (severely abnormal, through the
             cartilage depth) on medial or lateral femoral condyles

          4. Cartilage lesion area &lt; 3.2 cm2 (diameter &lt; 2 cm)

          5. Failed earlier conservative or surgical interventions such as lavage, abrasions,
             drilling or microfracture

          6. VAS-pain symptom &gt;40 for more than 6 months

          7. The arthroscopic finding corresponds to the expected; size of cartilage lesion is
             correct and no other significant pathology (see CIP, &quot;Intra-operative check-list&quot;,
             Appendix I)

          8. Capable of completing self-administered questionnaires

          9. Willing to comply with the follow-up requirements of the study

         10. Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (severe obesity)

          2. Instability or deficiency of soft tissues, vascular or muscular insufficiency

          3. Metabolic disorders which may impair bone formation

          4. Diabetes mellitus

          5. Smokers

          6. Diagnosis of a concomitant knee injury which the Investigator appreciates may
             interfere with study participation (i.e. may confound efficacy assessment or healing
             at the involved knee joint level)

          7. Irresolvable joint pain or loss-of-function with an undeterminable cause

          8. Diagnosis of a concomitant meniscal injury in involved knee that requires surgical
             intervention

          9. Loss of joint space on standing radiographs (≥ 1 on Ahlbäck-scale (0-5))

         10. Avascular necrosis

         11. Infections, systemic or local

         12. Known metal allergies

         13. History of inflammatory arthritis

         14. Pregnancy

         15. Pacemaker implant

         16. History of drug or substance abuse

         17. Systemic administration within 30 days prior to the study of any type of
             corticosteroid, antineoplastics, immune stimulating or immunosuppressive agents

         18. Participation in another clinical trial using an investigational new drug or device
             within 30 days of entrance into this study.

         19. Condition that may have an impact on the outcome of the investigation as judged by the
             Investigator.
