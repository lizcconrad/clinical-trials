  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark the number of patients, sick listed for more than four weeks is increasing, and
      patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders make one third of the total amount of
      long-term absenteeism. Compared to other diagnoses, patients suffering from musculoskeletal
      diseases, including low back pain, are less likely to return to work after a period of sick
      leave. It seems that a multidisciplinary intervention, including cooperation between the
      health sector, the social sector and in the work place, has a positive effect on days off
      work due to musculoskeletal disorders and particularly low back pain. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the effect of a work oriented multidisciplinary intervention.

      A randomized controlled trial will include 770 patients with low back pain. The study
      population consists of patients, who are sick listed or at risk of sick leave due to LBP.

      The control group is treated with usual care in a team with participation of a
      physiotherapist, a chiropractor, a rheumatologist and a local employed social worker The
      Intervention group is treated with usual care and in addition intervention of a psychologist,
      an occupational physician, an ergonomist and a social worker from the local sickness benefit
      office. The treating physiotherapist will be the RTW-coordinator. Outcome will be reported at
      the end of treatment as well as 6 and 12 months follow up. The primary outcome is number of
      days of work. Secondary outcomes are disability, pain, and quality of life.

      This large RCT study is testing the effectiveness of a preventive intervention targeting
      patients on short term sick leave or at risk being sick listed because of low back pain. We
      have developed a novel multidisciplinary team structure using the treating physiotherapist as
      the return to work coordinator, and having the case manager from the sickness benefit office
      participating in team meetings.
