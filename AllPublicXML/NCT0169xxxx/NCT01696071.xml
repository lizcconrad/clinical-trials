      Determine the 24-hour FEV1-profile of tiotropium solution for inhalation after 4 weeks
      treatment periods of 5 mcg tiotropium administered once daily in the evening and 2.5 mcg
      tiotropium administered twice daily (morning and evening). In addition compare the 24 hours
      pharmacokinetic profile of 5 mcg tiotropium administered once daily and 2.5mcg tiotropium
      administered twice daily in pharmacokinetic sub-investigation.
