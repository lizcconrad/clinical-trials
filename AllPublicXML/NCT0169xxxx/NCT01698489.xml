    <textblock>
      Closer examination of granular lipid data in a large population offers numerous opportunities
      to generate new knowledge, ranging from studies examining concordance between commonly used
      lipid parameters to phenotypic characterization of rare or extreme disorders of lipid
      metabolism, opening possibilities to better personalize future treatment of abnormal blood
      lipids.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      The Very Large Database of Lipids (VLDL) includes adults and children who were clinically
      referred for a Vertical Auto Profile (VAP).

      LIPID MEASUREMENTS:

      The VAP test (VAP Diagnostics Lab, Birmingham, Alabama, USA) directly measures cholesterol
      concentrations of low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, intermediate density
      lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, their subfractions, and lipoprotein(a). Triglycerides
      in the database are directly measured using the Abbott ARCHITECT C‚Äê8000 system (Abbott Park,
      Illinois, USA). Lipid distributions in the database closely match those from the
      population-representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

      STUDY PROCEDURES:

      This database was investigator-initiated. Only de-identified data reach the investigational
      site. The first data harvest was in 2011 and the second in 2016. The master database is
      housed at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, and maintained by Drs. Jones and
      Martin. Only electronic data, and not blood samples, are sent to Hopkins. The academic
      investigators have unrestricted access to study data, take responsibility for the accuracy of
      analyses, and have authority over manuscript preparation and submission.

      VARIABLES:

      The variables currently in the VLDL database are testing date, age, sex, fasting/nonfasting,
      and components of the VAP test. From these primary variables, many additional variables were
      derived for inclusion in the master database. Other analytes measured by validated assays in
      subsets of the VLDL database include apolipoprotein B (apoB), apolipoprotein A1 (apoAI),
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homocysteine, uric acid, insulin, hemoglobin
      A1c, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, cystatin C, lipoprotein-associated phosphatase (Lp-PLA2), thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3 and T4, pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pBNP), direct
      bilirubin, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatinine and other components of the comprehensive
      metabolic panel, magnesium, and phosphate.

      DATABASE ORGANIZATION:

      In the current database, each record represents a unique patient. The 1st available VAP test
      for each patient is included. To meet the needs of a variety of research questions, we are
      prospectively planning to organize harvest 2 data into 3-year interval datasets (i.e., VLDL
      2006-2008, 2009-2011, VLDL 2012-2014, etc), a summation dataset (first VAP test for each
      patient), serial lab dataset (patients who have had repeated testing), and ancillary datasets
      (subsets of patients with coexisting data on other measures such as apolipoproteins, vitamin
      D, etc).

      INDIVIDUAL STUDIES:

      Individual VLDL studies are based on a priori hypotheses or aims with statistical analysis
      plans (SAPs) peer-reviewed prior to execution. In the expandable &quot;Detailed Description&quot;
      section below, the VLDL investigators will periodically register individual studies and
      update their status here.
