  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of NOX-H94 in
      patients with anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Furthermore, this study is intended to provide
      data needed to correlate plasma concentrations of NOX-H94 with its efficacy and to choose the
      appropriate dose and dose schedule of subsequent efficacy studies.

      Some chronic diseases, e.g. tumors, inflammation, renal disease, are associated with high
      hepcidin concentrations in the blood. These hepcidin concentrations cause a reduction in iron
      concentrations in the blood and subsequently impair formation of red blood cells. Treatment
      with NOX-H94 is expected to inhibit this patho-mechanism by binding and inactivating
      hepcidin.
