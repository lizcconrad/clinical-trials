  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to compare the treatment effect on dentinal
      hypersensitivity of a tubule occluding dentifrice as measured by Schiff and Tactile
      sensitivity. This proof of concept study will compare the test dentifrice with three other
      treatment groups.

      This will be a single center, eight week, randomized, controlled, examiner blind, four
      treatment arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff Sensitivity Score of
      the two selected test teeth), exploratory study in participants with at least two sensitive
      teeth that meet all the criteria at the Screening and Baseline visit. Participants will be
      assessed at Baseline, four and eight weeks to monitor clinical efficacy and safety.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Evaporative Air Sensitivity Pain Response on Schiff Sensitivity Scale at Week 4</measure>

    <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to hypersensitive teeth was evaluated using a Schiff Sensitivity pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for each individual stimulated tooth ranged from 0 to 3; 0 - participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 - participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 - participant responds to air stimulus and request discontinuation of stimulus, 3 - participant responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and request discontinuation of stimulus.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants between 18 and 55 years of age, in good general health, with pre-existing
             self-reported and clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity are required for entry into

             erosion, abrasion and/or gingival recession which respond to qualifying evaporative
             (air) assessment at the Screening visit and have at least two teeth (incisors, canines
             or pre-molars) demonstrating signs of sensitivity, measured by qualifying tactile
             threshold (Yeaple ≤ 20 gram (g)) and evaporative (air) (Schiff Sensitivity Score ≥ 2)

             dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth used as abutments for
             fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full crowns, orthodontic bands,
             extensive caries or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with contributing etiologies other
             than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentine. c) Dental professional hygiene
             (includes dental prophylaxis, irrigation, and intensive anti-microbial/anti-biotic
             therapy) within 14 days of the screening visit. d) Presence of dental implants. e) Lip
             or tongue piercings. f) Periodontal surgical history within the past 6 months or have
             been scaled /root planed within the past 3 months.

             materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients.

          7. Clinical Study/Experimental Medication: a) Participation in another clinical study or
             receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit b) Previous
             participation in this study.

          8. Other: Any subject who in the opinion of the investigator, should not participate in

        <title>Change From Baseline in Evaporative Air Sensitivity Pain Response on Schiff Sensitivity Scale at Week 4</title>
        <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to hypersensitive teeth was evaluated using a Schiff Sensitivity pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for each individual stimulated tooth ranged from 0 to 3; 0 – participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 – participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 - participant responds to air stimulus and request discontinuation of stimulus, 3 - participant responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and request discontinuation of stimulus.</description>

        <population>Intent to Treat (ITT) population: All randomized participants administered with at least one study treatment during the study and provided at least one post baseline assessment of efficacy.</population>

        <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to hypersensitive teeth was evaluated using a Schiff Sensitivity pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for each individual stimulated tooth ranged from 0 to 3; 0 – participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 – participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 - participant responds to air stimulus and request discontinuation of stimulus, 3 - participant responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and request discontinuation of stimulus.</description>
