  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight gained during pregnancy is referred to as gestational weight gain (GWG). Excess GWG is
      a widespread problem that occurs in 55-75% of Canadian women who enter pregnancy overweight
      or obese (a group that represents over 50 % of all pregnant women) and about 40% women of
      normal weight. Excess GWG is associated with complications of pregnancy, such as post-partum
      weight retention, type 2 diabetes, elevated fats in the blood, and high blood pressure and
      may also lead to problems with the health of the newborn child. Our research aims to find
      ways to control GWG by developing new and practical approaches to diet and exercise targeted
      to overweight pregnant women that hold promise of improving their health both during
      pregnancy and thereafter. The experimental intervention is a diet of higher protein provided
      by dairy foods combined with an exercise program modified to the abilities of overweight
      pregnant women; and the control is the usual advice given by their primary care providers,
      information on healthy pregnancy from Health Canada, and a focus group session exploring
      women's experiences with exercise, nutrition, and gestational weight gain. The results of
      this study will allow us to design future large clinical studies in all pregnant women to
      help control the weight gain in all pregnant women.

      This will be a 2-arm randomized 1-site trial. Recruitment will be within the community care
      clinics by poster and flyer advertisements.

      Primary research question: Among pregnant women, does introducing a structured and monitored
      nutrition and exercise program (treatment) in early pregnancy compared with Usual Prenatal
      Care (control) increase the likelihood of attaining gestational weight gain within the
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines over the pregnancy period?

      Experimental and Control groups: Both groups of mothers and their health care providers will
      be given the Health Canada materials on &quot;Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy&quot;, &quot;Eating Well
      with Canada's Food Guide&quot; and the &quot;Pregnancy Weight Gain Calculator&quot;. Baseline information
      will be recorded for eligible and consenting women after which they will be randomized to
      Experimental or Control group. Nutrition intake, physical measures and physical activity will
      be recorded at baseline, 26-28 weeks and 36-38 weeks of gestation and 6 months post partum in
      the same manner for both groups. All mothers will receive the study promotional materials and
      small incentives. Also, all mothers will be followed by their primary care provider and have
      usual access to Public Health.

    <description>Nutrition intervention: The proposed nutrition plan is a high protein (25% energy) diet providing low fat dairy foods and individualized to energy needs. Dairy foods are accepted by women during pregnancy as a healthy choice (from pilot study) and in our recent birth cohort study, women consumed an average of 3 or more servings of dairy per day. Exercise intervention: Most previous studies and published guidance focus on aerobic exercise such as walking as it is the easiest physical activity to implement in pregnancy in terms of setting goals of steps and monitoring of adherence using accelerometer-type devices. Walking is also the most practical since women reduced moderate and vigorous physical activity during pregnancy but levels of walking were maintained.</description>

    <description>Both Intervention and Control participants and their care providers receive the new Health Canada guide on Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy. For the Experimental Group, the exercise intervention includes a custom-designed pregnancy-specific group walking class of 30-60 min. 1x/week and a prescribed at-home walking program to reach 10,000 steps/day. The nutrition intervention is a high protein (25% energy) low-fat dairy food plan designed to meet energy needs and with individualized counselling.</description>
