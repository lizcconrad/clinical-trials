  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label, prospective, non-randomized single arm study. Combination of two treatment
      modalities - HAI with FUDR and systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      Definition of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous gemcitabine in combination with
      intravenous cisplatin and intra-arterial FUDR. Definition of safety and toxicity of this
      combined regional and systemic treatment approach. Definition of the response rate after 3
      months of hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy with continuous infusion FUDR with or without
      ligation of the right or left portal vein, in combination with 3 months of systemic cisplatin
      and gemcitabine in patients with unresectable intrahepatic or hilar CCC.

      A total of 9-18 patients are required. 3-6 patients per dose level. A maximum of three dose
      levels (1 - 3) has been defined.

      Statistical Methodology: Traditional 3+3 dosing algorithm to find MTD.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine in combination with fixed doses of cisplatin and FUDR. DLTs are per protocol prespecified AE or laboratory abnormalities observed during the first 6 weeks of study treatment. The MTD is one dose level below the dose level that caused DLTs in â‰¥ one third of patients (2 or more in a cohort of 6 patients), as determined by a traditional 3+3 algorithm.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven cholangiocellular carcinoma including
             gallbladder cancer.

          -  Non-resectable cholangiocellular carcinoma as judged within an interdisciplinary
             tumor-board including senior hepatobiliary surgeons. Non- resectability is based on

          -  WHO Performance Score 0 or 1

          -  No extrahepatic tumor, as evaluated by PET/CT scan of the chest and the abdomen/pelvis
             with the exception of potentially resectable small lung nodules or hilar lymph node
             involvement.

          -  The assessment is done within 21 days before registration.
