  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand what causes dysautonomia and how
      this affects blood pressure and pulse. Dysautonomia is a condition of the autonomic nervous
      system. It is associated with fluctuations in blood pressure and pulse and may cause symptoms
      of nausea and belly pain, fatigue, excessive thirst, lightheadedness, dizziness, feelings of
      anxiety or panic, and fainting. A common example of dysautonomia is postural orthostatic
      tachycardia syndrome or POTS. Sometimes symptoms worsen when people move from lying down to
      standing, called orthostatic intolerance. We would like to learn more about the link between
      orthostatic intolerance and nausea. While medications currently used to treat orthostatic
      intolerance and nausea have proven to be effective in some patients, this may not be the best
      treatment for everyone as long term use could pose certain risks including high blood
      pressure. In order to provide a more focused and safer treatment for patients suffering from
      nausea and orthostatic intolerance, we have looked at how the blood pressure, pulse, and
      certain blood tests change during a tilt table test. This test helps to create the same
      circumstances that patients with orthostatic intolerance experience when they stand. To
      better understand if some of these problems are associated with the brain, we will study MRI
      in patients with dysautonomia compared to children without dysautonomia. This information may
      allow us to use alternative and safer treatments in the future.

    <description>The first objective of the proposed project is to study central transmitter/metabolite profiles using in vivo 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in children with dysautonomia diagnosed by tilt table testing compared to healthy children without symptoms of dysautonomia. The second objective will be to determine whether dysautonomia associated with nausea and cardiovascular instability shares common alterations in brain networks. We will be using cognitive and sensory processing tasks based on our prior experience with both traditional fMRI and network analyses.</description>
