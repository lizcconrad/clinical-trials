      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a Bayer Blood Glucose Monitoring
      System (BGMS) and two additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMS) from other
      companies. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained with a reference
      laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer).

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a Bayer Blood Glucose Monitoring
      System (BGMS) and two additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMS) from other
      companies. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained with a reference
      laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer). Performance of the three systems was
      evaluated across the glucose range of the BGMSs using capillary blood. All testing and
      lancing was performed by study staff and some samples were tested from subject fingertips.
      Additionally, some blood samples were glycolyzed to lower the glucose concentration levels
      and glucose solution was added to other samples to raise glucose concentration levels.

    <measure>MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference Between BGMS Results and Reference Method Results) Across the Overall Tested Glucose Range</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Using the overall Blood Glucose (BG) range (34 to 561 mg/dL according to YSI subject plasma results), the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI plasma results (BG reference) were compared. MARD is calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)|/(BG reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all 3 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MARD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value. Higher MARD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>

        <description>Using the overall Blood Glucose (BG) range (34 to 561 mg/dL according to YSI subject plasma results), the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI plasma results (BG reference) were compared.

Each evaluable sample was tested on all 3 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MARD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value. Higher MARD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>

          <title>MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference Between BGMS Results and Reference Method Results) in the Low Glucose Range (&lt;=80 mg/dL)</title>
          <description>Using fresh and glycolyzed samples with YSI plasma Blood Glucose (BG) ≤80 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI subject plasma results (BG reference) were compared. MARD is calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)|/(BG reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all 3 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MARD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value. Higher MARD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>
