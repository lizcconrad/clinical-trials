      A. Purpose To compare MiraLAX versus placebo for preventing constipation in the immediate
      postoperative period following pelvic reconstructive surgery in women taking routine docusate
      sodium.

      B. Objectives

        1. Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To compare time to first bowel movement (BM) between
           MiraLAX versus placebo in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic
           reconstructive surgery.

           Specific Aim 2: To compare patient reported outcomes of BM quality and associated
           gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms between MiraLAX versus placebo using the Bristol stool
           scale and the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire
           (PAC-SYM) in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic reconstructive
           surgery.

           Specific Aim 3: To evaluate GI-related quality of life between MiraLAX versus placebo
           utilizing the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality-of-Life Questionnaire
           (PAC-QOL) in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic reconstructive
           surgery.

        2. Hypotheses The investigators hypothesize that MiraLAX will optimally prevent
           constipation following pelvic reconstructive surgery by decreasing time to first BM,
           decreasing GI symptoms associated with constipation, and increasing measures of
           GI-related quality of life, while minimizing the bothersome side effects associated with
           stimulant laxatives.

      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of MiraLAX versus placebo
      in women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery receiving routine docusate sodium. Subjects
      will be screened for eligibility during their preoperative visits and once enrolled, they
      will be randomized to receive MiraLAX or placebo starting on postoperative day (POD) 1 and
      continuing through POD 5. Subjects will be instructed to stop taking this medication if they
      experience any diarrhea. Subjects in both arms will be instructed to take milk of magnesia as
      a rescue laxative if they do not experience a BM by the morning of POD 6. All subjects will
      be provided a 30 day supply of docusate sodium and be instructed to begin this medication on
      POD 1.

    <description>The investigators will evaluate BM quality based upon Bristol stool scale. Straining, abdominal or rectal pain, incomplete evacuation and the impact of these symptoms on GI-related quality of life will be assessed by the PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL validated questionnaires. The PAC-SYM is a validated 12-item questionnaire based upon the Rome criteria for constipation and is tailored to assess a change in symptoms following an intervention.2 This questionnaire has been previously used with success in studies with urogynecologic patients. The PAC-QOL is a validated 28-item questionnaire assessing quality-of-life issues, including burden of constipation on daily functioning and well-being. The Bristol stool scale, which is a visual BM rating scale from 1 to 7, provides a validated measure of gut transit time based upon the shape, consistency and appearance of BM.</description>

    <description>Symptoms of over-effectiveness, including abdominal pain or cramping, bloating, loose stools, watery diarrhea and their impact on GI-related quality of life will be evaluated based upon bowel diaries, Bristol stool scales and the PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL questionnaires.</description>
