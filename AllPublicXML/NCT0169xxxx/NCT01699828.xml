  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to use positron emission tomography brain imaging to
      investigate D3 occupancy of buspirone, an FDA-approved anxiolytic which acts as a serotonin
      partial agonist but has recently been identified as a D3 antagonist. It is hypothesized that
      clinically relevant doses of buspirone will occupy the D3 receptor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buspirone is used for anxiety disorder treatment, a therapeutic effect that has been thought
      to be mediated through its partial agonist properties at the serotonin receptor. However,
      since one PET study in humans has shown low occupancy of the serotonin by buspirone in
      clinical doses and since the DRD3 has been recently implicated in anxiety, some therapeutic
      effects of buspirone may be mediated through the DRD3. In human clinical studies, promising
      effects of buspirone have been reported for treatment of substance dependence, including
      tobacco, marijuana, and opiates, and clinical studies in cocaine dependent subjects are
      underway. However, it is unclear if buspirone is producing those effects through the DRD3 and
      no human study has incorporated a PET imaging component to investigate this question; it
      remains unclear whether buspirone significantly occupies the DRD3 at therapeutic doses in
      humans.
