  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are being asked to participate in this study because they have genotype 1 Hepatitis
      C Virus (HCV) and will be taking the standard of care drugs pegylated interferon, ribavirin,
      and telaprevir as part of their routine care. The purpose of this study is to see if the
      SIMpill automated pill dispensing device can help subjects take their medications at the
      times the doctor has instructed them to take it.

      The SIMpill device is an automated pill dispensing device that records a time stamp each time
      the device is opened and a dose of medication is taken. Physicians can download this data and
      generate a precise account of when you have taken your medication. In addition, if a dose is
      missed, the SIMpill device can be set to automatically notify you by text message if a dose
      is overdue. The Simpill device is a new way to keep track of when you take your HCV
      medications and will also help remind you when you forget to take a dose. In addition, this
      information will help your doctors understand how taking medication on time effects the
      success of the therapy.

      -  Patients with genotype 1 HCV who are candidates for therapy with telaprevir, pegylated
           interferon and ribavirin will be eligible for the study.

        -  All patients enrolled in this study will receive a standard of care regimen of
           telaprevir /pegylated interferon and ribavirin. This includes medication dosages,
           follow-up, and monitoring. The only exception will be the mode of medication dispensing.

        -  Patients will be asked to bring their Simpill devices to their regularly scheduled
           clinic visits at which time medication adherence information will be downloaded by study
           personnel. Each visit will be a regularly scheduled standard of care visit and no
           additional clinic visits will be needed for the patient in the Simpill study arm.

        -  In the event that any patient demonstrated viral breakthrough during therapy, those
           patients will be offered an additional blood draw to screen for viral resistance. This
           will be important to understand if patients using the Simpill device have better
           adherence to the medication regiment which results in lower incidence of viral
           resistance.

        -  Patients in the study arm will receive a text messages each time a dose of medication is
           missed. This message will only go to the telephone number specified by the patient and
           will not go to members of the study team. Patients who do not have text messaging
           capability will not be eligible for this study.

        -  The initial study will be a pilot study designed to obtain preliminary data regarding
           the feasibility of this device. This study is powered to detect differences in viral
           kinetics over the first 4 weeks.

        -  In the event that Vertex receives FDA approval for BID dosage of telaprevir prior to
           funding and initiation of the study, the most currently approved dosing (BID) will be
           used instead of q8 hours.

    <description>Subjects in this arm will receive their medication (telaprevir, interferon and ribavirin) dispensed using the Simpill device. The study staff will have access to data from the device during therapy and will be able to give subjects feedback on adherence during the course of therapy. The study team will refill the device as the medication is needed. The device will be configured to remind a subject each time a dose is missed. Subjects in this study arm will receive a text message each time a dose of medication is missed. This message will only go to the telephone number specified by the subject and will not go to members of the study team.</description>

    <description>The SIMpill device is an automated pill dispensing device that records a time stamp each time the device is opened and a dose of medication is taken. This works through a computer chip that is housed inside of the pill dispensing device that is activated each time the pill box is opened. Physicians can download this data and generate a precise account of the patient's adherence to the medication dosing schedule. In addition, if a dose is missed, the SIMpill device can be set to automatically notify the patient by text message if a dose is overdue.</description>

      A blood draw (about 1 tablespoon) if the medication is not working for a subject. This blood
      draw is another way for the study team to measure adherence to the therapy. This blood draw
      will be taken only once at the time HCV in the blood return to high levels. This blood draw
      will measure HCV resistance.
