  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot translational study aiming to compare the effects of a multi-component care
      program with personalized drug regimen augmented by behavioural therapy with psychological
      support and peer influence, led by a diabetes specialist team on metabolic control,
      psychological health and behaviours in difficult-to-treat type 2 diabetic patients versus
      usual care.

      The study hypothesis is to evaluate a novel individualized, multicomponent care program to
      optimize glycemic control in difficult-to-treat type 2 diabetic patients.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients are at high risk for co-morbidities which are closely related to disease
      duration and coexisting cardiovascular risk factors and complications. Data has shown that
      the following 3 groups of diabetic patients are at extremely high risk for future events:

        1. Obese type 2 diabetic patients: Weight control is a major therapeutic challenge which
           often requires cognitive-psychological-behavioral therapy (CBT) in addition to
           pharmacological and surgical interventions. After long disease duration, often
           characterized by the presence of complications, many obese diabetic patients need
           insulin to control glycemia which put them at risk of further weight gain which sets up
           a vicious cycle.

        2. Young type 2 diabetic patients: In both Pima Indian and Caucasian type 2 diabetic
           patients, young age of onset substantially increased risk of cardiovascular and renal
           complications, mainly due to long disease duration. Furthermore, these patients often
           default follow up or are non-compliant due to competing priorities and lack of symptoms.
           These young patients also have marked phenotypic heterogeneity characterised by insulin
           insufficiency and/or obesity with strong family history.

        3. Diabetic patients with established cardiovascular-renal complications. In a series of
           analyses, Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with established cardiovascular and kidney
           disease had 38% event rates including all-cause death and cardiovascular-renal
           complications including peripheral vascular disease (PVD) over 5 years.

      These 3 groups of patients are difficult to treat with many unmet needs requiring complex
      treatment regimens, intensive counselling and emotional support.

      In a series of studies, the investigators have confirmed the marked benefits of using a team
      approach to deliver structured care with particular emphasis on continuation of care and
      periodic reminders on clinical outcomes. Preliminary analysis from our peer support program
      also demonstrated the benefits of utilizing organized and visual information to communicate
      personalized risks and targets, further augmented by peer support, to improve risk factor
      control in type 2 diabetic patients.

    <description>Patients assigned to the EMERALD group will be invited to join the multi-component program which will last for 1 year. This program will be held on a 4-weekly basis for the first 3-4 months followed by a maintenance program involving 2-4 group activities every year. Between clinic visits, patients in this group will also receive telephone reminders from the staff and peer supporters to reinforce compliance and for social support.</description>

    <description>Irrespective of the assignment group, all patients will undergo a baseline comprehensive assessment using the JADE portal disease management system. All patients will also receive a 2-hour session on how to interpret their individualised JADE report and risk profiles, whilst the importance of achieving targets and optimizing self care will be reinforced.
Patients assigned to the UC group will be followed up in their usual clinic according to the 'standard' practice.</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to the EMERALD group will be followed up at a Diabetes Centre led by the nurses and supported by diabetologists, with a particular emphasis on individualizing HbA1c goals and selecting drugs based on clinical profiles to maximize benefits and minimize harm.
These patients will also undergo an intensive 3 to 4 months empowerment program where patients within the same group, and therefore sharing similar profiles, will return to the centre monthly to undergo a 2-3 hour activity session led by diabetes nurses, peer supporters and paramedics. Between medical visits, the nurses or HCA will telephone the patients at least once to provide support, help problem-shoot and remind them of their follow-up schedule.</description>
