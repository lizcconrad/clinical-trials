      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acupuncture or moxibustion therapies are
      effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. meanwhile, we are aim to observe the
      content of Inflammatory factors and Neurotransmitter before and after acupuncture and
      moxibustion therapy.

      Through treating active Crohn's disease by acupuncture and moxibustion therapies for 12
      weeks, we are aim to observe the efficiency and the probably change of Inflammatory factors
      and Neurotransmitter of colonic mucosa and we may elucidate the mechanism of the efficiency
      of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy.
