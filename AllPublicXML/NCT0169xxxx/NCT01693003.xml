  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise intolerance is a major complain of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). Dynamic hyperinflation has been recognized as an important limiting factor
      responsible for the appearance of intolerable dyspnea during exercise. Regular treatment with
      long-acting bronchodilators promotes a more sustained reduction of hyperinflation and
      consequent symptom relief and increase in the patient's ability to overcome physical demands
      of daily life. Tiotropium bromide (TIO) is a new generation, long-acting anticholinergic
      bronchodilator that significantly improves lung function, reduces symptoms and improves
      exercise tolerance in patients with advanced COPD. Indacaterol is a new ultra-long duration
      (&gt;24 h) β2-agonist, which promotes sustained dilation of the bronchi with a once-daily
      administration. Compared to tiotropium, indacaterol provides evidence that is as effective as
      tiotropium for bronchodilation, as well as other clinical outcomes such as dyspnea and state
      of health. However, comparative effects of indacaterol versus tiotropium with regard to
      outcomes in tolerance, dyspnea and dynamic lung hyperinflation during exercise is scarce. We
      hypothesized that indacaterol and TIO are not different in terms of exercise tolerance and
      its determinants (dynamic hyperinflation and dyspnea).

Adverse event is any sign, symptom or undesired medical condition that occurs after the beginning of the study even if said event is not considered related to the drug (or therapy) of study. Information on adverse events either reported voluntarily by the patient, identified through questioning by the investigator, or detected by physical examination, laboratory testing or otherwise, will be collected and recorded.</description>
