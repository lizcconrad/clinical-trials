  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Usually videolaryngoscopy using a videolaryngoscope with a classic Macintosh design is
      performed with the blade in the vallecula and the epiglottis elevated from the vocal cords
      indirectly, as in direct laryngoscopy. However, during an audit of videolaryngoscopic
      practice we noticed that, in obtaining the best view, clinicians frequently and inadvertently
      advanced the blade into the vallecula to get a better view, such that the epiglottis was
      downfolded and elevated directly from the vocal cords. However, a better view does not
      necessarily lead to higher intubation success.

      In this randomized, controlled trial, we want to determine the efficacy of
      videolaryngoscope-guided tracheal intubation using an alternative position for the blade in
      patients with normal airways.

      Anaesthesia will be induced in the conventional matter. For patients randomized to the
      intervention group, when the anaesthesiologist considers the depth of anaesthesia to be
      sufficient, a C-MAC® videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), will be placed into
      the patients mouth. The best possible view of the vocal cords will be obtained with the blade
      positioned normally in the vallecula anterior to the epiglottis. The epiglottis will be
      elevated from the vocal cords indirectly, identical with direct laryngoscopy. After this, the
      best possible view of the vocal cords will be obtained with the blade positioned
      alternatively in the vallecula posterior to the epiglottis, such that the epiglottis is
      downfolded and elevated directly from the vocal cords. Views will be scored in both positions
      using the Cormack and Lehane classification system. When correct laryngoscope positioning
      can't be achieved with a size 3 blade, a size 4 blade will be used.

      For patients not randomized to the intervention group, anaesthesia will also be induced in
      the conventional matter. When the anaesthesiologist considers the depth of anaesthesia to be
      sufficient, a C-MAC® videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), will be placed into
      the patients mouth. The best possible view of the vocal cords will be obtained with the blade
      positioned normally in the vallecula anterior to the epiglottis. The epiglottis will be
      elevated from the vocal cords indirectly, identical with direct laryngoscopy. The view will
      be scored in this position using the Cormack and Lehane classification system. After this,
      the patient will be intubated.

      Patients will be interviewed 2 and 24 hours postoperatively about sore throat, dysphonia,
      dysphagia and coughing.

    <description>In the control group, anaesthesia will be induced in the same way as mentioned above for the intervention group. Also in this group, intubation will be achieved using a C-MAC® videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) with a size 3 Macintosh blade.
The best possible view of the glottic inlet will be scored with the blade tip positioned in the vallecula. The glottic view will be scored in this position using the Cormack and Lehane classification system. If correct laryngoscope positioning cannot be achieved with a size 3 blade, a size 4 blade will be used. Hereafter, the patient's trachea will be intubated once the optimal view of the larynx had been obtained. Intubation attempts will be scored in the same way as mentioned above for the intervention group.</description>

    <description>Endotracheal intubation will be achieved using a C-MAC® videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) with a size 3 Macintosh blade.
The best possible view of the glottic inlet will be scored with the blade tip positioned in the vallecula.
Next, the view of the glottic inlet will be scored with the blade advanced further into the vallecula, until the epiglottis flips infero-posteriorly and becomes downfolded into the trachea.
The glottic view will be scored in both positions using the Cormack and Lehane classification system.
After successful intubation, the blade will slowly be withdrawn into the vallecula to elevate the epiglottis back to its normal position.</description>
