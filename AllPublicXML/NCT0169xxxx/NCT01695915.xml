        Constipated children are recruited from the outpatient clinic at Kolding pediatric
        department. A list of patients which have been given the diagnose constipation are drawn
        from the computer and reviewed. Children between 4-12 years who fulfill the Rome III
        criteria of constipation and have been taking PEG maintenance treatment at least 1 month,
        are contacted by telephone for possible participation in the study.

        Healthy participants without constipation or other diseases affecting the gastrointestinal
        tract were recruited among the employees of the Department of Pediatrics at Kolding
        Hospital.

        Written informed consent was obtained from both parents before any procedures were
        initiated.
