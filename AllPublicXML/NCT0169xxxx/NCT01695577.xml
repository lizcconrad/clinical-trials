  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of vestibular rehabilitation and balance
      training on patients with dizziness and balance problems after traumatic brain injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      8 000 to 10 000 persons are admitted to hospitals in Norway with traumatic brain injury
      (TBI)annually. Dizziness and balance problems have an incidence of 30-80% in this population.

      Studies show that dizziness and imbalance has the potential to restrict several aspects of
      personal and social life.

      Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is an accepted and effective treatment for dizziness and
      imbalance. However there is lack of evidence/knowledge about its effect on TBI patients.

      The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial study (RCT). Patients aged 16-60
      admitted to Oslo University Hospital with TBI and symptoms of dizziness and imbalance are
      included 8 weeks after the injury.

      The intervention and control group will receive multidisciplinary assessment and evaluation.
      The intervention group will in addition receive group training and a home exercise program by
      physiotherapists. The intervention will consist of a individually adapted Vestibular
      Rehabilitation and balance program.

      The main outcome measurement is the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). The study has several
      other self-report and performance based outcome measures. The outcome measures will be
      performed before and after the intervention and 6 months after the injury.

    <measure>Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post injury</time_frame>
    <description>The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) was developed to measure the self-perceived level of handicap associated with the symptom of dizziness (Jacobson, 1990). The DHI is a 25 item self-report questionnaire with 3 response levels: yes = 4, sometimes = 2, no = 0. The total score is obtained by summing the ordinal scale responses obtained from the 3 response levels (0-100, higher score indicates worse handicap) (Jacobson, 1990).
The DHI has been translated into Norwegian and has demonstrated satisfactory measurement properties (Tamber, 2009).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>High level mobility assessment tool for traumatic brain injury (HiMAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post injury</time_frame>
    <description>The HiMAT is a uni-dimensional performance-based measure of balance and mobility. It consists of 13 walking, running, skipping, hopping and stair items that are measured either by a stopwatch or tape-measure. Raw scores measured in times and distances are noted and converted to a score on a 5-point scale from 0-4, except the two dependent stair items that are rated on a 6- point scale from 0-5. A 0 corresponds to inability to perform the item, and 1 -4/5 represents increasing levels of ability. The sum score range is 0-54 (worst-best). A user/instruction manual for the testers describing the test in detail is developed. (Williams, 2006;Williams, 2006).</description>

    <measure>Balance Error Scoring System (BESS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post injury</time_frame>
    <description>The Bess is a standardized balance testing system. It consists of three 20 second, standardized stances on a firm surface and on a foam surface with eyes closed. The stances are: double leg stance, single-leg stance and tandem stance. Errors are counted during each 20-second trial(Bell, 2011;Finnoff, 2009). The Bess has variable but satisfactory measurement properties and norms are developed (Bell, 2011).</description>
