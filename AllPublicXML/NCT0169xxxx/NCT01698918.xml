  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if combining everolimus with letrozole is safe and
      has beneficial effects in postmenopausal women who have estrogen positive HER2 negative
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, this study aims to find out if
      everolimus plus exemestane is safe and has beneficial effects in women with estrogen positive
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after treatment with everolimus plus letrozole.
      This study will also aim to find out if a mouth rinse can help reduce the severity of oral
      stomatitis, a common side effect of everolimus. This part of the study will be conducted only
      in countries where an alcohol free 0.5mg/5ml dexamethasone oral solution is commercially
      available.

    <description>In this study Progression free survival is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST. Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease with a duration of 24 weeks or longer according to RECIST. ORR and CBR will be calculated based on the full analysis set, using local radiologist's/investigator's tumor assessment. Patients with only non-measurable disease at baseline will be included in the numerator if they achieve a complete response</description>

    <time_frame>Upon onset of 1st stomatitis, patient will complete diary daily until resolution of stomatitis</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis for this objective will be based on Patient reported outcomes data for the first incidence of stomatitis AE. The mean, standard deviation and 95% confidence interval of each severity item in the questionnaire will be calculated at each day for the two therapeutic interventions for stomatitis groups and presented graphically. The duration of the first stomatitis incidence will be calculated using the dates reported in the PRO.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of safety based on the frequency of adverse events that fall outside normal pre-specified ranges</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuous during the study, up to 28 days after last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre-determined ranges. Other safety data (e.g., electrocardiogram, vital signs) will be considered as appropriate. All safety data will be listed. For all safety analyses, the safety population will be used.</description>

    <description>At the onset of symptoms suggestive of stomatitis patients must contact the study site. Upon confirmation of stomatitis at the site, patients in countries where the alcohol-free 0.5mg/5ml dexamethasone oral solution is commercially available will be randomly assigned to take either dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5ml mouth rinse or the standard of care used to treat stomatitis at the patient's center. The mouth rinse will be self administered at a daily dose of 10ml 3 times per day. Patients will be instructed to swish and expectorate the mouth rinse. Patients will also be instructed to fill out the Oral Stomatitis Daily Questionnaire (OSDQ) at home every day until the patient recovers. The mouth rinse will be self administered at a daily dose of 10ml 3 times per day.Patients will be instructed to swish and expectorate the mouth rinse.</description>
