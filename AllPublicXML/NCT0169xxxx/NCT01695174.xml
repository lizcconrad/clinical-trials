      In the current protocol, we propose the assessment of potential beneficial effects of the
      antibiotic Xifaxan on liver biochemistries, liver related symptoms and Mayo risk score in 15
      adult and 5 pediatric patients with PSC. Adult patients will receive Xifaxan, 550 mg twice
      daily over a 12-week period. Pediatric patients with PSC whose weight is greater than or
      equal to 40 kg will receive Xifaxan, 550 mg twice daily.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of PSC established by all of the following criteria:

               -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal for at least 6 months
                  duration

               -  Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal in pediatric
                  patients

               -  Cholangiography demonstrating intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary
                  obstruction, beading, or narrowing consistent with PSC

               -  Liver histology in the past (if available for review) with features consistent
                  with or diagnostic of PSC

          -  Both genders

          -  Adults: Ages 18-75 years.

          -  Pediatric: Weight &gt; 40 kg

          -  Patient's informed consent for study participation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Treatment with systematic antibiotics, Azulfidine, ursodeoxycholic acid,
             corticosteroids, colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, chlorambucil,
             budesonide, pentoxifylline, tacrolimus, vitamin E or prednisone in the preceding three
             months

          -  Active drug or alcohol use

          -  Prior history of allergic reaction to the antibiotics which will be used in the study

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the
             patient's ability to complete the study safely or successfully

          -  Evidence of decompensated liver disease such as recurrent variceal bleeding,
             refractory ascites or spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy

          -  Anticipated need for transplantation in one year (Mayo survival model &lt;80% one-year
             survival without transplant)

          -  Findings highly suggestive of liver disease of other etiology such as chronic
             alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, hemochromatosis, Wilson's
             disease, 1-antitrypsin deficiency, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary
             cirrhosis or secondary sclerosing cholangitis

          -  Treatment with any study medications in the preceding three months
