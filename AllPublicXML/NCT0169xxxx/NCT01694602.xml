  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this research is to develop a non-invasive approach to evaluate the
      production of 3-methylhistidine (3MH)in cancer patients, as a potential means of determining
      which patients are at high risk for future development of cancer induced skeletal muscle
      atrophy.

      Rationale: The approach is based on the hypothesis that after an oral dose of deuterated
      3-methylhistidine (D-3MH), the slope of the terminal portion of the decay curve (&gt; 12 hours
      post-dosing) for the tracer/tracee (D-3MH/3MH) in the free 3MH pool is proportional to the
      rate constant for myofibrillar protein degradation and can be determined from spot urine
      samples.

      The long-term objective of this research is to develop a non-invasive approach for assessment
      of de novo 3MH production in cancer patients early in the course of the disease as a way of
      assessing which patients are at high risk for future development of skeletal muscle atrophy.
      The approach is based on: 1) the known increase in de novo production of 3-methylhistidine
      (3MH) from muscle protein breakdown in said patients as a consequence of their unique
      disease-host interactions, and 2) earlier demonstration that de novo 3MH production can be
      measured in vivo using isotope dilution.

      During this Phase-II project, we propose to conduct a statistically powerful prospective
      investigation to demonstrate that measurement of the slope of the terminal decay curve (rate
      constant) with our approach in newly diagnosed cancer patients predicts future development of
      muscle wasting. We expect the outcome of the combined Phase-I and Phase-II research to lead
      to the early identification of elevated muscle catabolism in at-risk patients so that medical
      intervention can prevent future muscle atrophy.
