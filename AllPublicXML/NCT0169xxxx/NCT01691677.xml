  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intranasal corticosteroids are beneficial in the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis. As
      adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotic treatment, mometasone furoate at doses of 200 μg or 400
      μg twice daily, was well tolerated and significantly more effective in reducing the symptoms
      of rhinosinusitis than antibiotic therapy alone. Furthermore,the addition of fluticasone
      propionate to xylometazoline and antimicrobial therapy with cefuroxime improved clinical
      success rates and accelerated recovery of patients with a history of chronic rhinitis or
      recurrent sinusitis who present for treatment of acute rhinosinusitis.

      The present study was planned to assess the effects of nebulised beclomethasone dipropionate
      given as add-on therapy to standard care (oral antibiotics) in the treatment of acute
      symptomatic rhinosinusitis. Antibiotic therapy will be at the physicians' discretion.
