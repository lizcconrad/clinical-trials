  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a very low dose naltrexone-buprenorphine treatment
      to transfer opioid dependent individuals to extended release naltrexone injection (Vivitrol).
      The hypothesis is that patients will complete the transfer to Vivitrol successfully, finding
      the treatment acceptable and showing minimal withdrawal discomfort.

    <textblock>
      Thirty-five opioid dependent (OD) volunteers seeking treatment will be enrolled in an
      open-label, flexible-dosing, outpatient trial at Duke Addictions Program. On days 1-3,
      participants will receive buprenorphine/naloxone daily at a starting dose of 4mg,
      progressively decreasing to 2 mg on days 2- 3. Participants will also receive very low dose
      naltrexone (VLNTX) at a dose of 0.25 mg to 1mg on Days 1-3, 2 to 6 mg on Day 4 and between 10
      and 50 mg on Days 5-7. Then a VIVITROL injection, 380 mg, will be administered on Day 8.

      Evaluations will occur daily for up to 6 hours until 1 day after VIVITROL injection and then
      weekly for 4 weeks. Patients will receive ancillary medications as needed and weekly
      psychosocial intervention. At the end of the study, participants will be offered outpatient
      treatment of OD at the study site, or will be referred to other treatment programs.

    <measure>Retention in Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After the initial titration period for opioid withdrawal (of up to 8 days), patients will receive the Vivitrol injection. Then, we will follow patients for retention out to 4 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Withdrawal Intensity as Measured by the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After the initial titration period for opioid withdrawal (of up to 8 days), patients will receive the Vivitrol injection. Then, we will follow patients for retention out to 4 weeks and record the total time they remained in treatment.
COWS rates eleven common opiate withdrawal signs or symptoms. The summed scores ranged from 0-48, with 5-12 = mild; 13-24 = moderate; 25-36 = moderately severe; more than 36 = severe withdrawal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Withdrawal Intensity as Measured by the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After the initial titration period for opioid withdrawal (of up to 8 days), patients will receive the Vivitrol injection. Then, we will follow patients for retention out to 4 weeks and record the total time they remained in treatment.
SOWS contains 16 symptoms whose intensity the patient rates on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total score range is 0 - 64; the higher the score the more withdrawal symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Craving, assessed with a 100-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS), ranging from 'not at all' (0) to 'more than ever' (100). The higher the score the higher the craving.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction With Treatment, Measured by a Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 9</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire consisted of 3 questions.
Were you satisfied with the treatment (range 1-5): Completely satisfied (1) to completely dissatisfied (5).
Were you satisfied with withdrawal treatment (range 1-5): Minimal withdrawal (1) to worse than ever (5).
Did the medication help (range 1-5): Helped a lot (1) to No it did not help (5).
Lower scores represent greater satisfaction.</description>

        <description>After the initial titration period for opioid withdrawal (of up to 8 days), patients will receive the Vivitrol injection. Then, we will follow patients for retention out to 4 weeks and record the total time they remained in treatment.
COWS rates eleven common opiate withdrawal signs or symptoms. The summed scores ranged from 0-48, with 5-12 = mild; 13-24 = moderate; 25-36 = moderately severe; more than 36 = severe withdrawal.</description>
