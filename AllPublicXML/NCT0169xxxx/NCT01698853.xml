  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoro-femoral cardiopulmonary bypass with retrograde perfusion is needed for totally
      thoracoscopic cardiac surgery. one of the major complication of retrograde perfusion is organ
      hypoperfusion.

      Arterial blood gas analysis can help to detect hypoperfusion or hypoxia during retrograde
      perfusion. However,whether the arterial oxygenation status from different parts of the body
      are the same in the condition of retrograde perfusion have not been studied.

      The present study is aimed to determine if there is difference in the arterial oxygenation
      between peripheral arterial and aortic root during the period of retrograde perfusion.In
      addition, the impact of artificial ventilation on the difference of arterial oxygenation will
      also be investigated.

      All patients included will be assigned into two different groups according to the surgical
      approach,one group is named &quot;NP&quot; with normal perfusion,and the other is named &quot;RP&quot; with
      retrograde perfusion.

      For all the patients,we will obtain 0.5ml blood from both peripheral arterial and aortic root
      for blood gas analysis at some specific time points.

      We will focus on the differences of arterial oxygenation between peripheral arterial and
      aortic root at each group.At the same time,we will analyse the impact of artificial
      ventilation on it.

    <time_frame>patients will be followed up during the cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood samples will be collected at 3 timepoints which is specified in the DESCRIPTION</time_frame>
    <description>The three time points for blood sample collection are:1.right before clamping the aorta; 2.Three minutes after **** without ventilation;3.5 min after re-initiate mechanical ventilation.</description>
