      A feasibility study for monitoring and recording gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric activity
      in subjects with suspected or diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and reports of GI pain
      and asymptomatic subjects without IBS and GI pain.

    <textblock>
      This single-arm, non-randomized feasibility study has been designed to transcutaneously
      detect and monitor myoelectric intestinal signals temporally associated with the symptoms of
      patients who report pain and have suspected or diagnosed IBS, and in controls [subjects
      without suspected IBS or diagnosis of IBS and prior and/or current complaints of pain].
