  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently intraoperative motor evoked potential monitoring (MEP) is widely used to reduce
      neural damage during neurosurgery.

      As neuromuscular blockade(NMB) during MEP monitoring decreases the amplitude of MEP, partial
      NMB is usually maintained during general anesthesia. Continuous infusion of NMB agent is
      preferred than bolus infusion during MEP monitoring. There are a lot of NMB agents in
      clinical use. But there have been no reports about the effect of changing NMB agent on
      efficacy of MEP monitoring.

      Therefore, the investigators performed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect
      of changing NMB agent on the variability of MEP amplitude during neurosurgery.
