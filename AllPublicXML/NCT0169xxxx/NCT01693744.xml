      Background: Pseudoexfoliation (PEX) is characterised by the deposition of fibrillar material
      in an eye structures and many other parts of the body including kidneys and blood vessels. As
      both PEX and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with oxidative stress and
      endothelial dysfunction we studied if the risk of PEX was increased in patients with CKD.

      Methods: Patients over age 40 with the diagnosis of CKD were included in the study. Chronic
      kidney disease was diagnosed as decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60
      mL/min/1.73 mÂ². Study groups were arranged as group 1 consisting of HD receiving patients,
      group 2 consisting of stage 1-4 CKD patients and group 3 consisting of patients with normal
      kidney functions (control group). Demographic properties and the rate of PEX were evaluated
      and compaired between the groups.
