    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to document the prevalence and associations between
      asthma, hypertension, and obesity in children living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and its
      surrounding regions.

      The secondary objective is to determine the impact of various educational interventions on
      child and caregiver knowledge of asthma.

      The Asthma Program will consist of six screenings and three camps each year, for two
      consecutive years. Screenings will be conducted in areas where populations are known to be at
      increased risk for asthma and its complications, such as inner-city, lower socioeconomic,
      African-American populations. Screenings will be conducted at churches or schools in these
      areas one month prior to each camp in an effort to identify children with undiagnosed or
      uncontrolled asthma and refer them to the camps. Camps will also be conducted in areas where
      populations are known to be at increased risk for asthma and its complications to improve
      ease of access. Asthma and smoking cessation education will be provided at each camp to
      children and caregivers. Baseline data will be collected at each camp and assessed.
      Longitudinal clinical outcomes will be assessed in children attending multiple camps.

    <description>A pre and post asthma knowledge test will be given to children and caregivers prior to and after participation in the educational session conducted at each asthma camp. A paired sample t-test was used for comparison of pre and post knowledge tests and a p value of less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.</description>

    <description>Two separate asthma education classes are conducted to target two age groups: 6-10 yrs and 10-15 yrs. With the guidance of pharmacy faculty, student pharmacists develop innovative educational activities directed at three of the most common barriers to proper asthma control: avoidance of asthma triggers; compliance with asthma medications and proper usage of inhalers; and the importance of an asthma action plan. There is a different group of student pharmacists participating in each camp and this allows for variation in educational activities, all reinforcing the same important aspects of optimal asthma management. Students create age-appropriate activities for each group. Parents are required to attend camps with their child and participate in the asthma education sessions.</description>

        Two screenings will be held prior to each camp, at two separate locations, for a total of
        six screenings per year. Screenings will be held at different locations throughout the city
        of Pittsburgh in an effort to increase identification and recruitment for subsequent camps.
        All children will be invited to participate in screenings, regardless of participation in
        the study. All children, ages 5-17 years, will be included in our study pending informed
        consent and assent. Camps will take place three times each year. All children will be
        invited to participate in camps, regardless of participation in the study. All children,
        ages 5-17 years will be included in our study pending informed consent and assent.
