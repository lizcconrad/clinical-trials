  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are born with immature lungs and often require help with breathing shortly
      after birth. This traditionally involves administering 100% oxygen. Unfortunately, delivery
      of high oxygen concentrations leads to the production of free radicals that can injure many
      organ systems. Term and near-term newborns deprived of oxygen during or prior to birth
      respond as well or better to resuscitation with room air (21% oxygen) compared to 100%
      oxygen. However, a static concentration of 21% oxygen may be inappropriate for preterm
      infants with lung disease.Purpose of the study is to investigate if preterm neonates where
      resuscitation is initiated with 21% fiO2 and adjusted to meet transitional goal saturations
      (Limited oxygen strategy or LOX) would have less oxidative stress as measured by the
      oxidative balance ratio of biological antioxidant potential/total hydroperoxide compared to
      infants where resuscitation is initiated with pure oxygen and titrated for targeted
      saturations of 85-94% (Traditional oxygen strategy or TOX). Secondary outcomes of interest
      included need for other delivery room resuscitation measures, respiratory support and
      ventilation/oxygenation status upon neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, survival
      to hospital discharge, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other short-term morbidities.

    <description>Resuscitation was initiated with room air (21% O2) for LOX infants. Supplemental oxygen was given if 1) the heart rate (HR) was less than 100 bpm after 30 seconds of effective ventilation, 2) the lower limits of goal saturations were not met. Targeted goal Pre-ductal saturations after birth were derived by approximation of the interquartile values for healthy term infants as reported by Kamlin et al and Dawson et al.FiO2 was increased or decreased by 10% in 30 second intervals as needed. If HR &lt; 60 bpm after 30 seconds of effective ventilation , FiO2 was increased to 100% until the heart rate was stabilized.
