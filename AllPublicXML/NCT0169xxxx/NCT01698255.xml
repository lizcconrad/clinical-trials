    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot study will test the feasibility of a behavioral intervention for late
      life depression. Enrolled participants will receive 9 weeks of a specialized form of
      psychotherapy we call &quot;ENGAGE&quot; or standard of care psychotherapy. ENGAGE is a stepped care
      psychotherapy based on what is currently known about older adults' response to depression
      interventions. Stepped care is a model of treatment that starts with the minimum effective
      therapeutic techniques first, and then based on how well people respond to treatment,
      additional therapeutic techniques are added until individuals recover from their depression.
      The treatment components of ENGAGE were selected to match the most common problems seen in
      older adults with depression. They include instructing the participant in basic problem
      solving techniques and encouraging re-engagement in rewarding activities.

      Participants will be depressed, older adult clients of Westchester Jewish Community Services
      or outpatient research subjects recruited by the Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.
      In addition to receiving therapy, study participants will also undergo research assessments
      at the beginning of the study and then at weeks 6 and 9.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A concern about existing psychotherapies is that, while effective in depression, community
      clinicians find them difficult to implement in older people, particularly those with medical
      illnesses or disability. As a consequence evidence-based psychotherapies are utilized by a
      small number of specialized clinicians and offered to small number of select patients.

      ENGAGE approaches these problems with a four prong strategy: 1) It developed a brief
      treatment program consisting of psychotherapeutic components of known efficacy. 2) Among
      them, ENGAGE selected components most pertinent to older adults. 3) ENGAGE distilled and
      simplified these components so that they can be accessible to most depressed older patients
      and taught to large numbers of clinicians. 4) To further simplify and personalize its
      administration, ENGAGE relies on a stepped approach focusing on engagement in rewarding
      social and physical activities (a form of behavioral activation), and when needed, adding
      techniques for management of emotionality (emotional control), negativity bias, and apathy.
      The self-correcting and least restrictive nature of stepped care approaches has appeal from
      patient cost/time efficiency and personalized treatment perspective. This project aims to
      further develop ENGAGE, to study the feasibility of training professionals (master's level
      social workers) offering care to depressed elderly patients in the community, to obtain
      preliminary data of its efficacy compared to community-based therapy (CT), and to prepare for
      an effectiveness (R01) study.

    <description>ENGAGE is a stepped care psychotherapy based on what is known about how older adults respond to depression interventions. Stepped care is a model of treatment that starts with the minimum effective therapeutic techniques first, and then based on how well people respond to treatment, additional therapeutic techniques are added until people are recovered from their depression. The steps of ENGAGE are:
basic social and physical engagement, which has been found to be a very effective depression strategy for most older adults;
the addition of strategies to address clinical features of depression interfering with treatment engagement, namely affect regulation, pessimism, and disorganization.</description>

    <description>The comparison group for this study will be the current standard of care psychotherapy offered by Westchester Jewish Community Services (WJCS) therapists. This type of psychotherapy is often supportive or eclectic in nature. Therapists will focus on helping the subject to express feelings and focus on strengths and abilities in working through current difficulties and transitions. Therapists assigned to provide standard psychotherapy to eligible participants will receive training and supervision from WJCS staff consistent with agency practice.</description>
