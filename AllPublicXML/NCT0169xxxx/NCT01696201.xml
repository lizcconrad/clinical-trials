  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to physical and physiological changes that occur in pregnant women, depression is very
      common during this period. Recent research findings indicate that antenatal maternal mood
      state impacts on babies health. Nowadays, many researchers are focussed on examining the
      effects of physical exercise on foetal and maternal outcomes.

      The main aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a supervised exercise program
      consisted of 25-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise,10 minutes of specific exercises
      (strength and balance exercises), and 10 minutes of pelvis floor muscles training, on the
      prevention and treatment of depression in pregnant women. Additionally, the other purpose of
      the study was to analyze the effects of depression and physical exercise on outcomes.

      Hypothesis: Pregnant women who do regular exercise during their pregnancies would have a
      better mood state than pregnant women who are sedentary, without having any negative effect
      on outcomes.

      BACKROUND: Recent studies have estimated the prevalence of depression during pregnancy at
      between 10% and 30%. This state can produce negative effects on the fetus as:

        -  Affect cerebral development

        -  Increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight

        -  Increase the risk of childhood overweight problems

        -  Adverse impact on the cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioural development of
           infants

      Due to the possible side effect of antidepressants on mother and fetus, its necessary to
      examine alternative solutions to this state.

    <description>Supervised physical conditioning program of three 55—60 minute sessions per week during whole pregnancy (from week 9 to 38). Each session consists of 25-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise,10 minutes of specific exercises (strength and balance exercises), and 10 minutes of pelvic floor muscles training.
Aerobic activity was prescribed at light to moderate intensity, aiming for 55-60 of maximal heart rate. All subjects wore a heart rate (HR) monitor (Polar FT7) during the training sessions to ensure that exercise intensity was light to moderate.</description>
