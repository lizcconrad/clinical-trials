  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of persons on the national solid organ waiting list continues to increase while
      the number of donated organs has failed to keep pace. In some portions of northeastern Ohio
      the donation rate is as low as 32%. There is a positive association between discussing organ
      donation with a primary care physician and signing a donor card. However, such discussions
      are rare. The investigators propose a blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of two interventions: 1) showing a donation video to patients in primary care
      settings waiting to see their physician and 2) cueing of primary care providers to have
      donation discussions with their patients. The study will be conducted throughout Cuyahoga
      County in at least 10 ambulatory clinics associated with a single county medical system. Nine
      hundred patients over 15.5 years of age will be enrolled. The investigators hypothesize that
      patients exposed to the interventions will be 1) more likely to consent to donate organs, 2)
      more likely to have donation discussions with their primary care providers, and 3) equally
      satisfied with the time spent with their doctor compared to patients who are not exposed to
      the interventions.
