  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study addresses a significant public health threat of HIV, HCV and other STIs
      among a very high risk population of active IDUs and their sexual partners in Kazakhstan a
      region that is experiencing one of the fastest rising HIV epidemics in the world. There is a
      race to develop and implement effective HIV preventive interventions for IDUs and their
      sexual partners to stem the spread of HIV, HCV and other STIs in Almaty, Shu and other
      Central Asian towns along drug trafficking routes. The proposed study will test the
      effectiveness of a couplesbased HIV/STI risk reduction intervention to decrease new cases of
      HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) and incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well as
      to reduce unsafe injection practices and increase condom use among injecting drug users
      (IDUs) and their heterosexual, intimate partners in Kazakhstan.

      The proposed study will rigorously test the efficacy of an innovative, couplesbased HIV/STI
      risk reduction intervention to decrease new cases of HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) and incidence
      of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well as to reduce unsafe injection practices
      and increase condom use among injecting drug users (IDUs) and their heterosexual intimate
      partners in Kazakhstan. Central Asia has experienced one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS
      epidemics due to a sharp increase in injection drug use. For the proposed study, the
      participants will be 400 IDUs and their heterosexual intimate partners. These 400 couples
      will be randomized to one of two interventions: a 5session couplesbased HIV/STI risk
      reduction intervention or a 5session couplesbased wellness promotion intervention, which will
      serve as a control condition. Participants will be assessed with repeated measures at
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12months postintervention. The primary behavioral outcomes are
      selfreported proportion of injection acts in which needles or syringes are shared in the past
      90 days and proportion of condom protected acts of sexual intercourse in the past 90 days.
      The primary biological outcomes are the rate of new HIV and HCV cases, and the cumulative
      incidence of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis over the 12month postintervention period. The
      proposed study will advance the understanding of HIV/HCV/STI risk reduction among IDUs and
      thereby may help to stem the rising epidemic of HIV, HCV, and STIs in Kazakhstan and Central
      Asia.
