    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of endogenous cortisol and cortisone
      metabolism as a biomarker for immunosuppressive agents disposition in Chinese renal
      transplant recipients. If the blood concentrations of immunosuppressants can be predicted
      successfully, this new probe may take place of current drug monitoring post transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppressive agents, including cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and sirolimus, have been
      widely used to improve the outcome of organ transplantation. The need for frequent and
      specific monitoring of drug concentrations remains essential, since the therapeutic dosing
      and pharmacokinetics show great variability among recipients. However, this may be time and
      cost consuming. Indeed, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and sirolimus are all metabolized by
      CYP3A, consisting with the metabolic characteristic of endogenous cortisol and cortisone.
      Hence, the present study is designed to determine if the endogenous cortisol and cortisone
      metabolism can be used as an noninvasive probe for immunosuppressants pharmacokinetics in
      Chinese renal transplant recipients.

    <description>For renal transplant recipients, blood samples are collected at 0 time point (before dosing) for the analysis of trough concentrations of immunosuppressive agents, and urine samples are gathered at 2h interval post-dose (8:00am-10:00am).
For healthy subjects, blood samples are collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24h after cyclosporine A dosing; at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72h after tacrolimus dosing; at 0, 0.33, 0.67, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120h after sirolimus dosing. Urine samples are obtained for 0-10 h (8:00 am to 18:00 pm) and 10-24 h (18:00 pm to 8:00 am) post-dose. Furthermore，blood samples at 1, 4, 8, 10, 24h and urine samples for additional 24 h interval (-8:00 am to 8:00 am) before dosing are compared with those obtained after dosing to evaluate the effects of immunosuppressive agents administration on cortisol and cortisone levels and metabolism.</description>
