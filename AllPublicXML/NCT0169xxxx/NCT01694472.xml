      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and preliminary efficacy of
      MAGE-A4 TCR Gene-Modified T lymphocytes in the treatment of malignant solid tumor patients,
      such as malignant melanoma and lung cancer.

    <description>The study consists of a 2-dose escalation scheme, and the patient receives twice in each dose. The starting dose is 1-3 x 10^9 cells of each TCR gene-modified cells and the second one is 3-8 x 10^9 cells of each TCR gene-modified cells. Two weeks after the first infusion the patient receives the same dose again, followed by infusions of IL-2 for 5 days. Thereafter, the patient receives peptide vaccinations on days 21 and 28.</description>
