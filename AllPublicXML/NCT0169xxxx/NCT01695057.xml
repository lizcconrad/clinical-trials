    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies vorinostat before surgery in treating patients with
      triple-negative breast cancer. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving enzyme inhibitor therapy before surgery may
      make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition using suberoylanilide
      hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (vorinostat) to induce expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and
      progesterone receptor (PR) genes in solid human triple negative invasive breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat 400 mg daily orally (PO) on days 1-21 followed by surgery within
      14 days.

    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients who achieve sufficient deacetylation of ER and PR will be estimable with a standard error no greater than +/- 0.05. The proportion of patients who exhibit a sufficient change in ER or PR expression can be estimated with similar precision. In addition, paired t-tests and McNamaraÃ¢s test will be used to evaluate whether the effect of vorinostat on deacetylation status or gene expression differs between ER or PR, and linear regression analysis will be used to evaluate the association between deacetylation changes and corresponding expression changes in ER and PR genes.</description>

    <description>The toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria v4.0 and nadir or maximum values for the laboratory measures), time of onset (i.e. week of treatment), duration, and reversibility or outcome.</description>
