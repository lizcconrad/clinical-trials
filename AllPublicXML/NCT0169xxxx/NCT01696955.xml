    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cetuximab with or without tivantinib works in
      treating patients with head and neck cancer that has come back (recurrent), has spread to
      other places in the body (metastatic), or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as cetuximab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Tivantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. It is not yet known whether cetuximab is more effective with or without
      tivantinib in treating patients with head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate (comparing the cetuximab/ARQ 197 [tivantinib] combination with cetuximab
      single agent activity).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Continuous tumor shrinkage. II. Progression-free survival (PFS). III. Overall survival
      (OS). IV. Objectives I, II, and III above, as well as response rates, will be assessed and
      compared between treatment arms in the subgroup of patients with high mesenchymal epithelial
      transition factor (c-MET) expression, and/or high c-MET copy number.

      V. Single agent activity for ARQ 197 (tivantinib) in patients who have failed cetuximab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
      tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients who fail
      cetuximab as a single agent may receive single agent tivantinib PO BID on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
