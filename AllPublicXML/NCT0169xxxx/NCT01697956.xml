  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of 6 weeks of treatment with
      beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) nasal aerosol versus placebo on HPA-axis function, as
      assessed by 24-hour serum cortisol weighted mean, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of BDP nasal aerosol, in subjects 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis.

    <time_frame>Day 1- week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity or severity of the AE was characterized as mild (AE which is easily tolerated), moderate (AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity) or severe (AE which prevents normal daily activities).
The causal relationship was characterized as not related (no reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by or attributed to the investigational product) or related reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by or attributed to the investigational product / a causal relationship cannot be ruled out).
An SAE was defined as an AE that resulted in any of the following:
Death
Life-threatening
Required hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity
A congenital abnormality or birth defect
An important medical event which required medical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes.</description>

          <description>Shifting to 'High' refers to starting the study within normal range and being outside the high-end of normal by end of study. Conversely, shifting to 'Low' refers to starting the study within normal range and being outside the low-end of normal by end of study.
