      Major vascular surgery involves operations to repair swollen blood vessels, clear debris from
      blocked arteries or bypass blocked blood vessels. Patients with these problems are a
      high-risk surgical group as they have generalized blood vessel disease. These puts them at
      risk of major complications around the time of surgery such as heart attacks , strokes and
      death. The mortality following repair of a swollen main artery in the abdomen is about 1 in
      20. This contrasts poorly with the 1 per 100 risk of death following a heart bypass. Simple
      and cost-effective methods are needed to reduce the risks of major vascular surgery. Remote
      ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) may be such a technique. To induce RIPC, the blood supply to
      muscle in the patient's arm is interrupted for about 5 minutes. It is then restored for a
      further five minutes. This cycle is repeated three more times. The blood supply is
      interrupted simply by inflating a blood pressure cuff to maximum pressure. This repeated
      brief interruption of the muscular blood supply sends signals to critical organs such as the
      brain and heart, which are rendered temporarily resistant to damage from reduced blood
      supply. Several small randomized clinical trials in patients undergoing different types of
      major vascular surgery have demonstrated a potential benefit. This large, multi-centre trial
      aims to determine whether RIPC can reduce complications in routine practice.

      The demand for major vascular surgery is increasing [1]. Patients requiring procedures such
      as aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, lower limb surgical re-vascularisation and
      major lower limb amputation for end-stage vascular disease constitute a high-risk surgical
      cohort. Peri-operative complications such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,
      renal failure and death are common [2,3]. Multiple potential mechanisms may result in these
      complications. For example, myocardial injury may result from systemic hypotension leading to
      reduced flow across a tight coronary artery stenosis or, alternatively, it may arise due to
      acute occlusion when an unstable plaque ruptures. Most strategies aimed at peri-operative
      risk reduction target a single potential mechanism. For example, beta-blockade may prevent
      myocardial injury due to overwork, but cannot prevent acute coronary occlusion. There is a
      requirement for a simple, effective intervention that protects tissues against injury via
      multiple different mechanisms. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may be suitable.

      Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon whereby a brief period of non-lethal ischemia in a
      tissue renders it resistant to the effects of a subsequent much longer ischaemic insult. It
      was first described in the canine heart [4]. Subsequent clinical trials showed that ischemic
      preconditioning reduced heart muscle damage following coronary artery bypass grafting [5] and
      liver dysfunction following hepatic resection [6]. Following cardiac surgery, it is
      associated with a reduction in critical care stay, arrhythmias and inotrope use [7]. However,
      ischemic preconditioning requires direct interference with the target tissues' blood supply,
      limiting its clinical utility. Further experimental work suggested that brief ischemia in one
      tissue, such as the kidneys, could confer protection on distant organs such as the heart [8].
      A similar effect was observed after transient skeletal muscle ischemia [9-11]. This effect is
      referred to as 'preconditioning at a distance' or 'remote ischemic preconditioning' (RIPC).

    <description>The primary endpoint for the trial will be Major Adverse Clinical Events. This is a composite endpoint comprising any of: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, new onset arrhythmia requiring treatment, cardiac arrest, congestive cardiac failure, cerebrovascular accident, renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, mesenteric ischaemia requiring intervention or biopsy proven ischaemic colitis, urgent cardiac revascularisation. All participants will undergo a serum troponin levels and 12-lead electrocardiogram on the second post-operative day to screen for silent peri-operative myocardial infarction. Trial ECGs and troponin levels will be interpreted by a blinded trial cardiologist.</description>

    <description>Preconditioning will be performed in the same manner as several previous trials. Immediately after induction of anaesthesia, a standard, CE-approved blood pressure cuff will be placed around one arm of the patient. It will then be inflated to a pressure of 200mmHg for 5 minutes. For patients with a systolic blood pressure &gt;185mmHg, the cuff will be inflated to at least 15mmHg above the patient's systolic blood pressure. The cuff will then be deflated and the arm allowed reperfuse for 5 minutes. This will be repeated so that each patient receives a total of 4 ischaemia-reperfusion cycles. In all other respects, the procedure and peri-operative care will follow the routine practices of the surgeons and anaesthetists involved.</description>
