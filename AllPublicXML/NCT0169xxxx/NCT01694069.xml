  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder leading to chronic pulmonary inflammation and
      infection. A majority of people with cystic fibrosis have large quantities of bacteria
      residing in their lungs. One of the most common and harmful bacteria is called Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa.

      Patients with cystic fibrosis require frequent therapy with intravenous (I.V.) antibiotics to
      treat lung infections thought to be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One of the antibiotics
      frequently used to treat this bacteria is piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam is
      thought to be the most effective when there is a constant level of drug in the body. The
      standard way to administer piperacillin-tazobactam is to give several grams 4 times each day
      as a 30 minute infusion. An alternative way to give piperacillin-tazobactam is by a
      continuous infusion; a continuous infusion will make it more likely that drug will remain at
      a constant level in the body. The objective of this study is to determine if administering
      piperacillin-tazobactam as a continuous infusion is more effective at treating people having
      a pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis than a standard 30 minute infusion, 4 times a
      day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive combination therapy to include piperacillin-tazobactam 400
      mg/kg/day (based on piperacillin component, actual body weight) not to exceed 16 grams and
      tobramycin 12 mg/kg/day extended interval dosing (once daily). Patients randomized to the
      continuous infusion group will receive a one-time loading dose of 100 mg/kg over 30 minutes
      followed immediately by initiation of the continuous infusion.

      Other antibiotics with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa are not allowed. Patients may
      receive an antibiotic for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus if deemed appropriate.

      Other treatments for pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis will be left up to the control
      of the treating physician. Patients will receive a total of 14 days of therapy. If deemed
      appropriate, patients may be discharged to home where they will continue to receive blinded
      treatment via an infusion pump. Patients will be evaluated after completing their 14 day
      course of antibiotics (end of therapy).

    <description>FEV1 will be measured upon enrollment (day 0). FEV1 will also be measured at end of therapy (day 14). If FEV1 is available when patient was stable, prior to enrollment, this value will be treated as baseline FEV1. Change in FEV1 will be calculated from baseline (if available) to day 14 and also Day 0 to day 14</description>

    <measure>Piperacillin serum concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Serum piperacillin concentration will be measured as follows:
Intermittent infusion arm: prior to dose (trough), 30 minutes (after completion of infusion), and at 4 hours
Continuous infusion arm: collected at the same time as in the intermittent infusion arm</description>

    <description>Patients will be followed for time of next subsequent pulmonary exacerbation for up to 52 weeks after completion of receiving study drug. Next pulmonary exacerbation is defined as requiring admission to a hospital for receipt of I.V. antibiotics because of a diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation.</description>
