    <textblock>
      Thr purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological results, as well as the
      femur bone density measurements of two uncemented total hip prostheses during 5 years of
      follow up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is of great importance for the function of uncemented total hip arthroplasty that the
      anchorage of the prosthesis in the bone of the femur is sufficient. This is of great
      importance in the prevention of stress shielding of the bone and to insure tranfer of forces
      from the prosthesis to the femur.

      The symax hip stem is developed to optimize stress tranfer to bone and insure mechanical
      stability.

      In this study the symax hip stem is compared to the HA_Omnifit hip stem (a frequently used
      and long term evaluated uncemented hip prosthesis) During the fist two years of follow up
      DEXA mesurments of bone mineral density are performed. Also patient satisfaction, patient
      fuction score and radiological evaluation measurements are done during 5 years of follow up.

      Our primary objective is: comparison of the short term bone remodelling surrounding the Symax
      hip stem to the short term remodeling surrounding the Stryker Omnifit HA hip stem measured by
      bone densitometry, clinical and radiographic evaluation.
