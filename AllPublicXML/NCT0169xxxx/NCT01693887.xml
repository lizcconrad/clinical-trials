      a multicenter study ( a total of 2411 person-time ) found In the United States in 205,
      antifungal therapy in empirical therapy, preemptive therapy, target therapy of respectively
      44%, 43%, 12%. While the existing on preemptive therapy and empiric treatment comparative
      study shows, the survival rate of the patients without differences, cost and application of
      antifungal drugs are relatively more in empirical therapy. These findings of differences, is
      due to the different research forecast model, treatment options vary widely, and are without
      a prospective multicenter study of verification. Initiation of antifungal therapy time and
      antifungal drug of choice is affected by many factors, including the risk stratification of
      patients, clinical manifestations, bacterial infection of evidence and non interventional
      diagnosis method results. How to grasp the opportunity to treat the fungal infections by
      empirical therapy or preemptive therapy that has plagued the global clinical doctors. The
      purpose of this study is aimed at the large scale prospective, multicenter study method to
      China, severe invasive pulmonary fungal infection of the empiric treatment with preemptive
      therapy for clinical contrast research, exploration of fungal treatment time and plan, to
      establish China's own optimal antifungal treatment options, are reduced in patients with
      severe fungal infection harm and increase the rate of successful treatment with
      evidence-based medical evidence.
