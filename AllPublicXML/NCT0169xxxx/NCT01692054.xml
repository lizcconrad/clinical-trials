    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to improve the prognosis of the development of alcohol consumption by
      considering a variety of biological, psychological and social risk and protective factors.
      Therefore, young people who have been hospitalized due to acute alcohol intoxication within
      the past 5 to 12 years will be interviewed in order to assess aspects of healthy or impaired
      psychosocial development. The study will also include a control group of young adults who
      were in hospital due to other medical conditions. The identification of relevant cases will
      be based on medical records of several children's hospitals. These records will be analysed
      with regard to potential predictors of developmental hazards and protective factors.
