    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ipilimumab works in treating patients with human
      papilloma virus (HPV)-related cervical cancer that has come back or that has spread to other
      areas of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can find tumor cells and help
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of ipilimumab in eligible patients with recurrent or metastatic
      cervical cancer.

      II. To assess the antitumor activity of ipilimumab in eligible patients with recurrent or
      metastatic cervical cancer via assessment of objective response rates (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of ipilimumab through secondary endpoints including of
      disease stabilization and progression free survival (PFS).

      II. Assessment of antitumor activity of ipilimumab using immune-related response criteria
      (irRC) III. Assessment of the predictive value of baseline C-reactive protein. IV. Assess the
      biologic responses of exposure to ipilimumab via correlative studies involving analysis of
      lymphocyte subsets and assessment of cervical cancer-antigen specific T cells anti-tumor
      response.

      V. Evaluation of archival tissue with regard to markers of immune population in correlation
      with clinical stage and response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving objective response or stable disease continue to receive maintenance therapy
      comprising ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 12 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

Immune-Related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions is measured and captured as the SPD baseline. At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions and of new measurable lesions are added together to provide the Immune Response Sum of Product Diameters (irSPD). A decrease, relative to baseline of the irSPD compared to the previous SPD baseline, of 50% or greater is considered an immune Partial Response (irPR). irStable Disease (irSD): does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of progressive disease.</description>
