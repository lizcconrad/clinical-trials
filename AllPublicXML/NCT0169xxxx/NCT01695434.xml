    <textblock>
      To explore whether treatment with glatiramer acetate (GA) may decrease iron deposition in
      subcortical deep GM, as detected by SWI-filtered phase imaging, in patients with RRMS over 24
      months and compared to a reference population of healthy controls.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, single-blinded, longitudinal, 24-month MRI study of the
      evolution of iron deposits, as evidenced by SWI-filtered phase imaging, in RRMS patients
      treated with GA and in healthy controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MS patients diagnosed with clinically definite MS according to the McDonald criteria
             (Polman et al., 2005)

          -  Being on GA monotherapy (20mg/day sc) for at least 24 months prior to the 24-month MRI
             scan

          -  Having baseline clinical MRI scan that included SWI-filtered phase imaging in a
             12-month window from the start day of the of the GA (MS patients)

          -  Having baseline clinical MRI scan that included SWI-filtered phase imaging (healthy
             controls)

          -  MS patients having a RR disease course (Lublin and Reingold, 1996)

          -  Age 18-65 (healthy controls will be matched to MS patients for age and sex)

          -  Signed informed consent at the 24-month follow-up

          -  Pass MRI health screening

          -  MS patients passing contrast screening

          -  MS patients having normal kidney function (creatinine clearance &gt;59)

          -  None of the exclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had a relapse within 30 days prior to MRI baseline scan date

          -  Patients who received steroid treatment within 30 days prior to the MRI baseline scan
             date

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating or of childbearing age who do not consent to
             approved contraceptive use during the study

          -  MS patients who used other imunomodulatory or immunosuppressant treatment other than
             GA during the follow-up (e.g., IFN-Î², mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, cladribine,
             fludarabine, cyclosporine, total body, azathioprine, methotrexate, IVIG, cellcept,
             natalizumab, etc.)
