  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the following hypothesis &quot;De novo resistance to EGFR-TKI in EGFR
      mutation positive patients is related with mutations in EGFR downstream genes&quot;.

      Investigators will prospectively collect genomic DNA and clinical data regarding treatment
      outcomes to EGFR-TKI in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations. Investigators will
      sequence candidate mutations of EGFR downstream genes and analyze c-met gene amplification
      and protein expression in PTEN, HGF, and IGFR. To identify genetic mutations, amplification,
      and protein over expression as predictive markers of treatment outcomes, investigators
      analyzed the association of treatment outcomes with the presence of genetic alteration or
      protein over expression. Investigators will attempt to identify biomarkers that are able to
      predict de novo resistance to EGFR-TKI in EGFR mutated NSCLC.

      Investigators will prospectively enroll patients who match the following criteria:
      pathologically proven unresectable NSCLC, planning to treat with EGFR-TKI, patients with
      activating EGFR mutations, and available tissue sample for DNA extraction.
