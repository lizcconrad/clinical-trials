  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will rigorously evaluate the
      implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a couple-based integrated human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and drug abuse prevention intervention (Connect II) with
      drug-involved male offenders charged with misdemeanors and their primary female sexual
      partners, implemented by frontline providers in Criminal Court, Community Court or probation
      (CCP) sites in NYC, compared to CCP standard treatment of care services (TAU). The primary
      outcomes are to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and increase condom use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and criminal justice involvement are critical
      intersecting public health issues for drug-involved men. Low income, Black and Hispanic men
      especially bear the burden of the HIV epidemic and are over-represented in the U.S. criminal
      justice system. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance data
      suggest that the health disparity in HIV rates is actually increasing for Black men: current
      estimates suggest 1 in 16 Black men in the U.S. will be infected with HIV in their life time.
      These HIV/STI transmission risks are fueled by high rates of poverty, incarceration,
      unemployment, and lack of access to health care and prevention services. The proposed study
      thus targets an underserved population at the epicenter of the epidemic in the U.S.
