  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disruption of spatial orientation is considered the second most common cognitive symptom
      of dementia, affecting nearly all activities of daily living. Research in the field of
      environmental psychology has helped to highlight the influence of the environment on patients
      with Alzheimer's disease or related syndromes. With regard to spatial orientation, it has
      been shown that an environment can provide support for cognitive failures in subjects if that
      particular space is adapted. While numerous studies have focused on the architectural
      environment (hospital, housing facility), none have explored the ability of patients to
      orient themselves in a natural environment such as a garden. Yet, in recent years, such
      gardens, known as healing gardens, have emerged in housing and care facilities, providing
      genuine support for the care management of patients with Alzheimer-type dementia. Various
      works have been published outlining recommendations for their management. However, with
      regard to spatial orientation, none of the available research has explored the basic
      principles on which to rely on in order to organize the elements of outdoor spaces into
      itineraries that promote orientation, according to ZEISEL and TYSON (1999). In the absence of
      such data, these authors recommend relying on five elements, identified by Lynch in his
      landmark book &quot;Image of the City&quot; (1960), that people use to orient themselves and find their
      way. These are &quot; paths &quot;, &quot; edges &quot;, &quot; districts &quot;, &quot; nodes &quot; and &quot; landmarks &quot;. The
      hypothesis to verify is that patients with Alzheimer's disease do not rely on the same
      elements of the garden as non-Alzheimer's subjects in making orientation decisions and to
      mentally picture this environment.
