  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding, not related to portal hypertension, is a
      common disorder in the elderly. Indeed, in 1996, in a French study, the median age of
      patients hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal bleeding was 68. During the same period in
      the studies reported in English the median age was 71. If epidemiological data concerning
      lower gastrointestinal bleeding are rare, the average age of hospitalized patients varies
      from 63 to 77 depending on the study. Due to improvement in endoscopic haemostatic procedures
      and current resuscitation methods, gastrointestinal bleeding prognosis has greatly improved,
      whereas anaemia related to a bleeding episode remains a frequent complication of
      gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients.

      Among elderly patients over 65, the prevalence of anaemia varies from 8 to 44% depending on
      the criteria used and populations studied. The occurrence of a bleeding episode can either
      induce anaemia or exacerbate pre-existing anaemia. Physicians in charge of gastrointestinal
      bleeding are often unaware of anaemic consequences in the elderly patients which can often be
      serious. Various studies have shown that anaemia increases morbidity and mortality rates in
      the elderly. Life expectancy is independently significantly lower for anaemic patients over
      65, than for non-anaemic subjects. Anaemia is also a risk factor for the occurrence of
      cardiovascular and neurological complications, impairment in cognitive function and increased
      risk of falling.

      Iron deficiency and anaemia induced by bleeding episodes in patients over 65 hospitalized for
      upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be corrected rapidly and effectively.
      Currently, the cost and risks of infection or cardiovascular-related complications of
      transfusions lead to limiting red blood cell transfusion with a goal average of 9 g/dL
      haemoglobin. It is also necessary to develop alternatives to massive transfusions. The
      correction of iron deficiency promotes erythropoiesis and can quickly correct anaemia.

      In clinical practice, the effectiveness of iron intake by the oral route is limited by the
      frequent occurrence of significant gastrointestinal side effects that limit patient
      compliance and limited absorption necessitating prolonged treatment to correct iron
      deficiency.

      The black colour of stools caused by taking oral iron supplements also makes it difficult to
      detect a possible recurrence of bleeding after hospitalization.

      The prescription of intravenous iron seems more suitable for a rapid and complete correction
      of iron deficiency after gastrointestinal bleeding. The main objective of our study is to
      evaluate efficacy of intravenous iron for the correction of anaemia, measured by haemoglobin
      at week 6 (W6) in patients aged over 65, after gastrointestinal bleeding. Secondary
      objectives were to assess the speed of anaemia correction, the tolerance of intravenous iron
      supplementation, the rate of re-hospitalization within 6 months after discharge and patients
      quality of life. This is a prospective multicenter randomized study versus placebo. After
      obtaining informed consent, all patients aged over 65 admitted with upper or lower
      gastrointestinal bleeding, with successful outcome, not related to portal hypertension,
      responsible for persistent anaemia (definition: Hb &lt; 11 g / dL) after hospitalization will be
      included in the study. Patients will be treated for their bleeding event in the usual manner
      of each centre with target for transfusion of 9 g / dL haemoglobin. The absence of external
      bleeding and haematocrit and/or constant haemoglobin levels will be considered as the end of
      bleeding.

      Day 1 was arbitrarily defined as the day the patient left hospital. The protocol at Day - 1
      included: obtaining informed consent of the patient, determination of iron and ferritin blood
      levels and complete blood count. and randomization intravenous iron injection , (Ferinject)
      versus Placebo. Intravenous iron injection will be performed at Day 0. A complete blood count
      will be performed at week 6 and month 6. Patients will be reviewed in consultation at week 6
      and at month 6 to obtain related intercurrent events and assess their quality of life.

      The results of this study could lead to changes in the care of older patients hospitalized
      for gastrointestinal bleeding.
