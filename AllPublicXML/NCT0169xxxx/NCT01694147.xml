  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the possible mechanisms of pulmonary and systemic permeability change
      including cytokine, extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), and oxygenation parameters in
      patients with sepsis related acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS).

      This investigation is a prospective control study. Informed consents will be obtained from
      all patients or their surrogates prior to the procedure of EVLWI measurement and blood
      sampling for molecular measurement including cytokines.

      From July 2011 to June 2014, consecutive septic patients with ARDS in intensive care units
      (ICUs) will be enrolled at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a university-affiliated hospital in
      Taiwan. EVLWI will be measured by PiCCO monitoring system. Serum cytokine such as
      endothelin-1, TNF-alfa, IL-6, Tie-1, Tie-2, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2,VEGF and
      thrombomodulin will be measured.

    <description>The EVLW measurement will be based on transpulmonary thermodilution method. This method was recently introduced as part of the PiCCO plus system (Pulsion Medical System, Munich, Germany), for monitoring severe sepsis patients being treated in medical ICUs. This method only used a single indicator (cold saline solution), and demonstrated a satisfactory correlation with the gravimetric method. A 4-F arterial catheter (PulsiocathPV2014L16; Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) was positioned in the descending aorta via the femoral artery using the Seldinger technique. The femoral arterial catheter and a standard central venous catheter were connected to pressure transducers, and also to an integrated bedside monitor (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems).</description>

      To measure the relationship between endothelial injury (serum TM, vWF, VEGF, TIE-2 increase
      and imbalance of ANG-1/ANG-2) and vascular permeability and EVLWI in patients, 20ml
      peripheral blood will be sampling retented on day 1 and day 3 after including.
