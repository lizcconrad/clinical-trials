  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tertiary Health Research Intervention Via Email (THRIVE; Kypri et al., 2009), originally
      utilized with Australian students, is unique in that it contains efficacious components
      derived from motivational interviewing (e.g., personalized feedback) and cognitive behavioral
      therapy (protective behavioral strategies), yet is very brief and has established efficacy.
      This study aims to test versions of THRIVE tailored to American college students. In addition
      to replicating original results with THRIVE, we will also test versions containing unique
      subsets of protective behavioral strategies to reduce alcohol consumption. The primary
      hypothesis is that versions of THRIVE will be associated with lower overall alcohol
      consumption than an assessment and brief brochure control condition.
