  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this trial is that the test drug (Enoxalow® - T) pharmacodynamics
      parameters are similar to the comparator drug (Clexane® - C) in healthy subjects following
      administration of single intravenous dose. The objective of this randomized, crossover,
      clinical trial is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic profile of the test drug Enoxalow® - T
      produced by Blau Farmacêutica, compared to the comparator drug Clexane®, produced by
      Sanofi-Aventis, by determining pharmacodynamic activities (including anti FXa and anti-FIIa),
      as surrogate markers for their circulating concentrations of the drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition other pharmacodynamic tests such as Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI)
      activity, as well as the ratio of anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activity will be compared as
      secundary obectives.
