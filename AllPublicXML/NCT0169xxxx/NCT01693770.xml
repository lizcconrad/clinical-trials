  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) has demonstrated to be effective for
      pain control through thermally-induced cell death and periosteal denervation caused by
      cortical heating relative to acoustic energy absorption. There is also evidence that a high
      intensity focused ultrasound beam can penetrate through the cortical bone to the medullary
      space, producing thermal necrosis of cancer tissue. However, little is known about the
      potential effects of MRgFUS as first line therapeutic modality for pain palliation in
      skeletal metastases.

      Our hypothesis sought to assess the clinical performance of MRgFUS primary treatment of
      painful bone metastases and determine the potential of this technique for local tumor
      control.

      Unlike previous studies, in which patients were enrolled for MRgFUS treatment because of the
      failure of other therapies, our study will be conducted in patients not previously treated
      with EBRT to the targeted lesion.

      This is an important new feature, especially given the advantages of MRgFUS, such as lack of
      ionizing radiation, the ability to conduct treatment on an outpatient basis and the
      possibility to repeat the treatment as necessary.

    <description>High intensity focused ultrasound energy, delivered under the guidance of the MR images (MgFUS) allows for a predefined amount of energy to be delivered in the desired target (Metastasis). Bone readily absorbs focused ultrasound energy resulting in a thermo-related neurolysis of the periostium with consequent pain palliation. The amount of energy delivered can be modulated with the objective to penetrate cortical space and obtain necrosis of the metastasis thus preventing local recurrence.</description>
