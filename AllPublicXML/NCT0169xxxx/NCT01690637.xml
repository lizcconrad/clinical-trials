  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that will be
      conducted in tertiary care pediatric hospitals in El Salvador and Panama. The primary purpose
      of this study is to determine whether empiric oseltamivir phosphate treatment given at the
      time of hospital admission to children less than 10 years of age hospitalized with influenza
      can effectively reduce their illness severity. Additional objectives are to: 1) evaluate the
      tolerability of oseltamivir phosphate treatment, 2) evaluate the effect of oseltamivir
      treatment on viral clearance and development of oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus during
      and after treatment in children hospitalized with influenza, 3) estimate the direct and
      indirect costs of all-cause respiratory illness and influenza-associated respiratory illness
      requiring hospitalization, and 4) evaluate the effect of empiric oseltamivir treatment during
      the influenza season on these costs.

      The primary study hypothesis is that children with laboratory-confirmed influenza receiving
      empiric oseltamivir phosphate treatment initiated at the time of hospital admission will have
      a shorter duration of hospitalization and a shorter time to resolution of signs of severe
      respiratory illness compared to children receiving placebo. The secondary study hypotheses
      are that children with laboratory-confirmed influenza receiving oseltamivir phosphate
      treatment will have a reduction in the time to non-detectable influenza virus and influenza
      viral RNA and children with all-cause respiratory illness receiving oseltamivir phosphate
      will not be more likely to experience severe adverse events than children receiving placebo.
