      The purpose of this study is to assess the determinants of immunologic variance within the
      general healthy population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Susceptibility to infections, disease severity, and response to medical therapies and
      vaccines are highly variable from one individual to another. While the question of variance
      in human populations continues to be a focal point of scientific research, medical practices
      and public health policies typically take a 'one size fits all' model to disease management
      and drug development.

      Individual heterogeneity in the immune response can have an enormous impact on the likelihood
      to respond to therapy or the development of side effects secondary to vaccine administration.
      Because of the complexity of immune responses in the individual and within the population, it
      has not been possible thus far to define the parameters (genetic or environmental) that
      constitute a healthy immune system and its natural occurring variability.

      Efforts to restore the 'personal' in medical care are the current challenge, and the driving
      vision of the project, to which the current study belongs.

      In order to realize the promise of personalized medicine, an in-depth understanding of the
      determinants of heterogeneity in host response to stress is required.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects considered as healthy by the investigator based on medical history, clinical
             examination, laboratory results and ECG (blood sampling for laboratory assessments and
             ECG should be done at V0 and only after signed informed consent).

          2. Subjects who, according to the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements
             of the protocol and are available for all scheduled visits at the investigational
             site.

          3. Healthy male or female aged between 20 and 69 (included) years

          4. Metropolitan French origin for 3 generations 5)18.5 ≤BMI ≤ 32 kg/m² (Appendix 18.6)

        6)Ability to give their informed consent in writing 7)Must understand spoken and written
        French 8)Affiliated to the French social security or assimilated regimens 9)Registered on
        the French &quot;Fichier des Volontaires se prêtant à la Recherche Biomédicale (VRB)&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who can not participate according to their status on the registry mentioned
             at Art L. 1121-16 of the French Public Health Code

          2. Participation in another clinical study in the last 3 months in which the subject has
             been exposed to an investigational product (pharmaceutical product or placebo or
             medical device) or concurrent participation in another clinical study during the study
             period
