  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study of
      mepolizumab in comparison with placebo in reducing Oral Corticosteroid (OCS) use in subjects
      with severe refractory asthma. The study consists of four phases, OCS Optimisation Phase
      (Week -8 to Week 0), and the double-blind treatment period divided into an Induction Phase
      (Week 0 to Week 4), OCS Reduction Phase (Week 5 upto Week 20) followed by Maintenance Phase
      (Week 20 to Week 24). During the Optimisation Phase the investigator will adjust the OCS
      (prednisone/prednisolone) dose according to the Optimisation titration schedule based on a
      review of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-5 score and exacerbation. In the Induction Phase
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 (approximately 60 per arm) to receive either mepolizumab (100
      mg) administered subcutaneously (SC) or placebo every 4 weeks in addition to their existing
      maintenance asthma therapy with the lowest dose of OCS from Optimisation Phase. The Induction
      Phase will allow sufficient time for those subjects randomised to the mepolizumab arm to
      achieve a decrease in the eosinophilic inflammation prior to the reduction in OCS. During the
      Reduction Phase, subjects will continue receiving 100 mg mepolizumab/placebo every 4 weeks
      and the OCS dose reduction will be done every 4 weeks using the reduction titration schedule
      based on a review of eDiary parameters recorded by the subject, the subjects' exacerbation
      history, and a review of the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. In the Maintenance
      Phase subjects will be maintained without any further OCS dose adjustment. Subjects who
      complete the 24 week double-blind period and meet the eligibility criteria, will be offered
      the opportunity to participate in an open label extension (OLE) study otherwise they will
      return for a Follow-up Visit 12 weeks after their last dose of double blind study treatment.
      At each clinic visit, adverse events, safety labs, spirometery parameters and exacerbations
      will be assessed. The pharmacokinetic samples will be collected in the beginning of the
      treatment, prior to last dose, at the end of study (exit visit) and the follow up.

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Percent Reduction From Baseline in Oral Corticosteroid (OCS) Dose During Weeks 20 to 24 While Maintaining Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 20 to 24</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline (BL) dose was the prescribed optimized prednisone/prednisolone dose following the OCS Optimization Phase. Maintenance (MN) dose was the mean of all daily prednisone/prednisolone doses during the MN Phase (weeks 20 to 24). The percent reduction of OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24 compared to BL dose was calculated as: 100 x (BL dose minus MN dose)/BL dose. Asthma control between weeks 20 and 24 was defined as no clinically significant exacerbation (worsening of asthma that required use of systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits) during this period. The percent reduction of OCS was categorized as: 90 to 100%; 75 to &lt;90%; 50 to &lt;75%; &gt;0 to &lt;50%; no decrease in prednisone dose, or lack of asthma control, or withdrawal (WD) from treatment. Analysis was performed using a proportional odds model with terms for treatment group, region, duration of OCS use at BL (&lt;5 years vs. &gt;=5 years) and BL OCS dose.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved a Reduction of &gt;=50% in Their Daily Oral Corticosteroid (OCS) Dose Compared With Baseline Dose, During Weeks 20 to 24 While Maintaining Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 20 to 24</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline (BL) dose was the prescribed optimized prednisone/prednisolone dose following the OCS Optimization Phase. Maintenance (MN) dose was the mean of all daily prednisone/prednisolone doses during the MN Phase (weeks 20 to 24). The percent reduction of OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24 compared to BL dose was calculated as: 100 x (BL dose minus MN dose)/BL dose. Asthma control between weeks 20 and 24 was defined as no clinically significant exacerbation (worsening of asthma that required use of systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits) during this period. Analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model with terms for treatment group, region, duration of OCS use at BL (&lt;5 years vs. &gt;=5 years) and BL OCS dose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved a Reduction of Their Daily OCS Dose to &lt;=5.0 mg During Weeks 20 to 24 While Maintaining Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 20 to 24</time_frame>
    <description>Maintenance (MN) dose was the mean of all daily prednisone/prednisolone doses during the MN Phase (weeks 20 to 24). Asthma control between weeks 20 and 24 was defined as no clinically significant exacerbation (worsening of asthma that required use of systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits) during this period. Number of participants who achieved a reduction of their daily OCS dose to &lt;=5.0 mg was based on the value of the MN dose. Analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model with terms for treatment group, region, duration of OCS use at BL (&lt;5 years vs. &gt;=5 years) and BL OCS dose.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved a Total Reduction of OCS Dose During Weeks 20 to 24 While Maintaining Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 20 to 24</time_frame>
    <description>MN dose was the mean of all daily prednisone/prednisolone doses during the MN Phase (weeks 20 to 24). Asthma control between weeks 20 and 24 was defined as no clinically significant exacerbation (worsening of asthma that required use of systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits) during this period. The number of participants who achieved a total reduction of OCS dose was based on the value of the MN dose. Total reduction implied no OCS use during the entire MN phase. Analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model with terms for treatment group, region, duration of OCS use at BL (&lt;5 years vs. &gt;=5 years) and BL OCS dose.</description>

    <measure>Median Percentage Change From Baseline in Daily OCS Dose During Weeks 20 to 24 While Maintaining Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 20 to 24</time_frame>
    <description>BL dose was the prescribed optimized prednisone/prednisolone dose following the OCS Optimization Phase. MN dose was the mean of all daily prednisone/prednisolone doses during the MN Phase (weeks 20 to 24). The percent change of OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24 compared to BL dose was calculated as: 100 x (MN dose minus BL dose)/BL dose. Asthma control between weeks 20 and 24 was defined as no clinically significant exacerbation (worsening of asthma that required use of systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits) during this period. For participants who withdrew from the study prior to the Maintenance Phase, and for participants with a lack of asthma control during the Maintenance Phase, a value equal to the minimum percent reduction in OCS use across all subjects was imputed for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Percent Reduction From Baseline in Oral Corticosteroid (OCS) Dose During Weeks 20 to 24 While Maintaining Asthma Control</title>
        <description>Baseline (BL) dose was the prescribed optimized prednisone/prednisolone dose following the OCS Optimization Phase. Maintenance (MN) dose was the mean of all daily prednisone/prednisolone doses during the MN Phase (weeks 20 to 24). The percent reduction of OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24 compared to BL dose was calculated as: 100 x (BL dose minus MN dose)/BL dose. Asthma control between weeks 20 and 24 was defined as no clinically significant exacerbation (worsening of asthma that required use of systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits) during this period. The percent reduction of OCS was categorized as: 90 to 100%; 75 to &lt;90%; 50 to &lt;75%; &gt;0 to &lt;50%; no decrease in prednisone dose, or lack of asthma control, or withdrawal (WD) from treatment. Analysis was performed using a proportional odds model with terms for treatment group, region, duration of OCS use at BL (&lt;5 years vs. &gt;=5 years) and BL OCS dose.</description>

Number of participants who achieved a reduction of their daily OCS dose to &lt;=5.0 mg was based on the value of the MN dose. Analysis was performed using a binary logistic regression model with terms for treatment group, region, duration of OCS use at BL (&lt;5 years vs. &gt;=5 years) and BL OCS dose.</description>

        <description>BL dose was the prescribed optimized prednisone/prednisolone dose following the OCS Optimization Phase. MN dose was the mean of all daily prednisone/prednisolone doses during the MN Phase (weeks 20 to 24). The percent change of OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24 compared to BL dose was calculated as: 100 x (MN dose minus BL dose)/BL dose. Asthma control between weeks 20 and 24 was defined as no clinically significant exacerbation (worsening of asthma that required use of systemic corticosteroids or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits) during this period. For participants who withdrew from the study prior to the Maintenance Phase, and for participants with a lack of asthma control during the Maintenance Phase, a value equal to the minimum percent reduction in OCS use across all subjects was imputed for the analysis.</description>
