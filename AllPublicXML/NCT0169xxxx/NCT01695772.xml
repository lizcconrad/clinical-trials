  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm, multicenter study evaluated the resection rate in participants
      with colorectal cancer and previously untreated unresectable liver-only metastases after
      adding bevacizumab to 5-FU based doublet chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.
      Participants receive standard 5-FU based chemotherapy plus Avastin bevacizumab 5 milligrams
      per kilogram (mg/kg) every 2 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles combined pre- and
      postoperatively, unless they experienced progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>R0 resection was defined as complete resection confirmed by pathology after pre-operative chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Participants with R0 resections based on assessments performed at time of surgery, 48 hours post-surgery and 4 and 12 weeks after surgery were reported.</description>

    <time_frame>At time of surgery (up to 28 weeks), 48 hours post-surgery and 4 and 12 weeks after surgery (up to 40 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>R1 resection was defined as achievement of incomplete tumor resection with microscopic involvement of a margin after pre-operative chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, as confirmed by pathology. Participants with R1 resections based on assessments performed at time of surgery, 48 hours post-surgery and 4 and 12 weeks after surgery were reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening until disease progression or death until data cutoff on 12 May 2016 (up to approximately 3.5 years overall)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved either Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. This is defined as the best response recorded from the start of trial treatment until disease progression (or death). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to [â‰¥] 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening until disease progression or death until data cutoff on 12 May 2016 (up to approximately 3.5 years overall)</time_frame>
    <description>According to RECIST v1.1 Progressive Disease is defined as a 20 % or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions (target lesions) taking as reference the smallest lesion diameter recorded since the treatment started or appearance of one or more new non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening until disease progression or death until data cutoff on 12 May 2016 (up to approximately 3.5 years overall)</time_frame>
    <description>Progressive Disease is defined as a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions (target lesions) taking as reference the smallest lesion diameter recorded since the treatment started or appearance of one or more new non-target lesions. PFS was defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to disease progression, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 criterion, or relapse after resection of liver metastases or death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to display PFS.</description>

    <description>Progressive Disease is defined as a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions (target lesions) taking as reference the smallest lesion diameter recorded since the treatment started or appearance of one or more new non-target lesions. PFS was defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to disease progression, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 criterion, or relapse after resection of liver metastases or death from any cause.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response</title>
        <description>Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved either Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. This is defined as the best response recorded from the start of trial treatment until disease progression (or death). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to [â‰¥] 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>
