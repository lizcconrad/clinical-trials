  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the long-term safety and exploratory efficacy of
      NEUROSTEM®-AD, administered via an open brain surgery to subjects with dementia of the
      Alzheimer's type, who were eligible for and enrolled in the earlier part of the phase I.
      Aside from the subjects who completed the earlier part of the Phase I, 3 additional subjects
      with comparable demographics and disease characteristics as the treatment group will be
      enrolled into a control group, followed-up for 3 months, and compared for various disease
      progression indicators with the treatment group.

      The hypothesis is that NEUROSTEM®-AD is safe and effective in the treatment of dementia of
      the Alzheimer's type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow up study of the earlier part of the phase I, during which the safe
      and effective dose(safety) of NEUROSTEM®-AD was determined for implantation into the brains
      of subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's
      type, who signed the informed consent form and meet the eligibility criteria, were implanted
      with a single dose of NEUROSTEM®-AD, hUBC-MSCs, into the brain. The subjects were
      hospitalized for 5 to 10 days following the surgical implantation and were observed for acute
      adverse events: Gradient echo MRI within the the 24 hours post-op, vital signs, clinical
      laboratory tests, chest x-rays within Day 2. On Day 14, DLT was assessed, and the subjects
      were followed up on the safety and disease progression of dementia (of the Alzheimer's type)
      for 12 weeks post-implantation.

      In this part of the study, the subjects described above will be followed-up for upto Month
      24, and 3 additional subjects with comparable demographics and disease characteristics as the
      treatment group (refer to Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be enrolled as a control group,
      followed up for 3 months and compared with the treatment group for various indicators of the
      disease progression.

    <description>A group of subjects with comparable demographics (age and gender) and disease characteristics [Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB)] as the NEUROSTEM®-AD-treated group, but did not receive the treatment with NEUROSTEM®-AD and were continued on conventional therapy. Restrictions in the concurrent use of drug therapy are as follows:
Patients are, in principle, permitted to continue the drug therapy they were on prior to the enrollment, for the treatment of concurrent illnesses other than Dementia, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia.
For drugs used in the treatment of dementia, behavior-modifying drugs can be added to the pharmacological regimen of a subject during the course of the study. However, adding a new cognitive enhancer, such as donepezil, memantine, galantamine, rivastigmine, is not permitted while dose adjustment is permitted given that the drug had been in use prior to the initiation of the study.</description>
