          <description>Participants with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) received rituximab (RTX) at a dose of 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 and pinatuzumab vedotin at a dose of 2.4 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) administered via IV infusion on Day 2 for the first 2 cycles. RTX and pinatuzumab were administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cycles beginning with the third cycle, in the absence of any infusion-related adverse events. Participants who developed disease progression (PD) were treated with RTX at 375 mg/m^2 and polatuzumab vedotin at 2.4 mg/kg via IV infusion on Day 1, beginning no later than 42 days after the last dose of the prior study treatment until a second PD event, clinical deterioration, and/or intolerance to the crossover treatment for up to a maximum of 1 year (maximum 17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response (OR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as Determined by Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL: Rituximab Containing Regimens (Arms A and B, Cohort C)</title>
        <description>Tumor response was evaluated according to modified response and progression criteria for NHL published by Cheson et al (2007 and 2014) and confirmed by repeat assessments greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 4 weeks after initial documentation. CR was defined as disappearance of all clinical/radiographic evidence of disease, regression of lymph nodes to normal size, absence of splenomegaly, and absence of bone marrow involvement. PR was defined as &gt;/=50 percent (%) decrease in sum of the products of greatest diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant lymph nodes, no increase in size of other nodes, liver, or spleen volume, a &gt;/=50% decrease in SPD of hepatic and splenic nodules, absence of other organ involvement, and no new sites of disease. Participants with insufficient data to determine response were classified as non-responders.</description>

        <description>Participants provided blood samples for evaluation of ADA. The number of participants with positive results for ADA against pinatuzumab vedotin at Baseline and at any of the post-baseline assessment time-points (overall 1.5 years) was reported.

        <description>Tumor response was evaluated according to modified response and progression criteria for NHL published by Cheson et al (2007 and 2014) and confirmed by repeat assessments &gt;/=4 weeks after initial documentation. PD was defined as appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis, at least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD or longest diameter of any previous lesion or node. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. In absence of PD or death, PFS was censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Participants with no post-baseline tumor assessment were censored on the date of randomization or date of enrollment. The median PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the 95% CI for median was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With OR at EOT Based on PET/CT Assessment as Determined by the Investigator Per Lugano 2014 Response Criteria: Obinutuzumab-Containing Cohorts (Cohorts E, G, and H)</title>
        <description>Tumor response assessment was performed by investigator according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan. OR was defined as a response of CR or PR. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake &lt;/=mediastinum), or 3 (uptake &lt;mediastinum but &lt;/=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow; and normal/IHC-negative bone marrow morphology. PR was defined as a score 4 (uptake moderately &gt;liver) or 5 (uptake markedly &gt;liver and/or new lesions) with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size on PET 5-PS for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; and reduced residual uptake in bone marrow compared with baseline. 90% CI for percentage of responders was calculated using Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With OR at EOT Based on CT Assessment Alone as Determined by Investigator Per Lugano 2014 Response Criteria: Obinutuzumab-Containing Cohorts (Cohorts E + H and E + G)</title>
        <description>Tumor response assessment was performed by investigator according to modified Lugano classification using CT scan. OR was defined as a response of CR or PR. CR was defined as reduction of LDi of target nodes/nodal masses to &lt;/=1.5 cm, no extralymphatic sites of disease, absence of non-measured lesions and new lesions, reduction of enlarged organs to normal, and normal/IHC-negative bone marrow morphology. PR was defined as &gt;/=50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extra-nodal sites; absence/reduction/no increase in size of non-measured lesions; reduction in length of spleen by at least &gt;50% beyond normal; and no new lesions. 90% CI for percentage of responders was calculated using Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
