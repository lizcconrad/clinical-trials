    <textblock>
      Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in 5,000 people. The purpose of this
      study is to provide data regarding the diet and nosebleed frequency using a questionnaire.

      This will be filled in by people with HHT.

      The questionnaire has been designed in paper format.

    <textblock>
      Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in 5,000 people, usually causing
      nosebleeds, skin blood spots, and/or anaemia as a result of bleeding from the nose or gut.
      The majority of people with HHT also have abnormal blood vessels (arteriovenous
      malformations) in internal organs such as the lungs, liver and brain. Management of this
      multisystem disorder is highly challenging.

      The Lead Applicant has spent 20 years working on this rare disease, and identified multiple
      areas where more evidence is required to assist clinicians and patients with this lifelong
      condition. A particular issue is whether the diet influences HHT or its complications in any
      way.

      In this study, people will fill in two questionnaires, one giving details of their diet, and
      another details of their nosebleeds. They will also be asked to consider participating in an
      accessory study arm which includes weighing food for one week and providing a food diary, in
      addition to having a single set of blood test.

    <description>The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) food frequency questionnaire is used to quantify dietary intake. This method has been validated against the gold standard for dietary assessment, a 7-day weighed food diary. Questions are asked about consumption of 130 major food items over the previous year, requiring participants to indicate the frequency of consumption, and to provide details about the methods of cooking, type of produce, and use of dietary supplements. The EPIC FFQ has been widely validated in a number of studies and is deemed an adequate assessment tool to assess dietary intake.</description>

    <measure>Nosebleed severity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nosebleeds were quantified using the validated Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS). The six questions provide an objective measure of nosebleeds: three relate to different characteristics of typical nosebleeds within the previous three months (frequency, duration and intensity (gushing/pouring or not)), three to medical attention, anemia and transfusion requirements</description>
