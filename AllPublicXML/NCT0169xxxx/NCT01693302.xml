  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes tend to peak after eating a meal due to
      the delayed action of insulin when compared to carbohydrate absorption from food. It is the
      hypothesis of the investigator that administering the insulin for a meal 20 minutes before
      the meal will result in lower blood glucose peaks compared to administration of insulin
      immediately before or 20 minutes after starting to eat.

      All subjects will eat the same meal on three different occasions. Insulin will be
      administered at one of the three times at each visit.

      Subjects enrolled in this study will be between the ages of 12 and 30 years inclusive. All
      subjects will be on an insulin pump and use carbohydrate counting as their method for insulin
      dosing at a meal.

      Subjects in this study will complete three study visits lasting from approximately 8:30am
      until 1:30pm. At each visit, the subject will eat the same frozen breakfast meal. Subjects
      will be supplied with the same insulin to maintain consistency between visits and between
      subjects.

      Insulin will be administered at different times, depending upon the randomization group
      assigned to the participant. The three different times the insulin will be given is either 20
      minutes before the meal, immediately before the meal and 20 minutes after the meal. All
      subjects will complete all three insulin bolus times. Blood glucose will be measured by
      fingerstick every 30 minutes until the completion of the visit.
