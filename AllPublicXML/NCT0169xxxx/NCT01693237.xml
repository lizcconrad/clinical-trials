    <textblock>
      The current trial aims to investigate the impact of continuous feedback on dropout and
      outcome in group therapy. The hypothesis is that continuous feedback to patient and therapist
      on treatment progress and alliance will 1) increase adherence and 2) increase treatment
      outcome.

      Background: In the psychotherapy of eating disorders, a dropout rate between 30% and 50% is
      reported internationally. The fact that up to half of the patients drop out of treatment
      calls for ways to improve it. Research shows that feedback to patient and therapist increases
      outcome and reduces the number of dropouts; however there is only three published works on
      the effect of feedback in eating disorders treatment. Therefore, the present trial, at the
      eating disorders unit at Stolpegaard Psychotherapy Centre, Gentofte, Denmark, may contribute
      to necessary improvements in the field.

      Objective: The current trial, which will be conducted from August 2012 to August 2014, aims
      to investigate the impact of continuous feedback on adherence and outcome in group
      psychotherapy. The hypothesis is that continuous feedback to patient and therapist on
      treatment progress and alliance will 1)increase adherence 2) increase treatment outcome.

      Method: The trial is set up in a randomized design with 159 patients allocated to a)
      treatment with feedback intervention or b) treatment as usual.

      Participants: The participants are diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder or
      Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.

      Interventions: In the experimental group, two sets of feedback measures are added to the
      standard treatment: Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and Group Session Rating Scale (GSRS). The ORS
      assesses areas of life functioning known to change as a result of therapeutic intervention.
      The GSRS assesses key dimensions of effective therapeutic relationships.
