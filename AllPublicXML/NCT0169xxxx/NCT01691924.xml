  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No clinical trials with PBF-509 in humans have been performed to date. Only preclinical
      studies have been done to assess the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, the safety and the
      toxicological profile of the PBF-509.

      An initial testing of PBF-509 in humans is planned, starting with the first-into-man clinical
      trial where a single oral, dose-escalating, and placebo-controlled design will be
      implemented.
