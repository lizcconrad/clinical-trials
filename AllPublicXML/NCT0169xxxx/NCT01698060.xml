    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of ND1.1, an adjuvanted
      adenoviral-based avian influenza vaccine, when delivery is targeted to the ileum, using a
      radio controlled capsule. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immune response
      (cellular and humoral) of two doses of ND1.1 oral vaccine.
