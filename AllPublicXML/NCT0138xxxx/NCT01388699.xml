    <textblock>
      Recently, there is evidence that endothelial activation and dysfunction are associated with
      migraine, especially in female migraineurs with aura. Our objectives were to determine
      whether novel endothelial function markers are altered in female migraineurs with aura
      compared to age-matched controls.

      Our objectives were to determine whether novel endothelial function methods and novel markers
      of endothelial activation are associated with migraine in female migraineurs with aura.

      Migraine is an independent risk factor for stroke, especially in young women with aura
      symptoms. Endothelial dysfunction is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Recent
      studies suggest that there is a link between migraine with aura and endothelial activation,
      dysfunction and impaired vascular reactivity.

      In this case-control study the investigators examine several novel biomarkers of endothelial
      function such as endothelial progenitor cells and endothelial microparticles as well as novel
      methods such as reactive hyperemic peripheral arterial tonometry in female migraineurs with
      aura and age-matched controls.
