  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is scant data on the casemix and practices in Indian intensive care units (ICUs). Most
      of the available data comes from single centre studies. There is a dire need to have data
      from Indian ICUs to reflect the vast spectrum of critical care illness, services and
      practices. INDICAPS planned to collect data of all patients in the ICU on one particular day,
      and four such days spread throughout a one-year period were selected: the second Wednesday of
      July and October this year, i.e. July 14 and October 13, 2010 and the second Wednesday of
      January and April next year, i.e. January 12 and April 13, 2011. As many ICUs all over the
      country as possible were asked to participate. The investigators aimed to gather information
      about ICUs, patients in ICUs, the types and severity of illness, monitoring and therapeutic
      modalities used, types of infections,mortality rates, etc.

      The following information will be analysed:

      Case-mix, severity of illness, prevalence of infection, hemodynamic monitoring and therapy,
      mechanical ventilation practices, nutrition and outcome

        -  Seasonal and regional variations in the above

        -  Epidemiology and variations in antibiotic use

        -  Patterns of microorganisms and outcome

        -  Prevalence and outcome of specific tropical febrile illnesses, including malaria, dengue
           fever, leptospirosis, scrub typhus

        -  Prevalence and outcome of toxins and poisonings

        -  Relation of ICU and hospital organizational issues to prevalence of infection and
           outcome

        -  Organisation of intensive care services

        -  End of life - Ethical decisions
