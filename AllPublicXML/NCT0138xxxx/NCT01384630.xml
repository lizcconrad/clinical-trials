  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 73-day phase II, open label trial of the true human monoclonal antibody RA-18C3 in
      subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ten (10) subjects will receive 200 mg of
      RA-18C3 via subcutaneous injection. Subjects will receive injections at Days 0, 21, and 42
      for a total of 3 injections. Study drug will be administered under close observation in a
      facility equipped to handle medical emergencies. Subjects will not be discharged from the
      facility until at least 1 hour following the end of the injection or 1 hour after their vital
      signs have stabilized. Safety will be assessed by pre- and post-treatment serial measurements
      of vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and the recording of adverse clinical
      events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects 18 years of age or older

          2. Diagnosis of plaque psoriasis for ≥ 6 months; INCLUDING subjects with chronic guttate
             lesions.

          3. Psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI) score of ≥ 12

          4. Involvement of ≥ 5% of body-surface area

          5. For female subjects of childbearing age, a negative urine pregnancy test at screening
             and at specified time points throughout the trial. For subjects with reproductive
             potential, a willingness to utilize adequate, double barrier contraception during the
             study and including 3 months after study completion. Sexually active men must use an
             accepted method of contraception during the study and including 3 months after study
             completion.

             protocol-specific screening procedures are performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with any biologicals or investigational agents within the last 4 weeks (or 5
