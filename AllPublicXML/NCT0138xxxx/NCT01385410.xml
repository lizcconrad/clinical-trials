  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This behavioural support intervention trial will investigate the potential to increase
      exclusive breastfeeding rates in an urban Kenyan community through peer mother support
      delivered either by cell phone or through group meetings. It will follow a cohort of more
      than 800 women attending antenatal care at a large public hospital, and compare indicators of
      breastfeeding and infant and maternal health between groups receiving one or other type of
      peer mother support. The main part of the study will test the primary hypothesis that peer
      group and cell phone based support can both increase rates of EBF at 3 months by 20% relative
      to a control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general objective was to assess whether participation from late pregnancy through to 3
      months postpartum in bi-weekly cell phone based peer support (CPS) or monthly peer-led
      support groups (PSG) can increase adoption and duration of EBF amongst low-income women in
      Kenya served by a nationalized BFHI certified hospital above benchmarks achieved with current
      approaches and standard of care by existing facility-based support (SOC).

      The study aimed to reach the following specific objectives related to message delivery on
      EBF:

      assess the feasibility of two innovative approaches (CPS and PSG) to deliver extended
      postnatal peer support for EBF by women in an urban, low-income country setting; compare the
      effectiveness of these two innovative approaches to existing facility-based support; and
      compare the relative effectiveness of each type of peer support intervention.
