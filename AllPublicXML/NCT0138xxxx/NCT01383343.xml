      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sorafenib tosylate when given
      together with bevacizumab, irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil in
      treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Sorafenib tosylate may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Sorafenib tosylate and bevacizumab may also block tumor growth in different ways by
      targeting certain cells. Giving sorafenib tosylate and bevacizumab together with combination
      chemotherapy may be a better treatment for colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of the combination of irinotecan hydrochloride,
      leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) plus sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) plus
      bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of FOLFIRI plus sorafenib plus bevacizumab. II. To assess the
      feasibility of the proposed combination. III. To evaluate the response rate and identify any
      activity of the proposed combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate followed by a cohort study.
      (Cohort study cancelled as of March 25, 2014)

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1,
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on
      days 1-2, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, and sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) once
      (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 3-6 and 10-13*. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may also receive sorafenib tosylate on days 7 and 14.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 3 months.
