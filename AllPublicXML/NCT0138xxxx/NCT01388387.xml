    <textblock>
      The choice of an immunosuppressant after hepatic transplant is now more difficult than before
      because of the increasing number of drugs available.

      Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenetic information can help to choose the best
      treatment and the best dose for each patient. The genetic polymorphism of enzymes
      metabolizing treatments can affect their efficacy and safety. Concerning tacrolimus, CYP3A5
      activity is a major determinant of the dose needed to reach target concentrations. This study
      is aimed at evaluating the impact of both donor and recipient CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms on
      tacrolimus exposure in patients with hepatic transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacogenetics is a recent tool which could help to choose the best immunosuppressive
      therapy in patients with hepatic transplant. Indeed, the CYP3A5 gene has many polymorphisms
      and one of them, g.6986 A&gt;G, is the major determinant of the variability of expression of
      this protein. The allele *1 (g6986A) leads to normal protein expression while the allele *3
      (g.6986G) causes lack of protein expression, and their different combinations induce a great
      variability in tacrolimus concentrations. As cytochromes are present in the liver and
      intestine, in hepatic transplant, tacrolimus exposure results from both recipient
      (enterocytes) and donor (liver) enzymes. Recent studies demonstrated a significant role of
      the genotype recipient on the dose/concentration relationship and on the dose needed to reach
      target concentrations. However, these studies were insufficient to analyze more precisely all
      impacts of this polymorphism because they did not include enough patients. The purpose of the
      investigators study is to evaluate the impact of donor and recipient CYP3A5 genetic
      polymorphism on tacrolimus exposure in patients with hepatic transplant after the first
      administration of tacrolimus and at 7 days post transplantation, when the dose has been
      adapted to avoid too high blood levels and to limit serious adverse reactions.
