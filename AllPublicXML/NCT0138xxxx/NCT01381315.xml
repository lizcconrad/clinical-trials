  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been hypothesized that the proximity of the anatomic locations of the arm lymphatic
      drainage system to the breast lymphatic system in the axilla put the arm lymphatics at risk
      for disruption during a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary lymph node
      dissection (ALND). Therefore, mapping the drainage of the arm in addition to the drainage of
      the breast during the procedure would potentially decrease the incidence of arm lymphatic
      disruption and subsequent development of lymphedema while providing adequate axillary breast
      nodes needed for staging.

      Patients will receive an injection of 1.0 mCi of technetium-99m sulfur colloid that will be
      injected into the sub-dermal subareolar aspect of the affected breast.

      On the day of surgery, if the radioactive SLN cannot be located using the gamma probe prior
      to incision, lymphazurin or methylene blue dye will be used in the breast in the subareolar
      plexus at the discretion of the surgeon for assistance in identifying the sentinel nodes.
      This contingency, expected to occur &lt; 3% of the time, will be used since locating the SLN for
      staging is of greater importance than the study. If radioactive isotope is sufficient to
      identify the sentinel node draining from the breast, then the blue dye will be injected
      dermally in the upper inner arm along the bicipital groove of the ipsilateral arm in order to
      locate the draining lymphatics from the arm. No more than 5cc of blue dye will be injected in
      any of the above mentioned scenarios. The site of all injections (radioactivity and/or blue
      dye) will be recorded.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to assess and test the lymphedema rates six times at the following intervals: Pre-surgery - baseline, at 6 months, and yearly for 4 years. Since the historical control rates are different (5% for SLNB only and 13% for ALND with or without SLNB) two tests will be performed.</description>

    <description>The one-year lymphedema rate among subjects undergoing axillary lymph node dissection with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy is ≥ 0.13. With our sample size of 58 subjects undergoing ALND, we will reject that hypothesis in favor of the alternative—that the lymphedema rate is &lt;0.13 for subjects undergoing ALND—if lymphedema is confirmed in three or fewer (ie, 0, 1, 2, or 3) subjects.</description>
