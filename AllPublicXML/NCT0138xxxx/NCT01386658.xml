    <textblock>
      HGT-FIR-086 is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study to evaluate the
      Pharmacokinetics, tolerability,safety, and efficacy on reproductive hormones, of a single
      subcutaneous (SC) administration of icatibant in approximately 30 pediatric subjects with
      Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) during an initial acute attack.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study HGT-FIR-086 will enroll 30 subjects from 2 to less than 18 years of age, divided into 2
      groups: prepubertal and pubertal/postpubertal. At least 10 prepubertal children and at least
      20 adolescents (including 10 treated during a HAE attack) must be enrolled in the study.

      After a qualifying screening period, the PK, safety/tolerability, and efficacy of treatment
      with SC icatibant will be evaluated in at least 20 subjects (10 prepubertal and 10
      pubertal/postpubertal subjects) who present with cutaneous, abdominal, or laryngeal symptoms
      of an acute attack of HAE. The PK and safety/tolerability of SC icatibant will be evaluated
      in at least 10 additional pubertal/postpubertal subjects who meet screening criteria and
      receive treatment with SC icatibant in the absence of a current acute HAE attack.

      The planned duration of active participation for subjects who present with an initial attack
      of acute HAE will consist of treatment with a single subcutaneous injection of icatibant on
      Day 1 through follow up at day 90.

      After having received initial treatment with icatibant, either during or in the absence of an
      attack, at least 10 pubertal/postpubertal subjects who subsequently experience an acute HAE
      attack may continue to receive treatment with icatibant as a single SC administration per
      attack for a total of 3 eligible icatibant-treated attacks.

      The period of active participation in the study for prepubertal subjects will be
      approximately 90 days, while that for pubertal/postpubertal subjects could be a maximum of
      approximately 270 or 360 days (3 separate active periods of approximately 90 days for those
      treated with icatibant during an attack; 4 separate active periods for those treated without
      an attack), with each active period separated by periods of inactive participation of
      variable duration.
