  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1120212 is a reversible and highly selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2
      activation and kinase activity currently being developed for the treatment of malignant
      melanoma. This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, single-dose study designed to
      characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of a single
      oral dose of MEK inhibitor [14C]GSK1120212 as a solution in male subjects with solid tumor
      malignancies. A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to complete approximately four
      evaluable subjects. Following completion of the study, subjects may elect to continue dosing
      with GSK1120212 in the rollover study, MEK114375.
