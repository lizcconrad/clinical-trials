      The purpose of this study is to scientifically evaluate the safety, efficacy and cosmetic
      results of transumbilical laparoendoscopic single site cholecystectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the natural orifice during embryonic, the transumbilical surgery not only can mask the
      abdominal scar and avoid infection produced by puncturing stomach, vagina or rectum in
      NOTES,but also can be played by the conventional laparoscopic instruments. TU-LESS
      (transumbilical laparoendoscopic single site surgery), is considered to be the most feasible
      NOTES(natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery)technology at present. Researches about
      TU-LESS mostly are case reports and small samples or the control experiments up to now,there
      are not persuasive randomized controlled trail between TU-LESS and conventional laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. So the investigators design this prospective randomized controlled trail to
      scientifically evaluate the safety, efficacy and cosmetic results of transumbilical
      laparoendoscopic single site cholecystectomy .
