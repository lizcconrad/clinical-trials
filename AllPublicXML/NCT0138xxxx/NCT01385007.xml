  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggression, a common symptom in persons with dementia, is linked with multiple treatable
      etiologies such as pain, depression, caregiver burden, and caregiver relationships. Pain, the
      main predictor of aggression, is a common symptom that is inadequately assessed and treated
      in persons with dementia. The main treatment for aggression is antipsychotic medications that
      are ineffective, costly, and possess considerable adverse side effects. There is a need to
      test psychosocial interventions that address treatable causes of aggression. Preliminary data
      suggest the potential utility of Preventing Aggression in Veterans with Dementia (PAVeD), an
      evidence-based psychoeducational intervention aimed to prevent aggression, with urban
      dwelling Veterans. PAVeD, an in-home intervention that requires significant clinician time
      and expense has yet to be evaluated in a rural culture with Veterans who are in poorer health
      compared to urban Veterans.

      The purpose of this intervention demonstration pilot study is to pilot test and evaluate the
      PAVeD-Telephone intervention. Twenty rural Veterans with dementia and pain and their
      caregivers from the Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) Program will be invited to participate.
      Clinical activities directed toward caregivers are supported by policies and procedures set
      forth by the Veterans Health Administration (Appendix A). Mixed-methods will be used to
      collect data using semi-structured interviews and standardized data collection measures
      suitable for persons with dementia and their caregivers. The interviews go beyond an
      evaluation of the outcomes by exploring how the intervention was experienced by the dyad.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

        1. Describe the feasibility and acceptability of the PAVeD-Telephone intervention (number
           of dyads recruited and completing the study) by rural Veterans and their caregivers.

        2. Describe the preliminary outcomes (aggression, depression, Veteran/caregiver
           relationship quality, pleasant events, caregiver burden, and pain) at baseline, 3 and 6
           months.

        3. Understand the cultural beliefs and practices of this population and the impact of the
           intervention.

      The PAVeD-Telephone intervention is an innovative approach to shift the paradigm of treating
      aggression with antipsychotic medications. This study is consistent with the goals of the
      South Central Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) to improve
      evidence-based practices in rural Veterans and their caregivers. The next step in this
      program of research is to submit a Health Services Research and Development Service (HSR&amp;D)
      application for pilot funding to further develop and test the telephone-based intervention
      and an appropriate control condition.

    <description>PAVeD-Telephone consists of three components: pain-management strategies, improvement of patient-collateral communication skills, and behavioral activation through increased pleasant activity planning. The intervention will be primarily geared toward the caregiver; but patients may be involved in some modules, depending on their dementia severity and willingness. The goal of the sessions is to prevent aggression in veterans with dementia. The sessions will include didactics, skill-building, and discussion. Participants will also be provided a copy of the book, Pain Management for Older Adults: A Self-help Guide, as an additional resource for optional reading on the topics covered in the intervention. The intervention is proposed to include six to eight sessions of weekly treatments, lasting 30 minutes to 45 minutes, specifically developed to address the recognition and management of pain in persons with dementia.</description>
