    <description>The treatment was based on established cognitive behavior therapy methods, as described in self-help books (Hodgins, 2002; Ladouceur &amp; Lachance, 2006). The text was divided into eight modules and was adapted for Internet use. The first four modules had a motivational interviewing focus and included building motivation for change by letting the participant answer open-ended questions that would evoke talk of change. The participants were encouraged to ask for input from their relatives on different aspects of their gambling. In addition, the first four modules included time line follow-back and mapping of the reasons for gambling. The remaining four modules were based on CBT. Each module included information and exercises and ended with three to eight essay-style questions. Feedback on homework assignments was usually given within 24 hr after participants had sent their answers via e-mail. Once weekly, a telephone call was made by the therapists to each participant.</description>
