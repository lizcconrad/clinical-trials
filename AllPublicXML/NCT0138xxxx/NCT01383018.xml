  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational registry is to collect and better understand &quot;real-world&quot;
      outcomes for men undergoing penile implant surgery to treat erectile dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, observational registry to be conducted at multiple sites
      throughout the United States and Canada, to collect &quot;real-world&quot; penile prosthetic outcomes
      according to investigators' standard of care. Using questionnaires as well as electronic data
      collection, investigating physicians will prospectively measure patient responses at regular
      intervals over a one- to five year period. The physician researchers have identified key
      metrics for the study including effectiveness, durability, complications, and patient
      satisfaction; quality of life will also be analyzed, being defined through several validated
      patient surveys.
