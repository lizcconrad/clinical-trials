    <measure>Log-Transformed 28-Day Seizure Rate For All Partial Onset Seizures During Baseline Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline phase (up to 8 weeks prior to treatment phase [Day 1])</time_frame>
    <description>All partial onset seizures experienced during baseline phase were recorded by the participants or their parents/legal guardian, in a daily seizure diary. 28-day seizure rate for all partial onset seizures = ([number of seizures in the baseline phase] divided by [number of days in baseline phase minus {-} number of missing diary days in baseline phase])*28. For log-transformation, the quantity 1 was added to the 28-day seizure rate for all participants to account for any possible &quot;0&quot; seizure incidence. This resulted in final calculation as: log transformed (28-day seizure rate +1).</description>

    <description>CBCL assessed suicidal behavior in children below 6 years. It is 100-item questionnaire completed by parent/legal guardian, based on participant's behavior in past 2 months. All 100 items rated on 3-point scale: 0=not true for that child; 1=sometimes true; 2=very/often true. Total CBCL score ranges from 0 (not true) to 200 (very/often true). Higher scores=higher levels of problematic behaviors or dysfunction. Scores from all items were used to calculate 3 subscale scores: Withdrawn subscale scores, Internalizing problems subscale scores and total problem subscale scores. All subscale scores reported scaled to T Scores. Higher scores for each CBCL subscales indicated higher levels of problematic behaviors or dysfunction. In this study, a cut-off of &gt;=68 on the T-scores was used for all 3 subscales. If a participant T Score was &gt;=68 in any of the sub-scales, the participant was referred for Mental Health Risk Assessment that included assessment of participant continuation to the study.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery (CogState Battery) Scores at Week 12: Detection Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose at Day 1), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CogState battery:computerized test battery used to assess cognitive domains through cognition tests/tasks. The test battery was presented on computer with external response buttons. In this study, Cogstate battery consisted of 2 tasks which measured psychomotor function (detection task) and attention (paediatric identification task). Detection task was a measure of simple reaction time and provided a valid assessment of psychomotor function in participants. In this task, a playing card turning face up was presented in the center of the computer screen. As soon as this happened, the participant was to press the 'Yes' response key. There was no minimum or maximum scores since it was a time-based assessment. The software measured the speed of accurate responses to each event. In this outcome measure, speed of performance of participants (calculated as mean of the logarithmic base 10 transformed reaction times) for correct responses was reported. Lower scores indicated better performance.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS (mapped to C-CASA) is a participant-rated questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. For suicidal ideation and behaviour, data from C-SSRS was mapped to C-CASA codes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7. C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced the following: completed suicide (C-CASA code 1); suicide attempt (response of “Yes” on “actual attempt”) (C-CASA code 2); preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (ISB) (“Yes” on “preparatory acts or behavior”)(C-CASA code 3); suicidal ideation (“Yes” on “wish to be dead”, “non-specific active suicidal thoughts”, “active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent) (C-CASA code 4); any self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent (C-CASA code 7). In this outcome, number of participants with positive response (response of “yes”) to C-SSRS (mapped to C-CASA categories 2, 3, 4 and 7) at baseline were reported.</description>

          <description>The C-SSRS (mapped to C-CASA) is a participant-rated questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. For suicidal ideation and behaviour, data from C-SSRS was mapped to C-CASA codes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7. C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced the following: completed suicide (C-CASA code 1); suicide attempt (response of “Yes” on “actual attempt”) (C-CASA code 2); preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (ISB) (“Yes” on “preparatory acts or behavior”)(C-CASA code 3); suicidal ideation (“Yes” on “wish to be dead”, “non-specific active suicidal thoughts”, “active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent) (C-CASA code 4); any self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent (C-CASA code 7). In this outcome, number of participants with positive response (response of “yes”) to C-SSRS (mapped to C-CASA categories 2, 3, 4 and 7) at baseline were reported.</description>

        <title>Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL): Internalizing Subscale Score in Participants Less Than 6 Years of Age</title>
        <description>CBCL assessed suicidal behavior in children below 6 years. It is 100-item questionnaire completed by parent/legal guardian, based on participant’s behavior in past 2 months. All 100 items rated on 3-point scale: 0=not true for that child; 1=sometimes true; 2=very/often true. Total CBCL score ranges from 0 (not true) to 200 (very/often true). Higher scores=higher levels of problematic behaviors or dysfunction. Scores from all items were used to calculate 3 subscale scores: Withdrawn subscale scores, Internalizing problems subscale scores and total problem subscale scores. All subscale scores reported scaled to T Scores. Higher scores for each CBCL subscales indicated higher levels of problematic behaviors or dysfunction. In this study, a cut-off of &gt;=68 on the T-scores was used for all 3 subscales. If a participant T Score was &gt;=68 in any of the sub-scales, the participant was referred for Mental Health Risk Assessment that included assessment of participant continuation to the study.</description>

        <title>Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL): Withdrawn Subscale Score in Participants Less Than 6 Years of Age</title>
        <description>CBCL assessed suicidal behavior in children below 6 years. It is 100-item questionnaire completed by parent/legal guardian, based on participant’s behavior in past 2 months. All 100 items rated on 3-point scale: 0=not true for that child; 1=sometimes true; 2=very/often true. Total CBCL score ranges from 0 (not true) to 200 (very/often true). Higher scores=higher levels of problematic behaviors or dysfunction. Scores from all items were used to calculate 3 subscale scores: Withdrawn subscale scores, Internalizing problems subscale scores and total problem subscale scores. All subscale scores reported scaled to T Scores. Higher scores for each CBCL subscales indicated higher levels of problematic behaviors or dysfunction. In this study, a cut-off of &gt;=68 on the T-scores was used for all 3 subscales. If a participant T Score was &gt;=68 in any of the sub-scales, the participant was referred for Mental Health Risk Assessment that included assessment of participant continuation to the study</description>

          <title>Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL): Total Problem Subscale Score in Participants Less Than 6 Years of Age</title>
          <description>CBCL assessed suicidal behavior in children below 6 years. It is 100-item questionnaire completed by parent/legal guardian, based on participant’s behavior in past 2 months. All 100 items rated on 3-point scale: 0=not true for that child; 1=sometimes true; 2=very/often true. Total CBCL score ranges from 0 (not true) to 200 (very/often true). Higher scores=higher levels of problematic behaviors or dysfunction. Scores from all items were used to calculate 3 subscale scores: Withdrawn subscale scores, Internalizing problems subscale scores and total problem subscale scores. All subscale scores reported scaled to T Scores. Higher scores for each CBCL subscales indicated higher levels of problematic behaviors or dysfunction. In this study, a cut-off of &gt;=68 on the T-scores was used for all 3 subscales. If a participant T Score was &gt;=68 in any of the sub-scales, the participant was referred for Mental Health Risk Assessment that included assessment of participant continuation to the study</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery (CogState Battery) Scores at Week 12: Detection Task</title>
        <description>CogState battery:computerized test battery used to assess cognitive domains through cognition tests/tasks. The test battery was presented on computer with external response buttons. In this study, Cogstate battery consisted of 2 tasks which measured psychomotor function (detection task) and attention (paediatric identification task). Detection task was a measure of simple reaction time and provided a valid assessment of psychomotor function in participants. In this task, a playing card turning face up was presented in the center of the computer screen. As soon as this happened, the participant was to press the 'Yes' response key. There was no minimum or maximum scores since it was a time-based assessment. The software measured the speed of accurate responses to each event. In this outcome measure, speed of performance of participants (calculated as mean of the logarithmic base 10 transformed reaction times) for correct responses was reported. Lower scores indicated better performance.</description>

The test battery was presented on computer with external response buttons. Paediatric identification task: a measure of choice reaction time and valid assessment of visual attention. In this task, a playing card turning face up was presented in center of the computer screen. As soon as this happened, participant had to decide whether color of card was black or not. If color was black, participants was to press “Yes” response key, otherwise “no”. There was no minimum/maximum scores since it was a time-based assessment. The software measured speed of accurate responses (correct identification of color) to each event. In this outcome measure, speed of performance of participants to correctly identify the color (calculated as mean of the logarithmic base 10 transformed reaction times) for correct responses was reported. Lower scores indicated better performance.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery (CogState Battery) Score at Week 12: Paediatric Identification (Go-No Go: Attention) Tasks</title>
          <description>CogState battery: computerized test battery used to assess cognitive domains through cognition tests/tasks. The test battery was presented on computer with external response buttons. Paediatric identification task: a measure of choice reaction time and valid assessment of visual attention. In this task, a playing card turning face up was presented in center of the computer screen. As soon as this happened, participant had to decide whether color of card was black or not. If color was black, participants was to press “Yes” response key, otherwise “no”. There was no minimum/maximum scores since it was a time-based assessment. The software measured speed of accurate responses (correct identification of color) to each event. In this outcome measure, speed of performance of participants to correctly identify the color (calculated as mean of the logarithmic base 10 transformed reaction times) for correct responses was reported. Lower scores indicated better performance.</description>
