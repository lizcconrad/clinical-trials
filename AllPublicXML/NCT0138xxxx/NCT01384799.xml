  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I dose escalation study of CUDC-101 in combination with concurrent cisplatin
      and radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. CUDC-101 is a
      multi-targeted agent designed to inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human
      epidermal growth factor receptor Type 2 (Her2) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). The study is
      designed to establish the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CUDC-101
      when administered in combination with concurrent cisplatin and radiation over an 8-week
      treatment course, consisting of a one week run-in period of CUDC-101 administered alone,
      followed by seven weeks of combination treatment with CUDC-101, cisplatin and radiation
      therapy.

    <description>CUDC-101 will be administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion three times per week for a one week run-in (week -1) and then as part of the combination treatment on weeks 1-7. If the 225 mg/m2 dose is tolerated in the first cohort, the dose will be increased to 275 mg/m2. If the 225 mg/m2 dose is not tolerated, the dose will be decreased to 175 mg/m2. If 175 mg/m2 is not tolerated the dose will be further decreased to 150 mg/m2.</description>
