      The investigators aim to :

        -  describe and analyse psychological characteristics, cognitive factors and
           representations in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, a rare disease.

        -  assess the psychological characteristics impact on quality of life, check the
           association between disease and QoL evolution, and the variability of QoL parameters
           over severity class changes and follow-up

      PAH is a rare, and severe disease, potentially mortal, affecting preferentially young
      subjects. The knowledge and the international literature, as regards the quality of life, the
      expectations, the needs and the psychosocial characteristics of patients with PAH, are
      non-existent. But it is known that the persons affected by rare diseases are more vulnerable,
      on the psychological, social, economic and cultural planIn all the stages of the treatment,
      patients with PAH are confronted with heavy psychosocial situations, in a context of vital
      risk, with exceptional medicinal treatments (intravenous administration at home).

        -  QoL might be differently affected by these changes according to situational and
           dispositional psychological dimensions.

        -  the predictive role of these characteristics on the current and later quality of life,
           as well as the impact of diverse cognitive mediators and strategies to cope with the
           disease, should be investigated.The respiratory diseases department of the Montpellier
           hospital is regional competence center for PAH in Languedoc-Roussillon, under the aegis
           of the national reference center (the respiratory diseases department of Antoine Béclère
           hospital, Le Petit-Clamart).
