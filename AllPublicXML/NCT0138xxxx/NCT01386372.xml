  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder encountered in hospitalized patients. A
      preliminary, observational, feasibility analysis finalized to assess retrospectively the
      incidence of hyponatremia (Serum sodium &lt; 135 mEq/L) in a general medical-surgical hospital
      and the distribution of the cases of hyponatremia among different referral units showed that
      over one year observation there were more than 1500 cases of hyponatremia. Conventional
      therapy for hyponatremia depends on its causes, speed of onset, extracellular fluid volume
      status, and severity. Treatment consists in fluid restriction, normal or hypertonic saline,
      furosemide. Recent development of arginine vasopressin antagonists has provided a new
      therapeutic option for treatment of hyponatremia.Tolvaptan, an orally administered,
      nonpeptide, selective vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist reported to increase free water
      clearance and limit fluid retention in subjects with congestive heart failure or liver
      cirrhosis, has been also shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic hyponatremia in
      patients with SIADH, chronic heart failure, liver cirrhosis. Thus the investigators designed
      a clinical study to explore the incidence of severe hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in
      the setting of large general hospital and to evaluate whether tolvaptan is effective and safe
      in increasing serum sodium concentration in patients with normovolemic and hypervolemic
      hyponatremia in the setting of daily clinical practice. Moreover this study may help
      understand the cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan therapy compared to traditional treatments of
      hyponatremia.

    <description>Patients will receive full-dose oral tolvaptan therapy up to 1 month after randomization. During the initial 4 days of therapy, the dose of the study drug will be increased from 15 to 30 mg or from 30 to 60 mg according to a regimen designed for slow correction of serum sodium concentrations to 135 mEq/L or more Depending on the serum sodium concentration the dose will be increased or decreased. Patients will then be continued on their maintenance therapy with adjustments allowed to prevent hyponatremia and avoiding hypernatremia. As soon as normal serum sodium levels are achieved in at least two consecutive measurements the dose of the study drug will be progressively tapered according to an individually tailored weaning program</description>
