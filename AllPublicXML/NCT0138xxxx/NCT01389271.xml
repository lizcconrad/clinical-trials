    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, uncontrolled, prospective long-term observation of Specific Drug in
      the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension up to 4 years. 160 patients with
      primary (idiopathic and familial) pulmonary hypertension (PH) or pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH) due to scleroderma with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class
      and exercise capacity, defined as class III and IV planned to enroll. Efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of the drug and the survival of the patients will be observed.
