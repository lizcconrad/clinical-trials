  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory disease of the esophagus, characterized by
      eosinophilic infiltration and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. There are no pharmacological
      treatments for EoE approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Supported by
      published case series and controlled trials in children and adults, the most widely used drug
      treatment for EoE is off-label use of corticosteroids intended for local (esophageal mucosal)
      action.

      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally administered EUR-1100 once or
      twice daily. Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of the 3 treatment groups. The
      Treatment Period will be 8 weeks during which subjects will visit the clinic at the screening
      visit, randomization, week 4, 8 and 1 week after end of treatment for clinical symptom
      assessment and safety evaluation. Additional phone visits will occur at week 2 and week 6.

             form, if required;

          -  Evidence of eosinophilic esophagitis defined by esophageal mucosal eosinophil count
             greater than or equal to 24 per HPF (400x magnification) in at least 1 of the
             esophageal sites biopsied (proximal/middle and/or distal);

          -  Lack of histological response to previously administered high dose proton pump
