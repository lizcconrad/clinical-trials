  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression
      fractures has been shown to be successful in providing acute pain relief, enabling improved
      function, and restoring of vertebral body height. However, limited prospective data exists in
      the investigation of unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty as a sufficient alternative to
      bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty. The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to
      compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of unipedicular and bipedicular balloon
      kyphoplasty.

    <measure>Comparison of 3 Month ODI Score Between Unipedicular and Bipedicular Kyphoplasty Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative questionnaire within 3 weeks before surgery and postoperative questionnaires at 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

    <measure>Change in RDQ in the Bipedicular Group From 3 to 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-12 months post operation</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire is a widely used health status measure for low back pain. The RMDQ is scored by adding up the number of items checked by the patient. The score can therefore vary from 0 to 24. It is not recommended to give patients a 'Yes' / 'No' option. If patients indicate in any way that an item is not applicable to them, the item is scored 'No', i.e. the denominator remains 24. A score of 0 indicates no low back pain, while a score of 24 indicates significant low back pain.</description>

    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.[1] It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms. The scale is from 1-10 with 10 as the highest level of pain, and 0 being no pain</description>

A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, and the needle removed. A series of dilating cannulae were then advanced over the guidewire until a working cannula was in place. A 15 millimeter (mm) or 20 mm bone tamp (Kyphon Inc; Sunnydale, CA) was then introduced into the vertebral body via the cannula and inflated until the balloon was in contact with the subchondral plate, lateral vertebral body wall, or anterior cortex of the vertebral body. The balloon was then deflated and removed. Subsequently, cement was injected into the cavity and allowed to harden.</description>

        <title>Comparison of 3 Month ODI Score Between Unipedicular and Bipedicular Kyphoplasty Groups</title>
        <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0–5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

        <title>Change in RDQ in the Bipedicular Group From 3 to 12 Months</title>
        <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire is a widely used health status measure for low back pain. The RMDQ is scored by adding up the number of items checked by the patient. The score can therefore vary from 0 to 24. It is not recommended to give patients a ‘Yes’ / ‘No’ option. If patients indicate in any way that an item is not applicable to them, the item is scored ‘No’, i.e. the denominator remains 24. A score of 0 indicates no low back pain, while a score of 24 indicates significant low back pain.</description>

        <title>Comparison of 3 Month RDQ Score Between Unipedicular and Bipedicular Kyphoplasty Groups</title>
        <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire is a widely used health status measure for low back pain. The RMDQ is scored by adding up the number of items checked by the patient. The score can therefore vary from 0 to 24. It is not recommended to give patients a ‘Yes’ / ‘No’ option. If patients indicate in any way that an item is not applicable to them, the item is scored ‘No’, i.e. the denominator remains 24. A score of 0 indicates no low back pain, while a score of 24 indicates significant low back pain.</description>

        <population>From the period of intervention to 3 month follow-up, 5 patients were lost in the unipedicular kyphoplasty arm, resulting in analysis of 18 patients from this arm at 3 months. 3 patients were lost in the bipedicular kyphoplasty arm, resulting in analysis of 18 patients from this arm at 3 months.</population>

A guidewire was placed through the Jamshidi needle, and the needle removed. A series of dilating cannulae were then advanced over the guidewire until a working cannula was in place. A 15 millimeter (mm) or 20 mm bone tamp (Kyphon Inc; Sunnydale, CA) was then introduced into the vertebral body via the cannula and inflated until the balloon was in contact with the subchondral plate, lateral vertebral body wall, or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.

        <title>Comparison of 12 Month VAS Score Between Unipedicular and Bipedicular Kyphoplasty Groups</title>
        <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.[1] It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms. The scale is from 1-10 with 10 as the highest level of pain, and 0 being no pain</description>
        <time_frame>12 months post-op</time_frame>
        <population>From the period of intervention to 12 month follow-up, 9 total patients were lost in the unipedicular kyphoplasty arm, resulting in analysis of 14 patients from this arm at 12 months. 6 total patients were lost in the bipedicular kyphoplasty arm, resulting in analysis of 15 patients from this arm at 12 months.</population>

In this arm only vertebral body pedicle was entered to deliver bone cement.
A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, and the needle removed. A series of dilating cannulae were then advanced over the guidewire until a working cannula was in place. A 15 millimeter (mm) or 20 mm bone tamp (Kyphon Inc; Sunnydale, CA) was then introduced into the vertebral body via the cannula and inflated until the balloon was in contact with the subchondral plate, lateral vertebral body wall, or anterior cortex of the vertebral body. The balloon was then deflated and removed. Subsequently, cement was injected into the cavity and allowed to harden.</description>
