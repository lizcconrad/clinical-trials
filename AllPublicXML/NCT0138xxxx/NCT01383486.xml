    <description>Participants were instructed to select a product for use upon their pain episode and then call a toll-free number for an interview within 30 minutes of the selection decision. Participants who did not call were interviewed after 14 days for data collection. The primary endpoint was derived from 2 variables: 1) number of participants who selected Naproxen Sodium ER and reported expected duration of pain less than or equal to 12 hrs (A); 2) number of participants who selected Naproxen Sodium ER and report expected duration of pain greater than 12 hrs (B). The results was calculated as B/(A+B).</description>
