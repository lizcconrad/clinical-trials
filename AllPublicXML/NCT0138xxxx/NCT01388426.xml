      Objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerance and potential benefit of moisture
      chamber glasses for dry eye in an Asian population. In this clinic based prospective
      interventional study, we aim to recruit patients (until 10 patients complete the study) who
      have evaporative dry eye due to exposure to environmental stress (such as frequency of out
      door activities) and keen to try out moisture chamber glasses/ eyewear from the dry eye
      clinic in Singapore National Centre. After informed consent, these patients will be
      prescribed 7eye( Panoptx)™ moisture chamber glasses/eyewear for 3 months and will be
      monitored on a diary for the amount of time wearing eyewear for 2 weeks and the number of eye
      drops for each type of medication used. Other outcomes will be changes in symptoms of dry eye
      using visual analog scale, as well as objective signs of dry eye (eg. corneal fluorescence
      staining and tear break up time (TBUT). As moisture chamber spectacles are currently not
      available as a treatment option for dry eye in Singapore, the findings of this study will
      give an insight to the efficacy of this new treatment modality in our population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Subjects with evaporative dry eye as assessed by the PI in the dry eye clinic and has
        occupational or lifestyle requirement to be exposed to a hyper-evaporative environment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who can't wear the eye wear as instructed in the study, or unable to complete
             the diary of eye wear use.

          2. Subjects with eye lid or facial bone malformation

          3. Subjects with a significant refractive error that warrants spectacles with a
             refractive power.
