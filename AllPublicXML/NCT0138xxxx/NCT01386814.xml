      Aim: To evaluate the influence of oxygen deficit on the cognitive performance and also about
      the architecture and sleep efficiency in volunteers subjected to mild and moderate exercise
      in a hypobaric chamber. SUMMARY: Participants in this study 30 healthy male volunteers, aged
      20 to 40 years, regular physical activity, constituting three groups: 1 - without
      exercise-hypoxia group 10 volunteers who not be subjected to any kind of physical exercise in
      hypoxia and remain all day of experiment, 2 - group exercise at sea level, is composed of 10
      volunteers who will undergo a protocol exercise physical sea-level, 3 - group exercise and
      hypoxia - 10 volunteers who will carry out a protocol exercise on a treadmill, being the same
      in condition of hypoxia (hypobaric chamber). All groups on the first day of the experiment
      will undergo baseline assessments, laboratory blood analysis salivary and spirometric
      testing. Assessments will be personality and neuropsychological. After baseline assessments,
      the last day of the experiment, the groups will be evaluated again 4350m above sea level the
      sea, by personality tests, neuropsychological and laboratory. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND:
      During exposure to environments with a partial reduction of oxygen, human body can undergo
      several physiological and psychological changes are not prepared for such condition. Few
      studies have reported that the elevation changes and cognitive aspects related to sleep.

      MATERIAL AND METHOD: They describe the procedures to be performed, and the study conducted in
      local with adequate infrastructure.

      ADDITIONAL RISKS TO THE PATIENT: Minimal risk, mild discomfort, involving blood collect.
      Purpose: To evaluate the influence of oxygen deficit on the cognitive performance and also
      about the architecture and sleep efficiency in volunteers subjected to mild and moderate
      exercise in a hypobaric chamber.
