      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of KW-3357 with concomitant use of heparin using
      multi-center, non-comparative, open-label method in patients diagnosed as disseminated
      intravascular coagulation (DIC) by the diagnostic criteria for DIC established by the
      Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare.
