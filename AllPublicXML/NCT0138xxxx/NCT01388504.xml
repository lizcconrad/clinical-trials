      The research question to be addressed is &quot;Does a 2.5 - 5 minute systemic intravenous
      injection of sodium nitrite administered immediately before opening of the infarct related
      artery result in significant reduction of ischaemia reperfusion injury in patients with first
      acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI)?&quot;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are estimated to be 125,000 acute myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) in the UK
      every year. Although substantial progress has been made in reducing the infarct size by
      prompt opening of the infarct related artery (with thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI)), effective therapy to further reduce the infarct size would
      substantially reduce the risk of the patient subsequently developing heart failure.

      There is a growing body of evidence from studies in animals that the use of nitrites may help
      in reducing the infarct size, although this has not been tested in man.

      In this phase 2/3 study, the investigators propose to investigate the effect of sodium
      nitrite injection on infarct size. Eligible patients will be males aged 18 and over and
      females aged 55 and over, presenting within 12 hours of the onset of chest pain, who are
      suitable for treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention. Those who give verbal
      agreement to take part will receive a 2.5-5 minute injection of sodium nitrite (or placebo)
      immediately prior to the blocked artery being opened with percutaneous coronary intervention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Men aged ≥18 years, women aged ≥55 years, and women &lt;55years who are sterilised, or have
        had a hysterectomy or have effective contraception and thus where there is no possibility
        of them being pregnant; presenting within 12 hours of the onset of chest pain who have ST
        segment elevation of more than 1mm elevation in limb leads or 2mm elevation in two
        contiguous chest leads or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) and for whom the clinical
        decision has been made to treat with primary PCI will be eligible for enrolment. Occlusion
        of the culprit related artery (TIMI grade 0 or TIMI grade 1) will also be required for
        inclusion. Eligible patients will be of North European descent.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Historical or ECG evidence of previous myocardial infarction

          -  Patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

          -  Prior revascularization procedure where this procedure (PCI) was performed in the same
             territory as the current infarct

          -  Known or suspected pregnancy

             liver failure

          -  Patients with prior thrombolysis for this event

          -  Patients with such Left Main disease which after PCI of their culprit lesion (culprit
             lesions may be located in the LAD or LCx or RCA) are likely to require CABG within the
             time course of the study period (6 months).
