  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at examining the effects of additional training in manualized
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on outcome in routine psychotherapy for social phobia. The
      investigators will investigate how CBT, specifically the treatment procedures and manuals
      proposed by Clark and Wells (1995), can be transferred from controlled trials into the less
      structured setting of routine clinical care, and whether the health care system benefits from
      such developments. Private practitioners (N=36) will be randomized to one of two treatment
      conditions (i.e., training in manualized CBT vs. treatment as usual without specific
      training). The investigators plan to enroll 160 patients (80 per condition) to be able to
      detect differences of d=.50 between conditions at 1-beta=.80, given the drop-out rate of 25%
      (N=116 completers; N=58 per condition). The study is genuinely designed to promote faster and
      more widespread dissemination of effective interventions. The following research questions
      can be examined: (1) Can manualized CBT be successfully implemented into routine outpatient
      care? (2) Will the new methods lead to an improvement of treatment courses aned outcomes? (3)
      Will treatment effects in routine psychotherapeutic treatments be comparable to those of the
      controlled, strictly manualized treatment of the main study?
