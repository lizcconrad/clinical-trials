  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the abuse potential of EMBEDA compared to
      controlled release morphine when crushed and taken orally by non-dependent recreational
      opioid users; secondary purposes include to determine the abuse potential of crushed EMBEDA
      relative to placebo and and to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of crushed EMBEDA with
      crushed controlled-release morphine and crushed placebo.

    <description>Drug liking assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot; (score of 50 mm), on the left with &quot;strong disliking&quot; (score of 0 mm) and on the right with &quot;strong liking&quot; (score of 100 mm).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a recreational opioid user who is NOT physically dependent on opioids based
             on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revision
             (DSM-IV-TR) criteria, and the Naloxone Challenge. A recreational opioid user is
             defined as recreationally abusing opioids for non-therapeutic purposes (i.e., for
             psychoactive effects) on at least 10 occasions within the last year and at least once
             in the 12 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Subject is in generally good health as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiogram
             (ECG).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history or current diagnosis of substance dependence (excluding caffeine and
             nicotine), as assessed by the Investigator using the DSM IV-TR criteria.

          -  Has participated in, is currently participating in, or is seeking treatment for
             substance- and/or alcohol-related disorders (excluding nicotine and caffeine).

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant illness (e.g., cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic,
             dermatologic, neurologic, oncologic, musculoskeletal, or psychiatric) or any other
             condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator would jeopardize the safety of the
             subject or the validity of the study results.

          -  Has a known allergy or history of hypersensitivity to morphine sulfate, opioids in
             general, naltrexone hydrochloride (HCl) or similar compounds and/or the known
             excipients in the investigational drug products.

          -  Has any condition in which an opioid is contraindicated (e.g., significant respiratory
             depression, acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia, or is suspected of having
             paralytic ileus).

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the
             course of the study. Females with a positive serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 or at any
             subsequent study visit will be excluded from participating in the study.

        <description>Drug liking assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot; (score of 50 mm), on the left with &quot;strong disliking&quot; (score of 0 mm) and on the right with &quot;strong liking&quot; (score of 100 mm). AUE (0-2) = Area under the effect versus time curve from time 0 to 2 hours (hrs) (0-2).</description>

          <title>Drug Liking: Area Under Effect Curve (AUE) From 0-1 Hour</title>
          <description>Drug liking assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 mm bipolar VAS anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot; (score of 50 mm), on the left with &quot;strong disliking&quot; (score of 0 mm) and on the right with &quot;strong liking&quot; (score of 100 mm). AUE (0-1) = Area under the effect versus time curve from time 0 to 1 hr (0-1).</description>
          <population>The evaluable population included all randomized participants who completed all 3 treatment periods of the treatment phase, contributed post-dose PD data from each period and did not have major protocol violations.</population>

        <description>Overall drug liking VAS assesses the participant’s global perception of drug liking (that is, effects over the whole course of the drug experience including any carryover effects). A 100 mm VAS is used to assess response based on a score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (0 mm = “strong disliking”, 50 mm= “neither like nor dislike”, and 100 mm= “strong liking”).</description>

The same eye for each participant was used for all measurements during the study. Participants had the size of their pupil measured (in mm) using a pupillometer.

        <title>Pupillometry: Area Under Effect Curve (AUE) From 0-2 Hours</title>
        <description>Pupillometry assessments measured change in pupil size (miosis) as an indicator of opioid pharmacological properties. The same eye for each participant was used for all measurements during the study. Participants had the size of their pupil measured (in mm) using a pupillometer. Measurements were made in a dimly lit (mesopic) room with controlled lighting conditions. AUE (0-2) = Area under the effect versus time curve from time 0 to 2 hrs (0-2).</description>

        <description>Pupillometry assessments measured change in pupil size (miosis) as an indicator of opioid pharmacological properties. The same eye for each participant was used for all measurements during the study. Participants had the size of their pupil measured (in mm) using a pupillometer. Measurements were made in a dimly lit (mesopic) room with controlled lighting conditions. AUE (0-12) = Area under the effect versus time curve from time 0 to 12 hrs (0-12).</description>

        <description>Pupillometry assessments measured change in pupil size (miosis) as an indicator of opioid pharmacological properties. The same eye for each participant was used for all measurements during the study. Participants had the size of their pupil measured (in mm) using a pupillometer. Measurements were made in a dimly lit (mesopic) room with controlled lighting conditions. TEmax = Time to smallest post-dose pupil size.</description>
