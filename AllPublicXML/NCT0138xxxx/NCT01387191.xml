    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of adverse events in Japanese
      pulmonary arterial hypertension subjects treated with epoprostenol injection based on
      prescribing information under the conditions of general clinical practice and also to grasp
      the following items;

        1. Unknown adverse reactions (especially, significant adverse reactions)

        2. Adverse reaction onset status under practical drug use conditions

        3. Factors possibly influential on safety

        4. Factors possibly influential on efficacy

        5. Patient's prognosis, efficacy and safety in long-term use
