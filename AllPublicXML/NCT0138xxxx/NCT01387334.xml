      Resistance exercise is effective in improving glycemic control in diabetes patients. The
      effectiveness of a home-based resistance exercise program has not been establish.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise play an important role in diabetes control. The American Diabetes Association (ADA)
      approved of resistive exercise as an effective method in controlling blood sugar of type 2
      diabetes patients. Few community-based intervention has been establish. So the authors
      developed the low-cost community based resistance exercise program to promote exercise in of
      type 2 diabetes patients.
