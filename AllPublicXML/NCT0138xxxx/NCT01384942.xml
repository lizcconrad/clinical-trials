  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that individuals in bereavement tend to experience substantial psychological distress
      in the first two years following loss, individuals seeking psychological support will need
      appropriate services grounded in sound empirical scholarship. There is a lack of studies
      assessing bereavement groups, despite groups being one of the most common forms by which such
      services are offered. The prominent and emerging process of meaning-reconstruction in
      bereavement research is theorized to lead to better psychological adjustment and prevent more
      prolonged grief reactions. The principal objective of this study is to compare two types of
      group counseling for individuals in bereavement: A novel meaning-based bereavement counseling
      group and a conventional bereavement support group.
