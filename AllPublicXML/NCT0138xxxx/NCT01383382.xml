  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using individualized patient estimates of procedural risks and benefits, this project will
      transform the process of informed consent for coronary angioplasty into a dynamic educational
      tool for patients and physicians and is a direct response to the Institute of Medicine's call
      for a more evidence‐based, efficient, patient‐centered healthcare system. It is hypothesized
      that patients will develop a greater understanding of their individual risks and benefits
      from PCI, will be empowered to more actively engage in shared decision-making, as well as
      have improved awareness of their responsibility to adhere to dual anti-platelet therapy if
      treated with a drug eluting stent (risks for target vessel revascularization with bare metal
      and drug eluting stents are also provided in the new consent form). It is also anticipated
      that physicians, in turn, will use these individualized estimates to better discriminate
      between risks and benefits among different bleeding avoidance therapies so as to improve the
      safety and cost-effectiveness of PCI.

      This study will test the impact of a new mechanism for eliciting informed consent from
      patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on 1) patients' comprehension of
      procedural risks/benefits and participation in shared decision-making; and 2) upon
      clinicians' use of effective strategies to minimize the risk of bleeding at the time of PCI.
      To facilitate these goals, we will prospectively provide each patients' risks for bleeding at
      the time that the informed consent document is generated. This will be accomplished by
      transforming the infrastructure of the informed consent process at participating study
      centers using a novel, web‐based system - the Personalized Risk Information Services Manager
      (PRISM) - to generate individualized consent forms with estimates of risks and outcomes using
      validated multivariable models from the American College of Cardiology's NCDR. The goals of
      this study are to 1) identify barriers in implementing individualized consent forms in
      clinical care and to test whether this novel consent process 2) improves the quality of the
      informed consent process, 3) supports the more rational use of Bleeding Avoidance Therapies
      (BATs), 4) reduces bleeding events after PCI, and 5) supports a more cost-effective PCI
      procedure. This will be done using a pre-post design at 6 enrolling hospitals and comparing
      changes in practice with contemporaneous controls matched from the broader NCDR Cath/PCI
      registry.
