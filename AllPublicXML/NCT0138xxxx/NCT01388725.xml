  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to describe the value of serum sTREM (soluble triggering
      receptor expressed on myeloid cells)-1, sCD163, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP)
      concentrations, white blood cell (WBC) count and SOFA score during sepsis and their clinical
      informative value in predicting outcome.

    <textblock>
      The investigators enrolled 130 subjects admitted to an ICU: 30 cases with systemic
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 36 cases with sepsis, 35 cases with and 29 with septic
      shock. Results for sTREM (soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells)-1, sCD163,
      procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, white blood cell (WBC) count
      and SOFA score were recorded on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14.
