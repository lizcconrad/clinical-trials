      The purpose of this research is to:

        1. Compare two study patches having minor differences in patch components

        2. Compare the pharmacokinetics (PK - how the body absorbs, metabolizes and eliminates
           medication) of NP101 (study patches) versus a currently approved oral formulation of
           Imitrex

        3. Collect resistance data during application of NP101 (study patch)

    <time_frame>Blood samples (4 mL per sample) for PK analysis will be collected for all treatments by catheter or venipuncture into EDTA collection tubes for the determination of sumatriptan concentrations in plasma for each treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples (4 mL per sample) for PK analysis will be collected at the following times for the determination of sumatriptan concentrations in plasma for each treatment:
Pre-dose (within 15 minutes prior to dosing) and at 0.25, 0.50, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hrs post-dose.</description>
