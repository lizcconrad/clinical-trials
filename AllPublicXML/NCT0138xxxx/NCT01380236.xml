  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 8.0 mg of ASM8 when
      given daily for 14 days by the Aeroneb® Go nebulizer to subjects with moderate to severe
      asthma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and tolerability of ASM8 will be assessed by performing a physical exam and vital
      signs, measuring the use of concomitant medication, routine laboratory tests, urinalysis,
      sputum analysis, serum IL-1 and TNF-α, lung carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, pulse
      oximetry and measuring AEs

      There are 5 study phases: screening (phase 1), run-in (phase 2), treatment A (phase 3) with
      Active or Placebo, treatment B(phase 4) with Active or Placebo and end of study (phase 5)
      that includes a wash out period and a final visit.
