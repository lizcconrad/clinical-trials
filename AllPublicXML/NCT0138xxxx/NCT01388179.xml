  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in speech and
      communication, impaired social functioning, and repetitive behaviors and interests. The term
      &quot;Autism spectrum disorders&quot; or ASD is often used to include autistic disorder, Asperger
      syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).
      Epidemiological research suggests that ASDs affect at least 60 per 10,000 youth, with
      estimates as high as 120 per 10,000.

      Severity of autistic features is not easily defined and the use of different diagnostic tools
      compounds the ability to lay a clear cut definition. It is, though, generally accepted that
      children with autism and normal IQ (&gt;70) are &quot;high functioning&quot; regardless of the severity of
      their autistic features. The investigators will use the terms &quot;autism&quot; and &quot;ASD&quot;
      interchangeably, and the term &quot;low functioning autism&quot; will be used to describe those
      children with autism who have, or are presumed to have, IQ&lt;70.

      The pathophysiology of autism has been studied extensively in the last decade. Abnormal
      neuronal connectivity has been implicated in a growing body of research. In addition, areas
      of over and/or under neuronal activation have been detected on functional MRI(Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging).

      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique that allows to
      affect brain activity. The pulses are administered by passing high currents through an
      electromagnetic coil placed adjacent to a patient's scalp. The pulses induce an electric
      field in the underlying brain tissue. When the induced field is above a certain threshold,
      and is directed in an appropriate orientation relative to the brain's neuronal pathways,
      localized axonal depolarizations are produced, thus activating the neurons in the relevant
      brain structure.

      rTMS has been studied in individuals with high functioning autism. rTMS treatment was found
      to have an electrophysiological effect and to reduce repetitive behaviors and improved social
      functioning.

      In the context of existing pilot data suggesting effect of rTMS treatment in individuals with
      high functioning autism, the investigators propose a pilot study to assess the efficacy of
      rTMS in children and adolescents with low functioning autism.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female outpatients 10-19 years of age. Although we assume that the effect of
             rTMS may be greater in younger children, in whom secondary behavioral issues may be
             less established, the study will focus on children older than age 10 years for 2
             reasons:

             i. Some cooperation is needed by the children to undergo a rTMS treatment. ii. We
             would like to establish the efficacy and safety profile of this treatment in older
             children with autism before we expose younger children, who may need sedation, to it.

          2. Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision
             criteria. Children will have had a diagnosis of ASD prior to the study given by a
             pediatric neurologist, child psychiatrist or developmental pediatrician. Diagnosis
             will be confirmed by Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-G) and Autism
             Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R)

          3. VABS-II score in the low-very low range. This study is recruiting low functioning
             individuals with Autism. Although some of the assessment tools (i.e. ASRS) are
             standardized and validated on individuals without intellectual disabilities, there has
             been experience using these tools in children with autism in all intellectual levels.
             In addition, because we are measuring a change over time and not endorsing a
             diagnosis, we feel that using these tools is sufficient.

          4. Have normal physical examination.

          5. TAS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation Safety Screen questionnaire) is negative or
             mitigated as per parent prior to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients born prior to 37 weeks gestational age.

          2. Patients with any primary psychiatric diagnosis other than autism at screening.

          3. Patients with a medical history of neurological disease, including, but not limited
             to, movement disorder, tuberous sclerosis, fragile X, and any other known genetic
             syndromes, or known abnormal MRI/structural lesion of the brain or a history of
             traumatic brain injury.

          4. Patients with a medical history of epilepsy/seizure disorder

          5. Patients with a family history of epilepsy in a first degree relative (parent or
             sibling)

          6. Patients with a medical condition other then autism

          7. Patients prescribed with psychoactive medication(s) less then 4 weeks prior to joining
             the study.

          8. Patients with a medical history head trauma associated with prolonged loss of
             consciousness.

          9. History of metal foreign body in the head, excluding oral devices

         10. History of known anatomical brain abnormality

         11. Hearing loss

         12. participation in an ongoing other interventional study

        Discontinuation criteria:

          1. The patient or legal guardian refuses to continue

          2. The RC decides that the patient is not suitable to continue the study

          3. Severe side effects
