  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many authors have recognized the need to overcome the different barriers to continuity of
      cancer care, such as inadequate communication between specialists and family physicians (FP),
      insufficient information provided for the long-term follow-up care and difficulties to
      transfer back to FP the responsibility for cancer care at the end of treatments. This study
      aims to assess the effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention to improve continuity of
      care for patients with lung cancer. Newly diagnosed lung cancer patients who have a FP will
      be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or to usual care and they will be
      followed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months ( or until death for those with a
      survival of less than 18 months). The intervention comprises 4 components: 1) systematic
      appointments with FP at 3-month interval ; 2) transmission to FP of a standardized
      comprehensive summary before each appointment; 3) systematic transmission to the oncology
      team of patients' information resulting from FP visits; 4) development of a priority access
      to FP for cancer patients. In both groups, outcomes related to patients and to care processes
      will be measured at baseline and then after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months (or until death for
      those with a survival of less than 18months). Patients' principal family caregiver will be
      invited to participate to the study and they will complete questionnaires at baseline, at 6
      months and at the end of the study. In addition, patients' FP will also be invited to
      complete a questionnaire at baseline and at the end of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer patients from both the intervention and the control group will complete validated
      questionnaires at baseline and then after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months (or until death for
      those with a survival of less than 18months) to assess their perceived collaboration between
      their FP and the oncology team (from an adaptation of Nielsen et al.'s validated
      questionnaire (2003)), their quality of life (from the EORTC-QLQ-C30), pain and other symptom
      relief (from the EORTC-QLQ-LC13), their level of distress, anxiety and depression (from the
      HADS), their self-efficacy (from an adaptation of Lorig et al.'s validated questionnaire
      (1996)). Several processes of care will also be measured at the same intervals: number of
      exchanges of information, number of visits to FP, number of answered/unanswered calls from
      FP, delay to return patients' calls, responsibility for care by FP at the terminal phase of
      cancer, service utilization (ER visits, hospitalization, community health services). The
      investigators will also measure in patients' principal family caregivers, their perceived
      collaboration between FP and the oncology team (same questionnaire than the one used for
      patients but adapted to family caregivers), their distress (from the IDPESQ), psychological
      burden (from the CBS-EOLC) and self-efficacy (same questionnaire than the one used for
      patients but adapted to family caregivers . Finally, measures related to FP will include
      their perceived collaboration with the oncology team (same questionnaire than the one used
      for patients and family caregivers but adapted to FPs).
