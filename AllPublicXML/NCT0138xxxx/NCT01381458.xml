    <textblock>
      This retrospective database study will assess differences in the risk of re-hospitalization
      and other COPD-related exacerbations and costs for patients receiving fluticasone
      propionate/salmeterol xinafoate combination 250/50 (FSC) versus anticholinergics [i.e.
      tiotropium (TIO) and ipratropium or combination ipratropium-albuterol (collectively referred
      to as ipratropium - IPR)] post-hospitalization or Emergency Department (ED) visit for the
      treatment of COPD.

      This is a hypotheses testing study. Associations are compared between FSC and AC cohorts.

      Hypotheses for the primary outcome and key secondary outcomes are presented below:

      Specifically the study hypotheses for the primary outcome being tested were:

      Ho: There is no difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization between FSC and AC Ha:
      There is a difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization between FSC and AC

      Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and AC Ha: There is a difference
      in COPD-related costs between FSC and AC

      Managed care patients (aged &gt;40 years) who were fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate
      combination (FSC)-naive in the 12 months pre-index period. The index-date was the date of
      discharge of the index Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-related
      hospitalization/Emergency Department (ED) visit. Eligible patients were required to newly
      initiate or switch to drug therapy with FSC or ipratropium (IPR) / tiotropium (TIO) during
      the identification period (01/01/2004 to 01/31/2008) to treat COPD. Patients who switched to
      another maintenance medication or had an exacerbation in the treatment assessment period
      (30-days post-index date) were excluded from the study. Follow-up period was 12 months post
      treatment assessment period. Patients classified as being on FSC 250/50 versus
      anticholinergics (TIO, IP or IPR). Examined risk of COPD-related exacerbations such as
      hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, COPD-related physician/outpatient visit
      with oral corticosteroid (OCS) or antibiotic prescription (ABX) within 5 days of
      physician/outpatient visit and COPD-related medical, pharmacy, and total healthcare costs in
      follow-up period.

    <description>Risk of hospitalization was assessed as any hospitalization that was catpured in the follow up period. We required this event to have a primary discharge dx of COPD (ICD-9 code 491.xx, 492.xx, 496.xx) thus assuring it to be COPD-related. a logistic regression model was run to examine this outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>January 1, 2003 through March 31, 2009 (up to 6 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Exacerbation rates were assessed between the FSC and AC groups. We examined COPD-related (primary dx of COPD (ICD-9 code 491.xx, 492.xx, 496.xx)) emergency department visits, outpatient visits, outpatient visits accompanied by prescription of oral steroids and antibiotics. A negative binomial regression model was run to examine this outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>January 1, 2003 through March 31, 2009 (up to 6 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean COPD-related medical costs-, pharmacy costs - and total costs (the sum of medical and pharmacy costs) were calculated. Medical costs included healthcare facility and professional services charges for hospital admissions, ED visits, physician and other outpatient visits, and laboratory, radiology and other outpatient procedures with a primary diagnosis of COPD. Costs were adjusted to 2009 US dollars using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI ). A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a log-link function was used to assess differences in costs.</description>
