  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic
      astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of
      tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival
      durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy consists of
      either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. All patients experience a
      recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy
      are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently
      used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). The investigators
      have shown in a previous phase I trial that a single Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral
      Infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective in the treatment of
      recurrent GBM. Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that
      trial in that the investigators seek to test the hypothesis that repeated dosing of
      intra-arterial Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent malignant
      glioma. Additionally the investigators will analyze if a combination with IA Carboplatin will
      further improve the treatment response. By achieving the aims of this study the investigators
      will also determine if IV therapy with Bevacizumab with IV Carboplatin should be combined
      with repeated selected intra-arterial Bevacizumab plus Carboplatin to improve progression
      free and overall survival. The investigators expect that this project will provide important
      information regarding the utility of repeated SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma,
      and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to the investigators patients in the near
      future.
