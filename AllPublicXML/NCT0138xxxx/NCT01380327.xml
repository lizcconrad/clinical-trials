      This trial is a follow-up study of the ICAC-12 Phase I/II trial (NCT00829985), and is
      designed to study biomarkers of the immune response to allergen immunotherapy and the safety
      of this therapy in a pediatric population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, scientific evidence has shown that the combination of cockroach
      allergy and cockroach exposure is one of the most important factors contributing to the
      dramatic increase in asthma morbidity seen in inner city children with asthma. Therefore, a
      major goal of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Inner City
      Asthma Consortium (ICAC) is ultimately to conduct a large multi-center trial of cockroach
      sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in inner-city asthma. As a step toward achieving this goal,
      ICAC is conducting a clinical trial comparing two doses of glycerinated German cockroach
      (Blattella germanica) allergenic extract to placebo, administered under the tongue
      (sublingual).

    <description>Outcome is change in mean IgE FAB activity level from baseline to post-baseline (status post 3 months of treatment). Serum from cockroach sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-treated participants were analyzed to determine if treatment inhibits in-vitro cockroach SLIT, using the per protocol allergenic extract doses. This result is an indicator of immune modulation over time, however its clinical significance is unclear.(Reference: Shamji MH et al.
