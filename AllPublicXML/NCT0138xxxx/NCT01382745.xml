  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using Nimotuzumab and
      radiation in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the anal canal in order to achieve
      a 65% local control rate with a better toxicity profile than the conventional treatment.
      Patients with high toxicity risks (HIV+ and fragile patients) will be selected for this
      study.

          -  Patients with anal canal tumors not eligible for conventional chemotherapy (for
             example, due to age and/or co-morbidities)

          -  Patients who have already started radiotherapy for anal canal cancer

        For step II:

          -  HIV-positive patients with T1, T2 anal canal tumors

          -  HIV-negative patients not eligible for conventional chemotherapy (for example, due to
             age and/or co-morbidities)

          -  HIV-negative patients with T1-2 anal canal cancer

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For both step I and II:

          -  Previous treatment with anti-EGFR drugs

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Nimotuzumab or other agents used in study.

          -  Previously treated with pelvic radiotherapy.

          -  Lesions not suitable for radiotherapy

        Step I:

          -  HIV-negative patients with anal canal tumors that are judged suitable for current
             treatment consisting in radiotherapy and 5-FU and MMC chemotherapy
