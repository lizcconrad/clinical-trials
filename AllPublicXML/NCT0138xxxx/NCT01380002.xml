    <textblock>
      -  Liver/renal transplantations are now tending to be the most important treatment for
           terminal liver and renal disease. Although transplantation can prevent recipients from
           suffering with critical and fatal symptoms, patients may experience the complication
           from surgery and immunosuppressive drugs. Furthermore, they might have many unmet needs
           in daily life, and so as their spouses. The purpose of this study is to explore the
           home-care needs among the post liver or renal transplant recipients and their spouses,
           and identify the significant factors for care needs.

        -  A cross-sectional correlated design will be used and patients will be recruited by
           purposive sampling from an organ transplant outpatient department at a medical center in
           northern Taiwan. A set of structured questionnaires will be used to collect data.

        -  The result of this study will be helpful for clinical nurses to understand liver or
           renal recipients' physical and mental distress, also identify the potential risk of
           home-care needs and the degree of satisfaction as well.
