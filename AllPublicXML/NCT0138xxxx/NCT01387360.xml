      This clinical study has been planned to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the SUPRACOR
      presbyopic excimer laser treatment algorithm for near myopic and near hyperopic indications,
      with or without astigmatism, when performed on the cornea of pseudophakic eyes implanted with
      a monofocal IOL.

    <description>The presbyopic treatment consists of a standard treatment for distance vision and the procedure known as SUPRACOR addition to correct near vision.
The SUPRACOR addition provides a multifocal ablation with a central near addition with an aberration controlled transition zone towards the periphery, thereby allowing good focus over a range of object distances.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be at least 45 years old

          -  Subjects must read, understand, and sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations
             through 6 months after surgery.

          -  Subjects must have undergone previous uncomplicated cataract surgery with monofocal
             IOL implant in the study eye at least 3 months prior to study enrollment.

          -  Subjects must have up to +/- 2.0 (D) of absolute spherical myopia or hyperopia (not
             spherical equivalent), with up to +/- 2.0 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal
             astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction. The spherical equivalent must be no
             more than +/- 2.0 D.

          -  Subjects who have be screened successfully for acceptance of the SUPRACOR simulation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of
             remaining corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.

          -  Subjects for whom the preoperative assessment of the ocular topography indicates that
             one or both eyes are not suitable candidates for treatment based upon the suggested
             computer-simulated treatment plan (e.G. Keratoconus).
