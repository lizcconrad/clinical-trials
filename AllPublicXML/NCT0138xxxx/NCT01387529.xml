      The objective of this study is to establish reference values for non-invasive hydration
      status markers. Although there are no hypotheses associated with this study, the outcome will
      help advance the development of non-invasive hydration status monitors (described above and
      in H08-12; A-15208) capable of detecting dehydration from a single, static measure. The
      outcome that this research effort supports what is recognized by the military community as a
      high priority medical technology gap (MOM ICD v1.3, 2008).

      Disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance in the U.S. military result in at least 125
      hospitalizations, two lost duty days per event, and 9,300 ambulatory hospital visits per year
      (60% hyponatremia, 40% dehydration) (Carter et al., 2005; DoD, 2008). Diarrhea is a major
      infectious disease threat which requires aggressive i.v. fluid replacement in 30% of U.S.
      troops deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan (Brown et al., 2009). It is also important to
      recognize that the management and outcome of the 662 severe or penetrating traumatic brain
      injuries (TBI) reported for the military in 2009 (DoD, 2010) may be hindered by dehydration
      (Clifton et al., 2002). Fluid and electrolyte imbalances also contribute to heat illness
      (Carter et al., 2005) and can substantially impair combat fighting effectiveness (Dupont,
      2003).

      The importance of developing a valid assessment measure of human hydration status for
      clinical and field use is recognized by the military community as a high priority medical
      technology gap (MOM ICD v1.3, 2008). In far forward locations (levels I-II), orthostatic
      testing or gross symptoms are most commonly used to estimate hydration status (Manning et
      al., 2007). However, level I-II methods share symptoms with numerous other maladies and are
      insensitive until dehydration is severe or becomes debilitating (Levitt et al., 1992; McGee,
      1999). Definitive hydration assessment in rear roles of medical care (levels III-V) requires
      invasive serial blood and/or urine measurements (Feig, 1977; Mange, 1997). Thus, a
      field-expedient technology that provides an accurate, non-invasive assessment of hydration
      status would improve medical triage by allowing better fluid-electrolyte management by medics
      in theatre (point of care), and by medical personnel in the rear levels of care (treatment
      and return to duty).

        Approximately 150 volunteers (military and civilians) will complete this experiment. A
        sample size of 120 volunteers is recommended for characterizing a sample reference
        population and constructing reference intervals (Fraser, 2001). A sample size of 150 will
        allow for the potential loss of data due to equipment or handling errors, and 'bad' samples
        resulting from volunteer non-compliance. A subset of as many as 50 volunteers will undergo
        repeat testing (3 days; ~3 hours) for the purpose of determining within-subject variance.
