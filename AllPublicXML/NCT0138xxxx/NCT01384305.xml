      Even though rare disorders usually have limited case numbers, they have induced huge impacts
      on patients and their families, and has heavily burdened on our society and healthcare system
      as well. Therefore, it is essential to detect the occurrence of disorders and thus take
      appropriate measures as early as possible. The preventive goal is based on comprehensive
      understanding on rare disorders, available diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. However,
      studies related to rare disorders are often impeded by limited sample sizes and infrequent
      exchange of research materials among institutes. After referring to foreign experiences, the
      investigators have noticed that a non-profit tissue bank which can reposit biological samples
      and thus provide researchers access to samples, may be a solution. Through sharing this
      public asset, the investigators believe not only quantity and quality of rare disorder
      studies will be improved, the collaboration between various research institutes can also be
      strengthened afterwards. Most important of all, those achievements can ultimately benefit
      patients, families and the whole society.

      Investigation Plan

        1. Study Period：From 2009 to 2013

        2. Study Population：Patients with rare disorders.

        3. Planned Number of Subjects： 300~500 Subjects will be included in CMU.

        4. Inclusive Criteria：A patient who is clinically diagnosed as one of rare disorders
           notified by Department of Health or our organization. Or a patient who is diagnosed as a
           probable rare disorder case by physicians.

        5. Exclusive Criteria：Patients whose physical or mental status is not suitable by the
           judgment of health professionals. Or a patient who is &lt;20 years old or interdictory, yet
           without getting the permission from his/her legal representatives.

        6. Study Site： Mainly in OPD that related to rare disorders.

        7. Study Materials：Blood (for plasma, DNA and cell line), a questionnaire and a chart
           review form. Tissue samples are acceptable as well.

        8. Application of collected materials：Samples and information will be restored in
           appropriate manner, and researchers will be encouraged to apply them for biological
           studies in the field of rare disorders thereafter.
