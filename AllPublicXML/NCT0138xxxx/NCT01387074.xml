    <measure>Muscle Tone as Measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in the Elbow at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS assessed the degree of muscle tone during movement of the elbow compared to normal muscle tone using a 6-point scale where: 0=no increase in muscle tone, 1=Slight increase in muscle tone manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the part is moved, 1+=Slight increase in muscle tone manifested by a catch followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder of the range of motion, 2=Marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion but affected part easily moved, 3=Considerable increase in muscle tone passive movement difficult or 4=Affected part rigid in movement or extension. A low score indicated little or no stiffness (best). A high score indicated severe stiffness (worse). The number of participants in each score category is presented.</description>

        <title>Muscle Tone as Measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in the Elbow at Baseline</title>
        <description>The MAS assessed the degree of muscle tone during movement of the elbow compared to normal muscle tone using a 6-point scale where: 0=no increase in muscle tone, 1=Slight increase in muscle tone manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the part is moved, 1+=Slight increase in muscle tone manifested by a catch followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder of the range of motion, 2=Marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion but affected part easily moved, 3=Considerable increase in muscle tone passive movement difficult or 4=Affected part rigid in movement or extension. A low score indicated little or no stiffness (best). A high score indicated severe stiffness (worse). The number of participants in each score category is presented.</description>

        <title>Muscle Tone as Measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in the Fingers at Baseline</title>
        <description>The MAS assessed the degree of muscle tone during movement of the fingers compared to normal muscle tone using a 6-point scale where: 0=no increase in muscle tone, 1=Slight increase in muscle tone manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the part is moved, 1+=Slight increase in muscle tone manifested by a catch followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder of the range of motion, 2=Marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion but affected part easily moved, 3=Considerable increase in muscle tone passive movement difficult or 4=Affected part rigid in movement or extension. A low score indicated little or no stiffness (best). A high score indicated severe stiffness (worse). The number of participants in each score category is presented.</description>

          <title>Muscle Tone as Measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in the Thumb at Week 24</title>
          <description>The MAS assessed the degree of muscle tone during movement of the thumb compared to normal muscle tone using a 6-point scale where: 0=no increase in muscle tone, 1=Slight increase in muscle tone manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the part is moved, 1+=Slight increase in muscle tone manifested by a catch followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder of the range of motion, 2=Marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion but affected part easily moved, 3=Considerable increase in muscle tone passive movement difficult or 4=Affected part rigid in movement or extension. A low score indicated little or no stiffness (best). A high score indicated severe stiffness (worse). The number of participants in each score category is presented.</description>
