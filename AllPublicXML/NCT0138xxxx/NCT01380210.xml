  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon dioxide intoxication is a rare condition and only few case reports are found in the
      literature. There were six patients who suffered from carbon dioxide intoxication in our
      hospital about two years ago. Two of them are more severe with conscious change and brain MRI
      studies of the two patients were performed. Reviewing the literature, no any report has
      mentioned about the encephalopathy associated with carbon dioxide intoxication. We want to
      review the brain lesions on the diffusion weighted images and the laboratory data of the
      patients for further diagnostic help.
