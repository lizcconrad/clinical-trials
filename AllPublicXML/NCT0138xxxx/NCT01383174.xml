  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a new program Nuevo Amanecer (A New Dawn),
      improves the quality of life of Latinas diagnosed with breast cancer. Trained Latina
      counselors who have had breast cancer provide support to recently diagnosed women. The
      investigators call these counselors peer support counselors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM)
      intervention for newly diagnosed Latina breast cancer patients. In our prior work, the
      investigators established the appropriate content of the intervention, the need for early
      intervention, and the value of culturally competent peer support. In this study the
      investigators will adapt an evidence-based CBSM intervention designed to meet these needs.
      This study will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a wait-listed usual care
      control group to adapt the intervention and test its effectiveness in improving breast cancer
      specific quality-of-life, and decreasing anxiety and breast cancer specific distress. The
      new, adapted intervention will be called &quot;Nuevo Amanecer&quot; (A New Dawn).

    <measure>Physical Well-being a Subcale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Quality of Life Instrument (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month assessment</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-B was used as the breast cancer-specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social-family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: physical well-being subscale. Of 7 items, 1 was dropped because it was conceptually different from other items on that scale. Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for physical well-being were 0-24. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>

    <measure>Social/Family Well-being a Subcale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Quality of Life Instrument (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month assessment</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-B was used as the breast cancer-specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social-family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: social/family well-being subscale. Of 7 items, 2 were dropped because the items were conditional on having a partner (resulting in lots of missing data). Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for social/family well-being were 0-20. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Well-being a Subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Quality of Life Instrument (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month assessment</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-B was used as the breast cancer-specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social-family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: emotional well-being subscale. Of 6 items, 1 was dropped because of low item-scale correlations and it was conceptually different from the other items on that scale (only positively worded item on the scale). Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for emotional well-being were 0-20. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>

Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: breast cancer concerns subscale. Of 7 items, 2 were dropped because of low item-scale correlations and were conceptually different from the other items on that scale. Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for emotional well-being were 0-28. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>

    <measure>Enjoyment of Life a Subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Quality of Life Instrument (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month assessment</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-B was used as the breast cancer-specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social-family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: functional well-being subscale. Of 7 items, 3 were dropped because items were conceptually different and did not converge psychometrically with the other items on that scale; the remaining 4 items were specific to enjoyment of life, thus we renamed the subscale to &quot;Enjoyment of Life&quot;. Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for enjoyment of life were 0-16. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>

    <measure>Total Score of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Quality of Life Instrument (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month assessment</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-B was used as the breast cancer-specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social-family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to each of the FACT-B subscale. The total overall score is based on the sum of modified subscales (see above primary outcomes for modifications to subscales). Possible score ranges for the total overall score were 0-108. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety a Subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month assessment</time_frame>
    <description>BSI was used to measure general symptoms of distress. BSI consists of 3 scale scores pertaining to general symptoms of distress (anxiety, depression, somatization). Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, and 4=extremely. Scores were the mean of nonmissing items. Possible score ranges for anxiety were 0-4. Higher scores indicated more distress.</description>

    <measure>Breast Cancer-Specific Distress of the Intrusive Thoughts Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 month assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Breast cancer-specific distress was measured with the 7 item Intrusive Thoughts Scale (anchored to the breast cancer experience), a subscale of the revised Impact of Event Scale (RIES). Response options were 0=not at all, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, and 3=often. Using the published scoring algorithm, items were summed after recoding responses to 0, 1, 3, and 5. Possible score ranges were 0-35. Higher scores indicate greater distress.</description>

        <title>Physical Well-being a Subcale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Quality of Life Instrument (FACT-B)</title>
        <description>FACT-B was used as the breast cancer–specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social–family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: physical well-being subscale. Of 7 items, 1 was dropped because it was conceptually different from other items on that scale. Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for physical well-being were 0–24. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>

        <description>FACT-B was used as the breast cancer–specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social–family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: social/family well-being subscale. Of 7 items, 2 were dropped because the items were conditional on having a partner (resulting in lots of missing data). Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for social/family well-being were 0–20. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>

        <description>FACT-B was used as the breast cancer–specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social–family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to each of the FACT-B subscale. The total overall score is based on the sum of modified subscales (see above primary outcomes for modifications to subscales). Possible score ranges for the total overall score were 0–108. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.</description>
