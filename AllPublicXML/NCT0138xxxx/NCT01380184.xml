      Part 1 of the study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      ridaforolimus after administration of single and multiple 40 mg doses in Chinese participants
      with advanced cancer. Part 2 of the study is optional; participants can continue to receive
      the study drug in a weekly regimen of daily oral doses of ridaforolimus 40 mg for 5
      consecutive days followed by 2 days off-drug.
