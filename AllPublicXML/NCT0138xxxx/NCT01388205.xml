  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to implement a new family-based health behavior community program to increase
      time spent outdoors and physical activity among Singapore children aged 6 to 12 years in a
      1-year randomized clinical trial. 300 children from 250 families will be randomly assigned to
      either a family-based intervention or no intervention. The family-based intervention
      comprises structured weekend outdoor activities organized by National Parks and incentives
      for children to wear a pedometer and increase their daily steps. Families who meet their
      monthly step and outdoor activity goals will receive a range of prizes and incentives. Both
      groups will receive brochures on the National Myopia Prevention Program and physical
      activity. The success of the intervention will be evaluated through light meters, 7-day
      outdoor diaries, questionnaires documenting outdoor time and myopia; as well as pedometer
      steps, walking tests, and body mass index. A community-based intervention will be developed
      to improve the health of Singapore children by increasing outdoor time and physical activity
      to prevent myopia and obesity.
