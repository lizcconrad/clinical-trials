  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the bioavailability of linifanib from 2 formulations.
      Subjects may enroll in a separate extension study to continue receiving linifanib after
      completion of this study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Age is greater than or equal to 18 years.

          2. Subject must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed non-hematologic
             malignancy other than Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 0-2.

          4. Subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function as follows:

               -  Bone Marrow: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mm^3 (1.5 X 10^9/L);
                  Platelets &gt;= 75,000/mm^3 (75 X 10^9/L); Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL (1.4 mmol/L)

               -  Renal function: serum creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dL (0.81 mmol/L);

               -  Hepatic function: AST and ALT &lt;= 1.5 X ULN unless liver metastases are present,
                  then AST and ALT &lt;= 5.0 X ULN; bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL (0.026 mmol/L)

             ULN) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) &lt;/= 1.5.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subject has received anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents, cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biologic therapy within 21 days or within a period
             defined by 5 half lives, whichever is shorter, prior to study drug administration. In
