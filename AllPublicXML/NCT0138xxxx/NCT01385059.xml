    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well axitinib works in treating patients with
      high-risk prostate cancer before undergoing surgery. Axitinib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving axitinib before surgery
      may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal cells that have to be removed

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if axitinib modulates pre-metastatic niche density in patients with high-risk
      prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if pre-metastatic niche density in regional lymph nodes (LNs) is associated
      with progression-free survival (PFS).

      II. To determine if therapy with axitinib prolongs time to biochemical recurrence.

      III. To determine if phosphorylated form of signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (pSTAT)3 in tumor tissue is associated with biochemical recurrence.

      IV. To determine if myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment in tumor tissue is
      associated with biochemical recurrence.

      V. To determine if lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression in tumor tissue is associated with
      biochemical recurrence.

      VI. To evaluate time to metastatic recurrence.

      VII. To determine the rate of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence (grade &gt;= 3 for
      both) in the setting of preoperative axitinib therapy.

      VIII. To evaluate changes in blood-based biomarkers (pSTAT3 and selected angiogenic factors)
      from baseline to the time of prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive axitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Patients then
      undergo prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection at 5-6 weeks after
      biopsy confirmation of prostate cancer.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

             procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g., blood
             count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be
             utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as
             specified in the protocol

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500 cells/mm^3

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000 cells/mm^3

             urine collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is &lt; 2
             g per 24 hours

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

             blood pressure readings taken within 1 hour; the baseline systolic blood pressure
             readings must be =&lt; 140 mm mercury (Hg), and the baseline diastolic blood pressure
             readings must be =&lt; 90 mm Hg; patients whose hypertension is controlled by
             antihypertensive therapies are eligible

             therapy) for high-risk disease; if the patient has met with a radiation oncologist
             within 3 months of study enrollment to discuss the possibility of radiation therapy
             for localized prostate cancer, then this will suffice; patients do not have the right
             to refuse consultation; if this is the case, it must be documented by the treating
             physician in the medical record

          -  Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally
             acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial
             prior to enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

             rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this protocol

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
