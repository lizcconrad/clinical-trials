    <textblock>
      This is a two part study. Part A is a multiple-ascending dose study in up to 6 different
      groups of healthy subjects, with approximately 12 subjects in each of the groups. Part A will
      allow investigation of up to 6 different doses of LY2979165. The drug will be administered
      for a total of 14 days. Subjects will be resident in the clinical research unit (CRU) from
      Day -1 (the day before dosing) until Day 15.

      Part B will investigate a dose of LY2979165 previously administered in Part A in up to 12
      subjects. The drug will be administered for a total of 14 days. In addition to the same
      assessments as would have been completed in Part A, subjects in Part B will also have
      cerebrospinal fluid samples taken from the lower lumbar region of their spine.
