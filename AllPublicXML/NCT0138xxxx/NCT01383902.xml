      This comparative pilot study is designed to compare the rates of gastric emptying and by
      inference rates of digestion of challenge meals. Two types of meal will be compared,
      chocolate mousse style dessert and chocolate bars. The information from this study will then
      be compared to the elicitation times for both objective and subjective symptoms in the
      allergic patients who have been challenged in a different study using the same two meals.
