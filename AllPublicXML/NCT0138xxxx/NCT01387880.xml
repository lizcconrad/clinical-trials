      This is an open, multicenter phase II trial of therapy with a combination of cetuximab, and
      irinotecan every second week combined with a daily dose of everolimus to patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) mutation or to
      patients resistent to cetuximab and irinotecan therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Main objective:

        -  Number of patients with progressive disease that obtain disease control defined as the
           sum of patients that obtain a Complete Remission (CR), Partial Remission(PR, or stable
           disease (SD))

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Time to progression after first therapy.

        -  Length of disease control (CR, PR and SD)

        -  Survival from date of start of therapy.

        -  Safety and toxicity of the therapy graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria version
           3.0

        -  Influence of smoking on disease control, response, survival and time to progression and
           other effect parameters in the investigation.

        -  Significance of metabolic response evaluated by a Photon Emissions Tomography
           (PET)/Computer Tomography(CT)scan.

        -  Blood: Examine the influence of potential predictive and prognostic tumour biomarkers in
           blood as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Vascular
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Human
           Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER-2), YKL-40, Interleukin-6 (IL-6)
           ,metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1), procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP),
           Procollagen type 3 N-terminal propeptide (P3NP), gen-, micro-ribonucleinate (microRNA)-
           and protein array profiles, metabolomics and C-reactive protein (CRP) 2 weeks after
           start of therapy and thereafter every 8.weeks on disease control, response, survival and
           time to progression and other parameters investigated.

        -  Tissue: Examine possible predictive and prognostic biomarkers in tissue from primary
           tumour or metastases for micro-RNAarray profiles, mutations in K-RAS, murine sarcoma
           viral oncogene homolog (BRAF), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA), EGFR, tumor protein
           53 (p53), and protein expression and polymorphisms of th phosphatase and tensin homolog
           (PTEN), epiregulin (EREG), amphiregulin (AREG), Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),
           IGF-1 Receptor (IGF-1R), VEGF, p53, topoisomerase 1 (Topo1), YKL-40, and TIMP-1

        -  Correlation between possible predictive and prognostic biomarkers in blood and tissue.
