    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of drug-eluting stents (DES) with a biocompatible polymer have been
      demonstrated in randomized clinical trials as well as in real world practice. Theoretically,
      a new DES with a biodegradable polymer should reduce the incidence of late in-stent
      thrombosis, however, the long-term safety and efficacy of these stents remains unknown. This
      study was aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of the Excel DES with a biodegradable
      polymer to the Endeavor DES with a biocompatible polymer in same individuals.

        The patiemts who underwent simultaneous implantation of one or more Endeavor stents and one
        or more Excel stents during the same index procedure and were evaluated with coronary
        angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at least one year post-procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  simultaneous implantation of one or more Endeavor stents and one or more Excel stents
             during the same index procedure

          -  willing to be followed up with coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound at
