      Both twice-a-day (BID) and once-a-day (QD) dosing are approved in Europe for the protease
      inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r; Kaletra®).

      Since once-a-day dosing is actually a driver for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
      patients to request a specific antiretroviral, the aim of this study is to assess both
      patient's perception of and adherence to Kaletra once-a-day, as well as with which factors
      they are related.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, post-marketing, observational, cross-sectional (single visit) study in
      HIV-infected patients treated with a combination of antiretroviral treatment (ART) containing
      LPV/r 200/50 mg tablets dosed QD for at least 12 weeks to assess the participants'
      satisfaction and adherence level with LPV/r QD ART as measured by specific validated
      participant questionnaires.

      As this is a non-interventional study, the decision to enroll a participant was separate from
      the decision to treat the subject with LPV/r. Prescription of LPV/r and duration of treatment
      were the responsibility of the treating physician.

      In addition, the overall study population was compared to Cohort 2 (394 patients on LPV/r BID
      for ≥3 months to &lt;2 years) from KAPITAL2, a post-marketing observational, cross-sectional,
      single visit, multicenter, national study. For further details on this study, please see:

    <measure>Adherence Classification of Participants Per Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the single study visit, performed after at least 12 weeks of treatment with Kaletra QD</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' adherence was classified according to answers for 5 of 6 items on the participant questionnaire Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ): 4 yes/no questions: Do you ever forget to take your medicines? Do you take your medicines at the instructed time? If you ever feel ill, do you stop taking the medication? Have you ever missed your medication during weekends?; plus the following: In the past week, how many times have you missed your medication? (0, 1-2, 3-5, 6-10, &gt;10). (Please see Outcome Measure 5 for details regarding the 6th item on the SMAQ.) Perfect adherence = no dose was forgotten, medication was not skipped for any reason, and the schedule was not modified; adequate adherence = no dose was forgotten, but at least one dose was not taken at the indicated time; poor adherence = one or more doses were not taken.</description>

    <measure>Reasons for Starting or Switching to a Lopinavir/Ritonavir Once Daily (LPV/r QD)Regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>At the single study visit, performed after at least 12 weeks of treatment with Kaletra QD</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' cumulative reasons for starting or switching to a LPV/r QD regimen were tabulated via the following yes/no questions entered on the case report form by the physician: simplification (simp) as reason to change to LPV/r QD; preference (pref) of patient as reason to change to LPV/r QD; adjustment to other antiretrovirals (adjust to ARV) as reason to change to LPV/r QD; adherence as reason to change to LPV/r QD; patient's lifestyle as reason to change to LPV/r QD; tolerability as reason to change to LPV/r QD.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Human Immunodeficiency Virus Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQ) Overall Satisfaction Dimension Mean Score Value of ≥5 and &lt;5</measure>
    <time_frame>At the single study visit, performed after at least 12 weeks of treatment with Kaletra QD</time_frame>
    <description>The HIVTSQ consists of 10 items (1-Satisfaction, 2-HIV Control, 3-Adverse Effects, 4-Level of Demand, 5-Convenience, 6-Flexibility, 7-Knowledge, 8-Life Habits, 9-Recommendability, and 10-Willingness to Continue). Items are scored from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied), other than item 4, which has an inverted score from 6 (very demanding) to 0 (very undemanding). The items are aggregated to 3 different dimensions. The Overall Satisfaction dimension has a maximum score of 54 (items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). The mean of the individual item scores were dichotomized as 'mean score &lt;5 (lower participant perception of LPV/r QD)' and 'mean score ≥5 (high or very high participant perception of LPV/r QD).' The dependent variable of a mean score &lt;5 was correlated with the independent variables of viral load and time on treatment (see Outcome Measures 9 and 10), to determine the factors associated with a participant's lower perception of QD LPV/r treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>At the single study visit, performed after at least 12 weeks of treatment with Kaletra QD</time_frame>
    <description>Viral load change was categorized as either 'detectable to undetectable,' 'undetectable to undetectable,' or 'current detectable' (includes participants whose viral load changed from undetectable to detectable and those whose viral load was detectable throughout). This independent variable was correlated with the percentage of participants with the dependent variable of a Human Immunodeficiency Virus Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQ) Overall Satisfaction dimension mean score value of &lt;5 (see Outcome Measure 8), to determine the factors associated with a participant's lower perception of QD LPV/r treatment (see statistical analyses for odds ratio).</description>

The KAPITAL2 cohort was comprised of HIV-infected participants treated with LPV/r BID from ≥3 months to &lt;2 years for at least 1 month before inclusion in the study. (A full comparison of the adherence between the QD-KAPITAL study and the KAPITAL2 study could not be made due to formal differences in the applied adherence questionnaires; therefore, the above in-common specified item was compared.)

        <title>Human Immunodeficiency Virus Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQ)Dimension (Overall Satisfaction, General/Clinical Satisfaction, Lifestyle) Scores for the Overall Study Population</title>
        <description>The HIVTSQ consists of 10 items (1-Satisfaction, 2-HIV Control, 3-Adverse Effects, 4-Level of Demand, 5-Convenience, 6-Flexibility, 7-Knowledge, 8-Life Habits, 9-Recommendability, and 10-Willingness to Continue). Items are scored from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied), other than item 4, which has an inverted score from 6 (very demanding) to 0 (very undemanding). The items are aggregated to 3 different dimensions: the Overall Satisfaction dimension, with a maximum score of 54 (items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10); General/Clinical Satisfaction dimension, with a maximum score of 30 (items 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10); Lifestyle dimension, with a maximum score of 24 (items 5, 6, 7 and 8). Each dimension was considered for the evaluation of the primary outcome. For each participant, each dimension score was calculated as a sum of the individual item scores.</description>

        <title>Adherence Classification of Participants Per Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ)</title>
        <description>Participants' adherence was classified according to answers for 5 of 6 items on the participant questionnaire Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ): 4 yes/no questions: Do you ever forget to take your medicines? Do you take your medicines at the instructed time? If you ever feel ill, do you stop taking the medication? Have you ever missed your medication during weekends?; plus the following: In the past week, how many times have you missed your medication? (0, 1-2, 3-5, 6-10, &gt;10). (Please see Outcome Measure 5 for details regarding the 6th item on the SMAQ.) Perfect adherence = no dose was forgotten, medication was not skipped for any reason, and the schedule was not modified; adequate adherence = no dose was forgotten, but at least one dose was not taken at the indicated time; poor adherence = one or more doses were not taken.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Human Immunodeficiency Virus Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQ) Overall Satisfaction Dimension Mean Score Value of ≥5 and &lt;5</title>
        <description>The HIVTSQ consists of 10 items (1-Satisfaction, 2-HIV Control, 3-Adverse Effects, 4-Level of Demand, 5-Convenience, 6-Flexibility, 7-Knowledge, 8-Life Habits, 9-Recommendability, and 10-Willingness to Continue). Items are scored from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied), other than item 4, which has an inverted score from 6 (very demanding) to 0 (very undemanding). The items are aggregated to 3 different dimensions. The Overall Satisfaction dimension has a maximum score of 54 (items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). The mean of the individual item scores were dichotomized as 'mean score &lt;5 (lower participant perception of LPV/r QD)' and 'mean score ≥5 (high or very high participant perception of LPV/r QD).' The dependent variable of a mean score &lt;5 was correlated with the independent variables of viral load and time on treatment (see Outcome Measures 9 and 10), to determine the factors associated with a participant's lower perception of QD LPV/r treatment.</description>
