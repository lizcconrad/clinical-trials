    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of lumbar injections on select
      biomechanics parameters; walking pattern, lumbar flexibility and balance. The surveys will
      help assess the patient's sense of functional ability and feeling of wellness compared with
      low back pain scores. The long terms goals of this project will be to elucidate the mechanism
      of action of injections and to improve identification of patients that are likely to benefit
      from injection therapy

    <measure>Determine the immediate biomechanical effect in patients that receive a lumbar epidural injection</measure>

    <description>We hypothesize that patients will demonstrate increased gait velocity, increased step length, decreased asymmetry and increased lumbar ROM immediately after injection compared to pre-injection</description>

    <measure>Determine the short-term biomechanical effect in patients that receive a lumbar epidural injection</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks following injection</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that patients will demonstrate increased gait velocity, increased step length, decreased asymmetry and increased lumbar ROM 2 weeks after injection compared with pre- and post-injection time points</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the relationship between biomechanical status before injection and short-term pain reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks following injection</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that those patients with moderate biomechanical limitation before injection (e.g., higher gait velocity, higher step length, lower asymmetry, and greater lumbar ROM) will have greater positive biomechanical response than patients who demonstrate severe biomechanical limitation pre-injection. This response to the injection will be measured by the changes in gait and lumbar spine range of motion and pain symptoms with these activities at 2 weeks after the injection</description>
