      The purpose of this study is to develop a real-time diagnostic technique with e- Ab sensor
      for serum PCT level measurement will offer a test with lower cost, and increase the
      applicability of serum Procalcitonin (PCT) level in daily clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a clinical syndrome with complex interactions between microorganism, host immune,
      inflammatory and coagulation response. The mortality rate associated with septic shock is
      high, up to 40-70%. Currently, the diagnosis of sepsis depends on microbial infection and
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which lacks sensitivity and specificity.
      Accordingly, Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) offered new recommendations about the
      diagnosis of sepsis in 2001, which included the serum level of procalcitonin (PCT). Increased
      PCT levels through the clinical course correlated with higher mortality in critically-ill
      patients. On the other hand, recent studies also showed PCT levels could guide the antibiotic
      treatment in patients with sepsis or lower respiratory tract infection. Besides usage in
      sepsis population, serum PCT level could also be used for aids in diagnosis of bacterial
      infection and for guide of antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
      airway disease. However, current method of PCT assay depends on the Kryptor system developed
      by BRAHMS, Germany, with the functional sensitivity of 60 pg/mL. Each assay costs 1300 NT
      dollars, which is too expensive for serial follow-up of serum PCT levels. A real-time
      diagnostic technique with e- Ab sensor for serum PCT level measurement will offer a test with
      lower cost, and increase the applicability of serum PCT level in daily clinical practice.
      Here, the investigators conduct a study to develop a real-time diagnostic technique with e-
      Ab sensor for serum PCT level measurement in patients with sepsis.

    <description>Electrosensing antibody probing system (e- Ab sensing), which was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of hapten, proteins or viral antigen in medical samples, will be used for analyzing the interaction kinetics between anti-procalcitonin antibody and procalcitonin in the serum of the patients. The system incorporates the use of engineered semiconductive antibodies or virus in vertical and lateral chip (eAbchip) or lateral flow through (eAbsignal) formats. In electrosensing antibody probing, semiconductive antibodies are bound as a suitable electrosensing probe which specifically and selectively binds procalcitonin polypeptide target molecules in the test specimen</description>
