  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and treatment of pain during hospitalization are becoming increasingly
      important. In recent decades there have been articles that explain that pain is
      underdiagnosed, that there are patients who do not receive treatment or that it fails to
      decrease pain intensity. It has now been shown that pain is a common problem during
      hospitalization, showing a prevalence of 38 to 91% depending on the population studied.

      Published studies show that there are three types of pain during hospitalization: acute or
      chronic pain that motivates the admission and continues during hospitalization, pain that
      appears during hospitalization but was not the cause of the admission or associated with
      health care, and,pain that appears during the hospitalization associated with health care. To
      complete the description of patients with pain during hospitalization it has been suggested
      the existence of a fourth group of patients presenting with chronic pain that does not
      motivate the admission but persists and does not interfere during hospitalization. In a study
      evaluating the Italian population shows that the prevalence of pain is modified by marital
      status and age, and the intensity of pain increases with time evolution of pain and days of
      hospital stay. Some studies, mainly in Europe, show that the use of analgesics is high but
      the adherence to guideline recommendations for treatment of pain is low, or that the presence
      of pain is not recorded in the medical chart compared to the indication of analgesic
      treatment.

      These results demonstrate the need to determine the prevalence of pain in hospitalization at
      each institution, distinguishing the case of pain prior to admission or appearing during the
      same (or motivation), evaluating the indication of pain at each hospital, in order to learn
      about the current situation and design and implement actions to improve pain management in
      this institution.
