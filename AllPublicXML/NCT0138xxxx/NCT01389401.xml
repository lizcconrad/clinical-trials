      -  Saliva plays a key role in the homeostasis of the digestive tract

        -  The reflux of gastroesophageal contents may cause damage to the esophageal, laryngeal
           and pharyngeal mucosas

        -  There seems to be no correlation between the severity of reflux episodes and the
           intensity of inflammatory changes, suggesting individual protective mechanisms to
           refluxate exposure

        -  Inorganic and Organic Salivary changes have been associated to Gastroesophageal Reflux
           Disease (GERD) and its supraesophageal manifestations, especially reflux laryngitis
           (Laryngopharyngeal Reflux- LPR)

        -  Decreased salivary Epidermal Growth factor (EGF) concentrations have been found in
           patients with GERD and LPR, but it is unclear if these are primary or secondary to the
           disease.

        -  Hypothesis: The decreased salivary EGF concentrations in patients with reflux laryngitis
           is primary and therefore would not change after treatment and control of the disease

      Background &amp; Aims: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is known to affect the upper
      airways and may cause a variety of inflammatory changes in the pharynx and larynx. The
      pathophysiology of the supraesophageal forms of GERD is widely unknown. Studies have
      suggested decreased salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentrations in patients with
      reflux esophagitis and laryngitis. It is however unclear if these abnormalities are primary
      or secondary. The aim of the current cohort study was to compare salivary EGF concentrations
      in adults with reflux laryngitis before and after treatment and control of the disease to
      that of healthy individuals. Methods: Twenty-one patients with reflux laryngitis were studied
      prospectively at a tertiary teaching hospital. Spontaneous whole saliva was sampled before
      and after a 16-week course of full dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) twice daily and compared
      to that of 13 healthy controls. Salivary EGF concentrations were established using a
      commercially available Elisa kit.
