  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the many problems associated with reduced balance and mobility, providing an effective
      and engaging rehabilitation regimen is essential to progress recovery from impairments and to
      help prevent further degradation of motor skills. The purpose was to examine effects of
      physical therapy based on the task-oriented approach delivered in an engaging, interactive
      video game paradigm. The intervention focused on performing targeted dynamic tasks, which
      included reactive balance controls and environmental interaction. Thirty community dwelling
      and ambulatory older adults attending the Day hospital for balance and mobility limitation
      treatment participated in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control
      group or experimental group. The control group received the typical rehabilitation program
      provided at the Day Hospital, consisting of strengthening and balance exercises. The
      experimental group received a program of dynamic balance exercises coupled to video game
      play, using a centre of pressure (COP) position signal as the computer mouse. The tasks were
      performed while standing on a fixed floor surface with progression to a compliant sponge pad.
      Each group received 16 sessions, scheduled two per week, each lasting 45 minutes. Balance
      performance measures and spatial-temporal gait variables were obtained pre- and
      post-treatment Findings demonstrated significant improvements for both groups in balance
      performance scores post-treatment, and change scores were significantly greater in the
      experimental compared to control group. No significant treatment effect was observed in
      either group for the spatial-temporal gait variables. In conclusion dynamic balance exercises
      on fixed and compliant sponge surfaces were feasibly coupled to interactive game-based
      exercise. This in turn resulted in a greater improvement in dynamic standing balance control
      compared to the typical exercise program. However there was no transfer of effect to gait
      function.
