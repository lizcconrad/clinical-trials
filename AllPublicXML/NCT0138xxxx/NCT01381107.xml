    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multiple dose
      study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the co-formulation of ALKS 33 with
      buprenorphine (ALKS 5461) in subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who are
      inadequately/partially responding to current treatment with a stable dose of a
      serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
      (SNRI).

                  General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ), and

               3. Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score of ≥3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Axis I diagnosis of delirium, dementia, amnestic or other cognitive disorder,
             schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, bipolar I or II disorder, eating disorder,
             obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder.

          -  A clinically significant current Axis II diagnosis of borderline, antisocial,
             paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, or histrionic personality disorder.

             medications, over-the-counter [OTC] medications, or dietary supplements) within 30
             days before dosing.

          -  Have received electroconvulsive therapy during the current MDD episode.

          -  Pose current suicide risk as confirmed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
             (C SSRS).

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to buprenorphine.

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to opioid antagonists (eg, naltrexone,
