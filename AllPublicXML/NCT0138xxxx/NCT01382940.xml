  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the safety of administering rituximab at a more rapid
      infusion rate in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an
      inadequate response to biopharmaceuticals that treat diseases by interfering with tumor
      necrosis factor (anti-TNF therapies), and were receiving methotrexate therapy for more than
      eight weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Infusion-related Reaction (IRR) Associated With the Second Rituximab Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours of beginning infusion on Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The primary criterion for assessing safety of the faster infusion was the incidence of infusion related reaction (IRRs). IRRs were adverse events (AEs) that occurred within 24 hours of beginning infusion that were among a pre-specified list of preferred terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). &quot;Incidence&quot; is defined as the percentage of participants experiencing an IRR.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Serious IRR (SIRR) Associated With the Second Rituximab Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours of beginning infusion on Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>A serious infusion-related reaction (SIRR) is an IRR that meets the definition of a serious adverse event. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any IRR or SIRR Associated With the Third Rituximab Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours of beginning infusion on Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>IRRs are AEs that occurred within 24 hours of beginning infusion that were included on a pre-specified list of MedDRA preferred terms, and an SIRR is an IRR that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events (AEs) Associated With the Second Rituximab Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours of beginning infusion on Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of AEs were graded on a 5-point scale (Grade 1 to 5) according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v. 4.0), where Grade 1 indicates &quot;Mild&quot; severity and Grade 5 indicates &quot;Death&quot;. The CTCAE defines Grades 3 and 4 as follows: - Grade 3 means &quot;Severe&quot;, indicating considerable interference with the patient's daily activities; medical intervention/therapy required; and hospitalization possible. - Grade 4 means &quot;Life-threatening, Disabling&quot;, based on extreme limitation in activity; significant medical intervention/therapy required, and hospitalization probable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing the Stopping, Slowing or Interrupting of the Second Rituximab Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>During the infusion (a 2-hour period) on Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who experienced a moderate or serious IRR had their infusion interrupted immediately and received aggressive symptomatic treatment. The CTCAE includes the following severity descriptions: - &quot;Moderate&quot; means mild to moderate interference with the patient's daily activities, no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required; - &quot;Severe&quot; means considerable interference with the patient's daily activities, medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization possible. If the IRR was moderate, the infusion was not to be restarted before all the symptoms disappeared, and then at half the rate. If the participant tolerated the reduced rate for 30 minutes, the infusion rate was increased to the next rate on the protocol-specified infusion schedule. If the symptoms did not resolve with treatment, the participant was withdrawn from the treatment period of the study. Participants who experienced a severe IRR to rituximab treatment were discontinued from the study.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 24 hours of beginning infusion on Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of AEs experienced within 24 hours of beginning infusion were graded on NCI's CTCAE (v. 4.0) intensity scale from Grade 1 (&quot;Mild&quot;) to Grade 5 (&quot;Death&quot;). Grade 3 AEs are &quot;Severe&quot; and Grade 4 AEs are &quot;Life-threatening, Disabling&quot;.</description>

        <description>Participants who experienced a moderate or serious IRR had their infusion interrupted immediately and received aggressive symptomatic treatment. The CTCAE includes the following severity descriptions: - “Moderate” means mild to moderate interference with the patient’s daily activities, no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required; - &quot;Severe&quot; means considerable interference with the patient's daily activities, medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization possible. If the IRR was moderate, the infusion was not to be restarted before all the symptoms disappeared, and then at half the rate. If the participant tolerated the reduced rate for 30 minutes, the infusion rate was increased to the next rate on the protocol-specified infusion schedule. If the symptoms did not resolve with treatment, the participant was withdrawn from the treatment period of the study. Participants who experienced a severe IRR to rituximab treatment were discontinued from the study.</description>
