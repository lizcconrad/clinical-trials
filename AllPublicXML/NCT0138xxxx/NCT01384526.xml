  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian toxicity is a well-described side effect of traditional chemotherapy in premenopausal
      women receiving treatment for early stage breast cancer. However, the impact of long-term
      endocrine therapy on ovarian function is not established, and to our knowledge, has never
      been directly studied. Understanding the effects of hormone therapy on ovarian aging will
      help breast cancer patients of reproductive age make more informed and empowered decisions
      regarding their treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between
      tamoxifen therapy and ovarian aging. Patients will be identified through the UCSF Cancer
      Registry and California Pacific Medical Center Cancer Registry and will be evaluated based on
      age and menopausal status. Women who read about the study from clinicaltrials.gov and contact
      the study coordinator will also be considered for enrollment. The age of menopause onset will
      be assessed through surveys and will be compared to the accepted national average age of
      natural menopause. Biomarkers of ovarian reserve will be assessed in premenopausal women
      between ages 25-45 and will be compared to those of healthy age- and ethnicity-matched
      premenopausal controls from an ongoing RO1- funded prospective longitudinal ovarian aging
      (OVA) study.

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to determine the mean age of menopause onset in a cohort of women who have completed a course of tamoxifen therapy and to compare this age with the accepted national average age of natural menopause. Age of menopause onset which is defined as the year of the last menstrual period minus patient's birth year.</description>

    <description>A secondary aim is to compare biomarkers of ovarian reserve in premenopausal women between ages 25-45 who have been previously treated with tamoxifen with those of age- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. The primary biomarker of interest is antral follicle count (AFC). Other biomarkers that will be measured include anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, FSH, and estradiol levels.</description>

      Serum AMH, FSH, estradiol, and Inhibin B will be measured. Blood will be collected and
      processed by the UCSF Center for Reproductive Health. Serum samples will be stored at -80oC
      in a designated freezer with an alarm system. Biomarker assessments will be performed by
      Quest Laboratories under standard quality control.
