    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will assess the effect of multiple doses of
      danoprevir/ritonavir on steady-state pharmacokinetics of methadone. Subjects on stable
      methadone maintenance therapy (20 - 120 mg daily as single oral morning dose) will receive
      danoprevir 100 mg orally twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days.
