    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV positive subjects.

          -  Age above 18 at the time of the first vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Subjects whom the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol.

          -  If currently on antiretroviral therapy (ART), subjects must be compliant to triple
             therapy (highly active ART) and have undetectable viral load for a period of six
             months prior to study entry.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject
             has a negative pregnancy test at screening and on the day of vaccination, and has
             agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous vaccination against HPV, or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other
             than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period (Day 0 to Month 12).

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding female.

          -  Previous enrollment in the study.

          -  Subjects whom the investigator believes cannot and/or will not comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (i.e. because of abuse of drugs or alcohol, dementia or
             given medical, psychiatric, social or work related conditions).

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressive drugs

          -  Cancer or autoimmune disease

          -  Previous allergic reaction to vaccination

          -  Known allergy towards on or more components of either of the test drugs.
