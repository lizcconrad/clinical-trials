      An observational, non-interventional study on social, economic and quality-of-life outcomes
      of Adalimumab use in participants with moderate to severe active Rheumatoid Arthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate adalimumab therapy in Malaysia on participants' Quality
      of Life (QoL) using non-invasive epidemiological methods like the Health Assessment
      Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), the Health Assessment Questionnaire Visual Analog
      Scale (HAQ-VAS), and the Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36). The primary
      objective of the study was to evaluate the changes in QoL outcomes in anti -TNF naïve
      Malaysian RA patients after 6 months of adalimumab treatment. The secondary objectives of
      this study were to evaluate the changes on QoL outcomes after 1 month and 3 months of
      adalimumab treatment; and provide an assessment of the safety and tolerability of adalimumab
      in anti TNF naïve Malaysian Rheumatoid Arthritis patients.

    <measure>Change in Overall Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Scores From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥ 0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5. Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicate improvement. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 6 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Visual Analog Scale (HAQ-VAS) Scores From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire Visual Analog Scale (HAQ-VAS) is a patient-reported questionnaire designed to assess the presence or absence of arthritis-related pain and its severity. It consists of a doubly anchored, horizontal VAS, that is scored from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain). Decreases from baseline indicate improvement. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 6 months.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) Scores From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical component summary score (PCS) of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary score (MCS) of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range = 0 &quot;worst&quot;-100 &quot;best&quot;). The standard recall period is four weeks. Increases from baseline indicate improvement. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 6 months.</description>

        <title>Change in Overall Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Scores From Baseline to 6 Months</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥ 0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5. Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicate improvement. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 6 months.</description>

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical component summary score (PCS) of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary score (MCS) of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range = 0 “worst”-100 “best”). The standard recall period is four weeks. Increases from baseline indicate improvement. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 6 months.</description>

          <title>Change in Mean Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) Scores From Baseline to 1 Month</title>
          <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical component summary score (PCS) of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary score (MCS) of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range = 0 “worst”-100 “best”). The standard recall period is four weeks. Increases from baseline indicate improvement. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 1 month.</description>

        <title>Change in Overall Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Scores From Baseline to 3 Months</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5. Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicate improvement. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 3 months.</description>

It consists of a doubly anchored, horizontal VAS, that is scored from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain). Decreases from baseline indicate improvement. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 3 months.</description>
