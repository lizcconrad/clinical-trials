  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess the effect of Neupro® on the severity of Restless Leg Syndrome
      (RLS) symptoms and augmentation in patients with augmentation associated with previous oral
      dopaminergic therapy. In addition, the change in treatment regimen used when switching to
      Neupro® will be evaluated.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Visit 1) in Clinical Global Impression (CGI) (Item 1 - Severity of Illness) to Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI scales document a global assessment of the severity of RLS at single visits according to the treating physician. To this end the physician judges severity of disease by following a simple seven step severity rating scale:
= Normal, not ill at all
= Borderline ill
= Mildly ill
= Moderately ill
= Markedly ill
= Severely ill
= Among the most extremely ill subjects
A negative change from Baseline to Visit 2 indicates an improvement in CGI Item 1.</description>

    <measure>Change in Treatment Regimen Used for Switching to Neupro® up to 28 Days After Entering in the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Case reports from clinical practice refer to different switching regimens for patients taking oral dopaminergics who experienced augmentation and then switched to Neupro®. The previous dopaminergic treatment might have been partly or completely down-titrated prior to switching to Neupro®. Physicians were requested to document the change of treatment at each recommended visit in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) considering their total clinical experience with this particular Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients population. Documentation comprised changes in the RLS medication last prescribed, and the dosage of Neupro® and concomitant medications. The change of treatment regimen was entirely at the physicians' discretion.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This non-interventional study (NIS) was conducted in 18 specialized centres (medical practice and outpatient department) for neurology throughout Germany.
The Participant Flow refers to the Enrolled Set (ES). The ES consists of all patients who provided informed consent.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The physician was to decide freely to treat the patient with Neupro®. In this context, the physician was not to change routine practice in reaching treatment decisions and in treating his/her patients because of the study. The observational period was 13 months per patient (adjustment period of medication switch plus 12 months of observation).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Visit 1) in Clinical Global Impression (CGI) (Item 1 - Severity of Illness) to Visit 6</title>
        <description>The CGI scales document a global assessment of the severity of RLS at single visits according to the treating physician. To this end the physician judges severity of disease by following a simple seven step severity rating scale:
= Normal, not ill at all
= Borderline ill
= Mildly ill
= Moderately ill
= Markedly ill
= Severely ill
= Among the most extremely ill subjects
A negative change from Baseline to Visit 6 indicates an improvement in CGI Item 1.</description>

        <population>The Analysis Population refers to the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS is a subset of the Safety Set and consists of all patients who received treatment with Neupro at least once and had a Visit 1 and at least one post-Visit 1 measurement on the primary variable documented.</population>

        <description>Case reports from clinical practice refer to different switching regimens for patients taking oral dopaminergics who experienced augmentation and then switched to Neupro®. The previous dopaminergic treatment might have been partly or completely down-titrated prior to switching to Neupro®. Physicians were requested to document the change of treatment at each recommended visit in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) considering their total clinical experience with this particular Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients population. Documentation comprised changes in the RLS medication last prescribed, and the dosage of Neupro® and concomitant medications. The change of treatment regimen was entirely at the physicians’ discretion.</description>
