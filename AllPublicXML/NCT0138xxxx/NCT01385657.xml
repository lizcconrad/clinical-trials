        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 18 years or older

          2. Chronic AD diagnosed by the Eichenfield revised criteria of Hannifin and Rajka that
             has been present for at least 3 years before the screening visit

          3. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score &gt;/= 12 at the screening and baseline
             visits

          4. Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score &gt;/= 3 at the screening and baseline
             visits

          5. &gt;/= 10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement at the screening and baseline visits

          6. History of inadequate response to a stable (&gt;/= 1 month) regimen of topical
             corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors as treatment for AD within 3 months before
             the screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen, and/or positive Hepatitis C antibody at the
             screening visit

          2. Treatment with an investigational drug within 8 weeks or within 5 half-lives, if
             known, whichever is longer, before the baseline visit

          3. Treatment with leukotriene inhibitors within 4 weeks before the baseline visit

          4. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks before the baseline visit

          5. Treatment with topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and/or pimecrolimus within 1 week
             before the baseline visit

          6. Systemic treatment for AD with an immunosuppressive/immunomodulating substance within
             4 weeks before the baseline visit

          7. Chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with oral or IV antibiotics,
             antivirals, or antifungals within 4 weeks before the screening visit or superficial
             skin infections within 1 week before the screening visit

          8. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          9. History of clinical parasite infection, other than treated trichomoniasis

         10. History of malignancy within 5 years before the baseline visit, with the following
             exceptions: patients with a history of completely treated carcinoma in situ of cervix,
             and non-metastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin are allowed

         11. Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the opinion of the investigator or the
             sponsor's medical monitor, would place the patient at risk, interfere with
             participation in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of study results

         12. Pregnant or breast-feeding women

         13. Unwilling to use adequate birth control, if of reproductive potential and sexually
