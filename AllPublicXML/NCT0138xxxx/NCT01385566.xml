    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, randomized, partially blinded, multicenter clinical study designed to
      compare safety and biomarkers of varicella zoster virus immunogenicity when administering
      ZOSTAVAX™ (V211) at various doses both intradermally and subcutaneously in healthy male and
      female participants 50 years of age and older.

    <measure>Geometric Mean Fold Change From Baseline in Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV)-Specific Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks following vaccine administration</time_frame>
    <description>VZV antibody titers were measured by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and at 6 weeks after vaccine administration. The geometric mean fold change represents the 6-week value / the baseline value.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting an Adverse Experience (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 days following vaccine administration</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the
structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an adverse experience.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting a Serious Adverse Experience (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 days following vaccine administration</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any adverse experience that results in death, is life threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of a study participant, is a cancer, or is another important medical event when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting a Serious Adverse Experience</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 5 days after the blood draw at approximately 20 months following vaccine administration</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any adverse experience that results in death, is life threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of a study participant, is a cancer, or is another important medical event when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Specific Local Injection-site Adverse Experiences Prompted for on the Vaccine Report Card (VRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 days following vaccine administration</time_frame>
    <description>The VRC actively prompts for local injection-site AEs of redness, swelling, and pain/tenderness and for the size of local injection-site reactions of redness and swelling that occur within 5 days of vaccination. The presence of varicella/varicella-like rash and herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rash is also captured on the VRC. Participants receiving an injection in both limbs will be instructed to complete injection-site reaction information for each limb. All injection-site AEs were reported for the limb in which they occurred: V211 vaccine or placebo.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Systemic Adverse Experiences</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 days following vaccine administration</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic AEs included all reported AEs except injection-site AEs</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting a Non-injection-site Rash (Varicella, Varicella-like, Herpes Zoster, or Herpes Zoster-like)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 days following vaccine administration</time_frame>
    <description>Non-injection-site rashes were examined by a study physician. Rashes suspected to be varicella/varicella-like or herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like were sampled for verification by polymerase chain reaction.</description>
