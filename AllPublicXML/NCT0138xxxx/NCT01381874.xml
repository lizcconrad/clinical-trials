      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of oral abiraterone acetate
      plus oral prednisone and oral abiraterone acetate plus oral prednisone plus oral exemestane,
      each compared with oral exemestane alone, in postmenopausal women with estrogen
      receptor-positive (ER+) metastatic (spreading) breast cancer that has relapsed after
      treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.

      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all participants will know
      the identity of the assigned study drug) study divided into three phases, screening,
      treatment, and follow-up. During screening, potential patients will be assessed for study
      eligibility after providing signed informed consent. The treatment phase will comprise a
      series of 28-day cycles with continuous study treatment until breast cancer progression, when
      an end-of-treatment visit will be completed before the follow-up phase begins. The duration
      of participation in the study for an individual patient may be up to approximately 7 years,
      including follow-up evaluations. Patients will be evaluated for the safety and effectiveness
      of study treatments. During the treatment phase, patients will take the following study drugs
      by mouth once daily: abiraterone acetate, 1 g/day, as four 250-mg tablets, on an empty
      stomach, and patients must not eat for at least 1 hour after abiraterone acetate; prednisone
      (prednisolone when prednisone is not available), 5 mg/day; and exemestane, 25 mg/day, as a
      single tablet. The treatment phase will consist of a series of 28-day cycles with continuous
      study treatment until breast cancer progression. At the planned interim analysis, the Data
      Review Committee has recommended that further randomization to the abiraterone acetate alone
      group be stopped and that the study is to be continued otherwise.
