  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid therapy optimization in the perioperative period has been considered as major
      contributor to improve oxygen delivery. A recent, noninvasive approach to estimate fluid
      requirements in the anesthetized patient with arterial line is the assessment of difference
      in pulse pressure (dPP). Intraoperative fluid management by dPP is a goal-directed fluid
      management approach to avoid both hypervolemia and hypovolemia. However, several clinical
      factors may impede dPP measurements. Surgical manipulations in abdominal procedures may
      interfere with hemodynamic stability due to obstruction of the caval vein. Physiological
      considerations make us hypothesize that only intense pressure impedes caval blood flow and
      thus hemodynamics and dPP. Therefore, the investigators want to assess those changes after
      standardized application of three different pressure levels (2 N, 5 N, 10 N) on the caval
      vein.

    <description>Following hepatic resection, a fitting area for pressure application on the caval vein will be identified by the attending surgeon. Baseline assessments of hemodynamic and heart-lung interaction parameters will be taken. Thereafter the surgeon will apply three different pressure levels (2 N, 5 N, 10 N) at random with a force gauge (Fa. ATP Messtechnik, Ettenheim, Germany). Assessment of the parameters will be performed after 2 minutes of pressure application by an investigator, unaware of the pressure applied. After each pressure application 5 minutes will be waited to assure hemodynamic recovery.</description>
