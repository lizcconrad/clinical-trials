  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We attempt to investigate the influence of physiotherapy and physical activity education
      applied in adolescence on physical fitness, curve progression, pulmonary function, physical
      activity and quality of life in adulthood. Quality of life assessment includes mental and
      social functioning, body image, self - esteem, depression and anxiety surveillance. The
      follow - up period ranges from 15 to 26 years. Also a group of shorter follow - up of 9 - 13
      years is available.

      The null hypothesis is that scoliosis specific exercise program applied in adolescence does
      not influence HRQoL and functioning in adulthood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among conservative treatment approaches of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), different
      physiotherapy methods are recommended and popular in some countries (Spain, Germany, Poland),
      while in others bracing and observation are standard (North America, Australia, the UK,
      Scandinavia. Neither of the methods have been shown to be definitely effective. Considerable
      evidence indicates that bracing can lead to psychological stress, poorer body image and self
      - esteem and reduce overall quality of life in adulthood. As to physiotherapy and physical
      exercises, such evidence is limited, especially long term follow up studies are not
      available.
