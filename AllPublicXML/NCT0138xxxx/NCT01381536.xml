          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) according to the
             American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, with 4 or more of the
             11 ACR criteria present, serially or simultaneously during any interval or
             observation.

          -  Be on either no SLE medication or a stable SLE treatment regimen of any medication
             (e.g., low-dose prednisone, NSAIDs; alone or in combination) for a period of at least
             2 months prior to the Screening visit.

          -  Males and females. A female subject is eligible to enter the study if at least one of
             the following conditions apply:

          -  Not pregnant or nursing;

          -  Of non-childbearing potential (ie, women who had a hysterectomy, are postmenopausal

          -  Of childbearing potential (ie, women with functional ovaries and no documented
             impairment of oviductal or uterine function that would cause sterility). This category
             includes women with oligomenorrhoea [even severe], women who are perimenopausal or
             have just begun to menstruate. These women must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             at screening, and agree to 1 of the following:

          -  Complete abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse, when this is the female's
             preferred and usual lifestyle, from 2 weeks prior to administration of the 1st dose of
             investigational product until 8 weeks after the last dose of investigational product;
             or

          -  Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following acceptable methods of birth control
             for 1 month prior to the start of the investigational product and for 8 weeks after
             the last dose of investigational product:

          -  Implants of etonogestrel or levonorgestrel;

          -  Estrogenic vaginal ring

          -  Injectable progesterone

          -  Double barrier method with vaginal spermicidal agent: Condom and an occlusive cap
             (cervical cap/vault or diaphragm) with a vaginal spermicidal agent
             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)

          -  Percutaneous contraceptive patch

          -  The subject is positive test for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) or anti-dsDNA antibody in
             serum

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active lupus nephritis requiring hemodialysis, intravenous cyclophosphamide
             (Cytoxan),or high-dose prednisone (&gt;60 mg/day) within 6 months prior to the Screening

          -  The subject has severe lupus kidney disease (defined by proteinuria &gt; 6 g/day) within
             6 months prior to the Screening visit.

          -  Active CNS lupus [including seizures, psychosis, organic brain syndrome,
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA), motor neuropathy, vasculitis] requiring medical
             intervention within 6 months prior to Screening visit

          -  The subject has hypogammaglobulinemia or IgA deficiency (IgA level &lt; 10 mg/dL)

          -  History of renal transplant

          -  History or clinical evidence of active significant acute or chronic diseases (i.e.,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, untreated hypertension, anemia, gastrointestinal, hepatic,
             renal, neurological, cancer, or infectious diseases) which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could confound the results of the study or put the subject at undue risk

          -  History of any other medical disease, laboratory abnormalities, or conditions which
             would make the subject (in the opinion of the Investigator) unsuitable for the study

             significant in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  The subject is currently participating in another clinical study or post-marketing
             study in which the subject is or will be exposed to an investigational agent.

          -  The subject has received a biologic investigational and non-investigational agent
             within 12 months prior to the dosing day.

          -  The subject has received a non-biologic investigational agent within 2 months prior to
             the dosing day.

          -  Have evidence of current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 2x upper limit of
             normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5ULN
             is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Have a historically positive HIV test or test positive at screening for HIV.

          -  History of, or positive test at Screening visit for any of HBsAg, anti-HBcAb or
             anti-HCVAb. If only anti-HBcAb result is positive, HBV-DNA test will be performed. If
             HBV-DNA results in negative, the patient is eligible.
