  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish the feasibility and safety of infusions
      of placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) from related or unrelated HLA identical or HLA
      mismatched donors in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).

      The secondary objectives are to document changes in lung function, 6 minute walk distance
      (6MWD), gas exchange and radiological appearance following infusion of MSC over a six month
      evaluation period.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, single centre, non-randomized dose-escalation evaluation of
      the safety and feasibility of MSC treatment for subjects diagnosed with IPF. The first 4
      patients will receive a dose of 1 x 10^6 placenta-derived MSC/kg. An interim safety analysis
      will be carried out by the Data Safety Management Board (DSMB) when these first 4 patients
      have all undergone their 3 month study visit. Should no serious adverse events be documented
      due, or likely due, to the MSC infusion, a subsequent 4 patients will receive an IV infusion
      of 2 x 10^6 placenta-derived MSC/kg. Therefore a total of up to eight (8) subjects who meet
      all eligibility criteria and who provide written informed consent will be enrolled in the
      study.
