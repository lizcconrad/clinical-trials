    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      PSN821 in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Subjects will be assessed for beta-cell function using a hyperglycaemic clamp before the
      start of treatment and at the end of a 12 week treatment period as the primary endpoint.
      HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight are secondary endpoints.
