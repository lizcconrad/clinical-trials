    <textblock>
      This is a research study to evaluate two different Lenalidomide doses (15 mg vs. 25 mg) in
      combination with low dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.

      The investigators propose to use the need for dose reduction as a criterion to judge
      tolerability from various causes. In the veteran population which predominantly is in the
      older age category with number of co-morbidities, a lower dose regimen may be safer and
      advantageous.

      This study expects to enroll approximately 80 subjects from participating VA sites across the
      nation.

      The investigators will evaluate the safety of the two dose regimens by comparing frequency of
      dose reductions. The investigators will also measure how long the responses last with each
      dose.

      Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM
      are cancers of the blood. It is currently being tested in a variety of cancer conditions. In
      this case it is considered experimental.

      At the time of enrollment, one-half of the subjects will be chosen at random to receive the
      15 mg Lenalidomide dose and the other half will take the 25 mg dose regimen of Lenalidomide.
      Depending on lenalidomide treatment assignment, subjects will receive either 15 mg p.o. q.d.
      or 25 mg p.o. q.d. for days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle. In addition, dexamethasone (40 mg) will
      be added once a week (Days 1, 8, 15 and 22) to the Lenalidomide regimen, with a dose
      reduction on the same schedule if the patient cannot tolerate the higher dose of
      dexamethasone. ASA (81 or 325mg) will be given daily for anticoagulation prophylaxis.
      Patients intolerant to ASA may use low molecular weight heparin. Lovenox is recommended.
      Coumadin will be allowed provided the patient is fully anticoagulate with INR 2.0 to 2.5.

      Primary Objective:

      • Evaluate the frequency of dose reductions in two different lenalidomide dose regimens.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of two different lenalidomide dose regimens in patients with
           multiple myeloma using the EBMT and IMWG criteria.

        -  Evaluate the duration of response of 15 mg Lenalidomide and 25 mg of Lenalidomide when
           used in combination with Low Dose Dexamethasone.

        -  Evaluate the safety of 15 mg and 25 mg of Lenalidomide regiments when in combination
           with dexamethasone.

        -  Explore blood and cellular levels of angiogenic factors, cytokines, and adhesion
           molecules.
