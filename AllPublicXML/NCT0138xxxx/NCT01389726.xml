  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, four-year long clinical trial study in which several mental
      health interventions will be delivered to custodial grandmothers and then compared. The study
      will examine effects on the mental health of these grandmothers and the grandchildren they
      provide full-time care to in complete absence of the grandchild's birth parents. Grandparents
      from diverse racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds will be recruited to test for
      cultural differences in response to these interventions. This study is important because
      there is growing evidence that custodial grandchildren are at-risk for psychological
      difficulties due to neglect and abuse by birth parents, challenges to parenting faced by
      custodial grandparents, and limited access to needed services. This study is funded by the
      National Institute of Nursing Research, a division of the National Institutes of Health, and
      it is anticipated that more than 500 custodial grandfamilies in four sites across the United
      States will partake.

      Although prior studies reveal that custodial grandmothers (CGM) and grandchildren (CGC) face
      high risk for psychological difficulties, virtually no rigorous studies of psychosocial
      interventions based on solid conceptual frameworks have been conducted with these vulnerable
      families. In view of preliminary findings that disrupted parenting mediates the relationship
      between CGM's psychological distress in the caregiver role and CGC's emotional and behavioral
      problems, this project involves a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the comparative
      feasibility and efficacy of two evidenced-based psychoeducational interventions widely used
      with other caregiver populations. Grandmothers (N = 504) of CGC (age 5 - 12) will be randomly
      assigned to one of three conditions: Behavioral Parent Training (BPT; derived from Project
      KEEP for foster parents; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; derived from Coping with
      Caregiving for caregivers of frail elders); Minimal Support Condition (to control for
      non-specific treatment factors). The proposed universal interventions include prevention and
      remediation objectives and involve a group format approach with mental health professionals
      and grandparent peers serving as co-leaders. The RCT will occur in multiple locations across
      the US to ensure that findings generalize beyond a single area and that equal numbers of
      Black (n = 168), Hispanic (n = 168), and White (n = 168) families participate. Prior to the
      RCT, focus groups will be held separately with CGMs of each race (n = 10 apiece) and
      experienced practitioners (n = 10) with the aim of assessing the perceived importance and
      acceptability of recruitment methods, treatment goals, and procedures, including possible
      differences by race/ethnicity. Multiple-informant and multiple-method assessments during the
      RCT at pretest, posttest and 6, 12, 18, and 24 month follow-ups will include indicators of
      CGM psychological distress (anxiety, depression); CGC adjustment (internalizing and
      externalizing problems); and disrupted parenting (use of ineffective discipline and low
      nurturance). Based on the conceptual framework of the prominent Family Stress Model,
      multi-group structural equation modeling analyses will be used to achieve four aims: (a) To
      compare the short and long-term effectiveness of CBT and BPT; (b) to examine longitudinally
      the dynamic linkages between CGM parenting practices, CGM' psychological distress, and CGC
      adjustment as modified by BPT and CBT; (c) to determine if key moderating variables
      (race/ethnicity, CGC, initial psychological difficulties in CGC and CGM influence RCT
      outcomes; and (d) to examine key factors related to acceptability and adherence to the
      proposed interventions. The findings will inform future clinical practice with custodial
      grandfamilies by identifying which of the proposed interventions are most effective and most
      acceptable among specific sub-groups (e.g., race/ethnicity; initial risk) and by unraveling
      the specific antecedent-consequent relations among CGM distress, dysfunctional parenting, and
      CGC adjustment.
