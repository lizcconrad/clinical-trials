      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of paliperidone
      extended release (ER) treatment in Thai schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of
      emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and
      withdrawal into the self) participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-randomized (the
      study drug is not assigned by chance) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      paliperidone ER in adult Thai schizophrenia participants. The study consists of a screening
      phase and an open-label treatment phase. Study duration will be 10 weeks and participants can
      either be inpatient or outpatient. The recommended paliperidone ER starting and maintenance
      dose will be 6 milligram (mg) per day for most participants. Throughout the study, flexible
      dosing ranging from 3 to 12 mg per day may be used at the discretion of the investigator.
      Throughout the study, participants will be evaluated for efficacy using clinician rating
      (Clinical and Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S] scale, and Personal and Social Performance
      Scale [PSP]) scales. Safety of the participants will be monitored.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) Scale at Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Total Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale assesses degree of a participant's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. Score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on 4 domains there will be 1 total score. Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Total Score at Week 2</title>
        <description>The PSP scale assesses degree of a participant’s dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. Score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on 4 domains there will be 1 total score. Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>
