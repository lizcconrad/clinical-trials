  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estradiol is synthesized by granulosa cells of ovaries under control of follicle-stimulating
      hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). It is known that Estradiol plays a crucial role
      in maturation and fertilization of oocytes. Furthermore it is involved in development of
      secondary female sexual organs, fertility and maintenance of pregnancy.

      Estradiol influences these processes by binding to estradiol receptors (ER). They are
      ligand-depending transcription-factors. In humans there are two subtypes: ERa and ERb, which
      are synthetized from gene ESR1 on chromosome 6 and ESR2 on chromosome 14. Both subtypes are
      expressed in the ovary. Both genes are polymorph. Especially for ERa subtype several
      polymorphisms and mutations are known which can be linked to breast cancer, spontaneous
      abortions, osteoporosis and the point in time of menarche. Furthermore some studies have
      shown a relationship between certain polymorphisms and the risk of infertility associated
      gynecological malfunctions and the result of IVF treatments.

      Progesterone is a hormone which plays a crucial role in initiation and maintenance of
      pregnancy. It induces the transformation of the endometrium, which facilitates the
      implantation of the fertilized oocyte and supports the pregnancy. Progesterone acts by
      binding to its receptor. The gene for this receptor is polymorph within the population,
      whereas some variants seem to account for implantation failure of embryos.

      In the investigators study the investigators will analyse the role of ERP and PRP
      polymorphisms in the context of IVF treatment. The analyzed genotypes are two polymorphisms
      of ESRI, called Pvu and Xba, as well as a variant of ESRII, ER2. In the progesterone receptor
      gene a single nucleotide exchange at position +331 (G-&gt;A) plays a role.

      The parameters correlated with are concentrations of estradiol, progesterone and FSH, number
      of follicles, number of fertilized oocytes and pregnancy rate.

      The investigators hope to optimize established treatment protocols and to improve the chances
      of success of IVF treatments depending on the genotype of the patient.
