    <textblock>
      This will be an experimental task-based functional MRI pilot study involving the neuroimaging
      assessment of patients with severely bothersome tinnitus, defined by a global bothersome
      scale. The investigators plan to enroll a total of 12 participants (6 severely bothered
      tinnitus and 6 age-matched non-tinnitus controls) over the course of six months to undergo
      task-based imaging. Subjects in the tinnitus group may have previously participated in the
      CTRWU study (HRPO: 07-0689) conducted by Dr. Jay Piccirillo at Washington University and have
      given permission to be contacted for consideration in future studies. The selected paradigm
      will allow us to advance knowledge about the role of the attention, control, and other
      cortical networks in the development and maintenance of bothersome tinnitus.

      Task-Based Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) The task-based fMRI protocol is based
      on work performed at Washington University by Dr. Gordon Shulman and published in The Journal
      of Neuroscience.(Shulman, Astafiev, Franke, Pope, Snyder, McAvoy, and Corbetta 2009)
      Individuals will be shown a target, which is randomly selected from 12 objects designated as
      targets, before each scan. The target for a scan will never appear as a non-target object in
      another scan. Per established protocol, individuals will fixate on a central cross prior to
      imaging. Individuals will press a MR-compatible button when they detect the target. Target
      objects only appear in the cued stream. Cues, a filled red square, are programmed to occur,
      on average, every 2.06, 4.12, or 6.18 seconds within a temporal window of ± 400 milliseconds
      centered on those values.

        Target population will consist of 12 adult participants - 6 with moderately, severely or
        worse, bothersome tinnitus, based on both a global bothersome score (i.e. How bothered are
        you by your tinnitus?) and the Tinnitus Handicap Index (THI). THI is a 25-question survey
        designed to assess how much tinnitus affects a person-possible scores range from 0-100,
        with a score 38 falling in the 75th percentile. The other six participants (Control group)
        will be age-matched without tinnitus.
