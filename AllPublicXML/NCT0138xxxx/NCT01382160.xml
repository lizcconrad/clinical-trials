  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)
      approved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs) and for the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously
      treated with methotrexate.

      However, almost one third of patients have no response and approximately 15% develop
      antibodies towards adalimumab (ATA) after a 6 month course of treatment. There is a
      relationship between adalimumab concentration and clinical response obtained after 6 month of
      treatment. Furthermore adalimumab concentration measured 3 months after initiation seems to
      predict the clinical response at 6 months.

      There is an important inter individual pharmacokinetic variability of adalimumab. Side
      effects may occur at the recommended dose and more than 3 months of treatment are generally
      required to estimate the clinical response.

      A therapeutic drug monitoring could help clinicians to early adjust the dose to optimize the
      response and to avoid dose related side effects. To date there is no definite adalimumab
      target concentration predictive of the clinical response to allow such a pharmacologic
      monitoring.

    <time_frame>During the 26 weeks of follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to characterize the concentration-effect relationship of adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To this aim, adalimumab concentration on the one hand and clinical and biological markers of disease activity on the other hand will be measured at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 and at week 26. Pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters will be estimated using PK(pharmacokinetic)-PD models in which Emax (maximum effect) and EC50 (concentration at which the effect is 50% of the maximum) will describe adalimumab effect on each markers of response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To study the relationship between genetic factors, immunogenicity and response to adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 26 weeks of follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoints consist on the association study between FCGR3A polymorphisms, transcriptomic analysis (at baseline), presence of antibodies toward adalimumab (ATA) on the one hand and estimited individuals pharmacodynamic parameters on the other hand. Measurements will be carried out at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 and at week 26.</description>
