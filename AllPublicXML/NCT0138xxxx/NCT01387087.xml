    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to explore safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of
      ASP015K, establish the maximum tolerated dose, and determine the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers.

      Subjects will be confined to the clinical research unit for five days. Some subjects will
      participate in two confinement periods. Subjects will receive a follow-up phone call to
      assess safety seven days after the administration of the single dose of study drug.

      Subjects will be assigned to one of nine sequential groups A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, or I. In
      each group, 6 subjects will be randomized to ASP015K and 2 subjects will be randomized to
      placebo. Subjects in group F will participate in two treatment periods. Subjects in the first
      treatment period of group F will have a single study drug dose administered in the fasted
      state. Subjects in the second treatment period of group F will have a single study drug dose
      administered immediately following a standard FDA recommended high-fat breakfast.
