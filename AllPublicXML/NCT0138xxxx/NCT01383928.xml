  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study using the oral formulation of
      IXAZOMIB administered twice weekly in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose
      dexamethasone. Both phases of the study will include patients who have newly diagnosed
      multiple myeloma and have not previously received systemic treatment.

      Both the phase 1 and the phase 2 portions of the study will include induction therapy
      consisting of 1 year of therapy followed by maintenance therapy that will continue until
      progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance therapy will be IXAZOMIB alone on
      Days 1,4,8, &amp; 11 of a 21-day cycle.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <title>Phase 1: Percentage of Participants Experiencing 1 or More Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <title>Phase 1: Number of Participants With Change From Baseline Value in Clinical Laboratory Test Results to Worst Value</title>
        <description>Number of participants with any markedly abnormal standard safety laboratory values collected throughout study. Hematology (white blood cell [WBC] count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets, hemoglobin), clinical chemistry and urinalysis were performed. Number of participants with baseline laboratory values as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) grade (Grade 0= within normal limits, Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening) and corresponding changes to the worst CTC grade were presented. Baseline value defined as value collected at time closest to, but prior to, first dose of study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1. Worst post-baseline value defined as worst value between first dose of any study drug and End of Study (EOS) visit. Shift to low refers to lower than Baseline value; shift to high refers to higher than baseline value for corrected calcium, glucose, magnesium, potassium and sodium irrespective of change in the CTC grade.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. As per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE), Grade 3 = AE with severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = AE with life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated and Grade 5 = Death related to AE.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
