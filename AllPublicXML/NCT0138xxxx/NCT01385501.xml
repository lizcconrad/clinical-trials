      This research project will develop an educational intervention to improve immunization
      acceptance by vaccine hesitant parents. This is prospective interventional case-control
      trial, where the investigators will provide the intervention in the clinical setting.
      Enrollees will be screened and selected if they meet criteria for &quot;vaccine hesitancy&quot;. The
      investigators will conduct follow up surveys following the intervention to assess change in
      attitude and follow immunization rates through 18 month well visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is a 8 minute video addressing common concerns that have been reported by
      vaccine hesitant parents. The video includes an expert in pediatric infectious diseases
      answering these common questions as well as 3 parental accounts of children who contracted
      vaccine preventable diseases. Also, the interventional group will be provided with two
      handouts: one listed information on how parents can find accurate vaccine information on the
      internet, and another that addresses more common concerns of vaccine hesitant parents and
      available for our use from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Center website.

    <measure>Change in parental attitude regarding vaccines</measure>
    <time_frame>6-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Parental attitudes regarding vaccines will be assessed upon screening to determine the parental level of hesitancy regarding childhood vaccines. We will will use the same survey questions again immediately after the intervention and at the 2 month visit to measure change in parental attitude. We will also survey the control group at the 2 month check as well to compare attitude change without the intervention.</description>
