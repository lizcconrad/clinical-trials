  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective longitudinal study describing clinical throughput metrics and
      patient reported quality of life outcome measures for patients undergoing Volumetric
      modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with and without Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for head
      and neck carcinoma at the British Columbia Cancer Agency.

        1. VMAT for the treatment of patients with HNC will provide opportunities for image-guided
           radiotherapy using CBCT online correction to reduce systematic and random error.

        2. Analysis of patient reported quality of life outcomes during VMAT, with and without CBCT
           acquisition, will be hypothesis generating.
