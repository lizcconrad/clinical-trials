    <textblock>
      As part of ongoing efforts to determine the causes of asthma and the progression of the
      disease, this study will gather data to explore the interaction of genetic and environmental
      factors in the cause and severity of asthma in inner city children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a complex, heritable disease that affects more than 11.2% of the U.S. population,
      which represents approximately 9 million children and 23 million adults. It is thought that
      asthma may be caused by the interaction of multiple genetic factors, such as whether a parent
      or sibling has asthma, and environmental factors, such as living in an inner city. Studying
      DNA from people who have asthma and those who do not have asthma may help us better
      understand the importance of those genes and how they are involved in asthma severity and
      response to treatment.
