    <textblock>
      The objective of the prospective, multi-center study is to evaluate the ease of use and
      effectiveness of the SPiN Drive Electromagnetic (EM) Tip Tracked Steerable Devices as a
      method of sampling subsegmental, less than 3.0 cm, lung lesions through the airway, and
      beyond the bronchus. Measures of diagnostic yield will be compared to the diagnostic yield of
      similar published historical controls using conventional bronchoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Always On EM Tip Tracked Steerable catheters and biopsy devices used with the Veran Medical
      Technologies system are Food and Durg Administration 510K approved for use in diagnostic
      pulmonary procedures to locate and sample subsegmental peripheral, less than 3.0 centimeter
      lung lesions or solitary pulmonary nodules(SPN).

      Up to 20 subjects with radiographically confirmed peripheral lung lesions will be asked to
      participate in the study and proceed with informed consent. An interim analysis of the data
      will be conducted to determine the need to include an additional 10 patients to achieve
      statistically significant results at the ninety five percent confidence interval.

    <description>Patients screened by CT to have a subsegmental, less than 3.0 centimeter lung lesion will be assigned to outpatient bronchoscopy. The patient will have a chest CT with the Always on Patient vPad. Access to the lesion will be achieved using Electromagnetic Tip Tracked devices. Once accessed the operator will use the Electromagnetic Tip Tracked devices or standard devices to obtain a biopsy sample to then be to pathology for diagnosis and reporting. Once completed the patient will be moved to recovery and discharged. If the biopsy is negative the patient will be advised by the pulmonologist about other interventions, watchful waiting, or no further treatment. If the biopsy is positive, the patient will be referred to their physician for further treatment.</description>
