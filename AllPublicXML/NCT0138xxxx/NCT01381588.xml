      This is an observational study to investigate the prevalence of osteoporotic fractures in
      post menopausal patients. Post menopausal patients who visit OS(orthopedic surgery) including
      GHs(general hospitals) and clinics will be enrolled. They will take the evaluation of spine
      X-ray and answer to a few questions. Their medical record will be reviewed and relevant
      clinical findings will be collected.
