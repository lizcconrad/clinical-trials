      This is a clinical trial to study the safety and effectiveness of Autologous Muscle Derived
      Cells for Urinary Sphincter Repair (AMDC-USR) for the treatment of female stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI).

      Study comparing intrasphincteric injection of AMDC-USR with placebo. Subjects unblinded after
      12 months visits, but followed for 2 years. Subjects randomized to placebo could elect to
      receive open-label AMDC-USR after completing 12 months visit.

             limited to, anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants or alpha-adrenergic blockers,
             for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization or is likely to change during the course
             of the study.

          -  Patient is pregnant, lactating, or plans to become pregnant during the course of the
