      This study will look at Drug-Drug Interactions Between AT2220 (duvoglustat hydrochloride) and
      alglucosidase alfa (ERT) in Patients with Pompe Disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, international, open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence crossover
      study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic effect of single ascending doses of AT2220
      on GAA administered 1 hour before initiation of a single alglucosidase alfa infusion. During
      Period 1 subjects will receive a single intravenous infusion of alglucosidase alfa. During
      Period 2, each subject will receive one single oral dose of AT2220 one hour prior to
      initiation of a single alglucosidase alfa infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, diagnosed with Pompe disease and between 18 and 65 years of age,
             inclusive

          -  Subject has been on a stable regimen and dose of alglucosidase alfa or at least 3
             month before screening (stable regimen defined as currently receiving alglucosidase
             alfa every 2 weeks and stable dose defined as not varying by more than ± 10%)

          -  Subject has an estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min at Screening; eGFR to be
             estimated using the 4-parameter MDRD equation:

        eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (Scr)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if
        African-American)

          -  Male and female subjects of childbearing potential agree to use medically accepted
             methods of contraception during the study and for 30 days after study completion

          -  Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent and is able to comply
             with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had a documented transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, unstable
             angina or myocardial infarction within the 3 months before Screening

          -  Subject has clinically significant unstable cardiac disease (e.g., cardiac disease
             requiring active management, such as symptomatic arrhythmia, unstable angina or NYHA
             class III or IV congestive heart failure)

          -  Subject requiring mechanical ventilation or is confined to a wheelchair

          -  Subject has a history of allergy or sensitivity to study drug (including excipients)
             or other iminosugars (e.g., miglustat, miglitol)

          -  Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Subject tests positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody

          -  Subject has received any investigational/experimental drug or device within 30 days of
             Screening

          -  Subject has any intercurrent illness or condition that may preclude the subject from
             fulfilling the protocol requirements or suggests to the investigator that the
             potential subject may have an unacceptable risk by participating in this study
