        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males, non-smokers, between 18-55 years of age

          -  Subjects' weight will be within 15% of their ideal weight based on the Table of
             &quot;Desirable Weight of Adults&quot;, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1983.

          -  Subjects should read, sign, and date an Informed Consent Form prior to any study
             procedures

             administration of the study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities found during medical screening

          -  Any clinically significant history of ongoing gastrointestinal problems or problems
             known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs
             (e.g. chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases).

          -  Clinically significant illnesses within 4 weeks of the administration of study
             medication.

          -  History of allergic reactions to heparin.

          -  Any food allergies, intolerances, restrictions, or special diet which in the opinion
             of the medical sub-investigator, contraindicates the subject's participation in this
             study.

          -  Positive urine drug screen (see section VIII) at screening

          -  Positive testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV screening.

          -  Use of an investigational drug or participation in an investigational study, within 30
             days prior to administration of the study medication.

          -  Recent donation of plasma (500 mL) within 7 days or recent donation or significant
             loss of whole blood (450 mL) with 56 days prior to administration of the study
             medication.

          -  History of significant alcohol abuse within six months of the screening visit or any
             indication of the regular use of more than two units of alcohol per day (1 Unit = 150
             mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or 45 mL of alcohol 40%)

          -  Recent history of drug abuse or use of illegal drugs: use of soft drugs (such as
             marijuana, pot) within 3 months of the screening visit or hard drugs (such as cocaine,
             phencyclidine (PCP), crack) within 1 year of the screening visit.

          -  Subjects who have taken prescription medication 14 days preceding administration of
             study medication or over the counter products 7 days preceding administration of study
             medication, except for topical products without systemic absorption.

          -  Subjects who have taken any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism
             within 30 days prior to administration of the study medication (examples of inducers:
             barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, glucocorticoids, rifampin/rifabutin; examples
             of inhibitors: antidepressants, cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, ketoconazole, MAO
             inhibitors, neuroleptics, verapamil, quinidine).

          -  Subjects who have undergone clinically significant surgery 4 weeks prior to the
             administration of the study medication.

          -  Any reason which, in the opinion of the medical sub-investigator, would prevent the
             subject from participating in the study.
