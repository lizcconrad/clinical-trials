  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is often noted as an important component in a comprehensive approach to the
      management of Parkinson disease (PD). Most studies of exercise have examined the effects of
      short-term interventions and have tested participants on their anti-Parkinson medications. As
      such, these studies have not been able to determine whether or not exercise may have a
      disease-modifying effect in people with PD. The investigators recent work has shown the
      potential benefits of dance as a form of exercise for individuals with PD, but, like previous
      work, has only examined short-term interventions. The investigators think that dance may be
      ideally suited for study over a longer period of time because dance incorporates many of the
      features recommended for inclusion in PD-specific exercise programs in a format that is known
      to be engaging and to enhance motivation to participate in healthful behaviors. As such, the
      investigators aim to determine both the short- and long-term effectiveness of a
      community-based dance program for individuals with Parkinson disease and to determine how
      physical function changes over time in individuals with PD who do not exercise as compared to
      those who exercise regularly. The investigators hypothesize that:

      A) participation in dance will result in improved physical function, cognitive function, mood
      and quality of life in people with PD within 3 months,

      B) additional improvements will be noted at 6 months as compared to 3 months,

      C) improvements will be maintained at one year with continued, regular participation in a
      dance class,

      D) those who do not exercise will show significant functional decline over a period of one
      year, a decline that will not be present in those who dance regularly.

    <description>We will use the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Motor Subscale 3, to assess the severity of movement-related symptoms. This is a standanrdized and well-established tool composed of multiple items each scored on a 0-4 scale, with 0 indicating no impairment and 4 indication severe impairment. The overall severity of motor symptoms is determined by summing scores for all of the individual items.</description>
