  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous multisystem disorder of unknown etiology which often presents
      with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltration and ocular and skin lesions. In
      addition to possible changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and carbon monoxide transfer
      factor (TLCO), a higher prevalence of clinical depression, reduced health status and exercise
      intolerance have been observed in patients with sarcoidosis.

      Reduced health status has been related to decreased pulmonary function, depressive symptoms,
      and to respiratory muscle weakness. Exercise capacity is believed to be limited by dyspnea,
      an insufficient heart rate response, decreased arterial oxygen tension during exercise,
      excessive and inefficient ventilation and by respiratory muscle weakness.

      In the past, exercise capacity was shown to be limited by skeletal muscle weakness in
      patients with chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease. 67% of the sarcoidosis patients studied
      by Miller et al terminated their peak exercise test due to &quot;leg complaints&quot;. Skeletal muscle
      weakness is therefore still assumed to be present in patients with sarcoidosis.

      Treatment with oral corticosteroids, clinical symptoms of depression, myositis, self-reported
      complaints of fatigue and high circulating levels of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are all
      present in patients with sarcoidosis and can all affect skeletal muscle force and exercise
      capacity. Additionally, low levels of circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which
      can be induced by high levels of TNF-α, and high circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and
      IL-8 (CXCL8) have been associated with skeletal muscle weakness. These interleukins are part
      of the current concept of the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis16 and may be raised in
      patients with stable sarcoidosis.

      Recent studies have shown that pulmonary rehabilitation program can lead to improve in the
      health status and anxiety among patients with chronic obstructive lung disease .However, no
      study has evaluated the role of pulmonary rehabilitation among patients with sarcoidosis.

        Fifty consecutive Pulmonary sarcoidosis patients who are treated at the outpatient
        interstitial lung disease clinic in MEIR Medical Center.

        Pulmonary Sarcoidosis will be diagnosed according to the latest ATS/ERS/WASOG statement on
        sarcoidosis.1 Diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis. The morphologic diagnosis of pulmonary
        sarcoidosis relies on three main findings: the presence of tight, well-formed granulomas
        and a rim of lymphocytes and fibroblasts in the outer margin of granulomas; perilymphatic
        interstitial distribution of granulomas (which allows transbronchial biopsies to be used as
        sensitive diagnostic tools); and exclusion of an alternative cause
