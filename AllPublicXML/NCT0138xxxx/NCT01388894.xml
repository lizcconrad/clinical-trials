    <textblock>
      Patients who report that exposure to bright light or strenuous physical activity will induce
      migraine aura will be provoked using one or both of these methods. Followingly the patients
      will be examined by functional MRI. √çf the patients develop migraine headache, MR angiography
      will be performed as well. The primary study hypothesis is that the functional MRI signal
      will show features similar to those of the electrophysiological phenomenon of cortical
      spreading depression.
