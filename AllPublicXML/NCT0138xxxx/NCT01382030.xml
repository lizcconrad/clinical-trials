    <textblock>
      Neo- and adjuvant chemotherapy is used in high-risk soft tissue sarcoma to improve systemic
      control. Patients in this trial are treated with 4 cycles of chemotherapy (EIA, etoposide,
      ifosfamide, adriamycin) preoperatively, followed by local surgery and radiotherapy. An
      additional 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy is administered. Treatment response is assessed
      by MRI and CT scans and FDG-PET in a subgroup of patients.

    <textblock>
      The role of chemotherapy in high-risk soft tissue sarcoma is controversial. Though many
      patients undergo initial curative resection, distant metastasis is a frequent event resulting
      in 5-year overall survival rates of only 50 - 60%. Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy has
      been applied to achieve pre-operative cytoreduction, assess chemosensitivity and to eliminate
      occult metastasis. The current protocol comprises for cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      ((EIA, etoposide 125 mg/m2 iv days 1 and 4, ifosfamide 1500 mg/m2 iv days 1 - 4, doxorubicin
      50 mg/m2 day 1, pegfilgrastim 6 mg sc day 5), local surgery and radiotherapy as well as
      further 4 cycles of adjuvant EIA. Treatment response is assessed by MRI and CT scans and
      FDG-PET in a subgroup of patients.
