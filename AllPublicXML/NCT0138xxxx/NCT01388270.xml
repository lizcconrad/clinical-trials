  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the heparin-coated dialysis filter is
      superior to a conventional filter during hemodialysis in twelve stable, chronic hemodialysis
      (HD) patients.

      The antithrombogenic properties of the heparin-coated dialysis filter and of the conventional
      filter will be compared by means of statistical tests.

    <textblock>
      In the present study twelve chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients will be included. Exclusion
      criteria are use of acetylsalicylic acid and/warfarin, clinical signs of infection and
      disseminated malignant disease. For each patient four HD sessions will be investigated;
      alternating with use of the pre-heparin-coated filter or the conventional filter. Dalteparin
      is reduced to 50% of the conventional dose and is given as one single bolus dose at start of
      HD.

      The venous drip chamber will be visually inspected for evaluation of clot score during each
      HD session. The filter will be visually inspected for clot score at the end of each session.

      Blood specimens will be drawn systematically during each HD session to evaluate platelet and
      coagulation activity as well as anti Factor Xa activity, haematology and urea/creatinine to
      evaluate dialysis effect.

      The antithrombogenic properties of the pre-heparin-coated filter and the conventional filter
      will be compared by means of statistical tests. The hypothesis is that the pre-heparin-coated
      filter induces significantly less clot score in the extracorporeal system during hemodialysis
      and also significantly less intravascular activation of the coagulation system compared to
      the conventional filter.
