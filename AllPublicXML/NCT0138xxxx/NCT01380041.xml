    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the brain leading to disability. Brain
      MRI is very useful for MS diagnosis but prognostic biomarkers are still needed. New therapies
      are also expected to improve MS care. Cytokine arrays provide measure of many different
      inflammation-related molecules that could help understanding the disease. Moreover,
      individual prognosis could be linked with the level of such molecules in the CSF of MS
      patients. The investigators will analyze the cytokine profile of MS and control patients CSF
      to determine a specific profile of MS and look for prognosis implication in a cohort of
      patients with clinically isolated syndromes (first manifesatation of MS).

      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the brain leading to disability. Early
      treatment could allow better prognosis for the patients in the long term by reducing relapses
      rates and neurological palsy. However, individual prognostic biomarkers are still needed to
      adapt the treatment to a given patient. CSF is a strategic body fluid to explore in
      neurological diseases. In MS, it contains an elevated IgG index and/or oligoclonal bands
      reflecting the intrathecal synthesis of Igs around the brain. The levels of other
      inflammatory molecules such cytokines and metalloproteases are also known to be elevated in
      MS (GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-2, MMP9, TIMP-1, TNF-α, RANTES, MCP-1 and MIP-1). These
      molecules can now be easily measured by protein arrays.The aim of this study is to measure
      the level of 40 cytokines and 10 MMPs by means of protein arrays in the CSF from clinically
      definite MS (CDMS) patients, control patients and patients with a clinically isolated
      syndrome (CIS). The best MS markers will be determined using multiple ROC curves. Markers of
      rapid conversion to CDMS after a CIS will also be looked for.The best MS candidate biomarkers
      will be analyzed by ELISA in a new cohort of patients being recruited.
