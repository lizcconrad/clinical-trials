      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of extracorporeal
      photopheresis therapy when added to standard drug therapies administered to patients with
      moderate to severe chronic graft-versus-host disease.

      This is an open-label study (patients and study staff will know the identity of treatments
      assigned during the study) in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD).
      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (a donator-versus-recipient-disease) is a complication that
      can occur after a blood stem cell or bone marrow transplant with cells from a related or
      unrelated donator. During cGvHD, the transplanted cells attack the recipient's body. Patients
      with cGVHD who meet entry criteria for the study will be randomly assigned to receive
      standard of care treatment for 26 weeks or standard or care treatment with extracorporeal
      photopheresis (ECP) for 26 weeks. Standard of care treatment consists of orally (taken by
      mouth) administered corticosteroids (drugs that reduce inflammation) and cyclosporine (CsA)or
      Tacrolimus ( drugs that suppress the patient's immune response). ECP therapy is a process
      that takes place in a device where the investigational drug UVADEX (methoxsalen) is injected
      into a germ-free bag mixed with the patient's white blood cells. After the blood cells have
      absorbed the drug and are exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, the blood cells are
      injected back into the patient's body. During the study, a third party assessor at each study
      center who will be blinded (will not know) to treatment will assess the condition each
      patient's skin and oral mucosa at protocol-specified visits and will complete a total skin
      score for all patients . The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open label
      treatment phase and an end-of-study (or early withdrawal) phase. The duration of patient
      participation will be 28 weeks and patient safety will be monitored throughout the study. An
      additional non-interventional 2 year follow-up will begin after the 28 week/withdrawal
      end-of-study phase.
