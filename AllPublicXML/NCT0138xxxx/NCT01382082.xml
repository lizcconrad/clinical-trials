  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments in cancer patients represent an important clinical problem. Studies to
      date estimating prevalence of difficulties in memory, executive function, and attention
      deficits have been limited by small sample sizes and many have lacked healthy control groups.
      More information is needed on promising biomarkers and allelic variants that may help to
      determine the etiology of impairment, identify those most vulnerable to impairment, and
      develop interventions for these difficulties.

      This is a longitudinal observational study of cognitive function in breast cancer and
      lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy to better understand the prevalence of cognitive
      difficulties (i.e., problems with memory, executive function, and attention) in these
      populations.
