  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fragility fractures are one of the commonest injuries among elderly people in Hong Kong and
      account for 12% of the disease burden in elderly aged 65 or above.

      A good management healthcare program and training helps elderly to restore full functional
      level and prevent re-fracture in the following 2 years after primary fracture, but Hong Kong
      lacks of such program. Some reports from other countries pointed out a well-organized
      multi-disciplinary management programs are cost-effective to identify and treat osteoporosis,
      reduce the fracture rate, improve quality of life and raise awareness of fragility fracture.

      This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of multi-disciplinary management program
      with conventional care controls. The clinical effectiveness outcomes (re-fracture rate, fall
      rate, mortality, mobility, quality of life and specialist follow-up time) of the fragility
      hip fracture patients in New Territories East receiving the proposed management program will
      be compared with those from Kowloon Central with usual care as controls. The findings will
      provide useful data for the policy maker to evaluate the current clinical service for
      fragility fracture patients and consider the implementation of new multi-disciplinary
      management program into our healthcare system.
