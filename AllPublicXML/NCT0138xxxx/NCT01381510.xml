  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence and length of therapy with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI) treatment may be
      associated with improved clinical outcomes of enlarged prostate (EP) as well as lower health
      care costs.

      The objective of this retrospective database analysis is to quantify the relationship between
      adherence and length of therapy with a 5ARI and the likelihood of acute urinary retention
      (AUR) or prostate surgery (emergency and non-emergency) in patients with benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH). The study will also measure the economic impact associated with these
      medical encounters.

      The MarketScan database contains data from people with commercial health insurance and
      Medicare and includes both medical and pharmacy data that are sourced directly from health
      plans and employers. Approximately 18 million covered lives will be utilized for this study
      in the time period from January 1, 2003 to September 30, 2009.

      This study is a retrospective cohort analysis of medical claims data.

        The study is populated with claims data from male health plan members and Medicare patients
        age 50 and older who were continuously enrolled in a health plan that feeds into the
        MarketScan database between July 1, 2003 and May 1, 2009. Patient records were analyzed for
        6 months prior to and at least 150 days following the index date for the first 5-alpha
        reductase inhibitor (5ARI) treatment
