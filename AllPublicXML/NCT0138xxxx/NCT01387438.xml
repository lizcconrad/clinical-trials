    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that active brown adipose tissue (BAT) is present in adults and
      may play important roles in material and energy metabolism. However, most of these studies
      were tumor-based populations and retrospective study. Due to the large amount in our cohort,
      the investigators are able to promote a cross-sectional study of the incidence and factors of
      BAT in adult chinese. In addition, the investigators can analyse the metabolic profiles in
      healthy adults with active BAT.

      The investigators will perform a cross sectional analysis on the chinese adults who use
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to scan the
      whole body at Huashan Hospital from 2009 to 2013. BAT activity will be measured by PET/CT.
      Not only demographic data on sex, age, medication and medical history,but also data on body
      composition and physical examination will be collected for all subjects. Imaging date,outdoor
      temperature and fasting blood samples will be collected as well. In addition, the
      investigators will analyse the metabolic profiles in healthy adults with active BAT and their
      negative controls,such as lipid profiles,fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity, adipokines
      and other biochemical markers.
