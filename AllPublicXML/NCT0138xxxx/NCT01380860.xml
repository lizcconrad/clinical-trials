  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare rates of hernia formation between colostomies created
      with no hernia preventing mesh versus colostomies created with a particular mesh.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies indicate that implanting mesh for peristomal hernia repair may efficiently
      prevent hernia relapse. However, mesh provides a good infection site, which is not a
      desirable characteristic for a material adjacent to a colostomy &quot;port&quot;. Our goal is to
      implement a high-quality, randomized trial to demonstrate whether or not systematic mesh
      implantation upon primary hernia creation is an effective means of avoiding this common and
      troublesome complication.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of peristomal hernias is determined in both groups every three months up until 24 months. The presence of absence of a hernia is detected by clinical exam, and at 24 months by an additional radiology exam. The primary outcome concerns rates at 24 months, primo-events only.</description>
