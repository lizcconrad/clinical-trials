      A Phase II Study of AUY922, Novel HSP Inhibitor, in Patients with Advanced GIST Failed to or
      Intolerance of Imatinib and Sunitinib Therapy

      Primary endpoint:

      •The primary endpoint of this study is to assess disease control rate (complete response +
      partial response + stable disease≧4 months) of AUY922 in patients with advanced GIST failed
      to imatinib and sunitinib

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  To determinate the objective response rate (ORR, complete response + partial response)

        -  To determinate the time to tumor progression (TTP)

        -  To evaluate the safety and toxicity profiles of AUY922

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile of AUY922 in Taiwan GIST population

        -  To access the pharmacodynamic effect of AUY922 on HSP client proteins in blood and tumor
           if feasible , i.e. HSP70, in Taiwan GIST population

        -  To access the tissue biomarkers pre-treatment and 4wks post treatment if feasible, i.e.
           HSP70, c-KIT, PDGFRA mutation, ...etc in Taiwan GIST population

      Exploratory endpoints:

      •PET imaging; sSUVmax

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic phase II study of AUY922 in
      patients with advanced GIST failed to or intolerance of imatinib and sunitinib therapy.
      AUY922 is a novel HSP90 inhibitor and will be administered at dose of 70 mg/m2 i.v. infusion
      on D1 every week. The Simon one sample two-stage minimax design was used with 15 suitable
      patients to be accrued to the first stage. If at least two patients meet our primary endpoint
      (complete response＋partial response＋stable disease≧4 months), an additional 10 patients would
      be recruited to the second stage. AUY922 would be considered active in this patient
      population, if there were more than 5 cases of non-progressive disease in the total cohort of
      25 patients.
