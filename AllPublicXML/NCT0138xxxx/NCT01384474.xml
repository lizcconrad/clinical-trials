    <description>Assistance by a local caregiver investigator (i.e., surgeon, anaesthetist, nurse,...) responsible for the implementation of surgical safety checklist within the operatory rooms of his department ;
A two-step CRM training of surgical teams (i.e., surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses,...) conducted by advisors from the world of air company using video support:
First month following randomization: a course about the implementation of surgical safety checklist (using online-available WHO short movies and other videos of surgical teams) and core concepts of CRM adapted to the operating room;
Sixth month following randomization: a feedback to surgical teams aiming at identifying and solving barriers related to the checklist implementation and interpersonal communication
Written reminders including the systematic presence of an unfilled surgical safety checklist in the patient's medical report, stickers and wall posters in operatory rooms</description>
