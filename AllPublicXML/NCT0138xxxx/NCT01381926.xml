  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine changes in bone turnover markers and calcitonin
      following the initiation of exenatide compared to placebo in postmenopausal women wtih type 2
      diabetes.

      Hypothesis 1a: Bone resorption (measured by osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline
      phosphatase) will be lower and bone formation (measured by type I collagen crosslinked
      aminoterminal peptide in urine (Urine NTX)) will be higher when subjects are treated with
      exenatide compared to when subjects are treated with placebo.

      Hypothesis 1b: Calcitonin levels will not vary significantly between periods of treatment
      with exenatide vs. placebo.

    <textblock>
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are at an increased risk of fracture, despite
      having bone mineral density (BMD) levels similar to age and sex matched cohorts. Recent
      studies have indicated that changes in incretin (INtestinal seCRETion of INsulin) hormones in
      the setting of T2DM may play a role in bone metabolism. Two of these incretin hormones,
      gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), have been shown to
      be involved in bone turnover regulation, in addition to their effect in increasing insulin
      secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. In addition, the
      rise in glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) in the postprandial state has been found to have a
      direct effect on reduced bone resorption in a non-fasting state and treatment with GLP-2
      improved BMD in postmenopausal women. Due to their glucose lowering effects, incretin
      hormones have been a therapeutic target for the treatment of T2DM through GLP-1 receptor
      agonists (i.e. exenatide) or inhibition of incretin hormone metabolism via dipeptidyl
      peptidase 4 (DPP-4)inhibitors. The GLP-1 receptor analog exenatide leads to an approximate
      13-fold increased GLP-1 effect compared to approximate doubling of incretin hormone levels
      with current DDP-4 inhibitors. In rodent models, calcitonin levels rise significantly
      following treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists, leading to c-cell hyperplasia. However,
      review of calcitonin changes in humans and cynomolgus monkeys treated with GLP-1 receptor
      agonists have not shown similar results.
