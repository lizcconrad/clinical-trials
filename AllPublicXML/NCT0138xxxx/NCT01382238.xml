  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor currently in Phase 3 clinical trials
      for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A granule formulation has
      been developed as an alternative to the current tablet formulation for administration in
      pediatric populations.

      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, 5-way crossover study in healthy adult
      subjects. The study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of a 50 mg granule formulation
      of dolutegravir when administered 1) directly to mouth; 2) with purified water; 3) with
      Contrex brand water; and 4) with milk-based infant formula compared to the current 50 mg
      tablet formulation administered with tap water. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will
      be collected during each treatment period. A taste assessment of the granule will also be
      performed. A follow-up visit will occur 5-7 days after the last dose of study drug.

      Pharmacokinetic assessments during the study will include area under the concentration-time
      curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC(0-infinity)), area under
      the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to last time of quantifiable
      concentration within a subject across all treatments (AUC(0-t)), maximum observed
      concentration (Cmax), terminal phase half-life (t½), lag time before observation of drug
      concentrations in sampled matrix (tlag), time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax), concentration at
      24 hours post-dose (C24), and apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F).

    <description>Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug, five treatment periods containing a single dose of study drug, followed by 48 hours of serial PK collection. In the 5 treatment periods subjects will receive DTG granule formulation 1) directly to mouth; 2) with purified water; 3) with Contrex brand water; and 4) with milk-based infant formula. They will also receive the current 50 mg tablet formulation administered with tap water. These treatments will be administered in a random order. Subjects will check out of the unit on Day 3 after the 48 hour PK sample in each period. Study periods will be separated by at least 5 days. Subjects will have a follow-up visit 5-7 days after last dose of DTG given.</description>

          -  ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5x upper limit of
             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). A single repeat is allowed for eligibility determination.
