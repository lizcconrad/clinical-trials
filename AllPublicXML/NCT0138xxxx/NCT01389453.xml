      All experimental group patients of 100 patients accept a treatment course stem cell
      transplantation, including one time stem cell transplantation through intravenous injection
      way at the 10-21th day of cerebral hemorrhage, and the 7—14th day of cerebral infarction
      incidence; the second time transplantation through lumbar puncture way at the 7th day after
      the First time transplantation. The control group gives injection through intravenous and
      lumbar puncture ways separately in the corresponding time, but the transplantation matter is
      physiological saline not the stem cell.

          3. the hemorrhage, block region：One side basis festival area, one side brain stem;

          4. the patient must catch the apoplexy at the first time and the accidence causes the
             obvious clinical symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:
