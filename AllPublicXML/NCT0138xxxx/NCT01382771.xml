  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects (N=120) who have had non-radicular low back pain, believed by clinical assessment
      and imaging to be consistent with lumbar zygapophysial joint (Z-joint) generated pain, who
      have failed conservative therapy including physical therapy, have had an initial &gt;80% pain
      relief on a diagnostic medial branch block, and are scheduled to undergo a routine second
      medial branch block for facet mediated pain will be randomized. Both groups will receive the
      standard of care, a medial branch block. The treatment group will also receive one set of
      intra-articular lumbar Z-joint corticosteroid injection and the placebo group will receive
      intra-articular normal saline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will have failed conservative treatment, including, but not limited to oral
      medications, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, and/or alternative medicine. They will
      be evaluated by a spine specialist in the Spine Division of the Department of Orthopaedics
      and will be schedule for a medial branch block as standard of care. As part of usual and
      standard care, patients will undergo lumbar medial branch blocks for diagnosis of
      zygapophysial joint pain.

      Patients who obtain ≥ to 80% relief of their index pain with a first set of lumbar medial
      branch blocks will be offered the opportunity for possible inclusion in the study if they are
      scheduled to receive a second medial branch block. The definition of a positive response to
      MBB's is an 80% reduction in pain (by change in NPR scores or estimated patient improvement)
      AND the restoration of the ability to perform at least one previously painful posture,
      movement, or activity without increase in pain, during the anesthetic phase of the blocks. If
      subjects are unable to render NPR scores or percentage estimate of improvement, then a 5
      point global perception of effect tool will be used.
