  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the use of proton pump inhibitors and available prokinetics, medical therapy is
      ineffective in an important number of children with cerbreal palsy (CP) and gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD), and failure of medical therapy is associated with a substantial
      morbidity. Many patients, particularly children with CP and GERD, continue to experience
      complications despite aggressive therapy because antisecretory medications do not address the
      primary reflux mechanism (TLESR). Furthermore, in patients with CP, surgical options are
      fraught with serious complications and long-term morbidity. Because the available treatment
      options for children with CP and intractable GERD are limited, new therapies are urgently
      needed. Baclofen, which has been shown in animals and humans to decrease TLESRs, may be a
      good alternative for the treatment of children with CP with intractable GERD.
