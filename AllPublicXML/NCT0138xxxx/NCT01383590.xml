  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Cat-PAD is a novel synthetic, allergen derived peptide
      desensitizing vaccine currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy.

      At present, the efficacy of immunotherapy (peptide or otherwise) can only be established at
      the conclusion of therapy. The aim of this study is to identify changes in potential
      biomarkers after peptide immunotherapy that may be subsequently developed as biomarkers that
      equate with clinical efficacy.

    <description>Blood samples derived from the study will be submitted for proteomics analyses aimed at the identification of one or more plasma proteins whose concentration over the course of the study varies in relation to the treatment administered. The outcome will be determined on the basis of measurements from samples collected over a period commencing prior to treatment and ending 6 months following treatment.</description>
