  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that psoriasis is a systemic disorder which enhances
      atherosclerosis and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies have shown an
      independent association between psoriasis and atherosclerosis, stroke and coronary artery
      disease. The main goal of this on-going study is to register data which will enable the
      identification of new markers of atherosclerosis activity and carotid plaque instability in
      patients with severe psoriasis.

        Patients who have had psoriasis for more than 5 years are being admitted to the study. The
        assessments include: clinical data, treatment, platelet aggregation and blood viscosity,
        serum markers and mediators of atherosclerosis, carotid IMT and plaque burden assessed by
        Color Duplex ultrasound. The patients are recruited from our dermatological department (in
        and outdoor patients)
