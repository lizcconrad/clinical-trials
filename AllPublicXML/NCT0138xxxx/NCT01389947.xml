  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digestive tract is supposed to be the motor of multiple organ failure. In ICU patients,
      mesenteric ischemia appears even when macrocirculatory parameters are controlled especially
      in our experience in patients coming in ICU after a cardiac surgery. The investigators
      suppose that microcirculatory failure develops and results in suffering of non major organs
      like muscle, skin and digestive tracts. In this study the investigators monitor digestive
      tract with plasmatic IFABP dosage and microcirculatory circulation with NIRS during a VOT and
      plasma glycocalyx measurements. The population is composed by patients having coronary artery
      bypass during cardiopulmonary bypass.

      The first aim of this study is to show that digestive tract is suffering with the use of
      extracorporeal circulation and will be assessed with Plasmatic Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding
      Protein when IFABP will more than 300 pg/ml ; and with citrullinemia when citrullinemia will
      be less than 20 micromol/L.

      The second aim is to investigate link between endothelial dysfunction and digestive tract.
      Endothelial dysfunction is assessed with tissular oxygen saturation before, during and after
      a vascular occlusion test of 3 minutes (measurement of basal value, desaturation curve,
      resaturation curve and hyperemic response by measurement of area under curve). Endothelial
      glycocalyx and NO pathway will be investigate (see under)

      Our objective is to enroll 100 patients. The same study will be done in a group of patients
      who benefit from coronary artery bypass without extracorporeal circulation to see the effects
      of extracorporeal circulation support.

      Population study is patients who benefit from coronary artery bypass grafting under
      extracorporeal circulation support during intervention. Extracorporeal circulation result in
      SIRS. We aim to study digestive tract during this intervention.

      There are 5 times of measurements : under stable hemodynamic conditions and after beginning
      of anesthesia, just at the end of extracorporeal circulation, about 15 minutes following
      aortic unclamping and at the end of the Protamine perfusion, about 90 minutes after the end
      of extracorporeal circulation and the last time measurement 24 hours later.

      At each time measurement are done : blood samples to measure Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding
      Protein, Citrullinemia that are markers for digestive suffering ; blood samples for
      measurement of Syndecan 1 CD 138 and Heparan Sulfate, two markers of shedding of the
      endothelial glycocalyx; blood samples for measurement of NOx and GMPc to assess the NO
      pathway ; measurement of tissular oxygen saturation with a NIRS probe, before, during and
      after a vascular occlusion test of 3 minutes. Blood samples for hemoglobin, platelets,
      coagulation evaluation, urea, creatininemia, liver enzymes and pancreatic enzymes will be
      done at each time.

      The vascular occlusion test is done the day before the surgery when patient is awake without
      any exercise. This is a reference measurement.

    <measure>Proving that digestive failure appears with extracorporeal circulation for cardiac surgery and is more frequent than the 1 to 3 % percent admitted in precedent studies using clinical endpoints.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Digestive suffering will be assessed by clinical measurment (pain, vomiting), classical biologic measurment and new specific measurment (intestinal fatty acid binding protein : IFABP and citrullinemia. Plasmatic IFABP of more than 300 pg/ml and citrullinemia of more than 20 micromol/L are used as cut-off to define intestinal failure.
Microcirculatory will be assessed via a Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) probe ajusted on the thenar eminence for the tissular oxygen saturation measurment before, during and after a vascular occlusion test of 3 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Study links between endothelial impairment and digestive suffering</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Digestive suffering was define before.
Endothelial impairment is define using :
Tissular Oxygen Saturation during vascular occlusion test. The reasturation curve represents endothelial vasodilatory capacities
Elevation of Syndecan and Heparan shows the shedding of endothelial glycocalyx We will study the links and the correlation between syndecan and heparan elevation with diminution of resaturation curve and digestive suffering NOx and GMPc will help us for the interpretation of NIRS curves.</description>
