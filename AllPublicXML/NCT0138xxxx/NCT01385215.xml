      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the influenza
      vaccine when administered nasally and intra-muscular (a &quot;shot&quot; of medicine given into a
      muscle). The investigators will measure the systemic (through out the body) and mucosal
      immune responses (how your body recognizes and defends itself against bacteria) to nasally
      administered influenza vaccine, and determine if nasal immunization results in immunity (your
      body's ability to avoid infections) within multiple mucosal compartments (ocular (eye), oral
      and reproductive), in comparison with intramuscular administration and placebo (inactive
      substance given in the same form as the active drug).
