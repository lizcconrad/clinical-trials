  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EGFR mutations plays an essential role in EGFR-TKIs treatment. However, for some patients,
      tissue samples are not available. The purpose of this study is to determine whether blood
      sample is feasible for EGFR mutation detection.For late stage NSCLC, we hypothesis plasma
      sample is an alternative for detecting EGFR mutations.
