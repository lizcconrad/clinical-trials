    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant anti-tumor
      and anti-virus protein for injection in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      after failure of second-line and more than second-line treatment.

      Explanation for study design

      The trial including two stages. The first is an exploration stage to decide delivery
      frequency and dose of study drug. It is single-blinded, subjects will be randomly divided
      into 4 groups with a 2:2:2:1 ratio. Study drug given twice per week or 3 times per, dose of
      the drug are from 20μg to 40μg. The sample size is 105, duration is 12 to 18 months. Based on
      preliminary efficacy and safety, the better dosage regimen will decided for the second
      stage.The second stage is double-blinded,subject will be randomly divided into treatment
      group or placebo group with 2:1 ratio and sample size is 600.

      Primary purpose

      To compare overall survival between study drug and placebo groups .

      Secondary purpose

        1. Progression free survival were compared in both groups.

        2. Disease control rate were compared in both groups.

        3. Quality of life scores were compared in both groups.

        4. Determine the safety and tolerance of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for
           injection

        5. Supplementary pharmacodynamics of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for
           injection

      Exploratory purpose Evaluate effects of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for
      injection on the anti-tumor immunity, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, immune
      cells and cytokines levels.

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>every 2 weeks in first 4 weeks and every 4 weeks after 4 weeks, it will last to the treatment end.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is assessed using EORTC-C30 (the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer.)</description>

    <measure>Adverse Events(AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>from informed consent form signed to 28 days after termination of administration.</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pharmacodynamics</measure>
    <time_frame>The first 2 weeks during 10ug dosage were given and the following 11weeks during 20ug dosage were given</time_frame>
    <description>As the drug concentration is very low, and no commercialized kits for original drug test, So original drug will not detect. Mopterin and MxA protein (alternate index) levels in serum will be used as alternative targets for pharmacodynamic studies</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>every 6 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>The disease control rate is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease as best overall response according to radiological assessments (based on modified WHO criteria)</description>
