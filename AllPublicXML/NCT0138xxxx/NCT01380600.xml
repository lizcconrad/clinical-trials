  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot safety study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JX-594
      (Pexa-Vec) administered intravenously every 2 weeks in colorectal carcinoma patients who are
      refractory to or intolerant of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and Erbitux treatments.

             tumor advanced either immediately or within 3 months of the end of treatment, or there
             is no response to Erbitux therapy due to a lack of expression of EGFR (epidermal
