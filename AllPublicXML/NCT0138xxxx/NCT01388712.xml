  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common cause of children chronic constipation is functional disorders. Functional
      constipation is diagnosed after excluding organic causes of constipation (anatomical,
      neurological, endocrinological) and identification of two symptoms defined by the Rome III
      criteria. There could be low number of bowel movements (below three times a week), defecation
      pain, fecal incontinence (once a week), stool consistency or occurrence of large diameter
      stools. The treatment is change of diet, defecation training and application of laxatives.

      The probiotics are defined as living microorganisms, which provided in a proper doses should
      result in beneficial effect on a host health. The assessment of its characteristic is related
      to strain of bacteria affiliation.

      Taking into the consideration that patients with constipation may experience microflora
      intestine disorders, using the probiotics can have the positive impact on process of treating
      this disease. The additional reason for using the probiotics during the constipation
      treatment is an influence of probiotics on movement of the alimentary canal.

      In spite of proved effectiveness of some probiotics' strains further research are required,
      because clinical significance is ambiguous and the effect is confirmed among patients with
      short medical history. That's way the further analysis of probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM
      17938, which was successful treatment method of chronic constipation amongst children
      (infants) should be performed.

      The primary aim of the study is the assessment of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 efficacy,
      provided with macrogol (Forlax), as treatment of constipation in 3-7 years old children. The
      baseline of estimation is the frequency comparison of bowel movement in children belonging
      into two groups: Lactobacillus reuteri treatment and placebo.

      The secondary aim of the study is the assessment of frequency the additional symptoms
      connected with defecation disorders: such as: number of pain episodes during defecation, the
      intensity of pain, number of hard stools, number of fecal incontinence per week, number of
      macrogol (Forlax) pockets used.

      The investigators believe that constipation treatment (laxatives- macrogol) with
      Lactobacillus reuteri has better efficacy that the same treatment without Lactobacillus
      reuteri in 3-7 years old children with medical history of chronic constipation.
