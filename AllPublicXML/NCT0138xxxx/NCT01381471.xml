      The specific aim of this study is to describe 1 year Advair dispensing rates for patients
      with COPD, and to measure the association between Advair adherence and healthcare utilization
      (e.g. emergency room visits and inpatient admissions, etc.). To compare the risk of a COPD
      exacerbation (moderate or severe) during a 3-month follow-up period between patients thqat
      are adherent versus those that are not.

        Patients 40 years of age or older with at least one pharmacy claim for FSC during the index
        date range (July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006). An index date was designated as the date
        of the first pharmacy claim for FSC. Patients were also required to have continuous medical
        and pharmacy eligibility for the 12 month pre-Index year and the 12 month Index year
        (referred to as the 24 month observation period), and the 3 month post-Index outcome period
        (referred to as the outcome period). Eligible patients were further required to have at
        least one medical claim with a diagnosis (either primary or secondary) of COPD (ICD-9-CM
        code 490.xx, 491.xx, 492.xx, and 496), AND at least 1 pharmacy claim for an anticholinergic
        medication, both occurring during the12 month pre-index period.
