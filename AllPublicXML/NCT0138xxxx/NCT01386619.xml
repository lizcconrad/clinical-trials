  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study of highly selected donor lymphocyte infusions in patients
      undergoing HLA-haploidentical hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients will be offered
      &quot;pre-emptive&quot; NK-DLI early after HSCT.

      Three schedules of NK-cell infusion will be studied: Basel patients (adult and pediatric)
      will receive NK-DLI on days +40 and +100 (pre-emptive-late); Frankfurt patients (pediatric)
      will receive NK-DLI on days +3, +40, and +100 (pre-emptive early). Patients not receiving
      pre-emptive NK-DLI with loss in donor chimerism or with evidence of minimal residual disease
      will be offered &quot;therapeutic&quot; NK-DLI.

    <measure>Feasibility of NK-DLI production</measure>
    <time_frame>At day of transplant (day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of the production of expanded NK-cell DLI will be measured. Primary quality measures of the NK cell product are the number of NK cells that can be produced (CD56+/cluster of differentiation 3(CD3)- NK cell goal dose &gt;= 1 * 10e7/kg body weight of recipient) as well as the degree of CD3 T-cell contamination (goal CD3+ T-cell dose &lt; 1 * 10e5 / kg body weight of recipient).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of NK DLI Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Day +60 after transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The safety evaluation regards transfusion associated adverse events (fever, fall in blood pressure, transfusion site reactions, etc) and is evaluated at the time of NK DLI infusion. The primary long-term safety measure is the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease 30 days after the last NK DLI infusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of NK DLI Infusions</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years after last NK DLI</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of NK DLI infusions will be assessed by evaluation of the rates of overall and disease free survival and the rate of disease relapse. As this is a single arm study, outcome measures assessed will be compared to those of historical controls treated with haploidentical HSCT without NK DLI infusions.</description>
