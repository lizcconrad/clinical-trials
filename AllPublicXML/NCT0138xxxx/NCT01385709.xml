  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether blood levels of lithium or sertraline are
      affected by different phases of the menstrual cycle and whether there is an effect on
      psychiatric symptoms. Subjects are seen for two visits: one visit during the luteal phase and
      one visit during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. On each visit, they will fill
      out a depression, anxiety and mania rating scale. Also at each visit a 20mL blood sample will
      be drawn to measure progesterone level and either a lithium or sertraline level, depending on
      which medication the patient takes. The primary hypothesis in this study is that blood levels
      of lithium and sertraline will be significantly lower in women during the luteal phase of the
      menstrual cycle than during the follicular phase. Examination will also be made of whether
      symptoms will increase in severity during the luteal phase as compared to the follicular
      phase. The investigators expect a negative linear association between symptom severity and
      blood level, i.e. expect symptom severity to worsen as blood levels of lithium or sertraline
      decrease.

    <description>Therefore, patients who are already taking psychotropic medications, and therefore are currently in treatment for a psychiatric illness, will be recruited. The specific psychiatric diagnoses anticipated in the subject pool include the conditions that sertraline is indicated to treat, including Bipolar Affective Disorders, Cyclothymic Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. Patients must be female, between the ages of 18-40, taking either sertraline on a daily basis for at least one week. Exclusion criteria include 1) currently pregnant or breastfeeding, 2) concurrent use of any form of hormonal birth control, including oral contraceptive pills, Norplant or Depo-provera, 3) hepatic or renal disease, 4) irregular menstrual cycles.</description>
