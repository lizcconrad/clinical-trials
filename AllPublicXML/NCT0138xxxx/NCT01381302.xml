      The study population will include 100 parkinsonian patients in early stage of disease, with
      total duration not exeeding 5 years.

      The patients will undergo neurologic examination and evaluation of disease severity using the
      unified PD rating scale. Subsequently a brain SPECT will be performed using Tc-99m-Trodat1.

      The study sample will include 100 Israeli Jewish patients with early idiopathic PD who were
      not treated with anti-parkinson drugs. The clinical diagnosis will be based on the criteria
      of the United Kingdom Parkinson Disease Society Brain Bank.5 All patients will undergo
      Tc-99m-Trodat1 SPECT. The severity of the motor symptoms will be assessed with the Unified PD
      Rating Scale (UPDRS). Genomic DNA is extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes for genetic
      analysis.
