  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The maintenance of partial neuromuscular blocking during general anesthesia for neurosurgery
      is essential for intraoperative motor-evoked potential monitoring. However, the precise
      strategy of administering neuromuscular blocking agent for obtaining that goal has not been
      established. Therefore, the investigators tried to find the optimal initial dose of
      vecuronium infusion and determine the adequate goal of neuromuscular blocking as guided by
      neuromuscular transmission module (M-NMT Module, Datex-Ohmeda Inc, Helsinki, Finland).

      The maintenance of partial neuromuscular blocking during general anesthesia for neurosurgery
      is essential for intraoperative motor-evoked potential monitoring. However, the precise
      strategy of administering neuromuscular blocking agent for obtaining that goal has not been
      established. Therefore, the investigators tried to find the optimal initial dose of
      vecuronium infusion and determine the adequate goal of neuromuscular blocking as guided by
      neuromuscular transmission module (M-NMT Module, Datex-Ohmeda Inc, Helsinki, Finland).
      Previously, one to two counts of response to TOF stimulation has been considered to be
      primary goal of partial neuromuscular blocking needed for intraoperative motor evoked
      potential monitoring. However, the visualization of twitch height of response to TOF
      stimulation has been possible with the help of NMT module. For adequate motor evoked
      potential monitoring, twitch height of T1 or T2 is also as important as simple count of TOF
      stimulation. The investigators tried to establish a vecuronium infusion strategy as guided by
      not only count of TOF stimulation but also twitch height of T1 or T2.
