  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme, needed by body to develop lymphocytes of the immune
      system. Children who are born in mutations with mutations in ADA gene have severe combined
      immunodeficiency (SCID). Children with ADA-deficient SCID generally die in the first year of
      life from severe infections because they do not have immune system that can fight against
      infections. ADA deficient individuals can be cured by bone marrow transplant, but the best
      results are obtained when there is fully matched family donor is available. In the absence of
      a matched related donor, transplants from unrelated or mismatched donors have a much worse
      outcome. There is a form of enzyme therapy (PEG-ADA) for ADA-deficient SCID, in which
      children receive injections of purified ADA enzyme 1-2 times each week. These injections can
      allow the immune system to recover to a level that protects children from infections.

      However, these injections have to be given weekly and are very expensive (£ 125,000 - 200,000
      annually) and the recovery of the immune system is not sustained over time.

      Gene therapy for ADA-deficient SCID could be performed by introducing a normal copy of the
      human ADA gene into the blood forming stem cells of the patient's bone marrow by using a new
      type of gene delivery system (in this trial called a lentiviral vector). The gene corrected
      cells are then transplanted back into the patient after small dose of chemotherapy. These
      gene corrected stem cells can survive into the body and make lymphocytes. In this trial, we
      will determine whether gene therapy for ADA-deficient SCID using lentiviral vector is safe,
      feasible and effective
