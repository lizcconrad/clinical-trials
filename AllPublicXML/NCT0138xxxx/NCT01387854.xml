  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited information on the long-term effects of treating patients with MPS VI with
      Naglazyme® and limited data on the natural history of treated and untreated MPS VI patients.
      The Re-survey Study ASB-00-03 will assist in understanding the effects of long-term Naglazyme
      treatment and the natural history of the MPS VI patient population.

             has been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures.

          -  Previously participated in Survey Study ASB-00-02, and met the criteria of a MPS VI
             diagnosis.

          -  Willing to perform all study assessments and procedures as physically possible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study participation or
             safety.

          -  Any condition that, in the view of the Investigator would place the patient at high

          -  Concurrent enrollment and randomization into a clinical study of MPS VI treatment.
             Patients enrolled in the BioMarin MPS VI Clinical Surveillance Program may be enrolled
