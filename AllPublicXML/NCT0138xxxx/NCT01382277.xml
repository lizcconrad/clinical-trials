      This multicentre, open-label, single-arm Study is to evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin 20
      mg 76 weeks on coronary atherosclerosis plaque versus baseline in Chinese coronary heart
      disease (CHD) patients with hyperlipidemia by measuring the plaque volume using a 64 slice
      spiral CT. Effect on blood lipids, hsCRP and Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is also
      evaluated.
