  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with active acute leukemia have dismal prognoses even with allogeneic
      transplantation.Thus,new measures to enhance graft versus leukemia effect and reduce relapse
      rates are needed.

      Relapse risk after double umbilical cord transplantations have been shown to be significantly
      lower compared to matched sibling and matched unrelated donor transplantations due to better
      graft versus leukemia effect.

      The investigators hypothesize, that concomitant transplantation from 2 matched siblings may
      improve GVL effect and reduce relapse rate in patients with high risk acute leukemias and
      other high risk hematological malignancies.

    <description>Patients with poor risk active acute leukemia and who have 2 matched sibling donors can be included. Patients' conditioning may be myeloablative or non-myeloablative. Both matched donors will be mobilized with G-CSF and their peripheral blood stem cells will be collected on day 0.Equal numbers of CD34+ cells from both donors will be transfused to the patient.
Patients will be followed for engraftment kinetics, chimerism, GVHD rate, severity and response to treatment, relapse rates, DFS and OS.</description>
