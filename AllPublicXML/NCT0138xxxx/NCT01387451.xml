  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective studies have combined positron-emission tomography and computed tomography
      (PET-CT) to identify adipose tissue with a high rate of uptake of
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose(18F-FDG) as active brown adipose tissue(BAT). In addition, biopsy
      specimens and immunohistochemical staining with a UCP1-specific antiserum were used to
      indicate that normal adults were able to have BAT. However,these studies only chose few
      subjects and limited to the neck tissue. Therefore, the investigators intend to test BAT in
      different parts of adults and analyse the clinical factors.

      The investigators will promote the cross-sectional study from 2010 to 2013 in Shanghai. Data
      on demographic statistics, medical history,physical examination and fasting blood sample will
      be collected for all patients. Adipose tissue of adults will be collected from different
      regions, such as cervical, perirenal, along the large blood vessels and trachea, because they
      are included in the range of surgical therapy and are the major locations of BAT. Adipose
      tissue samples will be used to immunohistochemical stain, to detect the expression of BAT
      related genes.
