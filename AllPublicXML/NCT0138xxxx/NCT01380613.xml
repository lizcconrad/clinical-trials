  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine how social networks, neighborhood, and depression are
      related to HIV risk. The intervention is designed to train individuals to cope with feelings
      of depression or stress as a way to reduce their risk for HIV.

      This study included implementation and evaluation of a small group, randomized controlled,
      phase II intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and HIV risk behaviors among inner city
      drug users. The intervention included elements of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for
      depression among impoverished individuals, emphasizing depressive cognitions and behaviors
      theorized to be associated with depression and with HIV risk behaviors among mildly to
      moderately depressed drug users. In addition, the study examined active drug users' social
      and environmental pathways to depression and subsequent HIV risk behaviors. Specifically, we
      will hypothesized mediating/moderating effects of neighborhood characteristics, social
      network factors, and individual level factors on depressive symptoms and HIV risk behaviors.
