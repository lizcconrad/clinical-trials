    <description>For family members/caregivers: telephone contacts will be conducted in day and time which family member/caregiver prefers, and he/she may make collect calls to the researcher always he/she judges it necessary during the period of study. Phone contacts will be recorded to ensure the registration of orientation given, using a digital phone recorder PCTEL. And they will be arranged with the technique of motivational interviewing that includes the skills to ask, listen and inform. For this, protocols based on these skills, which the covered topics will be those worked in group sessions through Diabetes Conversation Maps. Voice quality related to the tone, volume and clarity as well as the skills and strategies to listen to the interviews will be worked under the guidance of an audiologist</description>

    <description>For people with diabetes mellitus: educational interventions will be conducted in accordance with the assumptions of the Social Cognitive Theory, through Diabetes Conversation Maps , whose use is consistent with this theory (ADA, 2007). Diabetes Conversation Maps are a tool which involves people in the learning process about the disease, to make them able to process information more effectively and use them in making daily decisions in the management of diabetes mellitus (DM). It is recommended that this tool is used in small groups of three to ten people, in order to provide dynamic discussions among the participants (ADA, 2007). Currently, the maps that cover the following learning contexts: How the Body and Diabetes Work, Healthy Eating and Physical Activity, and Medication Treatment and Monitoring of Blood Glucose; Achieving the Goals with the Insulin and Weather Map of Diabetic Foot are available for the Brazilian Portuguese language.</description>
