      This is a multicenter, open label, three arms, Phase IB study.

      A dose escalation phase of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) administered in intravenous (IV) at day 2,
      day 8 and day 15 in combination with three chemotherapies regimens for patients in
      relapsed/refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL):

        -  Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide-Doxorubicin-Vincristine-Prednisone (R-CHOP) administered
           every 3 weeks for 6 cycles,

        -  Rituximab-Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide (R-FC) administered every 4 weeks for 6 cycles,

        -  Rituximab-Aracytine high dose-Dexamethasone (R-DHA) administered every 4 weeks for 6
           cycles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three arms trial that investigates Temsirolimus (Torisel™) in combination with
      three chemotherapy regimens (R-CHOP, R-FC or R-DHA).

      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the feasibility of these three chemotherapy regimens in combination with
      Temsirolimus (Torisel™) and to assess the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during
      the two first cycles of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) in combination with three chemotherapy
      regimens in order to determine the maximal tolerate dose (MTD) in a dose escalating study
      design in a population of patients in relapsed/refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the safety of the association Temsirolimus with the three chemotherapy
           regimens,

        -  To determine the efficacy of the association of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) and these three
           chemotherapy regimens after 4 cycles and after 6 cycles at the end of treatment:
           response rate and complete response rate (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), response
           duration (RD) and overall survival (OS).

      All subjects who received at least one dose of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) will be considered
      evaluable and will be included in the safety analysis.

    <description>Response at the end of treatment will be assessed after four cycles and at the end of complete treatment if the patient received all planned cycles or at withdrawal. Patients without response assessments (due to whatever reason) will be considered non-responders. A descriptive analysis will also be performed considering as non-responders all patients who relapsed or died during the treatment phase even if they were prematurely withdrawn as responders.</description>

    <description>Progression-Free Survival will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of first documented disease progression, relapse or death from any cause, according to the Cheson 2007 criteria. Responding patients and patients who are lost to follow up will be censored at their last tumor assessment date.</description>

    <time_frame>From the date of first documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of progression/relapse or death from any cause up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response will be measured from the date of first documentation of a response (CR or PR at the end of treatment) to the date of first documented evidence of progression/relapse or death from any cause, according to the Cheson 2007 criteria. Responding patients and patients who are lost to follow up will be censored at their last tumor assessment date.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days up to 42 days after the last treatment dose</time_frame>
    <description>The same disease response assessment used for complete response rate will be considered to determine the Overall Response Rate. A Patient will be defined as a responder if he/she has a complete response (CR/CRu) or partial response (PR) after four cycles and at the end of treatment. A descriptive analysis will also be performed considering as non-responders all patients who relapsed or died during treatment phase even if they were prematurely withdrawn as responders.</description>

    <time_frame>From the date of inclusion to the date of first documentated disease progression, relapse or death from any cause up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause. Patients who are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of the last contact.</description>

    <description>All subjects who received at least one dose of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) will be considered evaluable and will be included in the safety analysis.
Analysis of safety will be performed by summarizing adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs and ECOG per-formance status. When applicable, a summary of safety data will also be performed by cycle.</description>
