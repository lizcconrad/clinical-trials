  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how the pharmacokinetic profiles of each drug of a
      cocktail of six approved drugs (so-called &quot;Basel cocktail&quot;) change when the cytochrome P450
      system is inhibited or induced.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male aged between 18 and 35 years (inclusive) at screening.

          -  No clinically significant findings on the physical examination at screening.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 28 kg/m2 (inclusive) and body weight at least 50
             kg at screening.

          -  Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 100-145 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 50-90 mmHg
             and heart rate (HR) 45-90 bpm (inclusive).

          -  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically relevant abnormalities at
             screening.

          -  Hematology and clinical chemistry results not deviating from the normal range to a
             clinically relevant extent at screening.

          -  Ability to communicate well with the investigator and to understand and comply with
             the requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any excipients of the drug formulations.

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening.

          -  History or clinical evidence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the 3-year period
             prior to screening.

          -  Positive results from urine drug screen at screening.

          -  Excessive caffeine consumption, defined as &gt;800 mg per day at screening*.

          -  African or Hispanic ethnicity.

          -  History or clinical evidence of any disease and/or existence of any surgical or
             medical condition, which might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion of the study drugs, or which might increase the risk for toxicity.

          -  Smoking within the last 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Previous treatment with any prescribed or OTC medications (including herbal medicines
             such as St John's Wort) within 2 weeks prior to the intended start of study.

          -  Loss of 250 ml or more of blood within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity at screening.
