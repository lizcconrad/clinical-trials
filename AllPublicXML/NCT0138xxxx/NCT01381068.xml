    <textblock>
      This is a trial evaluating the use of an end tidal CO2 monitor during ventilation in the
      delivery room. The use of the monitor is compared with clinical assessment of ventilation.
      The hypothesis is that using the monitor would results in a decrease in the incidence of
      hypo- or hypercapnia on admission to the NICU.
