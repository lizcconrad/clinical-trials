    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate radiolabeled [18F]MK-3328 as a PET tracer for
      estimating the regional distribution and extent of amyloid plaques in participants suffering
      from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) versus healthy
      young and elderly participants. The study hypotheses will test whether [18F]MK-3328 can
      discriminate between AD participants and cognitively normal elderly control participants as
      measured by brain regional tracer uptake.

    <time_frame>60-90 minutes post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Using PET brain images acquired after dosing, regions of interest (ROIs) are drawn in identified brain areas. The ROIs are projected onto all frames of the dynamic PET scans in order to generate [18F]MK-3328 tissue time-activity curves (TACs). SUVR is calculated as the ratio of the average [18F]MK-3328 uptake over 60-90 minutes post dose in the target brain region and the cerebellum. Cortical SUVR is determined, which is a mean SUVR derived from SUVR from multiple brain regions (frontal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, temporal cortex, lateral temporal cortex and occipital cortices). The receiver operating curve (ROC) for determining whether a participant is in HE or AD group by using cortical SUVR values is determined. The ROC is a plot of sensitivity on the y-axis versus 1-specificity (false positive rate) on the x-axis for the range of cortical SUVR threshold values. The AUC of ROC is determined.</description>

SUVR is calculated as the ratio of the average [18F]MK-3328 uptake over 60-90 minutes post dose in the target brain region and the cerebellum. Cortical SUVR is reported, which is a mean SUVR derived from SUVR from multiple brain regions (frontal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulated gyrus, posterior cingulated gyrus, temporal cortex, lateral temporal cortex and occipital cortices). A trimming procedure will be applied to remove the sub-population of HE participants who have positive amyloid plaque burden. The 1st and 2nd quartiles of the cortical SUVR distribution, Q1 and Q2, are computed for HE data; values with SUVR ≥(Q2-Q1)*3 are removed before calculation of HE mean (trimmed) and standard deviation (SD)(trimmed).</description>

This step is performed to remove HE participants with positive plaque burden. Using HE data, the threshold for classification of plaque burden as positive/negative will be calculated as mean (trimmed) + k*SD (trimmed). Value of k will be chosen to fine tune sensitivity/specificity, with specificity of at least 0.9 in the sub-group remaining after trimming of data.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC of ROC) for Distinguishing Between AD and HE Participants Based on Brain Cortical [18F]MK-3328 Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR)</title>
        <description>Using PET brain images acquired after dosing, regions of interest (ROIs) are drawn in identified brain areas. The ROIs are projected onto all frames of the dynamic PET scans in order to generate [18F]MK-3328 tissue time-activity curves (TACs). SUVR is calculated as the ratio of the average [18F]MK-3328 uptake over 60-90 minutes post dose in the target brain region and the cerebellum. Cortical SUVR is determined, which is a mean SUVR derived from SUVR from multiple brain regions (frontal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, temporal cortex, lateral temporal cortex and occipital cortices). The receiver operating curve (ROC) for determining whether a participant is in HE or AD group by using cortical SUVR values is determined. The ROC is a plot of sensitivity on the y-axis versus 1-specificity (false positive rate) on the x-axis for the range of cortical SUVR threshold values. The AUC of ROC is determined.</description>
        <time_frame>60-90 minutes post dose</time_frame>
        <population>The study was terminated early before completion of Part I. Given the low number of enrolled AD participants (6 of up to 15 planned in Part I), the interim analysis for futility in Part I was not conducted and the potential of [18F]MK-3328 to distinguish between AD and HE participants was not assessed.</population>

A trimming procedure will be applied to remove the sub-population of HE participants who have positive amyloid plaque burden. The 1st and 2nd quartiles of the cortical SUVR distribution, Q1 and Q2, are computed for HE data; values with SUVR ≥(Q2-Q1)*3 are removed before calculation of HE mean (trimmed) and standard deviation (SD)(trimmed).</description>

This step is performed to remove HE participants with positive plaque burden. Using HE data, the threshold for classification of plaque burden as positive/negative will be calculated as mean (trimmed) + k*SD (trimmed). Value of k will be chosen to fine tune sensitivity/specificity, with specificity of at least 0.9 in the sub-group remaining after trimming of data.</description>
