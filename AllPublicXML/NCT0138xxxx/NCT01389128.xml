      The proposed project will be conducted to evaluate the influence of application resources
      associated with non-pharmacological during labor for pain relief and accelerated phase of
      expansion. Although mothers' access to resources for non-pharmacological pain relief during
      labor is recommended, is not seen as the application of routine obstetric practice, although
      it has been demonstrated benefits and scientific evidence with your application. It is
      believed that the implementation of this protocol based on the application of
      non-pharmacological resources in assisting the labor can be introduced into daily practice in
      various hospitals in the country, minimizing pain and favoring the shorter duration of labor,
      decrease in use of painkillers and inductors, resulting in a reduction of complications,
      improves the comfort of the mother making her birth experience more satisfying and rewarding,
      being assisted with security and trained by multidisciplinary teams.

      The current model of care delivery has demanded a technical-assistance approach that
      prioritizes the quality of care, as indissolubly concerns the employment of technology,
      knowledge, the centrality of dialogue between professionals and patients and individualized
      choice resources deemed suitable for safe delivery. Seeking to implement a less
      interventionist care with evidence-based practice and greater incentive to vaginal delivery,
      the programs were created humanization of labor and birth, with the use of various
      non-pharmacological resources. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the protocol
      using the combination of non-pharmacological resources during the dilation in relieving the
      pain of the mothers. The research will be of type randomized controlled trial, consisting of
      low-risk primigravidae admitted at the Reference Center for Women's Health in Ribeirão Preto.
      The mothers will be distributed in two groups (intervention protocol features non-drug) and
      Control (routine maternity) and will be evaluated before and after application of each
      resource, and the control group in the same time according to cervical dilation. Evaluation
      will be conducted by a visual analog scale and / or facial pain and pain location diagram and
      postpartum will be applied a validated questionnaire Experience and Satisfaction with
      childbirth. After collecting the data, the groups are statistically analyzed using the linear
      regression model with mixed effects (fixed and random), taking into account a value of p
      &lt;0.05 to obtain the statistical significance of 5%.
