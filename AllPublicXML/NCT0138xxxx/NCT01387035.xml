      The purposes of this study are (I), to evaluate various screening methods for their ability
      to predict and to confirm Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) in scleroderma patients, and (II) to
      evaluate the incidence of PH (i.e. the number of new cases per year) in scleroderma patients.

    <description>Correlate Spiroergometric, lung functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and echocardiographic parameters with invasive hemodynamic findings collected by right heart catheterization: which other non-invasive parameters can be found to detect pulmonary hypertension? Can pulmonary hypertension be detected at rest in the echocardiography? In which patients can only stress-Doppler echocardiography confirm manifest or latent pulmonary hypertension? Is stress-Doppler echocardiography a suitable for early detection of pulmonary hypertension in patients with collagen vascular disease?</description>

    <description>Can spiroergometric findings help to subdivide patients with connective tissue diseases into groups according to degrees of severity, and differ the patients based on spiroergometric findings? To what extent is this distinction comparable with the classifications for the &quot;functional classes&quot; (application for PH according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification)</description>
