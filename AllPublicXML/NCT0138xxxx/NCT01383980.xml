      Surgical patients fed up until the point of surgery will have safe delivery of more calories
      compared to a group whose feeding is held at midnight prior to surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition is essential for healing and recovery from illness. Tube feeds are the standard
      care for patients with prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) who cannot eat food
      on their own. Tube feeding means that a tube has been placed in a patient's stomach or small
      intestine to provide nutrition.

      When a patient is scheduled for an elective surgery, he/she usually has nothing to eat after
      midnight prior to the operation. A fasting period before surgery is done to avoid possible
      side effects during the placement of a breathing tube. Having an empty stomach is thought to
      decrease the chances of vomiting or aspiration while a breathing tube is placed. (Aspiration
      occurs when a substance, such as food provided by a tube feed, enters the airway.) However,
      some patients already have a breathing tube in place. The investigators do not know which is
      better for patients who already have a breathing tube in place: continuing feedings up until
      surgery or stopping them the night before.

      The investigators hypothesize intubated surgical patients randomized to a protocol of feeding
      up until the point of surgery will have the safe delivery of more calories as compared to a
      group whose feeding is held at midnight prior to surgery.
