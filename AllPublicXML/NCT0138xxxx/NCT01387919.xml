  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have begun to determine the time course of events sensing energy availability
      in rodents. In contrast, there is not a single study that has examined this in humans to
      date. A better understanding of this energy sensing machinery in humans is of utmost
      importance to give us new insights into developing new therapies for common diseases such as
      obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In these diseases,
      disturbances in the energy-sensing machinery possibly play a role. To determine the time
      course of energy sensing events in humans, the investigators will measure the concentration
      of various hormones in plasma, and biochemical changes in skeletal muscle at sequential time
      points during starvation in humans. The investigators choose to study the molecular machinery
      in muscle, since muscle is very sensitive to fuel deprivation.
