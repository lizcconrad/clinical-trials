      The purpose of this phase I study is to determine the safety, feasibility, maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Cisplatin administered as Intraoperative
      Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemoperfusion (HIPEC) in Patients with Platinum-Sensitive
      Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I dose escalating study designed to identify tolerable, clinically active
      doses of cisplatin delivered as intraoperative intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion
      (HIPEC) in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. After surgical
      cytoreduction, a single dose of cisplatin will be administered in 3 liters normal saline via
      intraperitoneal HIPEC with closed-abdomen technique for 90 minutes in the hyperthermic phase
      (41-43 degrees C). After completion of perfusion, the perfusate will be drained, the abdomen
      opened and the abdomen and pelvis irrigated with 2-3 liters normal saline to wash away any
      residual chemotherapeutic agent. Fascia and skin will then be closed in a standard fashion.
      Cisplatin infusion will be discontinued for unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective is
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin administered as HIPEC. Secondary
      objectives are to determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the effect of
      cisplatin as HIPEC on the ability to subsequently administer 6 cycles of standard
      platinum-based systemic chemotherapy.

    <description>Blood and peritoneal concentrations of cisplatin will be measured at various time points within the first 24 hours after HIPEC. The elimination half-life and the area under the plasma concentration time curve of cisplatin will be measured. Peritoneal and systemic clearance and distribution of cisplatin will be modeled in a compartmental model.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  only female participants are being studied

          -  signed informed consent

          -  patients with histologically proven or suspicious recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer
             (based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)- or CA-125 criteria)

          -  Progression-free interval after completion of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy of
             6 months or more.

          -  Subjects with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous
             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell
             adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma N.O.S.

          -  Patients are eligible if the disease is deemed operable to equal or less than 1 cm at
             the completion of surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  mucinous Ovarian cancer

          -  non-invasive Borderline tumor

          -  subjects who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity
             or pelvis are excluded. Prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and
             neck, or skin are permitted, provided that it was completed more than 3 years prior to
             enrollment, and the subject remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease

          -  subjects with active infection that requires parenteral antibiotics

          -  patients with any underlying cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic or
             gastrointestinal conditions, chronic or latent infectious diseases, immune deficiency,
             or history, which in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at an
             unacceptable risk for participation in the study

          -  patients with known platinum allergy

          -  evidence of extensive intraperitoneal adhesions at the time of surgery, as determined
             by the operating surgeon
