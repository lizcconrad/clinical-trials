  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the current resistance
      training guidelines for older adults proposed by ACSM/AHA to improve physical function in
      individuals with reduced physical abilities. A randomized controlled intervention trial will
      be used to compare change in physical function pre- and post-intervention between a treatment
      group receiving the minimum recommendations of the guidelines and a control group asked not
      to change their physical activity participation. To better understand the clinical
      significance of such an occurrence, a secondary purpose was to determine if older adults with
      reduced physical abilities who adhere to the recommended intervention dosage will experience
      a change such that they can be reclassified to a more favorable level of functioning. It is
      hypothesized that the minimum recommended dosage of the guidelines would be sufficient to
      both improve physical function and improve functional classification in older adults with
      reduced physical abilities.

    <description>Change in Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB) score is used as a measure of functionality. The SPPB consists of three tasks designed to assess gait speed, and ability to rise from a chair and maintain standing balance. This is a common test to assess function, with scores ranging from 0-12. The higher score equates to a better level of function.</description>
