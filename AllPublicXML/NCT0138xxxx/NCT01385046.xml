  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project FIT is a collaboration between the public school system, local health systems,
      physicians, neighborhood associations, businesses, faith-based leaders, community agencies
      and university researchers to develop a multi-faceted approach to promote physical activity
      and healthy eating toward the general goal of preventing and reducing childhood obesity among
      children in Grand Rapids, MI, USA. There are four overall components to Project FIT: school,
      community, social marketing, and school staff wellness - all that focus on: 1) increasing
      access to safe and affordable physical activity and nutrition education opportunities in the
      schools and surrounding neighborhoods; 2) improving the affordability and availability of
      nutritious food in the neighborhoods surrounding the schools; 3) improving the knowledge,
      self-efficacy, attitudes and behaviors regarding nutrition and physical activity among school
      staff, parents and students; 4) impacting the 'culture' of the schools and neighborhoods to
      incorporate healthful values; and 5) encouraging dialogue among all community partners to
      leverage existing programs and introduce new ones.
