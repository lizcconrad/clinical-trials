  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, &quot;modified standard design&quot; dose escalation study designed to
      determine the maximum tolerated, minimum efficacious dose (MTD/MED) of IL-15 (Intravenous
      Recombinant Human IL-15) and incidence of donor natural killer (NK) cell expansion by day +14
      when given after haploidentical donor NK cells in patients with relapse or refractory acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once the MTD/MED for IL-15 is determined, this cohort will be expanded to a total of 19
      patients. The primary goal of this extended phase will be to establish a correlation of the
      clinical endpoint, CRp defined as leukemic clearance (&lt; 5% marrow blast and no peripheral
      blood blasts) and neutrophil recovery without platelet recovery, with in vivo expansion.

      Patients achieving a complete remission and neutrophil recovery (ANC &gt; 500) for at least 4
      weeks will be considered for allogeneic transplant to prolong remission independent of this
      study.

      All patients, including those who go on to transplant, will be followed to determine disease
      free survival, treatment related mortality, and time to relapse.
