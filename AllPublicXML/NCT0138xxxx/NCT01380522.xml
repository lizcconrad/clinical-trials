          -  Presence or history of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic,
             psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic or dermatologic disease.

          -  Donation of 500mL of blood (Canadian Blood Services, Hema-Quebec, clinical studies,
             etc.) in the previous 5 days before day 1 of this study.

          -  Positive urine screening of drugs of abuse (drug names are presented in section
             7.1.4.).
