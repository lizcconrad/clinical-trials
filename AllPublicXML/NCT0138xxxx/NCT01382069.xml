    <textblock>
      The long term objective is to develop a new male hormone Dimethandrolone Undecanoate (DMAU)
      as a male hormonal contraceptive.

      The study has two parts. The first is a dose escalating study in healthy to assess the safety
      and tolerability of single dose oral administration of DMAUin healthy men.(Completed)

      The second is to study the safety and tolerability of DMAU after 28 days of repeated daily
      dosing of DMAU in healthy men. (Currently Recruiting) In both parts the investigators will
      also study the pharmacokinetics of Dimethandrolone (DMA) in the serum after oral
      administration of DMAU.

      The study will be conducted in two centers.

      28-Day Repeat-Dose, Dose-Escalation Study: Based on the safety and tolerability of the single
      dose study and serum DMA levels attained, three doses of two formulations of DMAU were
      selected for a dose-escalating 28-day repeat dose study. Safety will be assessed in subjects
      receiving lower dosages before additional men receive higher doses for 28 days. Up to 100 men
      will be randomized to receive either active drug or an identical number of capsules of
      placebo. The 24-hour detailed PK of DMA will be assessed on day 1 and 28. Trough levels of
      DMA will be obtained throughout the 28-day period and at 48 and 72 hours after the last dose.
      In addition to safety and tolerability, suppression of serum T, gonadotropins, and SHBG will
      also be assessed as secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. Psychosexual diaries for 7
      consecutive days and PHQ-9 (questionnaire)will be obtained before and at the end of the study
      period.
