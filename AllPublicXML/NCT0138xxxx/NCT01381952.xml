      ClarityIQ is a novel X-ray imaging technology, that combines advanced real-time image noise
      reduction algorithms, with state-of-the-art hardware to reduce patient entrance dose
      significantly. This is realized by anatomy-specific optimization of the full acquisition
      chain (grid switch, beam filtering, pulse width, spot size, detector and image processing
      engine) for every clinical task individually. Furthermore, smaller focal spot sizes and
      shorter pulses are used, which are known to positively influence image quality . The final
      effect on the clinical image quality is investigated in this study.

    <textblock>
      The advent of interventional neuroradiology (INR) has changed the treatment of neurovascular
      diseases by reducing the procedural invasiveness and the recovery time needed by patients,
      thus improving clinical outcome. However, INR procedures often require many high-quality
      digital substraction angiography (DSA) runs and long total fluoroscopy times, which can
      result in patients being exposed to considerable radiation doses levels.

      In order to introduce a dose reduction technology the most important aspect is to validate
      the diagnostic image information. Philips has developed a real-time noise reduction algorithm
      for DSA in neuroradiology that is capable to reduce the patient entrance dose by 75% without
      loss of image quality.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Image Quality. For Each Included Participant 2 Images (1 AlluraXper; 1 AlluraClarity) Were Evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The images were evaluated in randomized, blinded, offline readings. The anonymized images were displayed in pairs, i.e. the reference image run on one monitor (randomly left or right side) with the corresponding quarter-dose image run on the adjacent monitor. Three neuroradiologists graded the arterial, capillary, and venous phases separately. For each characteristic the images quality (IQ) were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 as 1 (very poor), 2 (mediocre), 3 (average), 4 (good), 5 (very good/excellent). An overall IQ score (3-15) was calculated as the sum of the score for these characteristics.
A paired Student's t test is used to compare the overall IQ score between the 2 imaging techniques. If the upper limit of the 97.5% one-sided CI for the difference overall IQ between the two treatment groups does not exceed the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 2.5 Clarity will be declared non-inferior to the current image acquisition settings for DSA.</description>

        <title>Image Quality. For Each Included Participant 2 Images (1 AlluraXper; 1 AlluraClarity) Were Evaluated.</title>
        <description>The images were evaluated in randomized, blinded, offline readings. The anonymized images were displayed in pairs, i.e. the reference image run on one monitor (randomly left or right side) with the corresponding quarter-dose image run on the adjacent monitor. Three neuroradiologists graded the arterial, capillary, and venous phases separately. For each characteristic the images quality (IQ) were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 as 1 (very poor), 2 (mediocre), 3 (average), 4 (good), 5 (very good/excellent). An overall IQ score (3-15) was calculated as the sum of the score for these characteristics.
A paired Student's t test is used to compare the overall IQ score between the 2 imaging techniques. If the upper limit of the 97.5% one-sided CI for the difference overall IQ between the two treatment groups does not exceed the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 2.5 Clarity will be declared non-inferior to the current image acquisition settings for DSA.</description>
