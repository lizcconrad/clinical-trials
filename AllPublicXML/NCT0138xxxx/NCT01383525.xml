  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial objectives are to establish the safety &amp; efficacy of using a DLTP laser to perform
      laser trabeculoplasty to reduce Intraocular Pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle
      glaucoma (Including Pigmentary &amp; Exfoliative Glaucoma), that did not achieve adequate IOP
      control by conventional therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site outpatient study assessing the safety &amp; efficacy of the DLTP laser in
      the ability to reduce IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG). The investigational
      site will accrue patients with uncontrolled OAG. These eyes will be treated with the direct
      application of Direct Laser Trabeculoplasty (DLTP).

      Only one eye per patient is to be treated with the investigational device during the study.
      The laser parameters used will be like these used in the Selective trabeculoplasty (SLT)
      device (CE/FDA approved), but all laser beams will be applied in less than one-second,
      through the sclera.

      Subjects will be evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 hour, 2 hours (and hourly
      to 4 hours in the event of an IOP elevation in the immediate postop course), 1 day, 1 week,
      and 1, 3, 6 months.

      Patients will be followed out to 6 months.
