  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order for a tumour to grow and spread to other parts of the body, it needs to have a blood
      supply. Certain proteins in the body, called cytokines or growth factors, have been shown to
      cause the growth of new blood vessels that supply tumours and therefore help the tumour to
      grow and spread. Motesanib (AMG 706) prevents these proteins from working, and may help to
      prevent the growth of tumours.

      In the first part of this study, we will look at the way your body absorbs this drug into
      your blood, how your body changes and breaks down the drug, and then how the drug leaves your
      body in your urine and faeces.

      In order to provide potential treatment benefit for the subjects who participated in the
      first part of the study, the second part of the study will allow subjects to continue on
      motesanib (AMG 706) treatment. The estimated length of this part of the study is unknown, and
      dependent on how subjects respond to motesanib (AMG 706).

    <description>Single oral dose of 125 mg AMG 706 (motesanib) containing 100 μCi of [14C]-AMG 706 followed by option to continue onto a treatment extension phase for potential treatment benefit. Subjects will be administered motesanib 125 mg (5 x 25 mg tablets) on a daily basis until subjects experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), an unacceptable AE, disease progression, or voluntary withdrawal.</description>
