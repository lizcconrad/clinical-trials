  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center trial to evaluate the efficacy, tolerance, and acceptability of Oxygenated
      Glycerol Triesters (OGT) mentholated cream on acute musculoskeletal pain in normal healthy
      adult volunteers suffering from a recent inflammation of muscles and joints. Patient who met
      eligibility requirements were instructed to identify one area on their body where they were
      experiencing the most acute musculoskeletal pain/discomfort. Patients were provided with
      visual analog scales in order to quantify their pain. Patients either received mentholated
      cream with or without OGT and instructed to rub on the identified site 3 times a day for 7
      days. Pain and other observations were written in a diary for each day.
