  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several environmental factors have contributed to the growing pandemic of obesity. It has
      been described that some characteristics of food and built environment have an influence on
      patterns of food consumption and physical activity of people in a certain place.

      We have designed a cross-sectional study to describe some aspects of the food environment
      (community and consumer) and the frequency, distribution and characteristics of the space
      available to perform physical activity in three neighborhoods of Buenos Aires city.

      Three neighborhoods of Buenos Aires (with representativity), from different socioeconomic
      strata, will be selected by convenience to conduct this study.

      The study will consist on three stages: first, the generation of the sampling frame of food
      stores, public and private spaces available for carrying out physical activity, and the
      development of a tool designed to evaluate the availability of healthy foods in supermarkets
      and grocery stores. Finally, a sample of those stores will be randomly selected for assessing
      the availability of selected foods.

      In Argentina, the knowledge of the food environment is limited. We believe that the
      information obtained in this study will contribute to a better understanding of the subject.

        A community sample of Recoleta, Almagro and Constitucion neighborhoods of Buenos Aires,
        Argentina has been conveniently selected by major representation of different socioeconomic
        stratus. The value of the square meter of the property (2 rooms apartments) was used as
        indirect indicator of socioeconomic level.
