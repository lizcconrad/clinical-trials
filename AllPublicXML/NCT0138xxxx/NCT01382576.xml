  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, serum chitotriosidase activity and its relationship with insulin
      resistance were determined in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ChT activity is increased in patients with PCOS in concordance with insulin resistance. These
      findings may reflect the pronounced risk for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerotic diseases
      in this particular patient group.
