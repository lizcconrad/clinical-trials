      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond
      to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in predicting response to rituximab
      treatment in samples from patients with indolent follicular lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Genotype the full cohort of samples available from the RESORT clinical trial
           (ECOG-E4402) for FCGR3A 158V/F in parallel to independently verify results.

        -  Correlate the FCGR3A 158V/F polymorphisms to response, response duration, and time to
           rituximab resistance.

      Secondary

        -  Quantify copy number variation in FCGR3A in this cohort.

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples isolate from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and from
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed for FCGR3A 158V/F polymorphisms
      using different complementary genotyping methods. Assay results are reviewed and compared
      with patients' outcome data.
