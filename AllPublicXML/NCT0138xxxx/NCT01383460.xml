      50 patients of Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) will be enrolled and randomized into
      G-CSF+EPO or Placebo arms

      Treatment protocol To administer G-CSF (in prefilled syringe) at a dose of 5 µg/kg s/c at
      days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then every 3rd day till day 28 (total 12 doses), along with
      Darbopoetin alpha 100 mcg/ week (in prefilled syringe) for 4 weeks (total 4 doses).

      Standard medical therapy included as per requirement lactulose, bowel wash, albumin,
      terlipressin, antibiotics (if indicated) will be continued and recorded. Pentoxiphylline in
      alcoholic hepatitis and Tenofovir in Hep B reactivation Controls: Standard medical therapy
      will be given along with placebo in similar prefilled syringes.

      Follow up Physical examination will be done daily, after 1 week and at 4 weeks, at 2 months,
      at 3 months and at 6 months CBC on alternate day for 1 week, at end of 1 week and then at end
      of 4 weeks , at 2 months, at 3 months and at 6 months

      KFT on alternate day for 1 week, at end of 1 week and then at end of 4 weeks, at 2 months, at
      3 months and at 6 months LFT along with PT/INR on alternate day for 1 week, at end of 1 week
      and then at end of 4 weeks, at 2 months, at 3 months and at 6 months AFP at baseline, after 4
      weeks, at 3 months and at 6 months Liver regenerative potential efficacy testing at baseline
