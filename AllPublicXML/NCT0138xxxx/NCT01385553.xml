  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social service systems rarely acknowledge the status of men as fathers in the
      conceptualization and delivery of treatment for substance abuse or domestic violence.
      Although there has been extensive focus on the treatment of mothers who abuse substances, are
      victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) (defined as physical aggression and/or
      psychological abuse and control at the hands of an intimate partner), or maltreat their
      children there has been little consideration of the need for interventions for fathers with
      histories of co-morbid IPV and substance abuse. It is estimated that between 10 and 17.8
      million children are witness to violence in their homes each year. National and regional
      samples indicate 50-70% of families impacted by IPV and the typically co-occurring substance
      abuse have children under the age of seven. Large percentages of these men continue to live
      with or have consistent contact with their young children despite aggression and substance
      use.

      Court mandated treatments for perpetrators of domestic violence have become the norm, however
      the efficacy of these treatments is questionable and most do not speak to the broader needs
      of batterers and their families. How batterer's treatments might impact parenting and
      father-child relationships and the psychosocial functioning of children is vastly
      understudied and not currently understood. Since batterer treatments are court mandated and
      require tremendous financial and community resources, the efficacy of these interventions in
      stopping the cycle of domestic violence and improving the health and well-being of the
      batterer, his partner and children is crucial. There are currently NO evidence-based
      treatments that address co-morbid substance abuse and domestic violence perpetration with
      emphasis on paternal parenting and the father-child relationship. Consequently, the proposed
      psychotherapy development project will develop and evaluate the potential efficacy of a
      novel, relational parent intervention for fathers with co-morbid substance abuse and IPV who
      have young children. The goals of this intervention are to decrease aggression and substance
      abuse by increasing focus on fathering and an improved father-child relationship.

    <description>Individual drug counseling focuses on the symptoms of drug addiction and related areas of impaired functioning and the content and structure of the patient's ongoing recovery program. This model of counseling is time limited and emphasizes behavioral change. It gives the patient coping strategies and tools for recovery and promotes 12-step ideology and participation. The primary goal of addiction counseling is to assist the addict in achieving and maintaining abstinence from addictive chemicals and behaviors. The secondary goal is to help the addict recover from the damage the addiction has caused in his or her life.</description>
