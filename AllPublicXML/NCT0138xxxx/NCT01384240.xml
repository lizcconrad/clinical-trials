  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to obtain data to evaluate whether high-resolution
      imaging of the colon can assist clinicians in detecting dysplastic (precancerous) and
      neoplastic areas. This is a pilot study of a novel technology, a miniaturized microscope
      device which can be used during standard endoscopy to image the gastrointestinal epithelium.
      Theoretically, by visualizing superficial mucosal changes at a high-resolution and
      magnification, the investigators will be able to obtain optical images that can be used to
      guide endoscopic biopsy and polypectomy. This may foster the selective targeting of
      dysplasia/neoplasia, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy.
