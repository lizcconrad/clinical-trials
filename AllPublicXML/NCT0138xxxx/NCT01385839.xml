  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety, as well as the efficacy of hair
      transplantation compared with irritation with hypodermic needles in the treatment of subjects
      with refractory alopecia areata.

      With this study, the investigators hope to demonstrate that trauma is just as effective as
      hair transplant in the treatment of recalcitrant alopecia areata of the scalp.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata is a recurrent, non-scarring type of hair loss that can affect any
      hair-bearing area. This disorder can present in many different manners. Though medically
      benign, alopecia areata can result in severe emotional and psychosocial stress in affected
      individuals. This disease can be treated by hair transplantation.

      Hair transplantation is a procedure in which donor hair follicles are harvested from a
      section of a patient's scalp, and transplanted in another bald recipient area, at which time
      it will take root and continue to grow. Hairs generally continue to grow indefinitely

      During this study, subjects with alopecia areata will have one area (or ½ of a large area)
      treated by hair transplant and another (or the other ½) treated by simple irritation with a
      large gauge sterile hypodermic needle.

    <description>Hair transplantation is a procedure in which donor hair follicles are harvested from a section of a patient's scalp, and transplanted in another bald recipient area, at which time it will take root and continue to grow. Hairs generally continue to grow indefinitely.Hair transplant involves mild sedation with Valium, followed by local anesthesia of the donor and recipient areas. Donor hair is harvested using a scalpel to cut narrow strips of hair bearing areas. Follicular units are obtained by slicing the donor tissue into naturally occurring groupings. The follicular units are placed into holes made by a hypodermic needle in the alopecia areata affected areas of the subject. Grafts are held in place by coagulated blood. A bandage is applied after the procedure and left in place over night. The following day, the patient returns for follow up, bandage removal, cleansing, hair washing, and a check up.</description>
