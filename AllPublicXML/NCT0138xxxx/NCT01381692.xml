    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of temsirolimus
      when given together with bortezomib, rituximab, and dexamethasone and to see how well they
      work compared to bortezomib, rituximab, and dexamethasone alone in treating patients with
      untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or relapsed or refractory mantle cell or
      follicular lymphoma. Bortezomib and temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bortezomib may also stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab,
      can block cancer growth in difference ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow
      and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to
      them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is
      not yet known whether bortezomib, rituximab, and dexamethasone are more effective with
      temsirolimus in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temsirolimus in combination with
      bortezomib, rituximab, dexamethasone in patients with relapsed Waldenstrom's
      macroglobulinemia and relapsed/refractory mantle cell, follicular, marginal zone or small
      lymphocytic lymphoma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate whether the addition of temsirolimus to the
      regimen of bortezomib, rituximab, dexamethasone improves progression-free survival in
      patients with previously untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define and describe the toxicities of temsirolimus in combination with bortezomib,
      rituximab, and dexamethasone. (Phase I) II. To evaluate time to progression of bortezomib,
      rituximab, dexamethasone +/- temsirolimus in patients. (Phase II) III. To evaluate major and
      minor response by 6 cycles of therapy of bortezomib, rituximab, dexamethasone +/-
      temsirolimus. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate time to response and duration of response of
      bortezomib, rituximab, dexamethasone +/- temsirolimus. (Phase II) V. To evaluate toxicity of
      bortezomib, rituximab, dexamethasone +/- temsirolimus. (Phase II) VI. To evaluate time to
      next therapy of bortezomib, rituximab, dexamethasone +/- temsirolimus. (Phase II) VII. To
      evaluate overall survival of bortezomib, rituximab, dexamethasone +/- temsirolimus. (Phase
      II) VIII. To describe treatment-related fatigue, physical and functional well-being during
      and after treatment. (Phase II) IX. To compare the change in treatment related fatigue,
      physical and functional well-being over 6 cycles of bortezomib, rituximab, dexamethasone +/-
      temsirolimus. (Quality of Life) X. To prospectively assess health-related quality of life
      longitudinally (pre-treatment to 3 year follow-up assessment) among trial participants.
      (Quality of Life) XI. To describe treatment-related peripheral neuropathy associated with
      bortezomib neurotoxicity. (Quality of Life)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus followed by a randomized
      phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22; rituximab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (of courses 1 and 4
      only); and bortezomib IV or subcutaneously (SC) and dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1, 8,
      and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive rituximab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (of courses
      1 and 4 only) and bortezomib IV or SC and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and
      rituximab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then yearly for 5 years.
