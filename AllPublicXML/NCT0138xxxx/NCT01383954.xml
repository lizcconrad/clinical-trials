      The purpose of this proposed study is to conduct a trial with knee OA patients using the
      diclofenac gel. The effectiveness of diclofenac gel in managing breakthrough pain or the
      neuropathic components of pain (e.g., the burning, soft tissue joint sensitivity, or
      allodynic components) in knee OA is unknown. It is likely that patients will use the gel in a
      as needed (prn) fashion, on top of other analgesics prescribed for their pain. The
      neuropathic components of a generally nociceptive or inflammatory condition, such as knee OA,
      are underappreciated, and typically not tracked in OA analgesic studies. Yet, evidence across
      a variety of chronic painful conditions suggests that these components are quite disabling.
      The results of this study would show whether diclofenac gel as a prn medication is beneficial
      to patients suffering from knee OA pain.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their knee pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) where 0=no pain and 100=worst possible pain. Pain scores were recorded in an electronic diary prior to and 4 hours after the first daily application of diclofenac gel for breakthrough pain. The daily percent change in pain scores over the 7 days prior to Week 1 were averaged. Percent change from Baseline (average pain score 7 days prior to first treatment) was calculated as (value at baseline - value at post-baseline visit) / (value at baseline) x 100. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
