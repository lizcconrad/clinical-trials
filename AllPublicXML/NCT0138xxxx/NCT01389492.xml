  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postprandial increase in MDA level following meat meal could cause modification to LDL
      particles in healthy volunteers. Co-consumption of food drived polyphenols with the meat will
      result in a significant decrease in LDL modification.

    <measure>Change in plasma MDA levels following meat meal</measure>
    <time_frame>Fasting before meal and 3, and 6 h postprandial, and fasting levels</time_frame>
    <description>After an overnight fast baseline (0 h) fasting blood sample (10 ml) was collected in EDTA-treated tubes. The subjects then ate a test meal within 30 min. Blood samples (10 ml) were drawn 3 and 6 h after the meal was eaten. Serum was separated from whole blood by centrifugation (910 g, 15 min), and MDA was evaluated by HPLC in plasma samples</description>

    <measure>Changes in MDA concentration on LDL fraction following meat meals</measure>
    <time_frame>Fasting, before meal was eaten, 3 h following meal, at day 4, 3 h following meal consumption, and day 5 following over nigth fast</time_frame>
    <description>Subject consumed the test meals for 4 days. Day 1, (0 h) fasting blood sample (10 ml) was collected in EDTA-treated tubes. The sbjects then ate a test meal within 30 min. Blood samples (10 ml) were drawn 3 h after the meal was eaten. Blood was collected at day 4, 3 h after the meal was eaten, at the morning of day 5.Plasma LDL was isolated using a single discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation. The protein concentration was determined based on the method of Bradford. MDA concentration was evaluated by HPLC.</description>
