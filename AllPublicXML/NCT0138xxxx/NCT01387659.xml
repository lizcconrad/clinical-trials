  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the tolerability of Myfortic®/Simulect® combination in
      diabetic patients in a steroid free regimen. Due to the diverse ethnicity of our transplant
      recipient population, our study will determine any different responses, including
      autoimmunity, between Hispanic, and Caucasian, patients.

      Myfortic® is an enteric-coated formulation of the sodium salt derivative of mycophenolic acid
      (MPA) that is administered to control kidney graft rejection. Myfortic® was developed to
      improve MPA-related upper gastrointestinal (GI) side effects by delaying the release of MPA
      until it reaches the large surface of the small bowel. Approximately half of all the kidney
      transplant recipients in the United States have diabetes mellitus. A recent analysis of
      approximately 30,000 kidney transplant recipients included in the U.S. Renal Data System
      showed that 42% of patients had pre-transplant diabetes (1). Moreover, 15% to 20% of patients
      develop diabetes after transplantation, a condition that is commonly known as post-diabetes
      mellitus (1-3). It was previously shown that the rate and extent of MPA absorption is
      minimally affected by diabetes (4). Limited data is available in the current literature on
      Myfortic® and Simulect® based therapy in diabetic patients.
