    <textblock>
      This retrospective study aims to assess the clinical and economic impact of early initiation
      of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) therapy in patients with enlarged prostate (EP)
      receiving 5ARI monotherapy or combination therapy with an alpha-blocker (AB) compared to late
      initiation of 5ARI therapy in patients receiving combination therapy. The Henry Ford Health
      System databases will be utilized for this study (2000-2008).

    <description>EP-related charges were defined as medical claims submitted to The Health Alliance Plan (HAP), a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) owned and operated by the Henry Ford Heath System (HFHS) for reimbursement and internal billing data that had a primary diagnosis of EP. Charges were assessed during months 5 to 12 of the variable follow-up period. Follow-up could end only due to end of continuous eligibility, end of study period, or end of 1-year follow-up. Charges were computed on a per-month basis due to differences in the length of follow-up in the sample.</description>

          <title>Dollar Amount of Enlarged Prostate (EP)-Related Medical Costs Incurred Per Month</title>
          <description>EP-related charges were defined as medical claims submitted to The Health Alliance Plan (HAP), a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) owned and operated by the Henry Ford Heath System (HFHS) for reimbursement and internal billing data that had a primary diagnosis of EP. Charges were assessed during months 5 to 12 of the variable follow-up period. Follow-up could end only due to end of continuous eligibility, end of study period, or end of 1-year follow-up. Charges were computed on a per-month basis due to differences in the length of follow-up in the sample.</description>
