  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The multicenter, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized, two-stage Simon's design, phase II
      study (The CLMO-001 Trial) will evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in
      combination with mFOLFOX-6 (Levofolinic acid, 5-Fluorouracil [5-FU] and oxaliplatin) in
      participants with colorectal cancer and liver metastases. Participants will receive
      combination therapy of bevacizumab 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenous (IV) dose
      and mFOLFOX-6 every 2 weeks during Cycles 1-5 and Cycles 7-12. Participants will receive
      mFOLFOX-6 alone (without bevacizumab) on Cycle 6. In between Cycle 6 and 7, participants will
      undergo liver surgery if operable. Thereafter participants will receive bevacizumab (5 mg/kg
      IV every 2 weeks) alone for 52 weeks (26 cycles) after the end of the post-operative phase
      (maintenance therapy). At the end of the preoperative treatment phase (Cycles 1-6),
      participants showing different alternative conditions admitted by the protocol will undergo
      different management (alternative study designs 1 to 3).

    <time_frame>Up to 11 cycles of treatment (up to Week 22)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with shrinkage (partial response [PR]) or disappearance of cancer (complete response [CR]). Tumor response was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). The same method of tumor measurement and assessment had to be used to characterize each lesion throughout the study. Tumor assessment consisted of computerized tomography (CT) scan (abdomen + pelvis + chest) or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) (abdomen + pelvis) + non CE-CT (chest) according to the choice of the center. CR, Disappearance of all target lesions; PR, &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving No Residual Tumor (R0)/Surgical Margin With Microscopic Residual Tumor (R1) Liver Resection</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study up to approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants achieving R0/R1 liver resection was defined as the percentage of participants achieving R0 surgery (no residual tumor) plus percentage of participants achieving R1 surgery (surgical margin with microscopic residual tumor).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-free Interval (DFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study up to approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>DFI was defined as the time from the date of R0/R1 surgery to the date of disease relapse or death due to any cause. Participants who did not progress were considered censored at the date of the last assessment performed. For participants receiving two-stage resection, the date of R0/R1 surgery was the date of the second surgery. Participants, who did not receive surgery and participants without R0/R1 surgery were censored at Day 1. DFI was calculated as follows: DFI (months) = ([Date of R0/R1 surgery ‐ Date of 1st relapse/Death] + 1)/30</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study up to approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first. Progression was defined according to RECIST, v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants, who did not progress were censored at the date of the last assessment performed. Participants who withdrew from the study without documented progression and for whom an electronic case report form (eCRF) existed as evidence that evaluations had been made, were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment when the participant was known to be progression-free. Participants without post-baseline tumor assessments, but known to be alive were censored at the time of first study drug administration. PFS was calculated: PFS (months) = ([Date of Event - Date of first study drug administration] + 1)/30.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>

    <description>OS was defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the date of death due to any cause. Participants who were alive at the time of the analysis were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive. OS was calculated as follows: OS (months) = ([Date of Death - first study drug administration] + 1)/30</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first. Progression was defined according to RECIST, v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants, who did not progress were censored at the date of the last assessment performed. Participants who withdrew from the study without documented progression and for whom an electronic case report form (eCRF) existed as evidence that evaluations had been made, were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment when the participant was known to be progression-free. Participants without post-baseline tumor assessments, but known to be alive were censored at the time of first study drug administration. PFS was calculated: PFS (months) = ([Date of Event - Date of first study drug administration] + 1)/30.</description>

          <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first. Progression was defined according to RECIST, v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants, who did not progress were censored at the date of the last assessment performed. Participants who withdrew from the study without documented progression and for whom an electronic case report form (eCRF) existed as evidence that evaluations had been made, were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment when the participant was known to be progression-free. Participants without post-baseline tumor assessments, but known to be alive were censored at the time of first study drug administration. PFS was calculated: PFS (months) = ([Date of Event - Date of first study drug administration] + 1)/30.</description>
