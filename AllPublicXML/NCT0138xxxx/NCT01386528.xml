    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA).

      The aim of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NNC-0156-0000-0009 (nonacog
      beta pegol) during surgical procedures in patients with haemophilia B.

    <measure>Haemostatic Effect During Surgery Evaluated by the Four-point Response Scale (Excellent, Good, Moderate, Poor)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Haemostatic effect during surgery was evaluated immediately after surgery (last stitch) using a fourpoint response scale:
- Four-point response scale: Excellent, good, moderate, poor. The evaluation was done by the surgeon, anaesthesiologist and/or investigator based on experience as follows:
Excellent: Better than expected/predicted in this type of procedure.
Good: As expected in this type of procedure.
Moderate: Less than optimal for the type of procedure but haemostatic response maintained without change of treatment regimen.
Poor: Bleeding due to inadequate therapeutic response with adequate dosing, change of regimen required.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Patients enrolled in the present trial were recruited from the pivotal trial (NN7999-3747) or the extension trial (NN7999-3775). In addition, new patients were recruited into the present trial.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>New patients as well as transferred patients from the pivotal trial (NN7999-3747) or the extension trial(NN7999-3775) received nonacog beta pegol at screening and followed a preventive treatment regimen with nonacog beta pegol until one week before the day of surgery. No more than 4 hours prior to the planned surgical procedure, all patients received a single bolus injection of 80 U/kg of nonacog beta pegol. Postoperatively, the patients received fixed doses of 40 U/kg repeated at the investigator’s discretion aiming for no less than the FIX levels recommended by the World Federation of Hemophilia. Nonacog beta pegol was administered intravenously. The new patients were dosed once with 40 U/kg nonacog beta pegol at screening.From the day after surgery (Day 1) and through Day 6, nonacog beta pegol dosing was adjusted to aim for a FIX activity level of approximately 0.50 U/mL.</description>

        <title>Haemostatic Effect During Surgery Evaluated by the Four-point Response Scale (Excellent, Good, Moderate, Poor)</title>
        <description>Haemostatic effect during surgery was evaluated immediately after surgery (last stitch) using a fourpoint response scale:
– Four-point response scale: Excellent, good, moderate, poor. The evaluation was done by the surgeon, anaesthesiologist and/or investigator based on experience as follows:
Excellent: Better than expected/predicted in this type of procedure.
Good: As expected in this type of procedure.
Moderate: Less than optimal for the type of procedure but haemostatic response maintained without change of treatment regimen.
Poor: Bleeding due to inadequate therapeutic response with adequate dosing, change of regimen required.</description>
