    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the Impact of Crime (IOC) group
      intervention for jail inmates. The hypothesis is that participants in IOC will show decreases
      in criminogenic thinking, decreases in shame, increases in guilt, and increases in empathy,
      which in turn will be reflected in reduced recidivism (official records and self report),
      relative to those randomly assigned to a treatment as usual group.
