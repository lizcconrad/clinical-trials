    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this observational study is to evaluate the function (patency) of
      cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts used as coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) for
      patients with occlusive coronary artery disease.

      This Study is designed as a combination retrospective/prospective single center study in
      which all patients will be eligible for enrollment based on having a previous implant of
      CryoVein Saphenous Vein for CABG during the 2008-2010 time frame. A comprehensive chart
      review of former and previously implanted allograft patients will be performed for the
      retrospective portion of this Study. An effort will be made to include all patients from this
      site. Eligible patients will be consented into the Study for a single, prospective,
      observational imaging evaluation of their bypass conduits.
