      -  Thirty six patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis despite continued
           treatment with methotrexate will be evaluated for improvement of disease activity when
           taking GLPG0634 or matching placebo for 4 weeks.

        -  During the course of the study, patients will also be examined for any side effects that
           may occur, and the amount of GLPG0634 present in the blood as well as the effects of
           GLPG0634 on disease- and mechanism of action-related parameters in the blood will be
           determined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have active RA as shown by five or more swollen joints (from the 66-joint count), five

          -  Have received methotrexate for six months or longer and at a stable dose of 7.5 to 25
             mg/week (extremes included) for at least four weeks prior to screening and willing to
             continue on this regimen for the duration of the study;

          -  If taking oral steroids, these should be at a dose ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or
             prednisone equivalent and stable for at least four weeks prior to screening;

          -  If taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), these must be at a stable
             dose for at least two weeks prior to screening;
