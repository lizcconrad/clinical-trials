  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone loss is a common secondary complication of spinal cord injury (SCI), and treatments used
      to reverse this condition have equivocal effectiveness. The aim of this study is to determine
      the effect of intense multi-modal training on bone health, body fat, and quality of life in
      persons with SCI. Participants will complete 6 months of training during which various
      measures will be obtained at 0, 3, and 6 months. Control subjects are also being recruited to
      complete testing but not participate in training.
