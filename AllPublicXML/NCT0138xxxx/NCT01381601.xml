  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Information on the prevalence of advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma and its symptom
      burden is limited in commercially insured adult patients. Additionally, limited information
      exists on economic burden of adverse events associated with treatments for
      advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma. An objective of the current study is to estimate
      the incidence, prevalence, and symptom burden associated with advanced/metastatic RCC in a US
      &quot;real-world&quot; setting. Another objective is to quantify the economic burden of severe adverse
      events with agents used in management of first line advanced/metastatic RCC (sunitinib,
      sorafenib, bevacizumab, and pazopanib). This study will employ a retrospective cohort design.
      Analyses of health insurance claims data from a large commercially insured population will be
      employed in the current study. Study subjects will consist of all persons, aged ≥18 years,
      with evidence of advanced RCC between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009; these persons
      will be identified based in part on case-ascertainment algorithms. Analyses will be directed
      at estimating annual rates of incidence and prevalence of advanced/metastatic RCC, as well as
      symptom burden and costs of common severe adverse events associated with treatments used in
      management of advanced/metastatic RCC (sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, and pazopanib).
