      The purpose of the study is to determine if immunization with dscCfaE with or without a
      modified E. coli heat labile enterotoxin, LTR192G, is safe and immunogenic when administered
      transcutaneously using a skin wet-patch. If the vaccine is found safe and adequately
      immunogenic in humans, a phase 2b vaccination/challenge study would be undertaken to further
      evaluate vaccine safety and allow a preliminary assessment of efficacy. With favorable
      evidence for safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, complemented by advances in standard
      methodology to combine multiple adhesins with an appropriate LT enterotoxoid form, a
      multivalent vaccine would be constructed and evaluated for further clinical development.

    <description>Adverse event monitoring will survey and specifically inquire about fever (oral temperature &gt; 100.4 o F), malaise, headache, rash, pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, extremity pain or swelling. Clinical definitions will be used to grade severity of symptoms in accordance to the severity scale below: Grade 0 = None Grade 1= Barely noticeable Grade 2= Noticeable, does not interfere with daily activities Grade 3=Interferes with daily activities Grade 4=Prevents daily activities</description>
