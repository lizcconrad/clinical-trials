  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies indicate that patients with cardiovascular disease have a variable response
      to aspirin. Despite treatment with aspirin a large number of patients suffer a myocardial
      infarction. This has given rise to the phenomenon &quot;aspirin low-responsiveness&quot;. Laboratory
      aspirin low-responsiveness can be defined as the failure of aspirin to inhibit platelet
      production of thromboxane A2 or inhibit thromboxane-dependent platelet aggregation. Whether a
      low platelet response to aspirin results in an increased risk of future thrombotic events is
      of great clinical significance, but is still unknown.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients with a reduced response to aspirin, determined by
      platelet aggregation using the apparatus Verify Now Aspirin and Multiplate, have a higher
      risk of thrombosis.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a higher incidence of cardiovascular
      events is found in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) having a reduced biochemical
      response to aspirin compared with CAD patients having a normal biochemical response to
      aspirin. In addition to CAD, all patients have at least one of the following risc factors:
      previous myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or renal insufficiency.
