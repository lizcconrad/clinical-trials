    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators hypothesized that perioperative i.v. infusion of lidocaine
      in major abdominal pediatric surgery, may have a beneficial effect on hemodynamic and
      hormonal responses. Also, it could decrease the hospital stay, opioid requirement and hasten
      return of bowel function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory response after major abdominal surgery is of great importance for patients,
      physicians and perioperative medicine1. Perioperative excessive stimulation of the
      inflammatory and hemostatic systems may result in development of postoperative ileus,
      ischemia-reperfusion syndromes, hypercoagulation syndromes (e.g. deep venous thrombosis) and
      pain excessive inflammatory response such as impaired gastrointestinal motility, so
      modulation of inflammatory responses may decrease severity of such complications 2,3.

      Intravenous lidocaine, a local anesthetic, has been shown to improve postoperative analgesia,
      reduce postoperative opioid requirements, accelerate postoperative recovery of bowel
      function, attenuate postoperative fatigue, reduced the duration of hospitalization, and
      facilitate acute rehabilitation in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery 4.
      Administration of local anesthetics to epidural space has analgesic effect, blunt stress
      response; provide rapid mobilization, early extubation with rapid recovery of bowel function
      5. However, insertion of an epidural catheter carries risks especially in pediatric
      populations. So, systemic lidocaine may become another strategy for improving perioperative
      outcome which is safe and effective2.

    <description>In the postanaesthetic care unit (PACU), children were assessed for pain every 10 min by the trained nurse blinded to group assignment, using 1 of 2 pain scales according to child comprehension: a 0- to 10-point visual analog scale (VAS), or FLACC Scale (Face, Legs,Activity, Cry, Consolability). FLACC is an observer assessment based 5 items and each item is graded from 0 to 2</description>
