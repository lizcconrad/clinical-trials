  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is recognised as one of the main causes of death in the western
      world. LDL- cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol) and other lipids (fats) are important CVD risk
      factors. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is an important transporter of fats in the blood. ApoE comes
      in E2, E3 and E4 forms, depending on your genetic make up. Approximately 60% of the UK
      population are E3/E3, 25% E4 carriers and 15% E2 carriers. There is some evidence to suggest
      that an E4 genotype may put you at modestly higher risk of CVD. Furthermore although very
      inconclusive previous studies have suggested that E4 individuals are slightly more sensitive
      to the LDL-cholesterol modifying effects of dietary fats (saturated fat, total fat, fish oil)
      showing slightly, greater reductions when low levels of these fat are consumed, and greater
      increases when high levels of these fat are consumed. Therefore, the aims of the Satgene
      study is to examine the impact of modifications in dietary total fat and saturated fat
      intakes, alone and in combination with fish oil supplement on LDL-cholesterol and other blood
      lipids, in individuals with an E3 and E4 genotype. The levels of total fat and saturated fat
      used in the current study are within the range observed in a typical UK population.

    <description>Subjects were asked to consume a low fat diet for 8 weeks. Composition: 28% energy from fat, 8% energy from saturated fat, 55% energy from carbohydrate. Subjects were provided with low fat spread, cooking oil and snacks and asked to consume these in place of normally eaten equivalent foods. Subjects were asked to consume two extra portions of carbohydrate per day (e.g. two slices of bread, equivalent to 35g carbohydrate) and to consume low fat dairy products. Subjects also consumed 2g control oil per day during this period. Control oil comprised palm olein and soybean oil.</description>

Subjects were asked to consume one less portion of carbohydrate per day (e.g. one slice of bread and to consume full fat dairy products.
