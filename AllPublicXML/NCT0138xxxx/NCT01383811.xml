  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effects of adjunct exercise in treatment
      resistant depression. The central hypothesis for the research is that adjunct exercise with
      usual care in Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) will have significant effects in improving
      the psychiatric symptoms in comparison to usual care alone.

      Participants with treatment resistant depression will be recruited to participate in a
      12-week clinical trial on the effects of adjunct moderate-intensity exercise versus usual
      care. Primary outcome measure will be reduction in baseline scores on Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale (17 item). Secondary outcome measure will include reduction in baseline scores
      of clinical global impression severity, pittsburgh sleep quality index global score, scores
      on beck depression inventory, and improvement in actigraphic sleep.

    <description>Individuals in this group will receive moderate intensity exercise in addition to their usual care (Medications+/-Psychotherapy). The moderate intensity exercise program will involve gradual progression in exercise intensity and duration. During the first 4 weeks, participants will attend 3 supervised sessions/week and will be asked to complete at least 2 unsupervised aerobic exercise sessions/week. From weeks 5-8 the number of supervised sessions will be 2/week with at least 3 unsupervised aerobic exercise sessions/week. From weeks 9-12, the participants will have only 1 supervised session/week and will be asked to complete at least 4 unsupervised aerobic exercise sessions/week. In total, the participants will be required to complete 150 minutes of moderate physical activity/week.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Being sedentary (exercising less than 3 times/week for &gt; 20 minutes at
             moderate/vigorous intensity for each bout)

          -  Ability to come for supervised exercises up to 5 days/week.

          -  On stable doses of medication or psychotherapy (within last 1 month) for underlying
             depression and willingness to continue on stable dose or therapy schedule during
             active phase of study participation, with the exception of during acute exacerbation
             of symptoms of psychiatric illness.

          -  Being able to read, understand, and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  DSM-IV TR Axis I diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizophrenia
             spectrum disorder, or substance or alcohol abuse/dependence disorder (except nicotine
             dependence) in the past 12 months. Patients with current primary anxiety disorder will
             also be excluded.

          -  Behavioral or personality disturbances, which may significantly interfere with study
             participation.

          -  Evidence of acute suicidal risk.

          -  Medical contraindication for physical exercise (significant orthopedic or
             cardiopulmonary disorder) that would prevent regular aerobic exercise. The American
             College of Sports Medicine criteria for risk stratification will be used and where
             indicated medical clearance for exercise will be obtained through the subject's
             primary care physician.

          -  Pregnancy.
