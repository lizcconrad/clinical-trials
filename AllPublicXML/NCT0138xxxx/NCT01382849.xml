      Florbetapir F 18 is an experimental radioactive drug that may allow doctors to image changes
      in the brain using a PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scanner. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the imaging characteristics of, Florbetapir F 18 (also known as 18F-AV-45) in
      patients who have previously undergone bleeding in their brains. Florbetapir F 18 binds to
      amyloid-ß peptide (Aß) that accumulates in the brains of patients with bleeding. These
      accumulations are called amyloid plaques and when extensive are labeled cerebral amyloid
      angiopathy (CAA). Florbetapir F 18 sticks to the amyloid plaques in the brain and emits a low
      level of gamma rays which can be detected by a PET camera.

      MRI detected microbleeds have been identified as markers of clinically silent hemorrhage from
      bleeding-prone vessels. Another imaging marker of vessel damage and risk of bleeding is the
      spot sign (SS). Finally, certain genetic signatures (ApoE genotype) have been shown to be
      associated with Aß deposition in the brain or predispose patients to higher risks of
      bleeding. This research study will explore the interactions of these factors and understand
      the physiology of intracerebral bleeding.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior intracranial hemorrhage at least 3 months prior

          -  Patients &gt;18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Modified Rankin score &gt;3.

          2. Clinically significant medical comorbidities which in the opinion of the investigator
             might pose a potential safety risk to the subject.

          3. Women of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile, not refraining from
             sexual activity or not using reliable methods of contraception.

          4. Have a history of relevant severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity

          5. Patients who withdraw consent. Age and gender-matched microbleed patients previously
             demonstrating MRI microbleeds without prior macrobleeds will be recruited from stroke
