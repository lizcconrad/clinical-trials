  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignant tumor of the liver that accounts for an
      important health problem worldwide. In only 10% - 15% of all patients with HCC, tumors are
      considered resectable at presentation. In contrast to metastatic liver disease, there is no
      role for systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of HCC. Today only evidence is available for
      Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibiting agent. The arsenal of non-surgical therapies can
      roughly be divided into local ablative, transarterial and systemic therapies. In well
      selected patients, local ablative therapy can offer favorable long term results.

      For patients with disease confined to the liver, but locally more advanced, transarterial
      treatment modalities are proposed. These therapies exploit the dual blood supply to the
      liver. HCC derives its blood supply almost entirely from the hepatic artery, while liver
      parenchyma derives &gt; 75% of its blood supply from the portal vein. Antitumoral agents, such
      as cytotoxic drugs or radionuclides, can be delivered in close proximity of the tumor.

      Examples of transarterial therapies are: transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), bland
      transarterial embolization (TAE), transarterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads
      (TACE-DEB) and transarterial radioembolization with Iodine-131 or Yttrium-90.

      TACE is currently the gold standard for treatment of patients with intermediate stage HCC,
      with a reported median survival of around 17 months. A novel development in the TACE
      treatment for HCC is the drug-eluting bead (DEB). Recently performed small clinical trials
      reported the efficacy of DEBs in the treatment of intermediate stage HCC, which is
      substantially higher compared to conventional TACE.

      Yttrium-90 radioembolization (90Y-RE) is a relatively recently developed technique which
      implements transarterial administration of minimally embolic microspheres loaded with
      Yttrium-90, a β-emitting isotope, delivering selective internal radiation to the tumor.

      In this study the investigators want to prospectively compare TACE-DEB and 90Y-RE, two novel
      treatments that both have theoretical and/or proven advantages compared to the use of
      conventional TACE, in patients with intermediate stage HCC.
