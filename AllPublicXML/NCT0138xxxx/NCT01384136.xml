  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The telomere system stabilizes the chromosomes. Telomeres are shortened during senescence, in
      cases of genetic instability and secondary to stress.

      The investigators aim is to study the telomere system in cord blood and in the placenta
      immediately after the delivery in pregnancies defined as high risk pregnancies following
      sterss events such as placental insufficiency, preeclampsia, diabetes.

      The investigators intend to compare the telomere system in maternal blood to cord blood and
      to placental biopsies and to study the influence of different stressogenes on this system.
