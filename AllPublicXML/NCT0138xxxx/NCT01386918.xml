  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for
      refractory auditory hallucinations (AH) in schizophrenia have shown promise. The majority of
      studies have examined the effect of low frequency left-sided stimulation (LFL) (i.e., 1 Hz)
      to the temporal parietal cortex (TPC). Priming stimulation (6 Hz) prior to LFL stimulation
      (hereby simply referred to as priming) has been shown to enhance the neurophysiological
      effects of LFL rTMS alone and, as such, may lead to greater attenuation of AH. Therefore,
      this study evaluated the efficacy of priming rTMS and LFL rTMS, compared to sham, applied to
      the TPC in patients with schizophrenia experiencing refractory auditory hallucinations (AH).
