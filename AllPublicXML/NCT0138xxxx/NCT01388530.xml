    <textblock>
      This proposal seeks to obtain preliminary data on the potential efficacy, tolerability, and
      feasibility of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) as a treatment for
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). If successful, this open-label, exploratory,
      pilot study will provide a basis for a federal grant application and larger controlled
      trials.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ADHD-IV Rating Scale (ADHD-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>A standard, frequently used, clinician completed measure of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual -IV (DSM-IV) ADHD symptoms.
Scale ranges from 0 (best) to 54 (worst).
Unit of Measure - units on a scale.
Outcome value reflects change from baseline at endpoint (Week 8) in ADHD-RS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A global measure of clinical improvement compared with baseline.
A standard clinical trials rating scale with value from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).
Unit of measure - percentage improved based on CGI-I scores of 1 and 2 versus all others.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conners Global Index - Parent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>A standard, parent completed measure of ADHD symptoms.
Scale range from 0 (best) to 27 (worst).
Unit of Measure - units on a scale.
Outcome value reflects change from baseline at endpoint (Week 8).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention Network Task - Incongruent Reaction Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory measure of response inhibition. The measure assessed the reaction time in milliseconds (ms) using the Attention Network Task (ANT), which is a computerized test designed to evaluate the efficiency of an attention network.
Outcome measure represents a change from Baseline at Week 8 for the ANT - Incongruent reaction time. Lower reaction time is consider a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Laboratory measure of response inhibition. The measure assessed the reaction time in milliseconds (ms) using the Attention Network Task (ANT), which is a computerized test designed to evaluate the efficiency of an attention network.
Outcome measure represents a change from Baseline at Week 8 for the ANT - Incongruent reaction time. Lower reaction time is consider a better outcome.</description>
