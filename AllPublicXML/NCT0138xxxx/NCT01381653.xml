    <textblock>
      An existing face-to-face HIV prevention intervention (The Young Men's Health Project, YMHP;
      R01DA20366) will be iteratively adapted and pilot-tested to target difficult to engage
      high-risk young men who have sex with men (YMSM) via online social networking and aims to
      reduce both high-risk sexual behavior and drug use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study entails a two-phase process. During Phase I, 15 former YMHP participants
      (intervention decliners and those who only completed one session) will participate in focus
      groups to advise us on the feasibility and pragmatic specifications of an HIV prevention
      intervention received via the IM (instant messaging) function of Facebook. Focus group
      transcripts will be examined to isolate key recommendations for modifying the intervention's
      structure and procedures. Focus groups will be reconvened for additional feedback on the
      modified intervention, followed by further adjustment. During Phase II, 40 high-risk YMSM
      (ages 18-29 and Facebook users) will be enrolled in a pilot of the modified intervention. The
      intervention will span 4 weeks and contain 8 bi-weekly 30 minute Motivational Interviewing
      (MI) chat-window sessions consisting of a sequential progression of intervention approaches
      tailored to each participant's readiness to change their drug use and high risk sexual
      behavior. Data from Phase II will include pre-post intervention behavioral risk assessments,
      as well as individual interviews with all 40 intervention participants for a qualitative
      evaluation regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention's structure, and
      process. Findings from these interviews (and counselor focus group) will inform the
      fine-tuning of the intervention in preparation for a subsequent randomized control trial
      (RCT).

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Phase I:

        For the focus group portion of the study (N=20), we will invite former YMHP participants
        who declined the intervention or only completed one session, agreed to be contacted for
        future studies, indicated using Facebook, are still between the ages of 18-29 and live in
        NYC.

        Phase II:

        To qualify for the intervention portion of the study, participants must report

          1. at least 5 days of drug use (of 1 or more of the following drugs: cocaine,
             methamphetamine (MA), or ecstasy (MDMA) in the prior three months;

          2. high-risk sexual behavior (1 or more acts of unprotected insertive or receptive anal
             sex with a male partner of unknown or HIV+ serostatus), in the prior three months;

          3. biologically male;

          4. age 18 to 29;

          5. HIV-;

          6. reliable Internet access;

          7. Facebook use at least four times per week;

          8. able to write in English given that intervention participation involves writing;

          9. NYC residency.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be excluded for any of the following reasons:

          1. Unstable, serious psychiatric symptoms;

          2. Currently suicidal/homicidal;

          3. Evidence of gross cognitive impairment;

          4. Self-reported current enrollment in a drug or HIV-related intervention or research
             study.

        We exclude those with serious cognitive or psychiatric impairments because this would
        compromise ability to participate, regardless of whether these impairments are attributed
        to drug use. Such impairments would make completion of assessments difficult.

        Excluded participants will be referred to local community health and social services
        resources, for which we have established linkages to facilitate access to care regardless
        of ability to pay.
