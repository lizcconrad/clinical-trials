  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose
      study in which approximately 24 subjects with SCLE will be enrolled. Cohort 1 will consist of
      12 subjects (6 AMG 557: 6 placebo) randomized to receive AMG 557 210 mg or matching placebo.
      Cohort 2 will consist of 12 subjects (6 AMG 557: 6 placebo) randomized to receive AMG 557 140
      mg or matching placebo. Enrollment of Cohort 2 (140 mg) will be initiated after enrollment of
      Cohort 1 (210 mg) is completed.

      Cohort 1 will consist of 12 subjects (6 AMG 557: 6 placebo) randomized to receive AMG 557 210
      mg or matching placebo. Cohort 2 will consist of 12 subjects (6 AMG 557: 6 placebo)
      randomized to receive AMG 557 140 mg or matching placebo. Enrollment of Cohort 2 (140 mg)
      will be initiated after enrollment of Cohort 1 (210 mg) is completed. After Cohort 1 and 2
      enrollment has been completed, the emerging PK and PD data will be reviewed to determine if
      an additional 4-8 subjects with SCLE will be enrolled into the study to address equivocal
      results from the study. These 4-8 additional subjects will receive the same dose of either
      210 mg or 140 mg SC (in an allocation ratio of 1 AMG 557: 1 placebo).

      In addition, an open label extension study for participants in this study may be instituted
      following completion and analysis of results of this study. Initiation of this study will
      require that an acceptable risk-benefit profile and some evidence of efficacy are observed in
      the current study.

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Drug-induced SCLE;

          -  Any disorder (including psychiatric), condition or clinically significant disease
             (other than a diagnosis of SCLE, SLE, or Sjögren's syndrome) that would, by its
             progressive nature and/or severity, interfere with the study evaluation, completion
             and/or procedures per the investigator's discretion. This includes any age related
             co-morbidities such as presence of congestive heart failure, angina, chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma;

          -  Presence or history of vasculitis (comprising internal organs or extremities or

          -  History of malignancy;

          -  Signs or symptoms of a viral, bacterial or fungal infection within 30 days of study

             mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, Intravenous (IV)
             immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, oral or IV cyclophosphamide;

          -  Receiving or has received any investigational drug (or is currently using an
             investigational device) within the 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer),

          -  29. Use of any other over-the-counter or prescription medications within the 14 days
             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer), prior to receiving the first dose of study
             medication. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g per day) for analgesia and hormone replacement
             therapy (eg, estrogen, thyroid) will be allowed. In addition, prescription drugs for
             hypertension or hypercholesterolemia, oral hypoglycemic drugs, or NSAIDs will be
             allowed; however, NSAIDS are not permitted within 24 hours of skin biopsies to reduce
             the risk of bleeding. Other medications may be approved following review by the
             Principal Investigator and the Amgen Medical Monitor. Written documentation of this
             review and Amgen acknowledgement is required for subject participation;
