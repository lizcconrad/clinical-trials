    <textblock>
      Induction of Labour in Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP) has become a common
      procedure in management of ICP to avoid fetal complications. Surprisingly, this empirical
      approach has not been evaluated as to delivery complications and fetal outcome as yet. The
      investigators now examine weather ICP affects (i) delivery procedures chosen, in particular
      the incidence of caesarian section, (ii)fetal and maternal outcome in induced labor, and
      (iii)possible impact of bile acids and UDCA treatment in a retrospective cohort study based
      on approximately 5000 induced deliveries at Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet,
      Stockholm. The investigators analyze data on on previous deliveries, BMI, medical history and
      medical book data. Primary endpoint is the risk of caesarian section.
