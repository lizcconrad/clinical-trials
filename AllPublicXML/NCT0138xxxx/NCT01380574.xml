      The purpose of this study is to investigate the complications of cardioversion of acute (&lt;48
      hours duration) atrial fibrillation (AF).

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      - Incidence and predictors of thromboembolic complications, especially stroke, and death &lt;31
      days after cardioversion of acute AF

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Number of therapy non-responder and early recurrence of AF

        -  Bleeding complications during the 31 days follow-up

        -  Hemodynamic complications of cardioversion

      Estimated Enrollment: 3000 cases

      Study Start Date: Jun 2011

      Estimated Study Completion Date: December 2011

      It has been a common practice to perform cardioversion of acute (&lt;48 hour) AF without any
      anticoagulation. The new European guidelines recommend that anticoagulation should be started
      already before cardioversion in all patients with CHADS2VASC score indicating need for
      long-term oral anticoagulation. The evidence behind these guidelines is, however, scarce. In
      this retrospective study we collect data on the safety of acute AF cardioversion from
      emergency rooms of two university hospitals and one secondary referral center from the years
      2003-2010.

      Inclusion criteria:

      All patients admitted to emergency room because of acute AF in whom electrical or
      pharmacological cardioversion was attempted &lt;48 from the beginning of the symptoms.
