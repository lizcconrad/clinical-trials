  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial. Potential participants
      in this study include patients referred for Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided fine needle
      aspiration (EUS-FNA) of a solid pancreatic lesion at one of the participating centers. If the
      patient meets inclusion criteria and signs the informed consent, they will be randomized into
      one of the two study arms in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will either undergo EUS-FNA with or
      without an on-site cytopathologist present during EUS-FNA. Patients assigned to the on-site
      cytopathologist arm will have the cytopathologist dictate the number of fine needle
      aspiration (FNA) passes performed by the endosonographer. This number will be based on the
      adequacy of specimen and the ability to provide a preliminary diagnosis. In the other arm, in
      the absence of an on-site cytopathologist, the endosonographer will perform a predetermined
      number of 7 passes (standard of care in the absence of an on-site cytopathologist). The
      technique of performing EUS-FNA (needle type, use of stylet, suction) will be standardized
      among all endosonographers in order to rule out confounding factors. After EUS-FNA is
      performed all slides will be sent to the pathology department. The slides will be sent for
      review regardless of which arm the patient is randomized into, and they will be reviewed by
      experienced cytopathologists for the purpose of determining the final diagnoses.

      Future clinical intervention will be monitored for the purpose of reporting the impact
      EUS-FNA has on the patient's clinical course and determining diagnostic accuracy. Patients
      will be followed prospectively for at least one year, and the gold-standard for final
      diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy will be defined by the presence of malignant cytology or
      histologic evidence (if the patient undergoes surgery) or with clinical and/or imaging
      follow-up consistent with pancreatic cancer (death or clinical progression). A detailed
      account of medical equipment used during each procedure, procedure time, clinic
      visits/hospitalizations due to procedure related complications, and number of repeat
      procedures will be recorded systematically.

      The investigators hypothesize that an on-site cytopathologist during EUS-FNA for pancreatic
      masses improves diagnostic yield, accuracy, and lowers the duration, complications and the
      need for repeat procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) plays an integral role in the diagnosis of suspected pancreatic
      cancer, and the EUS findings are crucial for determining the course of future management and
      potential treatment options for these patients. EUS is the most sensitive imaging modality
      for the detection of pancreatic masses, and has a sensitivity of greater than or equal to
      90%. Furthermore, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) plays an important role in
      accurate staging of pancreatic cancer with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity close to
      100%. EUS-FNA is considered to be cost-effective by virtue of its impact on therapeutic
      management. In particular, real-time tissue sampling by EUS-FNA is possible when a
      cytopathologist (pathologist skilled in evaluating fine needle aspiration specimens) is able
      to be present at the time of FNA in order to review the biopsy slides and make a preliminary
      diagnosis. The availability of an on-site cytopathologist has the potential to provide quick
      diagnostic and predictive information to confirm the presence and staging of suspected
      malignancy. The rationale for an on-site cytopathologist includes increasing the adequacy and
      yield of biopsy tissue/aspirate which can decrease the need for additional passes to obtain a
      diagnostic yield of tissue. This hypothesis, however, has not been formally examined.

      In this proposed randomized controlled multicenter trial, the investigators hypothesize that
      an on-site cytopathologist during EUS-FNA for pancreatic masses improves diagnostic yield,
      accuracy, and lowers the duration, complications and the need for repeat procedures. This
      hypothesis will be explored in the context of the following specific aims.

      Specific aim #1: To compare the diagnostic yield of malignancy and proportion of inadequate
      specimens between the two groups.

      Specific aim #2: To compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of EUS-FNA between the
      two groups using histologic diagnosis or cytologic diagnosis in conjunction with clinical
      and/or imaging follow-up as the gold standard.

      Specific aim #3: To compare the duration, rate of complications and repeat procedures between
      the two groups.

    <description>The Investigators would like to look at each of the two groups to assess whether or not having an onsite cytopathologist during EUS-FNA increases the diagnostic accuracy of pancreatic malignancies. To do this, the Investigators will compare the percent of patients in each group who were accurately diagnosed with a malignancy during EUS-FNA to see if the on-site cytopathologist group yields a higher percent of positively diagnosed malignancies.</description>

    <description>Final slides will be reviewed by three experienced cytopathologists blinded to the patient's randomization group.
