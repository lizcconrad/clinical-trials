  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of pyronaridine and artesunate is an antimalarial therapy in development.
      This Mass Balance study is intended to determine the rate and extent of excretion of total
      radioactivity in urine and faeces following administration of a single oral micro-dose of
      14C-pyronaridine in humans.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a monocenter, open-label, non-placebo-controlled, single-group,
      single-dose study. Six subjects will receive a single dose of Pyronaridine 720 mg orally
      administered together with 14C-Pyronaridine (approx. 100 µg, 800 nCi (29600 Bq). Safety
      measurements (12-lead ECG, vital signs, blood chemistry and haematology) and adverse events
      will be monitored throughout the study.

      Subjects will come to the clinic the evening before the dosing of Pyronaridine. After the
      drug intake at day 1, subjects will have regular in-house periods for specimen collection up
      to 87 days after the drug administration Blood, faeces and urine will be collected during the
      hospitalisation periods. Samples will be analyzed for radioactivity by Accelerator Mass
      Spectrometry (AMS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male subjects between the ages of 40 and 55 years with a body weight between 60 and 90
             kg and a body mass index calculated using Quetelet's Index - weight (kg)/height2 (m2)
             between 18.5 - 30.0

          2. Signed and dated a written informed consent form (ICF) before undergoing any study
             related activities, including discontinuation of any prohibited medications

          3. Medically normal subjects with no significant abnormal findings at the screening
             physical examination as evaluated by the investigator

          4. Strictly normal values of ALT, AST and bilirubin and normal or abnormal and clinically
             insignificant results (if agreed by the Investigator and the Sponsor on a case by case
             evaluation) of the other blood and urine laboratory parameters at screening
