  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a highly specific vascular complication of type 1 and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Calcium dobesilate(CD) or Doxium has been tested in the treatment of
      diabetic retinopathy showing a slowdown of the progression of the disease after long-term
      oral treatment,as a potent antioxidant. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) Besides being a very potent
      vasoconstrictor,acts as a mitogen on the vascular smooth muscle and play the main role in the
      failure of autoregulation that it is an important and often early feature of diabetic
      retinopathy.several studies have been confirmed that inflammation besides oxidative stress
      are the main mechanisms,in the pathogenesis of DR and hsCRP can play a sensitive role in
      detecting inflammation in these patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effects
      of CD on decreasing ET-1 and hsCRP serum levels in patients with diabetic retinopathy.
