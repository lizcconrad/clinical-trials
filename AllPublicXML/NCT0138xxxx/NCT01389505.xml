    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized and comparative study is to quantify the functional and
      structural alterations of the macula in patients with proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
      submitted to laser photocoagulation and to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab
      as a adjuvant therapy in preventing the adverse events of that procedure. The patients with
      proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) with indication of binocular laser photocoagulation
      will be examined by ophthalmologists who will measure the visual acuity and contrast
      sensitivity, perform slit lamp examination, fundus examination and optic coherence tomography
      before and after laser photocoagulation. Laser photocoagulation will be performed in both
      eyes according Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study that advocate the realization of 3
      episodes of laser photocoagulation in 3 weeks. This comparative study analyses the effect of
      intravitreal bevacizumab one week before laser photocoagulation and one, three and six months
      after the randomization visit. The fellow eye will be submitted only to laser
      photocoagulation and will be considered as control. It is estimated a sample of 30 patients.
      All procedures, purposes and methods will be explained to all patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current gold standard for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is
      panretinal photocoagulation. Therefore this study is designed using both treatments in the
      same patient: intravitreal Bevacizumab plus panretinal photocoagulation in one eye, compared
      to panretinal photocoagulation alone in the contralateral eye. These patients had their
      visual acuity and contrast vision measured and complete ophthalmological examination was
      performed, including macular slit lamp examination, fluorescein angiography and optical
      coherence tomography.

      Patients with similar proliferative diabetic retinopathy without high risk characteristics
      receive laser therapy in both eyes and intravitreal Bevacizumab injections in one eye. For
      the Bevacizumab injections, numbing drops, antibiotic drops, and drops to dilate the pupil,
      and possibly and anesthetic injection, are put in the eye before the medicine is injected
      into the vitreous. Patients return for follow-up visits 1 day, 1 and 4 weeks after the
      injection, and then 3 and 6 months. Patients whose condition does not improve may undergo new
      evaluation.
