    <textblock>
      Because locally far-advanced gastric cancer combined with adjacent tissue invasion has a poor
      prognosis, some phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are performed
      in Japan. However, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) achieves superior local tumor
      control compared with NAC. This feasibility trial explored the feasibility and safety of
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) in this type of gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since S-1 (combined drug of tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine and potassium oxonate)
      was approved in Japan in 1999 after a large-scale clinical trial, adjuvant chemotherapy with
      S-1 has been the standard treatment for stage II/III gastric cancer. However, for
      far-advanced gastric cancer, various adjuvant chemotherapies, including S-1, have not
      achieved satisfactory results. Therefore, Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) is currently
      performing phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locally
      far-advanced gastric cancer. However, previous studies of NAC have reported a pathological
      response rate of 15-50% for the main lesion, indicating no significant effect on local tumor
      control.

      On the other hand, other studies have reported that anticancer drugs, including S-1, have a
      radiosensitizing effect, and that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) achieves superior
      local tumor control compared with NAC. Therefore, we conducted a feasibility trial of NACRT
      with S-1 for locally far-advanced gastric cancer combined with adjacent tissue invasion.
