  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of Dronabinol 10 mg
      capsules verses Marinol.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the plasma levels of dronabinol (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol)and the principle
      active metabolite 11-OH-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol levels produced after administration of
      the test formulation with those produced after administration of a marketed reference
      product, under fasted conditions.
