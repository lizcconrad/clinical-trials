  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of metformin and topiramate on
      second-generation antipsychotic-induced obesity. The secondary domain we look at is the
      adverse effects of both drugs. The investigators hypothesize that metformin and topiramate
      are effective in treating obesity induced by second-generation antipsychotics.
