        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be female, greater or equal to 18 years of age

          -  Be willing to undergo immediate breast reconstruction with sub-pectoralis muscle
             placement of a breast implant

          -  Be willing to undergo mastectomy with healthy, well vascularized skin flaps
             anticipated by the surgeon

          -  Be in good health other than breast pathology and be suited to general anesthesia and
             planned treatments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have undergone breast radiation treatment and/or is preoperatively evaluated to
             require radiation treatment to the breast area during the course of the study

          -  Have a known allergy to silk

          -  Have any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes, which is clinically known to impact
             wound healing ability

          -  Have undergone previous breast surgery with the exception of mastectomy, breast
             biopsy, cyst removal, lumpectomy, mastopexy, reduction and/or augmentation

          -  Have had a prior soft tissue support device implanted in the breast

          -  Have a condition or be in a situation that, in the Investigator's opinion, may put the
             subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with the subject's participation in the study
