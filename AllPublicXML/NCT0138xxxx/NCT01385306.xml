    <textblock>
      The objective of this feasibility research study is to gather preliminary clinical data
      regarding the safety and potential clinical benefit of noninvasive neurostimulation of the
      vagus nerve with the AlphaCoreâ„¢ system for the relief of acute bronchoconstriction due to
      asthma.
