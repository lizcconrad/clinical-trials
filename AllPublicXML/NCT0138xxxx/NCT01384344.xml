  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive and memory disorders are characterized of Alzheimer disease. In addition,
      psychologic and behavioural symptoms, called speak neuropsychiatric symptoms, are frequents
      and play an important role in prognostic and intervention. These symptoms are noticed before
      the diagnostic of dementia, their prevalence and their intensity increase with the evolution
      of disease. Apathy, which is characterized by a decrease of motivation, is the most frequent
      of this behaviour disrupt. Clinically, a decrease, or a totally, lack of interest, initiative
      and blunting emotional are noticed. Fundamentally, apathy is considered as a decrease of
      cognition and behaviour to &quot;go in goal&quot;. Assessment of psychological and behavioural symptoms
      is realised principally with neuropsychiatric scales. These contribute to obtain particular
      informations about health of patient allowing by patient and caregiver discussions and
      impressions of clinician. These scales are simples but loss of subjectivity. An alternative
      of this method is the use of gerontechnology as actigraphy (system out-patient which records
      locomotive activity with the help of piezo-electrical sensor fixed on a bracelet) and video
      recording which is associated to an informatic treatment of signal in order event
      recognition.

      The aim of study is to realise an objective assessment of activities &quot;go in goal&quot; during
      experimental sequence which has well-characterized acts, using at the same time an
      actigraphic record of activity &quot;motive&quot; (system of assessment indirect of apathy fit) and a
      video records which uses an informatic event recognition system. The assessment will realise
      with participants controls (n=30) and Alzheimer disease patients with (n=20) or without
      (n=20) apathy, during well-characterized records. The final aim is to obtain a particular
      assessment of some disorders behaviours, as apathy, which is principally characterize by a
      decrease of behaviours &quot;to go in goal&quot;.
