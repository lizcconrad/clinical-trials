  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation(AF)is the commonest arrhythmia worldwide and can lead to significant
      morbidity and mortality, posing an increasing public health burden. Restoration of sinus
      rhythm (SR) is the preferred strategy in symptomatic patients but outcomes with
      anti-arrhythmic drugs (AAD) are poor. The alternatives to AAD are two-fold.Firstly, catheter
      ablation (CA)- a technique that uses catheters (thin tubes) to deliver small 'heat lesions'
      to areas of the heart to eliminate AF. Secondly, surgical ablation, where multiple incisions
      are made in the atria to restore SR. Long term results from this traditional surgical
      approach are excellent however as it is technically difficult open-heart procedure with
      significant morbidity and mortality, it is seldom used.

      CA is very effective in restoring SR in the early stages of AF when it is a paroxysmal
      (intermittent) rhythm disturbance. If not treated at this stage AF inevitably evolves into a
      more persistent or permanent state and becomes more difficult to treat with CA. Therefore,
      the optimum approach to treat patients with symptomatic long standing persistent AF has yet
      to be determined and remains a key area of on-going research.

      New minimally invasive, thoracoscopically assisted surgical(closed-heart)approaches have
      recently developed which ablate a wide area around the pulmonary veins, and may offer
      advantages over the best current strategies in CA. There are also clear advantages for
      patients with greater safety and less discomfort when compared to traditional surgical
      open-heart procedures.

      At present there is small amount of encouraging data on this thoracoscopic surgical technique
      but there is no data comparing these two modalities of treatment in persistent AF patients.
      The investigators therefore wish to prospectively investigate the safety and efficacy of this
      thoracoscopic surgical technique and compare with CA in this group of patients. MRI scanning
      will also be used to visualise the effects of ablation by analysis of scar formation.

      This will be a pilot, prospective, observational study of catheter ablation compared with
      thoracoscopically assisted, surgical ablation strategies using a case control design.

      The study population will be patients between the ages of 18 and 80 with symptomatic
      long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (≥1≤5 years) and good left ventricular function
      where at least one anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) has failed, or where such drugs are
      contraindicated or not tolerated.

      Thoracoscopically Assisted Surgical Ablation Group Patients assigned to this group will
      undergo minimally invasive, thoracoscopically assisted, surgical ablation to isolate the
      pulmonary veins (PVI) using a radiofrequency (RF) clamp device. This will include
      ganglionated plexi ablation +/- LAA excision/exclusion.

      Catheter Ablation Group Patients will undergo pulmonary vein isolation, linear and
      electrogram based ablation.

      Recurrences Only one redo procedure is allowed for atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrences in the
      12 month follow-up period.
