  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for the evaluation of the benefits of 1 st Trimester risk markers in
      detecting Early Onset Pre-eclampsia and the use of the Placental Growth factor(PIGF) as a
      potential marker for Trisomy 21 and other aneuploidies.

      Aim of this prospective nonprofit study is to analyze the benefits of early onset pre
      eclampsia risk assessment in the 1st trimester (measuring biochemical markers [PIGF], blood
      pressure and Doppler ultrasound), and how the results can permit to modify or influence the
      course of the preeclampsia during the pregnancy. The investigators will also evaluate the
      potential use of the PIGF as a marker to improve the prenatal screening with the currently
      used nuchal translucency, serum Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free beta
      subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (fBhCG) parameters.
