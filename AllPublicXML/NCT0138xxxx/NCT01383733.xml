  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, multiple ascending dose study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of RO5458640 in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. Cohorts of patients will receive ascending doses of RO5458640
      intravenously, either weekly or every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks, until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs.
