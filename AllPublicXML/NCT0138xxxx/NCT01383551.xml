  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed of this study is to determine if an intervention, known as the &quot;Becoming
      Parents&quot; programme, is more effective in improving the mental health, marital relationship
      and parental competence of expectant couples in a Chinese community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transition to parenthood is potentially a stressful life event for many new parents, which,
      if not properly managed, could have adverse effects on their mental health, marital
      satisfaction, and parent-child relationships. The proposed programme, &quot;Becoming Parents&quot;,
      aims to turn the challenges of the transition into opportunities of learning and support for
      these parents. Building on our experience of instituting a pioneering programme to support
      new fathers prenatally, &quot;Becoming Parents&quot; has an extra component of support for new parents
      in the postnatal period using trained volunteers from the community networks. Through
      &quot;Becoming Parents&quot;, seamless antenatal-postnatal care based on a hospital-community
      partnership will be provided to 125 expectant couples in a target community which is known
      for its high risks for postnatal depression, child abuse and intimate partner violence. In
      addition to addressing the health promotional needs of the target community, &quot;Becoming
      Parents&quot; will also illustrate how a community's capacity for health promotion can be
      maximized through the collaboration of healthcare providers and network of community partners
      in helping couples function more optimally during their transition to parenthood.
