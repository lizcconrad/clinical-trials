  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ionizing radiation has a number of harmful effects in humans. The most important among these
      is the induction of cancer. It is assumed that damage to DNA in the nucleus of a single cell
      can induce cancer. Among the different types of lesions inducted, DNA double-strand breaks
      (DSBs) are considered to be the most relevant effects that can initiate carcinogenesis.

      The investigators are already conducting several other studies to prospectively compare the
      inducted DSBs by coronary CT-angiography and conventional coronary angiography. Extending
      these examinations to investigate the induced DSBs by myocardial scintigraphy allows a
      comparison of all three relevant imaging methods of the heart that incorporate ionizing
      radiation.

      To evaluate this, the investigators are planning to examine patients who are scheduled for a
      clinically indicated myocardial scintigraphy. These examinations are routinely done by the
      Department of Nuclear Medicine in either a 1-day or a 2-day protocol according to the
      diagnostic reference values of the Federal Department for Radiological Protection. Blood
      samples will be taken from these patients at predefined time steps before and after the
      examination and DNA double-strand breaks will be determined from these blood samples
      specifically considering the applied activity of the tracer and the exposition kinetics.
