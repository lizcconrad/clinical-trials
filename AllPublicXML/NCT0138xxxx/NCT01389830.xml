      Objectives:

      The primary objective of the research project is to investigate how declining health status
      influences the end-of-life (EOL) treatment preferences in Latino Medicare beneficiaries with
      cancer and to examine if and how these preferences are modified by predisposing
      characteristics (i.e., acculturation, education, medical mistrust, perceived racism) and/or
      provider-related characteristics (i.e., ethnicity, language used, provision of interpreters,
      or patient navigators). The specific aims are:

        1. To determine if declining functional status influences the end-of-life treatment
           preferences of older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.

        2. To determine if predisposing characteristics (i.e., acculturation, age, education,
           medical mistrust, perceived racism) and/or provider-related characteristics (i.e.,
           ethnicity, language used, provision of interpreters, or patient navigators) modify the
           association between end-of-life treatment preferences and declining health status in
           older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.

        3. To identify if the end-of-life treatment preferences of Latino Medicare beneficiaries
           with cancer differ from those of older Medicare beneficiaries without cancer.

      Latino Medicare Beneficiary With Cancer:

      This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors (such as
      language of choice) and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients
      influence end-of-life treatment choices over time.

      If participant decides to take part in this study, participant will complete a questionnaire
      once a month for 9 months, over the telephone. The questionnaire asks participant about
      participant's end of life and decision making preferences, as well as questions about
      participant's health status and other basic questions about participant such as participant's
      education level, age, and health insurance. The first phone questionnaire, the one
      participant will answer today, will take about 30 - 40 minutes to complete. The monthly
      surveys after today will take about 20 - 30 minutes to complete each month. Participant will
      be considered off of the study in nine months.

      Should participant become too ill and are unable to complete the surveys, researchers will
      ask a proxy to respond on participant's behalf. A proxy in this case, should be someone
      participant trusts, who knows participant well enough to know how to answer the health
      questionnaire on participant's behalf. A proxy is usually a spouse, child, other close family
      member or friend. This person will only have to answer questions about participant. He or she
      will not answer any questions about him or herself. Researchers will ask participant to
      provide researchers with the contact information of the person participant selects as
      participant's &quot;questionnaire proxy&quot; today at the end of this consent form. If participant is
      able to complete all 9 surveys, researchers will not contact the proxy.

      Information from this study will be used only for research purposes. All identifying
      information such as participant's name and address will be kept private. This information may
      be kept at MD Anderson and University of Houston (UH) forever. Participant will be assigned a
      code number so that participant's name will not be used. The research team at MD Anderson and
      UH will be able to link the code number to participant's name. Researchers will take
      appropriate steps to keep participant's survey responses confidential. However, there is no
      guarantee of absolute confidentiality. Participant's information will be protected according
      to state and federal law. The research team may share study information with certain
      individuals including the National Institutes of Health and institutional study monitors who
      verify the accuracy of the information to see that the research is being conducted in a safe
      and correct manner.

      Answering the survey questions over the phone may cause participant to feel tired. The
      questionnaires may involve topics that are sensitive in nature. Participant may refuse to
      answer any question that makes participant feel uncomfortable. If participant has concerns
      after completing the survey, participant is encouraged to contact participant's doctor, the
      study chair, or MD Anderson's Institutional Review Board.

      Latino Medicare Beneficiary Without Cancer:

      This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors (such as
      language of choice) and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients
      (provider ethnicity, use of interpreters), influence end-of-life treatment choices over time.

      If participant decides to take part in this study, participant will complete a one-time
      questionnaire today, over the telephone. The questionnaire asks participant about
      participant's end of life and decision making preferences, as well as questions about
      participant's health status and other basic questions about participant such as participant's
      education level, age, and health insurance. This questionnaire will take about 30 - 40
      minutes to complete. Participant will be considered off the study after participant completes
      this one-time questionnaire.

      Information from this study will be used only for research purposes. All identifying
      information such as participant's name and address will be kept private. This information may
      be kept at MD Anderson and University of Houston (UH) forever. Participant will be assigned a

      questionnaires may involve topics that are sensitive in nature. Participant may refuse to
      answer any question that makes participant feel uncomfortable. If participant has concerns
      after completing the questionnaires and interviews, participant is encouraged to contact
      participant's doctor or the study chair.
