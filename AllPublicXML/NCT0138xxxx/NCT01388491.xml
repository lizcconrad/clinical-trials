      <recruitment_details>Of the 351 healthy women screened for enrollment, 293 at 26 centers in the European Union (EU) (21 centers) and Israel (5 centers) met entry criteria and were considered to be eligible for this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 58 women who were screened but not randomly assigned to receive treatment, 10 were excluded on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria, 32 withdrew consent, and 6 were lost to follow-up before the baseline visit. An additional 10 participants were not randomly assigned to treatment for other reasons.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants were in a fasting state and had refrained from moderate to vigorous exercise prior to phlebotomy on the day of this lab draw. Change from baseline was analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of covariance with covariate adjustment for baseline, treatment, month, and the treatment by month interaction.</description>
          <population>Per protocol (PP) population with BL and at least 1 post-BL value for this measurement. PP population included all data from intent-to-treat (ITT) participants obtained prior to any major protocol violations. PP participants were analyzed according to the treatment actually received.</population>
