  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood samples and health information (e.g., age at diagnosis, test results) are collected for
      the purposes of genetic research. The blood samples are assigned a number and stored in a
      repository for safe keeping until they are needed for a research project. Participants are
      persons who are healthy (not having high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol
      levels) or persons who have Diabetes Mellitus Type II(T2D) and live in Indiana. Participants
      complete a questionnaire at the time the blood sample is drawn. Visits are repeated at 2 and
      5 years after initial contact. Researchers apply to the Fairbanks Institute for use of the
      blood samples and health information minus participant names and contact information. Their
      research is required to be related to find genes or substances made by genes that may be
      involved in Diabetes Mellitus Type II with the purpose of improving the investigators
      understanding of the illness potentially leading to the development of new diagnostic tools
      for identifying the illness, new treatments,or preventative measures.

      Study Aim:

      The purpose of this study is to create an extensively annotated bio-repository platform for
      hypothesis-driven research that will lead to advancements in the diagnosis, treatment and
      prevention of diseases common to the population of Indiana. The second phase of this research
      platform will be created by collecting blood samples from two groups of individuals in the
      Central Indiana community, one with documented evidence of Diabetes Mellitus Type II(T2D),
      and a second group of age, gender and ethnicity matched individuals without clinical evidence
      of Diabetes. Each individual's blood sample will be linked to their clinical, demographic and
      epidemiological information, gathered both retrospectively and prospectively.

      Recruitment:

      This study will include 500 individuals with T2D (the T2D Group) and 500 individuals who are
      age, gender, and ethnicity matched to the T2D Group, but without presentation of clinical
      evidence of T2D (the Control Group). To reflect the growing representation of Hispanics in
      Central Indiana, Hispanics will be overly recruited in both groups so that the study
      population accurately reflects the general population of Central Indiana.

      Follow-up:

      As this is a prospective, longitudinal study, follow-up of study subjects is intended to
      include two follow up visit and continue indefinitely, unless, of course, at any time,
      consent for further follow-up is withdrawn by the subject. Follow-up will include visits at 2
      and 5 years post initial contact and continuing access to the subject's medical record to
      pursue data concerning changes in the subject's health. Subjects may be contacted by
      telephone, mail or email every twelve months to ask if they wish to continue participation in
      the study. The 2 and 5 year follow up visits mirror the initial visit.

      The collected dataset (made up of the collected blood samples linked to clinical and
      epidemiological information collected retrospectively and prospectively), will be used in
      medical research to find genes, or gene products such as RNA or proteins that will help in
      understanding the causes of disease and will guide the development of new treatments

        Inclusion Criteria:T2D Group

        Study subjects will be recruited for the T2D group based on a history confirmed by the
        medical record of at least one of the following:

          -  A fasting blood glucose of greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL on two separate
             occasions

          -  A random (non-fasting) blood glucose of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL on two
             separate occasions

          -  A blood glucose of greater than 200 mg/dL at 2 hours during a standard oral glucose
             tolerance test

          -  A HgbA1c of greater than or equal to 6.5%

        Females who are pregnant will be excluded.

        Control Group

        Study subjects for the Control Group will have:

          -  no confirmed history of T2D as defined above

          -  A fasting blood glucose of 100 mg/dL or less

        Medical records will be obtained to ensure subjects meet study inclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:Exclusion criteria for both the T2D Group and the Control Group are a
