  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the permeability, or 'leakiness' of the airway epithelium (the inner
      lining of the lung) in asthmatic patients. Increased leakiness of this lining has been shown
      in asthmatic patients by other studies, not only in the lung but also possibly in the gut,
      perhaps reflecting a widespread defect. This leakiness may underline the interaction between
      the environment and a person's genetic make up, and may contribute to why some people get
      asthma, and how severe it is. Increased leakiness may allow increased exposure to inhaled
      allergic substances, helping to perpetuate the inflammation in the lungs that is a hallmark
      of asthma.

      Specifically, this study will attempt to modify and reduce this permeability through the use
      of a substance called 'keratinocyte growth factor', or 'kgf'. KGF is a naturally occuring
      human protein, which is involved in stimulating the growth of cells lining the layers of the
      skin and gut, helping to repair damage and maintain their structure. It has been manufactured
      in a laboratory as the commercial compound 'Palifermin', which has already been used in
      humans to reduce damage to the lining of the mouth after chemotherapy. The study will see if
      Palifermin can similarly improve the lining of the lung in asthma patients and improve their
      symptoms. To date no treatments have been used in this area in asthma, and if successful the
      study will open up a whole new area of therapy
