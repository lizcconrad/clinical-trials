  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diaphyseal long bone fractures are usually associated with high energy trauma in which
      femoral shaft fracture is one common fracture in young age group. Surgery is usually needed
      for the diaphyseal lone bone fractures and the painful conditions always hinder weight
      bearing which is important for fracture healing and functional recovery. Fracture healing in
      cortical bone is less predictable than trabecular bone because they are less active and blood
      supply is more critical. Therefore accelerating fracture healing and rehabilitation of long
      bone fracture will absolutely bring significant economic benefit to the society in term of
      hospitalization and sick leave cost.

      Low-magnitude, high-frequency vibration (LMHFV) treatment can provide systemic mechanical
      stimulation and is reported with multiple effects on musculoskeletal tissues. LMHFV can
      enhance the blood circulation and osteogenic effect in normal subjects and animals. Our
      previous clinical study also indicated that LMHFV could enhance the balancing ability and
      muscular function in normal post-menopausal women after treating whole-body vibration. For
      the fracture healing effect, an acceleration of healing by inducing callus formation and
      maturation in rat model was also reported in our previous studies.

      In this study a total of 50 unilateral closed femoral shaft fracture patients of either
      gender aged 20-40 years old will be recruited and they will be randomized to either control
      and vibration group. The vibration group will be treated with LMHFV for 6 months. The
      findings of this study will provide very useful scientific data to support the application of
      LMHFV for fracture healing.
