      of diabetes' nurse and dietitian will lead to an improvement of the patients' metabolic
      balance, a decrease in complications' rate, a reduction of hospitalizations and an economic
      streamlining.

      The investigators assume that during the study, subjects from the intervention group will
      reach a better metabolic balance than the control group. In this group the following changes
      will occur:

        -  A decrease in HbA1C levels.

        -  A decrease in Hypoglycemia events.

        -  A decrease in DKA events.

        -  A decrease in patients' visits in ER and hospitalizations.

        -  An improvement in the knowledge of the patients and their families about the disease.
