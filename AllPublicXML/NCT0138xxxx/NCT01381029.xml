    <textblock>
      Investigators in the Division of Infectious Diseases are carrying out a study to determine if
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive patients receiving the Seasonal Influenza
      vaccination develop an adequate antibody response. The study group will consist of
      individuals seen in the Infectious Diseases Clinic who are HIV-seropositive and receive the
      Seasonal Influenza vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to establish the immunologic response in HIV-seropositive individuals to the
      FDA approved seasonal influenza vaccine when it is available. HIV-seropositive individuals
      seen in the Infectious Diseases Clinic at George Washington University, Medical Faculty
      Associates and receive this vaccination, on label, as part of standard of care will be
      invited to participate.

      The study will require a 10-ml sample of whole blood to be drawn from each participant prior
      to the dose of the seasonal influenza vaccine and at 3 weeks after the vaccine dose and at 3
      months after the vaccine dose. No additional samples are envisioned. Serum will be separated
      and will frozen and stored in the Clinical Trials Unit until all patient samples have been
      obtained. At that time the antibody levels to the vaccine antigens will be measured.

      Data that will be collected from the subject's medical record includes the following:

        -  Age, gender, race

        -  CD4 count

        -  HIV viral load

        -  History of prior influenza immunization including the 2009-2010 trivalent vaccine

        -  HIV antiviral medication history

      Data that will be collected from the subject during participation in study

        -  Antibody levels prior to vaccination

        -  Dose date of the seasonal influenza vaccination

        -  Antibody levels 3 weeks after the vaccination

    <description>The primary endpoint will be to measure the change from baseline in vaccine-strain specific antibody levels. Titers of &gt; or = 40 U will be considered protective and a &gt; 4-fold rise in antibody titer will be considered an adequate response in previously antibody-negative patients. Data from this study will assist in defining the efficacy of the influenza vaccine in the HIV-infected population and the ability of HIV-infected patients to generate an appropriate immune response, as well as maintain an appropriate response, to the influenza vaccine.</description>
