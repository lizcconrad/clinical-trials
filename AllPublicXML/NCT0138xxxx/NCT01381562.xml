    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of GSK2251052 in subjects with complicated intra abdominal
      infections. GSK2251052 will be compared to meropenem, an IV therapy that is approved for use
      in the treatment of subjects with cIAI. GSK2251052 has a spectrum of microbiological activity
      that includes pathogens responsible for cIAI.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE included AEs those result in death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition</description>

    <description>12-lead ECGs was obtained during the study using an ECG machine and performed with the participant in a semi-supine position rested in this position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Measurements deviated substantially from previous readings were repeated immediately. Number of participants with normal and abnormal ECG findings were reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin for Partcipants With Significant Hemoglobin Drop</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in whom the hemoglobin level dropped by more than 30% from Baseline that was not attributable to acute blood loss were recorded and immediately withdrawn from study treatment. Baseline assessments were recorded on Visit 1 (Day 1) and used as Baseline values. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from Day 42 values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing. The mean change from Baseline in hemoglobin for participants with significant hemoglobin drop were reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 5 to 9 post IV therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Test of cure-clinical success was resolution of signs and symptoms of complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) for participants who were clinical successes at the end of IV therapy visit with no new symptoms recorded that were not present at Baseline and no use of additional antibiotic therapy for cIAI. Test of cure-clinical failure was persistence of signs and symptoms of cIAI recorded at Baseline, or reappearance of signs and symptoms that had previously resolved, or new signs and symptoms recorded that were not present at a previous visit, or receipt of additional or alternate antibiotic therapy for cIAI or participant had died. Test of cure- unable to determine was refusal to consent to a clinical examination, lost to follow-up. Participants who were 'unable to determine' at End of IV therapy were considered 'unable to determine' Test of cure Visit as well. Due to early termination of the study, a Bayesian approach for informal hypothesis testing was not performed.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at five centers in four countries (United Stated of America, Spain, France and Russia) between 03-October-2011 and 05-March-2012.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 15 participants were enrolled in the study; of those, 5 participants each were randomised to receive GSK2251052, 750 milligram (mg) or 1500 mg or meropenem 1.0 gram (g), intravenously. One participant in the GSK2251052 1500 mg group was randomised but not treated, thus safety and efficacy populations consisted of 14 participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Participants in whom the hemoglobin level dropped by more than 30% from Baseline that was not attributable to acute blood loss were recorded and immediately withdrawn from study treatment. Baseline assessments were recorded on Visit 1 (Day 1) and used as Baseline values. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from Day 42 values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing. The mean change from Baseline in hemoglobin for participants with significant hemoglobin drop were reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Response at Test of Cure Visit (5-9 Days Post-therapy) in Microbiological Intent to Treat (MITT) Population</title>
        <description>Test of cure-clinical success was resolution of signs and symptoms of complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) for participants who were clinical successes at the end of IV therapy visit with no new symptoms recorded that were not present at Baseline and no use of additional antibiotic therapy for cIAI. Test of cure-clinical failure was persistence of signs and symptoms of cIAI recorded at Baseline, or reappearance of signs and symptoms that had previously resolved, or new signs and symptoms recorded that were not present at a previous visit, or receipt of additional or alternate antibiotic therapy for cIAI or participant had died. Test of cure- unable to determine was refusal to consent to a clinical examination, lost to follow-up. Participants who were 'unable to determine' at End of IV therapy were considered 'unable to determine' Test of cure Visit as well. Due to early termination of the study, a Bayesian approach for informal hypothesis testing was not performed.</description>
