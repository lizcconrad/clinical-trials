  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the main causes of morbidity and the
      main cause of re-hospitalization in subjects with neurogenic bladder. Long-term antibiotic
      therapy increases the risk of multi-resistant bacterial infections, without reducing the rate
      of symptomatic UTIs. Our non-comparative preliminary study has shown that Weekly Oral Cyclic
      Antibiotic Programme (single, weekly dose of antibiotic X on even weeks, and antibiotic Y on
      odd weeks) seem to drastically reduce both the number of symptomatic UTIs and the number of
      hospitalizations in patients with neurogenic bladder, without affecting bacterial ecology.

      The objective of this study is to validate this preliminary work with a large-scale
      randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study.

    <description>The Weekly Oral Cyclic Antibiotic Programme consisted of the alternate administration of an antibiotic once per week. The antibiotics that were chosen (efficient for urinary tract infection, well tolerated, low selection pressure) included : Amoxicillin 6000 mg, Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 3000 mg, Cefixime 400 mg, Fosfomycin trometamol 6000 mg, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 2400 mg. During week A,the patient received a single antibiotic (A), and the following week B the patient was given another antibiotic (B). For each patient, antibiotics were specifically chosen according to the results of urine cultures.</description>
