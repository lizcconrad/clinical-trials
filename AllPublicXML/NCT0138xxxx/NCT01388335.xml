  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of enzastaurin (LY317615), on a protein
      (enzyme CYP2C9) which is involved in the metabolic pathway of warfarin in patients with solid
      tumors or lymphomas. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be
      collected. This is a drug interaction study so the treatment of the disease will not be the
      main purpose of the study.

      This is a Phase 1, open label, fixed sequence, 2 period study conducted in patients with
      solid tumors or lymphomas. The duration of participation in this study will be up to
      approximately 38 days not including screening, after which patients will be allowed to
      continue receiving enzastaurin. There is no planned duration for the extension phase of this
      study; patients will be allowed to continue to receive enzastaurin until fulfilling one of
      the criteria for discontinuation, such as unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

             patients who have a congenital long-QT-syndrome in their own or family medical history
             should be excluded at the investigator's discretion. Patients with intraventricular
             conduction delays (for instance, right or left bundle branch blocks) should also be
