    <textblock>
      A retrospective study to demonstrate the optimal depth of right side bronchial blocker for
      complete right lung separation. Data were collected from all patients who completed right
      side VATS with right side BB from Jan 2010 through Nov 2010.

      After general anesthesia, an 8.0 mm internal-diameter single-lumen endotracheal tube was
      inserted orally. An independent Coopdech bronchial blocker, which has a formed-curvature near
      the catheter tip, was directly inserted through the single-lumen endotracheal tube into right
      main bronchus. Chest inspection, auscultation, fiberoptic bronchoscopy confirmation, if
      necessary, by visualizing the blocker cuff located at right main bronchus just below the
      carina was performed firstly. After placing patients in left decubitus position, the position
      of BB was reconfirmed by auscultation firstly; then complete collapse of the right upper lobe
      was adjust, if necessary and reconfirmed on the video of thoracoscopy by both surgeon and
      anesthesiologists. The depth of BB and the need of fiberoptic bronchoscope were recorded. All
      the patients were extubated in operation room after completion of operation with optimal
      analgesia. Data collected included; age, sex, body height and weight and the depth of
      right-sided BB from incisor was then recorded.
