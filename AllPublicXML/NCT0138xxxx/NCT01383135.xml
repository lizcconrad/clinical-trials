    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a pilot test of a new tracer in healthy human
      volunteers to define normal tracer biodistribution (where the tracer goes), stability (how
      much metabolises), pharmacokinetics (how much stays in which organs and for how long), and
      radiation dosimetry (organ radiation dose). The same radiopharmaceutical will then be tested
      in cancer patients.
