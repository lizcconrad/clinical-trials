    <textblock>
      A systematic literature search a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm was created. The
      hypothesis of this study was that the goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm is feasible and
      can improve clinical outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a systematic literature search a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm was created. The
      algorithm was adapted to international standards and consensus was reached through a modified
      Delphi method at international meetings. The feasibility of using the algorithm for
      intraoperative haemodynamic management was tested and the resultant clinical data analyzed
      retrospectively for several types of surgery with the hypothesis that the goal-directed
      haemodynamic algorithm is feasible in the clinical setting and can improve clinical outcome.
