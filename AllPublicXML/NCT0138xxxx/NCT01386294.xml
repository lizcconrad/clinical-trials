      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of intravaginal 1%
      tenofovir gel in preventing Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection and Herpes Simplex
      Virus (HSV-2) infection in sexually active women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multicenter trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of 1% tenofovir
      gel, administered vaginally by approximately 2900 sexually active women at high risk for
      sexually transmitted HIV. Approximately 2600 women aged 18-30 years old will be enrolled to
      achieve the required number of endpoints to show an effect on HIV-1 infection, while up to
      300 additional women aged 31-40 years old will be enrolled to collect more safety information
      in this age group.

      This is an event driven study that plans to randomize seronegative women. Participants will
      be randomized to a 1:1 ratio to receive 1% tenofovir gel or placebo gel. Each will be asked
      to insert a dose of the assigned study product within 12 hours prior to a coital event and
      another dose as soon as possible within 12 hours after a coital event. Participants will be
      advised to use only two doses of gel in a 24 hour period.

      All women will be evaluated for the rates of adverse events and the rate of HIV
      seroconversion. In addition, the study will evaluate several secondary endpoints that bear
      directly on potential risks and benefits of vaginal tenofovir gel use.

    <description>Incidence of HIV-1 infection: HIV incidence will be determine by detection of HIV antibodies using two HIV rapid tests (of which one will be FDA approved) according to algorithm in protocol. One of the rapid tests will detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2; the other will be specific for HIV-1. All endpoints will be reviewed by an expert committee (the Endpoint Adjudication Committee). In carrying out this review, the Committee will use guidelines prepared by the protocol committee for this purpose and recorded in the Manual of Procedures</description>

    <description>HSV-2 status will be established at enrollment according to a testing algorithm in the protocol. At product discontinuation samples of all those that were HSV-2 seronegative at enrollment will be tested. To identify and confirm incident HSV-2 infections and the timing of these infections, blood samples that were stored will be tested to determine the earliest equivocal or positive result. These samples will be then be tested by HSV Western blot. Samples positive on HSV Western blot will be deemed to be incident HSV-2 infections.</description>
