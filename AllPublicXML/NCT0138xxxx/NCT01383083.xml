    <textblock>
      The prevalence of PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts in Western
      countries has been estimated to range between 1.6 and 12.5 cases per million adults, with
      25-50% of this population affected by Eisenmenger's syndrome. The rarity of this syndrome,
      combined with its complex pathophysiology, account for the insufficient understanding of the
      principles underlying its proper treatment.Recent decades have seen developments in pulmonary
      hypertension pathophysiology which have led to the introduction of new groups of drugs:
      prostacycline analogs (Epoprostenol, Treprostinil, Beraprost, Illoprost), phosphodiesterase
      inhibitors (Sildenafil, Tadalafil), endothelin receptor antagonists (Bosentan, Sitaxantan,
      Ambrisentan) and nitric oxide. These drugs should be administered to patients in III-IV NYHA
      class. Despite successful early results, the therapeutic effect on patients with Eisenmenger
      syndrome has not been conclusively established The treatment strategy for patients with PAH
      associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and, in particular, those with
      Eisenmenger's syndrome is based mainly on clinical experience rather than being evidence
      based. Although Eisenmenger's syndrome is uncurable disease, the survival rate is relatively
      higher than primary PAH, and the patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome are relatively younger
      group. So the improvement of exercise tolerance and quality of life is very important.
      Several randomized controlled trial reported favourable short- and long-term outcomes of
      treatment with the orally active dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan in patients
      with Eisenmenger's syndrome. However, there was scare data of outcomes of treatment with the
      inhaled iloprost in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome. In Korea, most of patients with
      Eisenmenger's syndrome are treated with conservative therapy instead of administration of
      PAH-specific drug, because of lack of clinical experience. Moreover, oral agent such as
      bosentan, sidenafil is preferred than iloprost becase of more evidence and convenience. Our
      therapeutic efforts should be directed mainly towards preventing complications. As a rule, we
      should avoid agents with no established therapeutic efficacy and try to alleviate symptoms
      without any additional risk, so as not to disrupt the existing clinical balance.

      In this study, we investigate to know the clinical benefit of iloprost on patients with
      Eisenmenger's syndrome by the use of functional and hemodynamic parameters, which would add
      the evidence of PAH-specific agents on the Eisenmenger's syndrome

      A large proportion of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), in particular those with
      relevant systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, will develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) if
      left untreated. Persistent exposure of the pulmonary vasculature to increased blood flow, as
      well as increased pressure, may result in pulmonary obstructive arteriopathy, which leads to
      increased pulmonary vascular resistance that, if it approaches or exceeds systemic
      resistance, will result in shunt reversal. Eisenmenger's syndrome, the most advanced form of
      PAH associated with CHD, is defined as CHD with an initial large systemic-to-pulmonary shunt
      that induces severe pulmonary vascular disease and PAH, with resultant reversal of the shunt
      and central cyanosis. The histopathological and pathobiological changes seen in patients with
      PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, such as endothelial dysfunction
      of the pulmonary vasculature, are considered similar to those observed in idiopathic or other
      associated forms of PAH.

    <description>In the adult patient group, iloprost acceptable target dose is 2.5 ug 4-6 times/day according to the patient's compliance. Because of the concern of safety and tolerability, during the first 4 weeks of treatment, patients receive 2.5 ug twice daily. After 4 weeks, this is increased to the target dose, if iloprost is well tolerated.</description>
