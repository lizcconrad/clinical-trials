    <textblock>
      Approximately 300 million short peripheral intravascular catheters (PIVs) were sold in the
      U.S. in 2009. These short (&lt; 3 inches) peripherally inserted IV catheters are vital for
      providing patients with needed: 1) fluid, electrolyte, nutrient and blood product
      replacement, 2) medicines and 3) diagnostic solutions (dyes). However, these IV catheters
      have inherent risks or potential complications which may result from poor catheter securement
      or stabilization.

      When a PIV catheter is not properly secured, motion and micro-motion within the vessel cause
      injury to the vein. This damage to the vein is a primary cause of phlebitis, a distressing
      complication of PIV therapy. Additional complications of inadequate stabilization of the PIV
      catheter are infiltration, leaking at the insertion site, pain, infection and dislodgement.
      According to Royer (2003), the most common reason for PIV catheter failure is infiltration
      and dislodgement. Infiltration is more dependent on keeping the extremity still, where
      phlebitis is dependent on injuries due to the chemical nature of the drugs and fluids infused
      or by the physical trauma to the endothelium from IV pushes.

      The results of these complications are costly and can be serious if another vein cannot be
      immediately accessed or if the infiltrated infusate causes tissue necrosis. An unscheduled
      restart of another PIV catheter causes a delay in patient treatment, patient discomfort,
      patient dissatisfaction, safety concerns, nursing interruptions and additional costs. Actual
      costs associated with PIV catheter restarts include materials and nursing resources; yet
      intangibles such as, treatment for patient complications and patient dissatisfaction may be
      far more costly.

      One way to reduce the incidence of PIV catheter-associated complications is to use
      technologies that help reduce catheter movement thereby improving catheter stabilization. In
      addition to stabilization platforms added to the peripheral IV catheter design, catheter
      stabilization devices and modified transparent film dressings also help to reduce catheter
      movement and could possibly eliminate the need for routine catheter site changes.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to: 1) compare the number of PIV securement-related
      complications and PIV catheter restarts of one stabilization system to another stabilization
      system and 2) to determine which system provides a cost savings.
