    <textblock>
      The AC-052-391-study is a phase 3 study to investigate whether adding bosentan to inhaled
      nitric oxide in newborns with persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborns (PPHN) is a
      supporting and safe therapy and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of bosentan and its
      metabolites.

    <description>Concentrations were measured directly in dried blood spot samples scheduled to be taken immediately prior to first study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7.5 and 12 hours post-dose on Day 1. Cmax was obtained directly from the measured concentrations. Cmax was corrected to a dose of 2 mg/kg bosentan (Cmaxc). The target dose was 2 mg/kg. However, as the smallest dose unit was 8 mg (quarter of a tablet), it was not possible to achieve the exact target dose in all patients. Therefore, Cmax was divided by the actual dose (in mg/kg) and multiplied by 2 mg/kg.</description>

        <title>Maximum Whole Blood Concentration (Cmax) for Bosentan and Its Metabolites, Ro 47-8634, Ro 48-5033, and Ro 64-1056 on Day 1</title>
        <description>Concentrations were measured directly in dried blood spot samples scheduled to be taken immediately prior to first study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7.5 and 12 hours post-dose on Day 1. Cmax was obtained directly from the measured concentrations. Cmax was corrected to a dose of 2 mg/kg bosentan (Cmaxc). The target dose was 2 mg/kg. However, as the smallest dose unit was 8 mg (quarter of a tablet), it was not possible to achieve the exact target dose in all patients. Therefore, Cmax was divided by the actual dose (in mg/kg) and multiplied by 2 mg/kg.</description>

        <description>Concentrations were measured directly in dried blood spot samples scheduled to be taken immediately prior to study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7.5, and 12 hours post-dose on Day 5. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined on the basis of scheduled blood sampling time points using non-compartmental analysis. Actual blood sampling times were used only if there was a deviation of more than 5% from the scheduled times. AUCtau Day 5 was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule using the measured concentration-time values above the limit of quantification.</description>
