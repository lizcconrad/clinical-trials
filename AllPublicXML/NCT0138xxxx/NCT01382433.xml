    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is set out to find a human model for negative symptoms based on
      clinical observation that chronic cannabis users express negative symptoms and characterize
      by the same neurocognitive and electrophysiology characteristics like patient suffer from
      schizophrenia. Towards that end the first part of the study is set out to explore weather
      chronic cannabis user's express negative symptoms similar to patient suffer from
      schizophrenia. The second part of the study will explore the neurocognitive and
      electrophysiology characteristics of those cannabis users that express negative symptoms.
      This data will be compared to parallel data of schizophrenia patients with predominantly
      negative symptom.

      Several lines of biological and genetic evidence support the cannabinoid hypothesis for
      schizophrenia. Particularly, it is most significant clinically that the possible involvement
      of the cannabinoid system in the neural basis for the negative symptoms. This hypothesis
      based on clinical findings that chronic cannabis use causes a combination of symptoms
      including apathy, avolition, lack of interest, passivity, and cognitive impairments, the
      so-called &quot;amotivational syndrome,&quot; which resembles the core negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia in behavioral level as well as the brain level. Both are associated with the
      functions or integrity of the frontal lobe due to its role in creating self-directed
      behaviors, deficits in which may underlie alogia, anhedonia, and flat affect. Despite the
      aforementioned similarities, to date, there is no documentation for such a relationship.
      Recognition that chronic cannabis users share the same or similar constellation of symptoms
      and similar neurocognitive and electrophysiology characteristics could provide a key to
      develop a human model for negative symptoms and an essential tool to comprehensive
      understanding of the etiology of negative symptoms and development of an innovative therapy.

      The investigators Hypothesize That Chronic Cannabis Users Would Express the Same
      Constellation of Behaviors as Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia; as well as similar
      neurocognitive and electrophysiology characteristics
