    <textblock>
      This clinical trial focuses on helping African Americans with high blood pressure to manage
      their disease. The study will target their ability to read and understand health information
      (also called health literacy). The research method relies on community participation in equal
      partnership with the researchers to provide interactive workshops and home blood pressure
      self-monitoring with the assistance of telephone counseling by community health workers.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a culturally sensitive intervention focused on health
      literacy that is designed to reduce high blood pressure (HBP) in a vulnerable African
      American (AA) population. A community-based participatory research approach delivered by
      community health workers (CHW) will be used to address the following specific aims: Aim 1. To
      examine the effect of health literacy on self-care skills, including HBP knowledge, adherence
      to HBP and substance abuse treatment recommendations, communication skills, health care
      utilization, and BP outcomes in AAs with HBP. Aim 2. To conduct a pilot randomized,
      controlled trial with a delayed intervention control group to test the effectiveness of a
      health literacy-focused self-help HBP intervention program using CHWs in 100 AAs who reside
      in Baltimore City.
