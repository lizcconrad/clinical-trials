  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following extensive abdominal surgery for the treatment of endometrial or ovarian cancer,
      paralytic ileus frequently develops. Gum chewing can promotes the return of bowel function
      through the cephalic-vagal reflex and increased intestinal enzymes secretion.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate effects of adding gum chewing to the
      conventional postoperative feeding protocol on the return of bowel function, its related
      complications, and patients' satisfaction.
