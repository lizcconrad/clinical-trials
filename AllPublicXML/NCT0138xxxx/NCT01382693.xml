  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project, a small-scale pilot study, will attempt to determine if involvement in a
      group-based creative expression program may correlate with a reduction in use of psychotropic
      drugs for persons with dementia.

    <textblock>
      The study site has two skilled-nursing dementia Special Care Units. One unit will serve as a
      control with residents receiving the standard care activity program. The other unit will
      receive the standard care activity program as well as the TimeSlips storytelling program (two
      hour-long sessions per week for six weeks). The behavioral symptoms and psychotropic drug
      usage for both cohorts will be studied for eight months, the first four months with no
      intervention and the last four months with or without the six-week TimeSlips intervention.
