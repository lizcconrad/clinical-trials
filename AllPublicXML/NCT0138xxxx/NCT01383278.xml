  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-group RCT in 380 tobacco-using medical patients that will compare a single
      session, computer-directed 5 A's intervention for smoking (experimental condition) to
      screening and resource provision (control condition). Follow-up visits will occur at 1 and 3
      months post study enrollment. Measures will focus on tobacco use and related psychosocial
      outcomes (e.g. mood, stress). We will compare resources used and economic costs needed to
      implement each intervention.

      The Investigators hypothesize that patients receiving the computer-directed intervention will
      have significantly higher tobacco abstinence rates at 3 months post study enrollment compared
      to the control group. If indeed the computerized intervention increases tobacco abstinence
      rates compared to the control group, this intervention could be used to increase access to
      treatment for the millions of US smokers, ultimately reducing tobacco mortality and morbidity
      rates in this country.
