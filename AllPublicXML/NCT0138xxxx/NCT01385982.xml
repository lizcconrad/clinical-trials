  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically significant test results require timely clinician follow-up including the
      non-urgent clinically significant, or actionable, test results that have received less
      standardized management and attention. Unfortunately, failure to correctly manage actionable
      test results is not infrequent and may be associated with important delays in diagnosis and
      treatment and patient harm. The investigators have designed a safe practice intervention to
      improve the management of actionable test results for ambulatory patients in a large
      healthcare system.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Primary care physicians will be enrolled in the study by virtue of being an actively
        practicing clinician in an PHS ambulatory practice, and having at least one patient with a
        diagnostic test included in the PHS CCSTR intervention. The patient population will consist
        of adult patients &gt;17 years of age with diagnostic tests in the affiliated ambulatory
        practices of PHS. Patients will be recruited into the study by a review of electronic
        medical record data to identify patients with a diagnostic test specified in the PHS CCSTR
        intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who do not meet the inclusion/eligibility requirements will be excluded.
