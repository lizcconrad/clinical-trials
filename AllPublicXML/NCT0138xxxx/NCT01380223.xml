  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Omecamtiv Mecarbil in Healthy Volunteers</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The highest infusion rate tolerated by at least eight subjects. A dose was intolerable if: 1) the pattern of intolerance clearly distinguished active drug from placebo, or 2) the number of subjects intolerant of the dose level in question was at least 3 more than the number of subjects intolerant of placebo.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline of Systolic Ejection Time at Various Omecamtiv Mecarbil Infusion Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pooled analysis of the echocardiographic measure systolic ejection time. The systolic ejection time is the period during which the aortic valve is open and blood is flowing across the valve. Echocardiograms from cohorts 1,2,3,4 were binned into either placebo group or groups based on infusion rate of omecamtiv mecarbil.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline of Fractional Shortening at Various Omecamtiv Mecarbil Infusion Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pooled analysis of the echocardiographic measure fractional shortening. Fractional shortening is the percentage of change from baseline in the left ventricular cavity dimension with systole. Echocardiograms from cohorts 1,2,3,4 were binned into either placebo group or groups based on infusion rate of omecamtiv mecarbil.</description>

             screen.

         10. Subject has had a serious adverse reaction or significant hypersensitivity to any
             drug.

         11. Subject has donated 500 ml or more of blood within the month prior to screening.
