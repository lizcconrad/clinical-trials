  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies can transport and deliver radioactive elements capable of releasing
      sufficient amounts of energy to destroy tumor cells. In this clinical trial, we will study
      alpha particle radio immunotherapy using lead-212 (²¹²Pb), an isotope with a short path
      length targeted to malignant cells by the trastuzumab antibody, as a potential treatment for
      metastatic diseases.

      This Phase I trial is designed to determine the toxicity profile of ²¹²Pb-TCMC-Trastuzumab,
      its dose-limiting toxicities, and its anti-tumor effects in patients with HER-2 positive
      intraperitoneal cancers.

    <description>In preparation for the study, patients screened and eligible will have a peritoneal catheter placed and the evening prior to the injection of the labeled antibody will receive furosemide. Herceptin will be administered IV followed by a single IP infusion of ²¹²Pb-TCMC-Trastuzumab. Serial sampling of blood, urine, and dosimetry will be performed following treatment to determine the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and antitumor effects.</description>

    <description>The starting dose level will be 200 μCi/m² of ²¹²Pb-TCMC-Trastuzumab. Three to six patients will be treated at each dose level, and dose escalation will proceed if no more than 1 out of 6 patients in a cohort experiences dose limiting toxicity.
