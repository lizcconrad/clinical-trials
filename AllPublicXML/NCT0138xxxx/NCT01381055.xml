      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pentoxifylline associated to pentavalent
      antimony has a higher cure rate than pentavalent antimony alone in the treatment of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis.

    <description>All lesions will be categorized as either active or healed (cured) at follow-up visits. Only lesions with complete re-epithelialization, without raised borders, infiltrations or crusts will be considered healed. Evaluation of the lesions will be performed by 2 clinicians who will be unaware of the group assignment of all patients.
Bidirectional measurements of ulcers will be taken of the patients' lesions at the initial visit, and at each follow-up visit with standardized caliper. The area involved will be calculated as the product of the two measurements.</description>
