    <time_frame>Post-treatment Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA levels &lt;lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), (target detected or target not detected) at Post-treatment Week 12. The limit of detection for HCV RNA was 10 IU/mL and the LLOQ was 25 IU/mL. For analysis purpose, participants were assigned to following 3 race/ethnicity cohorts: Black/African American, Latino, and White non-Latino. Some participants were represented in more than one race/ethnicity cohort.</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose to last dose plus 7 days (treatment period [TP]) through 48 weeks after the end of TP (follow-up period [FUP])</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a pre-existing condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE was defined as a medical event that at any dose resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or required or prolonged hospitalization. Treatment-related AE was defined as an AE that had certain, probable, possible, or unknown relationship to study drug. For analysis purpose, participants were assigned to following 4 race/ethnicity cohorts: Black/African American, White/Caucasian, Latino and Non-Latino. Some participants were represented in more than one race/ethnicity cohort.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 33 clinical sites in United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 448 participants were enrolled, and 246 entered treatment period. Remaining 202 did not enter treatment period (29: withdrew consent, 17: lost to follow-up, 156: no longer met study criteria). As per protocol, any participant who discontinued the treatment period was still expected to enter the post-treatment follow-up period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Daclatasvir + Pegylated-interferon Alfa 2a + Ribavirin</title>
          <description>Participants received daclatasvir (BMS-790052) 60 mg tablet orally once daily, along with pegylated-interferon alfa 2a solution for injection 180 μg/0.5 mL subcutaneously once weekly, and ribavirin 1000 mg per day for those weighing &lt;75 kg or 1200 mg per day for those weighing ≥75 kg for a period of 24 weeks. Participants who achieved a virologic response (Hepatitis C Virus RNA undetectable at both Weeks 4 and 12) completed therapy at Week 24 and were followed for 48 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Participants who did not achieve the virologic response, continued to receive pegylated-interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin for additional 24 weeks (total treatment duration of 48 weeks), and were followed for 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Dose modifications to pegylated-interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin were allowed to manage tolerability and adverse events.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Virologic Response at Post-treatment Week 12 (SVR12)</title>
        <description>SVR12 was defined as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA levels &lt;lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), (target detected or target not detected) at Post-treatment Week 12. The limit of detection for HCV RNA was 10 IU/mL and the LLOQ was 25 IU/mL. For analysis purpose, participants were assigned to following 3 race/ethnicity cohorts: Black/African American, Latino, and White non-Latino. Some participants were represented in more than one race/ethnicity cohort.</description>
        <time_frame>Post-treatment Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>All treated participants. Modified intent-to-treat analysis (participants meeting the response criteria / all treated participants) was performed for Black/African American and Latino cohorts.</population>

            <title>Black/African American Cohort</title>
            <description>Participants belonging to Black/African American race, received daclatasvir (BMS-790052) 60 mg tablet orally once daily, along with pegylated-interferon alfa 2a solution for injection 180 μg/0.5 mL subcutaneously once weekly, and ribavirin 1000 mg per day for those weighing &lt;75 kg or 1200 mg per day for those weighing ≥75 kg for a period of 24 weeks. Participants who achieved a virologic response (HCV RNA undetectable at both Weeks 4 and 12) completed therapy at Week 24 and were followed for 48 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Participants who did not achieve the virologic response, continued to receive pegylated-interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin for additional 24 weeks (total treatment duration of 48 weeks), and were followed for 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Dose modifications to pegylated-interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin were allowed to manage tolerability and adverse events (AEs). This cohort included Latino and Non-Latino participants.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA Levels &lt;Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ), Target Detected or Target Not Detected, at Specified Time Points</title>
        <description>The limit of detection for HCV RNA levels was 10 IU/mL and the LLOQ was 25 IU/mL. Data for post-treatment Weeks 36 and 48 were based on participants who had achieved virologic response (defined as HCV RNA levels &lt;LLOQ, target not detected) at both Weeks 4 and 12, and completed 24 weeks of study treatment. For analysis purpose, participants were assigned to following 3 race/ethnicity cohorts: Black/African American, Latino, and White non-Latino. Some participants were represented in more than one race/ethnicity cohort.</description>

            <description>Participants belonging to Black/African American race, received daclatasvir (BMS-790052) 60 mg tablet orally once daily, along with pegylated-interferon alfa 2a solution for injection 180 μg/0.5 mL subcutaneously once weekly, and ribavirin 1000 mg per day for those weighing &lt;75 kg or 1200 mg per day for those weighing ≥75 kg for a period of 24 weeks. Participants who achieved a virologic response (HCV RNA undetectable at both Weeks 4 and 12) completed therapy at Week 24 and were followed for 48 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Participants who did not achieve the virologic response, continued to receive pegylated-interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin for additional 24 weeks (total treatment duration of 48 weeks), and were followed for 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Dose modifications to pegylated-interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin were allowed to manage tolerability and adverse events (AEs). This cohort included Latino and Non-Latino participants.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment-related AEs, and Who Died</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a pre-existing condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE was defined as a medical event that at any dose resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or required or prolonged hospitalization. Treatment-related AE was defined as an AE that had certain, probable, possible, or unknown relationship to study drug. For analysis purpose, participants were assigned to following 4 race/ethnicity cohorts: Black/African American, White/Caucasian, Latino and Non-Latino. Some participants were represented in more than one race/ethnicity cohort.</description>
