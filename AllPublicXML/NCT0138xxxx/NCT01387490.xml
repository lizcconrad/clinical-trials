  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effects of Individualized Scheduled Telephone Support (ISTS) and
      Usual Care (UC) for service members with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). A total of 400
      service members will participate in this study. ISTS is a telephone intervention that
      provides injury-related education, training in problem solving, and focused behavioral
      strategies for problems (e.g. anxiety, depression) that commonly co-occur with MTBI. ISTS
      also includes access to usual care and web-based and printed educational material. The 12
      phone calls included in ISTS will be administered over a 6-month period. UC is the usual care
      provided to service members attending the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Clinics at Madigan
      Army Medical Center and Womack Army Medical Center, plus web-based education and 12 mailings
      of educational materials over a 6-month period. Subjects will complete major assessments at
      study entry and then 6 months and 12 months later. The primary aim of the study is to compare
      the effects of ISTS and UC on post-concussive symptoms and emotional distress at the 6-month
      assessment. The investigators predict that participants who receive ISTS will report lower
      levels of post-concussive symptoms and emotional distress at the 6-month assessment.
      Secondary aims include comparing the longer term effects of ISTS and UC at the 12-month
      assessment, as well as comparing their effects on other outcomes such as post-traumatic
      stress symptoms, quality of life, resilience, and work activity.
