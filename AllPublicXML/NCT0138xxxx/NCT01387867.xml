  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to Danish and international guidelines the recommended first-line of management for
      people with osteoarthritis consist of exercise, education, analgesic medication, and, if
      necessary, weight reduction. It is well documented that exercise has a positive effect on
      pain and physical function in patients with knee OA, but the effect of exercise on hip OA is
      sparsely investigated.

      Aim of the study: To investigate the effects of 1) strength training, and 2) Nordic Walking,
      and 3) unsupervised home based exercise on muscle function, endurance, pain level, physical
      activity, and health related quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip.

      The effects of exercise on muscle mass and the mechanisms behind the osteoarthritis, i.e.,
      disease activity, inflammation, and cartilage degradation, are investigated in a subgroup
      (n=45) of the participants.

      Study hypotheses: Strength training will have a greater effect on physical function and
      muscle strength than Nordic Walking and home based exercise; 2) Nordic Walking will have a
      greater effect on endurance than strength training and unsupervised home based exercise; 3)
      Strength training and Nordic Walking will have a greater effect on pain level and health
      related quality of life than unsupervised home based exercise.
