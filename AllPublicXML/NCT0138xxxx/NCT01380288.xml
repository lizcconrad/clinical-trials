      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the changes of cognitive function (as
      measured by ADAS-Cog) in the two group of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated
      with and without white matter changes after rivastigmine patch therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) increase the amount acetylcholine at ACh receptors
      within the brain, and are the primary medications used to treat AD. Alzheimer's disease
      patients are frequently associated with mild or moderate white matter changes on MR imaging.
      The impact of whiter matter changes on the efficacy of cognition, functional abilities,
      behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and caregiver burden for probable Alzheimer's disease is
      not well known. There are very few studies for the efficacy of rivastigmine between the
      patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease associated with or without vascular risk
      factors.

      Recently, the rivastigmine patch demonstrated efficacy comparable to the highest doses of
      rivastigmine capsules, with markedly improved tolerability profile. The investigators
      hypothesized that rivastigmine patch will provide benefits to AD patients with white matter
      changes compared to those without any white matter changes. Possible explanation about
      favorable benefits for AD with white matter changes is that rivastigmine may act on both
      Alzheimer's and vascular pathologies contributing to dementia, providing additive treatment
      effects in patients suffering from both conditions concurrently. To our Knowledge, there was
      no study or clinical trial to compare the changes of cognitive function, ADL, BPSD and
      caregiver burden in two groups of patient with Alzheimer's disease associated with or without
      white matter changes after rivastigmine transdermal patch therapy.
