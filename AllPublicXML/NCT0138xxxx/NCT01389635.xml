    <textblock>
      Abdominoplasty is one of the most popular body-contouring procedures, yet it is also among
      the most hazardous aesthetic procedures currently performed. It was shown, in many studies,
      to be associated with a significant complication rate, some of which are life-threatening.
      This study describes the investigators experience with a series of abdominoplasties performed
      under epidural anesthesia. Outcomes are presented, especially in terms of complication, and
      the practical advantages of this method are discussed.
