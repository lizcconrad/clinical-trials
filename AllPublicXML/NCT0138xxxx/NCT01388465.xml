  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the hypothesis that patients who are exposed to daily
      text-message (TM) assessments with feedback will have better adherence to prescription than
      those patients not exposed to TM-based queries with feedback.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Short course, oral antibiotics are frequently prescribed to patients treated/discharged from
      the Emergency Department. Medication adherence involves the patient taking the proper daily
      dosing of prescribed medication for the entire length of time it is prescribed. Previous
      studies have shown that prescription non-filling rates range from 5 to 20%. Other studies
      have shown that even if patients fill their prescription, as low as 30-40% will properly take
      the medication. The purpose of this study is to determine if the proportion of patients
      discharged from the Emergency Department that are adherent with antibiotics is higher in
      patients that are provided TM support using self-report.
