  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug SOM 230 in addition to
      standard therapy of gemcitabine can shrink or slow the growth of pancreatic cancer. The
      safety and tolerability of different doses of SOM 230 will also be studied. The participants'
      physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings taken while
      on-study will help us (the study doctor and Moffitt Cancer Center) decide if SOM 230 is safe
      and effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I study of combination therapy with SOM 230 LAR and
      standard treatment with gemcitabine. We will utilize a staggered, sequential dose-escalation
      design to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SOM 230 LAR when combined with standard
      doses of gemcitabine. Cycle will be defined as 28 days.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Gemcitabine is administered by IV
      infusion. The dose should be based on the patient's actual baseline body weight; the dose
      will be recalculated if there is a weight change of &gt; 10% from baseline. The dose of
      gemcitabine will be given over 30 minutes, weekly every 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest
      period. SOM 230 LAR will be administered as an intramuscular dose determined by the dosing
      schema, every month.
