  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many children with cancer cannot participate regularly in school due to frequent
      hospitalizations for treatment or treatment related effects such as pain, nausea, and
      fatigue. Prior studies have shown that children with cancer desire to attend school while
      receiving therapy despite these challenges, and that they report psychological and
      psychosocial difficulties if unable to attend. While school attendance has been found to
      correlate with Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), self-efficacy beliefs, and
      self-esteem, little is known about how children with cancer experience school attendance
      while receiving active cancer therapy. The purpose of this study will be to explore how 6-12
      year old children with cancer perceive school attendance pre and post diagnosis during active
      therapy as measured at one-time point, 6 months (Â± 2months) into active therapy.

      The primary objective of this study is to explore 6-12 year old pediatric oncology patients'
      perceptions of their school experiences pre and post cancer diagnosis.

      This study will utilize qualitative interview methods. Potential participants who meet
      inclusion criteria will be approached by the principal investigator to obtain consent and
      assent in accordance with institutional guidelines. Upon giving consent, the child will
      participate in a one-hour audio-taped interview session with the principal investigator. The
      interview session will begin with some general rapport building questions to help the child
      grow comfortable with the interviewer, the interview room, and the interview format. The rest
      of the interview will consist of questions pertaining to the child's school experiences both
      before and during diagnosis and treatment for malignancy. The interview will conclude with
      the child being asked to draw a picture of themselves at school before diagnosis, and of
      themselves at school since being diagnosed. Demographic data will be collected from each
      participant's medical chart pertaining to age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, and the type of
      school attended before and after diagnosis and the principal investigator and study staff
      involved in data coding will complete field note entries directly following the conclusion of
      each interview or data coding session (see Appendix V). The participant's involvement in the
      study will end at the conclusion of the interview session.

        Participants will consist of 6-12-year-old patients currently on therapy for a primary
        diagnosis of a leukemia/lymphoma or solid tumor at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in
        Memphis, Tennessee. Potential participants will be recruited via a medical chart review
        performed by the principal investigator in order to identify children who have been on
        active therapy for a malignancy for 6 months (plus or minus 2 months) at the time of
        enrollment on this protocol
