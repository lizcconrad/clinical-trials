        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients at least 18 years of age

          2. Patients with AK lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area on the upper extremity

          3. Patients with a 25 cm2 area of normal skin on the upper inner arm

          4. Female subjects must be of either non-childbearing potential or childbearing
             potential, provided there is a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test prior to
             exposure, to rule out pregnancy

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using high
             effective methods of contraception

          6. Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all study requirements

          7. Obtained written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Location of the selected treatment areas within 5 cm of an incompletely healed wound
             within 10 cm of a suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma
             (SCC)

          2. History or evidence of skin conditions other than the study indication that would
             interfere with evaluation of the study medication

          3. Clinical diagnosis/history or evidence of any medical condition that would expose a
             subject to an undue risk of a significant AE or interfere with assessments of safety,
             as determined by Investigator clinical judgment.

          4. Anticipated need for in-patient hospitalisation or in-patient surgery during the study
             period.

          5. Current participation in any other interventional clinical trial

          6. Subjects who have received treatment with any non-marketed drug product within the
             last two months

          7. Subject known or, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the
             Clinical Study Protocol

          8. Females who are pregnant, of child-bearing potential and wishing to become pregnant
             during the trial, or are breast feeding

          9. Undergone cosmetic or therapeutic procedures within 2 cm of the selected treatment
             areas in the 2 weeks prior to the screening visit

         10. Use of acid-containing therapeutic products within 2 cm of the selected treatment
             areas in the 2 weeks prior to the screening visit

         11. Use of topical salves/topical steroids: within 2 cm of the selected treatment areas in
             the 2 weeks prior to the screening visit

         12. Treatment with immunomodulators, cytotoxic drugs or interferon/interferon inducers,
             systemic medications that suppress the immune system or UVB in the last 4 weeks

         13. Treatment with 5-FU, imiquimod, diclofenac, or photodynamic therapy: within 2 cm of
             the selected treatment areas within 8 weeks prior to any screening visit

         14. Use of systemic retinoids
