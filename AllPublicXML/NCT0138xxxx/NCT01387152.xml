    <textblock>
      Nuclear stress testing evaluates whether the heart receives enough blood, by injection of a
      nuclear isotope during a stress on the heart that permits taking pictures of the heart
      muscle. A low-radiation-dose protocol for nuclear stress testing involves injecting less of
      the nuclear isotope than standard protocols, by utilizing a new, more efficient camera
      (called an Alcyone camera) which could decrease radiation dose to patients while still
      providing excellent clinical information. Subjects will undergo imaging under the Alcyone
      camera after undergoing stress testing with exercise or a standard medication simulating
      exercise, and then at rest if needed. Subjects will have follow-up to measure events
      occurring after the test, such as death, heart attack, unstable angina, repeat emergency
      department visit for chest pain evaluation, or repeat imaging needed to evaluation for
      coronary artery disease. Radiation doses and quality of the images from the imaging with the
      new protocol will be recorded to compare to those used in standard nuclear imaging protocols.
      The primary study hypothesis is that greater than 90% of patients who have a normal very low
      dose stress first myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) will be free at 3 months after
      study of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and repeat emergency
      department visit for chest pain evaluation or repeat anatomical or functional cardiac
      imaging.
