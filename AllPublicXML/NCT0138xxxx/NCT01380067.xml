      laparoscopic hernia sac high-ligation

        -  has a high recurrence rate laparoscopic hernia sac high-ligation and the lateral
           umbilicus ligament covering the hernia opening

        -  The investigators developed a method of laparoscopic hernia repair by applying a new
           concept in hernia repair. The hernia opening was tightened, and hernia opening region
           repaired with a lateral umbilicus ligament in a tension-free manner. This method
           combines the advantages of a secure repair achieved by the open method with the minimal
           invasiveness of the laparoscopic method. The investigators hypothesized that the lateral
           umbilicus ligament covering the internal hernia opening region after the laparoscopic
           purse-string knot would result in lower recurrence and the same operation relative
           complication.

      The primary outcome measure was the recurrence rate after surgery, and the secondary outcome
      measures included degree of postoperative pain, the amount of postoperative analgesia,
      procedural duration, number of days to recovery normal activity, surgical complications,
      cosmetic results, and patient satisfaction. The outcome was recorded at the outpatient visits
      10 days, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after the surgery. The cosmetic result was
      scored (unsatisfactory = 0, satisfactory = 1, good = 2, and excellent = 3) by the patients or
      parents, the attending nurse, and the surgeon (maximum points = 9). The patient satisfaction
      was scored similarly (unsatisfactory = 0, satisfactory = 1, good = 2, and excellent = 3). The
      long axis of the testes was measured.

        The sample size was calculated such that a 4% difference (Î± = 0.05) in recurrence rate at 5
        years between the groups could be detected with a power of 0.9. This required a sample size
        of 510 patients. Considering an estimated drop-out rate of 10%, we aimed to enroll 600
        patients.
