    <textblock>
      The objective of this research project is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate an
      Internet-based (web) application for SMART Recovery: Overcoming Addictions (OA). OA will be
      based on the four point cognitive-behavioral program for SMART Recovery
      (www.smartrecovery.org). The goal of the OA program is to help users learn cognitive and
      behavioral skills to abstain from drinking, drug use, and problem gambling.

      The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the OA web application for heavy
      drinkers in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with follow-ups at 3- and 6-months.

      The study design has three conditions: 1) participation in face-to-face SMART Recovery
      meetings alone; 2) use of the OA web application as a stand-alone intervention; and 3)
      combining the OA web application with participation in face-to-face SMART Recovery meetings.

      Study Hypotheses:

        1. All three groups will reduce their alcohol consumption, drug use (if any), and
           alcohol/drug-related problems relative to their baseline levels at the 3- and 6-month
           post-baseline assessments.

        2. The OA only group (Experimental group 1) will show a greater reductions in drinking,
           drug use (if any), and alcohol/drug-related problems relative to the face-to-face only
           (Control) group.

        3. The OA + face-to-face group (Experimental group 2) will have better outcomes on drinking
           and drug use variables compared to the Control group.
