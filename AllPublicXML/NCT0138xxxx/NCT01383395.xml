      Eligibility for participation of this study was determined from demographic information,
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
      within 4 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study were
      admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Samsung Medical Center on the day before dosing, and
      they were overnight-fasted from 10 p.m. of Day -1. Subjects were dosed simvastatin 40 mg
      orally around at 9 a.m. of Day 1. Subjects performed scheduled procedures including clinical
      laboratory tests and pharmacokinetic samplings for simvastatin. Subjects were dosed
      cilostazol 100 mg in the morning on Day 2 and discharged, and visited Clinical Trials Center
      on Day 3, Day 4 and Day 5 for the oral administration of cilostazol 100 mg. Subjects was
      admitted in the evening on day 5 and dosed simvastatin 40 mg plus cilostazol 100 mg
      concomitantly and scheduled pharmacokinetic sampling for simvastatin was performed. Next
      morning (Day 7), subjects were discharged
