  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer can be treated with one of monoclonal
      antibodies targeted against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This treatment is
      associated with a specific spectrum of toxicity: acne-like rash from limited up to erythema,
      often with severe pruritus, sometimes combined with other types of skin toxicities (hair and
      nail changes). Previously in STEPP study investigators shown that pre-emptive treatment with
      oral doxycycline (200 mg daily), topical steroids and sun blockers reduces the number of more
      severe skin side effects of panitumumab.

      The study is designed to described the profile of skin toxicity of EGFR blocking drugs
      combined with low-dose doxycycline (100 mg daily) used in the pre-emptive manner.

      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab or panitumumab usually
      develop the skin toxicity which can impair patients' quality of life as well as limit the
      treatment. We designed this trial to assess the effect of simplified protocol of pre-emptive
      treatment on the observed skin toxicities during cetuximab and panitumumab treatment of
      colorectal cancer.

      The study is a cohort observational, single center study which should result in estimation of
      particular types of toxicities, especially occurence of more severe (grade 2 and 3) side
      effects and assess the tolerance of doxycyline in the prolonged administration.

      The observation in the study is biweekly and is continued up to 8 weeks.
