  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in transplant pharmacotherapy have led to improved one-year patient and graft
      survival in kidney transplant recipients, but have not translated to enhanced long-term
      survival. An explanation for the disparity in outcomes is the negative role of antibodies in
      transplant graft survival. There currently does not exist maintenance immunosuppression that
      targets antibodies and standard of practice aims at removing circulating donor specific
      antibodies upon detection of antibody mediated graft damage but not prior to the detection of
      rejection. There exists an insufficiency of data regarding patient and donor characteristics,
      changes in immunosuppression, the risk of viral donor and patient seropositivity and the risk
      of non-compliance on the development of antibodies. By measuring antibody levels in the blood
      at specific time periods after transplant, we may have a better understanding of what types
      of patients will develop antibodies, when these antibodies appear and how changes to
      transplant medications may affect antibodies.

      The proposed project will examine the multifactorial risks associated with the development
      and appearance of donor-specific antibodies in the first year post-kidney transplant. The
      data collected will provide a historical perspective and preliminary pilot data to support a
      proposal for prospective antibody monitoring and to justify pre-emptively treating the
      antibodies in the absence of clinical signs of rejection.

    <textblock>
      Organ transplantation is an effective treatment for several end-stage organ diseases.
      Preventing rejection of transplanted organs remains the premier challenge. According to the
      humoral theory, donor specific antibodies (DSA) are the major cause of chronic rejection and
      allograft loss. Despite this, and evidence that links human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      antibodies to allograft dysfunction and loss, doubt remains about the cause-and-effect
      relationship and confirmation of this evidence is necessary to help facilitate change in
      transplant practice. Prospective monitoring for de novo DSA in the serum of patients who have
      received a transplant may allow for earlier detection, evaluation, and characterization of
      factors leading to the development of antibodies prior to the development of clinical
      manifestations of graft dysfunction.

      The contribution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and Class II
      antibodies to transplant outcomes is well documented. However, there is emerging evidence
      that antibody mediated rejection and the severity of outcomes may involve proteins and
      antibodies that go beyond HLA Class I and II. A number of assays are available for testing
      for these additional antibodies and proteins but they are currently not used for widespread
      patient monitoring in part due to lack of data justifying their commercial use. This pilot
      study will prospectively evaluate for the presence and/or emergence of these unique
      antibodies, (I.E. MICA antigen, IgG3 and C1Q) in serial samples of serum, and confirm or
      reject the utility of incorporating these assays into routine patient monitoring which might
      provide earlier evidence of emerging rejection. Serum samples will be stored indefinitely for
      future kidney transplant research projects.
