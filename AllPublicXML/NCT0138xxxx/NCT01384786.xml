  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hyperthyroidism and/or goiter are evaluated with blood samples and scintiscan
      before they are treated with radioiodine for their thyroid disease. Because the investigators
      do not get a histologically/final diagnosis the investigators want to make sure, that the
      patients treated do not have a thyroid cancer when treated.

      The investigators have found that thyroid cancer is not overlooked.
