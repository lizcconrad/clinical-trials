  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will measure the concentration of the drug called voriconazole which is used
      to fight infections caused by fungus in children who usually are cancer patients and have
      their immune system down. Since we know the dose in adults, and we think we know the matching
      doses in the young patients ages 2 to less than 15 years old, we will compare the amount of
      drug that goes into the system with what we know works in adults. We give the drug by a
      needle directly into the blood, then few days later we stop that and give the drug by mouth.
      Meanwhile, we draw a little bit of blood at certain times to measure the drug in it.
