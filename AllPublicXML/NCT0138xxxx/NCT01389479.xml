        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female.

          -  Adults 18-64 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Satisfactory baseline medical assessment by history, physical examination, and
             clinical laboratory testing.

          -  Capable of informed consent.

          -  Able, willing and likely to fully comply with study procedures and restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute illness at the time of enrollment.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus infection and/or chronic use of immunosuppressants of
             other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months of administration of the study vaccine.

          -  Presence of an unstable chronic illness.

          -  Complicated diabetes mellitus.

          -  Active neurological disorder.

          -  History of any demyelinating disease including Guillain-Barré syndrome.

          -  Any clinical laboratory abnormality.

          -  Any disorder of coagulation or treatment with coumadin derivatives or heparin.

          -  Vital sign abnormalities at screening.

          -  Acute or chronic liver, renal or inflammatory bowel disease or collagen vascular
             disease.

          -  Cancer, or treatment for cancer, within three years.

             visit.

          -  Positive urine drug screen at screening within 3 months prior to the screening visit
             or hard drugs. Products such as ativan, tylenol with codeine should be stopped
             sufficiently ahead of the screening visit in order to avoid a positive urine drug
             screen.

          -  Positive testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus at
             screening.

          -  Receipt of an influenza vaccine within 9 months prior to dosing.

          -  Planned administration of any other vaccines 30 days before study immunization or
             during the course of the study. Immunization on an emergency basis, such as Tetanus
             and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed for adult use, will be allowed provided the vaccine is
             not administered within two weeks prior to study immunization.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine or participation in an
             investigational study within 30 days prior to administration of study vaccine, or
             planned use during the study period.

          -  Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within three months of
             screening or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.

          -  Receipt of a depot injection or an implant of any drug within 3 months prior to
             administration of study vaccine.

          -  Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of Fluviral™ S/F or Fluzone®.

          -  A history of severe adverse reaction to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine.

          -  History of anaphylactic type reactions to consumption of eggs.

          -  Any other condition or social circumstance that, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for or unable to complete the study.

          -  Breast-feeding subject.

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test at screening.

          -  Female subjects having sexual intercourse with any non-sterile male partner within 14
             days prior to vaccine administration and without a history of acceptable
             contraception.
