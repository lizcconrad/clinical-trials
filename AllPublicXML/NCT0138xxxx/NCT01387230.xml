      The purpose of this study is to assess if 12 weeks' treatment with GSK573719 Inhalation
      Powder is safe and effective compared with placebo or no active drug intake, when
      administered once-daily in subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

    <textblock>
      Inhaled bronchodilators, such as beta 2 agonists and anticholinergics, and inhaled
      corticosteroids are the mainstays of therapy in patients diagnosed with COPD. Anticholinergic
      bronchodilators or long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists function by blocking
      endogenous airway smooth muscle cholinergic tone. Treatment with anticholinergics has been
      shown to significantly improve forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), resting and
      dynamic lung hyperinflation, symptoms, and exercise capacity in patients with COPD. Currently
      tiotropium is the only approved long acting muscarinic antagonist available for treatment of
      COPD.This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK573719 Inhalation Powder of 2 doses when
      administered once-daily via Novel DPI compared with placebo over a treatment period of 12
      weeks in subjects with COPD. There will be a total of 8 study clinic visits conducted on an
      outpatient basis. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will
      complete a 5 to 9 days run-in period followed by a 12-week treatment period. There will be 8
      clinic visits during three of which serial spirometry will be performed . The total duration
      of subject participation in the study will be approximately 14 weeks.

      This is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK573719 Inhalation Powder 62.5 mcg and 125 mcg
      when administered once-daily via Novel DPI compared with placebo over a treatment period of
      12 weeks in subjects with COPD.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either of the two doses of GSK573719
      Inhalation Powder doses or placebo for 12 weeks.

      There will be a total of 8 study clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis. Subjects who
      meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will complete a 5 to 9 days run-in
      period followed by a 12-week treatment period. Clinic visits will be at Screening,
      Randomization (Visit 2), Day 3 and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and 1 day after the Week 12 visit
      (Visits 1 to 8, respectively). A safety follow-up assessment will be conducted by telephone
      approximately 7 days after the end of the study treatment (FU Phone Contact). The total
      duration of subject participation, including the follow-up period will be approximately 14
      weeks. All subjects will be provided with albuterol/salbutamol for use on an &quot;as-needed&quot;
      basis throughout the run-in and treatment periods.

      Pre-dose spirometry will be conducted at each clinic visit. Six hour post-dose serial
      spirometry will be conducted at Visit 2 and at Visits 5 and 7. All subjects will be provided
      with a paper diary for completion everyday throughout the run-in period and 12-week treatment
      period. Subjects will use the diary to record their daily use of supplemental
      albuterol/salbutamol and to record any medical problems experienced and any medications used.

      At Visit 2 the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) will be administered. The Transition Dyspnea
      Index (TDI) will be administered at Visits 5, 6, and 7.

      Disease specific health status will be evaluated using the St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ) at Visit 2 and Visits 5, 6 and 7. Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse
      rate), 12-lead ECGs and standard clinical laboratory tests (hematology and blood
      biochemistry) including pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained at selected clinic visits.

      Approximately 198 subjects will be randomized to ensure at least 168 subjects complete the
      treatment period.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry on Days 2, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 85. Baseline is defined as the mean of the assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and 5 minutes pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24 hours after the previous morning's dosing (ie., trough FEV1 on Day 85 is the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after the morning dosing on Day 84). Change from Baseline was calculated as the trough FEV1 minus the Baseline. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline , smoking status, center group, day, and day by Baseline and day by treatment interactions.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean (WM) 0-6 Hour FEV1 Obtained Post-dose at Days 1, 28 (Week 4) and 84 (Week 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1, 28 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The WM FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The WM was calculated at Days 1, 28, and Day 84 using the 0-6-hour post-dose FEV1 measurements collected on that day, which included pre-dose (Day 1: 30 minutes [min] and 5 min prior to dosing; other serial visits: 23 and 24 hours after the previous morning dose) and post-dose at 1 hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours. Change from Baseline was the WM minus Baseline. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline (mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1), smoking status, center group, day, and day by Baseline and day by treatment interactions.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Serial FEV1 Over 24 Hours Post-dose at Days 1 and 84 (Week 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Serial FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry. Serial FEV1 measurements of interest for Day 1 were collected at 1, 3, 6, 23 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 and for Day 84, the measures were pre-dose (24 hours post-dose of Day 83 morning dose but prior to Day 84's dose) and 1, 3, 6, 23 and 24 hours post dose on Day 84. Baseline is the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as FEV1 value at the evaluated time point minus Baseline. Analysis performed separately by Visit/Day using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline, smoking status, center group, time, time by Baseline and time by treatment interactions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Day 85</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry on Days 2, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 85. Baseline is defined as the mean of the assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and 5 minutes pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24 hours after the previous morning's dosing (ie., trough FEV1 on Day 85 is the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after the morning dosing on Day 84). Change from Baseline was calculated as the trough FEV1 minus the Baseline. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline , smoking status, center group, day, and day by Baseline and day by treatment interactions.</description>

Change from Baseline was calculated as the trough FEV1 minus the Baseline. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline , smoking status, center group, day, and day by Baseline and day by treatment interactions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean (WM) 0-6 Hour FEV1 Obtained Post-dose at Days 1, 28 (Week 4) and 84 (Week 12)</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The WM FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The WM was calculated at Days 1, 28, and Day 84 using the 0-6-hour post-dose FEV1 measurements collected on that day, which included pre-dose (Day 1: 30 minutes [min] and 5 min prior to dosing; other serial visits: 23 and 24 hours after the previous morning dose) and post-dose at 1 hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours. Change from Baseline was the WM minus Baseline. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline (mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1), smoking status, center group, day, and day by Baseline and day by treatment interactions.</description>

        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Serial FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry. Serial FEV1 measurements of interest for Day 1 were collected at 1, 3, 6, 23 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 and for Day 84, the measures were pre-dose (24 hours post-dose of Day 83 morning dose but prior to Day 84’s dose) and 1, 3, 6, 23 and 24 hours post dose on Day 84. Baseline is the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as FEV1 value at the evaluated time point minus Baseline. Analysis performed separately by Visit/Day using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline, smoking status, center group, time, time by Baseline and time by treatment interactions.</description>
