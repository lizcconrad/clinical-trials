      This study consists of 2 parts. Part 1; The study will investigate the effects of morning
      versus evening dosing on the pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of 150 mg of ONO-5334 in
      healthy post menopausal women. The study design will be single-blind and 16 subjects will be
      enrolled. Part 2; The study will investigate the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of a
      single dose of 150mg of ONO-5334 in healthy post menopausal women. 12 subjects will be
      enrolled.
