    <textblock>
      This double blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial will compare the safety, efficacy
      and acceptability of two medical abortion regimens up to 63 days since last Menstrual Period
      (LMP) in Tunisia and Vietnam. The first regimen will include a 200 mg oral dose of
      mifepristone followed by 800 mcg buccal misoprostol. The second regimen will include two 800
      mcg doses of buccal misoprostol three hours apart. All drugs are administered AT home by the
      participant.
