    <textblock>
      In infants and toddlers wheezy bronchitis is a common viral disease. To relieve wheezing
      symptoms bronchodilators or corticosteroids are commonly used but the efficacy is not always
      satisfactory.

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of iv-magnesium in the
      treatment of moderate or severe bronchial obstruction associated with viral infection in
      small children.

      The study population will include the children attending the Pediatric Emergency Department
      of Oulu University Hospital because of respiratory infection and bronchial obstruction that
      is not relieved with conventional treatment. After written consent from the parents, the
      children will be randomized to get either intravenous magnesium sulfate or isotonic NaCl. The
      primary outcome is RDAI (Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument) scoring six hours from
      the infusion. Secondary endpoints are RDAI scoring and oxygen saturation at other time points
      and length of hospital stay.

      The sample size is 64 children at the age of 6 months to 4 years.

      If iv-magnesium is effective in relieving viral infection associated bronchial obstruction,
      that would be an important addition to the treatment of this common disease.

      symptoms bronchodilators or corticosteroids are commonly used but the efficacy is not always
      satisfactory.

      Intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate has been proven to be efficacious and safe for the
      treatment of acute asthma attacks in adults and school-aged children. The purpose of this
      trial is to investigate the effectiveness of iv-magnesium in the treatment of moderate or
      severe bronchial obstruction associated with viral infection in small children.
