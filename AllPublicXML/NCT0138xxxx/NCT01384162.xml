  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label safety and tolerability continuation study of intracerebroventricular
      administration of sNN0029, containing the growth factor VEGF165, in patients with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis that have previously participated in study sNN0029-001. The intention of
      the study is to investigate safety and tolerability of intracerebroventricular administration
      of sNN0029 and whether it can improve motor function and prolong survival in patients with
      ALS.

    Issues with development and supply of infusion system for delivery of IMP. Lack of favorable
    benefit risk ratio in sNN0029-003 study (review of interim data).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of ALS classified as definite, or probable with or without
             additional laboratory evidence, according to the revised WFN El Escorial criteria
             (Appendix B).

          2. Previous participation in study sNN0029-001 with completion of 12 weeks study drug
             administration.

          3. To have completed the investigations associated with safety in study sNN0029-001
             without development of clinically significant safety concerns.

          4. Patient has been given written and verbal information about the continuation study,
             has had the opportunity to ask questions about the study, and understands the time and
             procedural commitments.

          5. Patient has given oral and / or signed consent (written) to participate in the study.
             In the event that a patient who gives oral informed consent is not physically able to
             sign the informed consent form (ICF) due to disease progression, a witness may sign
             the ICF on the patient's behalf.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic.

          2. Proliferative retinopathy.

          3. Non-proliferative retinopathy of moderate severity or higher.

          4. Concurrent clinically significant dementia as determined by the investigator.

          5. Concurrent clinically significant depression as determined by the investigator.

          6. Need for administration of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication (e.g. aspirin,
             Plavix, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). Low dose aspirin or
             occasional use of NSAIDs is allowed (See Appendix E).

          7. Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters
             as assessed by the investigator.

          8. For female patients, ongoing pregnancy or planned pregnancy

          9. Breast feeding
