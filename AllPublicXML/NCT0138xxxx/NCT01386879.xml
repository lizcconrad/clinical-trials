  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, pilot study is compare ease of tracheal intubation,
      amount of microaspiration and efficacy of secretion removal using three FDA (Food and Drug
      Administration)-cleared endotracheal tubes (ETT) after the induction of general anesthesia in
      the operating room (OR). Studies in the intensive care unit (ICU) have demonstrated a
      significant reduction in the incidence of ventilator acquired pneumonia when a ETT with
      suction above the cuff is used to remove secretions that accumulate above the inflated cuff.
      This will be the first study to evaluate the efficacy of above the cuff suctioning during
      general anesthesia and surgery.

      One hundred and ten adult patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery (general, colorectal
      or gynecological) requiring general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube and mechanical
      ventilation will be randomized into 3 groups to receive one of the following three
      endotracheal tubes:

        1. Teleflex ISIS HVT Cuffed Tracheal Tube with Subglottic Secretion Suction Port
           Endotracheal Tube (Teleflex ISIS ETT).

        2. Mallinckrodt TaperGuard Evac Endotracheal Tube (TaperGuard Evac ETT).

        3. Mallinckrodt Intermediate Hi-Lo Endotracheal Tube. (Standard ETT)

      The first two groups will be compared to standard ETT (third group) regarding easy of
      tracheal intubation, efficacy of suctioning of secretions, efficacy of sealing the trachea
      with an inflated ETT cuff by preventing the movement of test dye (methylene blue) from the
      pharynx into the trachea and incidence of post-operative respiratory complications.

    <description>The primary objective of the pilot study is to evaluate whether there is a difference between the 3 types of ETT in preventing the movement of test dye (methylene blue) from the pharynx into the trachea, past the inflated cuff. After tracheal intubation a small amount of methylene blue will be instilled into patients' pharynx every 60 minutes. The presence or absence of blue dye above and below the ETT cuff will be evaluated every 20 minutes using a video recording fiberoptic bronchoscope.</description>
