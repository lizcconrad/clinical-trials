  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This monocenter trial is conducted to obtain first data on safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) after multiple ascending doses of BYK324677
      in humans. In addition, the trial should provide preliminary information on a possible
      influence of sex, food intake, and posology (once or twice daily administration of BYK324677)
      to support the further planning of the drug development programme.

Dose group III: total daily dose 6 mg (3 mg BID or 6 mg SID)
In each dose group 12 subjects (8 subjects BYK324677, 4 subjects placebo) are planned.
Within each dose group, the subjects will be randomised to either BYK324677 or placebo at a ratio of 2:1.
Within each verum group, the subjects will be randomised to one of the 2 treatment sequences (BID/SID or SID/BID, ratio 1:1) and treated in a cross-over manner.</description>
