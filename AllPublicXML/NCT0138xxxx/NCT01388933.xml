  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease, a chronic condition resulting in inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract
      (GI), causes a person to experience persistent symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease,
      including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and constipation, with
      infrequent bowel movements that are at times accompanied by a sensation of incomplete
      emptying after having a bowel movement. Tsumura's TU-100 is a modern herbal product that has
      been approved as a prescription drug in Japan. Several lines of evidence indicate that TU-100
      attenuates intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease by increasing intestinal blood flow and
      stimulating a protective lining of intestinal mucus which produces an anti-inflammatory
      effect. TU-100 may attenuate pathological changes in the intestine and reduce symptoms in
      patients with Crohn's disease.
