  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the toxicity and also the efficacy of a
      treatment that includes the following treatment: Two medications, bortezomib and
      dexamethasone (or BD), followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, and a prolonged
      course of treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone after transplantation. This type of
      treatment has been very effective in multiple myeloma. However, there is little experience
      with this treatment in patients who have Monoclonal Immunoglobulin Deposition Disease (MIDD)
      or amyloidosis. The investigators and others have treated patients who have MIDD and
      amyloidosis with bortezomib and autologous stem cell transplantation and have had success
      with this treatment. But the combination of autologous transplant with BD given before and
      after the transplant is a new way of treating these diseases, which the investigators believe
      will be very effective.

    <description>The treatment has three phases:
1) Initial treatment phase: This phase consists of 1-3 21-day-cycles of a combination regimen that includes bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, IV or Subcutaneous Injection (SQ), on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and dexamethasone 40 mg PO or IV, on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Stem cell mobilization and HDM/ASCT. Post-ASCT consolidation/maintenance treatment phase: This phase consists of six cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, IV or (SQ) with dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 12 weeks +/- 2 weeks.</description>

          -  New diagnosis of MIDD or AL amyloidosis based on pathologic findings confirmed at
             Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

          -  Patients must show the ability to understand the investigational nature of the
             treatment and to give voluntary informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future
             medical care.

          -  Female subject is either postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening
             visit, is surgically sterilized or if they are of childbearing potential, agree to
             practice 2 effective methods of contraception from the time of signing the informed
             consent form through 30 days after the last dose of bortezomib, or agree to completely
             abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          -  Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy) must agree
             to 1 of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the entire
             study treatment period and through a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of study
             drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          -  Adequate organ function defined as follows: Absolute granulocytes &gt; 1,000/mm3 and
             platelets &gt; 70,000/mm3, unless low granulocyte and platelets counts are due to
             multiple myeloma; total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 ULN; AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3
             times upper limit of laboratory normal; LVEF &gt; 50% by MUGA or ECHO (the method used at
             baseline must be used for later monitoring); DLCO &gt; 50 % confirmed at MSKCC; elevated
             creatinine is not a contraindication to enrollment

          -  Performance status (ECOG) &lt; or = to 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment

          -  Prior initial treatment chemotherapy for MIDD, AL amyloidosis or multiple myeloma with
             the exception of one cycle of high dose dexamethasone

          -  Prior bortezomib treatment

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or New York Heart
             Association Class III or IV heart failure (see Appendix 20.2), uncontrolled angina,
             severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG
             abnormality at screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically
             relevant.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women are ineligible. A pregnancy test will be performed on each
             fertile premenopausal female 2 weeks prior to entry into the study. Treatment may not
             begin until the results of the pregnancy test are ascertained. All patients (men and
             women) must agree to use medically approved contraceptive measures for at least 4
             weeks before starting therapy, during therapy, and for at least 3 months after therapy
             has stopped.

             Patients with a history of a T1a or b prostate cancer (detected incidentally at TURP
             and comprising less than 5% of resected tissue) may participate if the PSA has
             remained within normal limits since TURP.

             possibility of increasing HIV viral load with therapy

          -  Any other medical condition or reason that, in the principal investigator's opinion,
             makes the patient unsuitable to participate in a clinical trial

             or mannitol.

          -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before randomization. Enrollment of subjects who
             require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size) should be
