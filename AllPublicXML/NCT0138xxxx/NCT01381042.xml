  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown active brown adipose tissue (BAT) is present in adults and may
      play important roles in regulating energy homeostasis. However, the majorities of these
      studies were done in patients undergoing scanning for cancer surveillance, and may not
      reflect BAT behavior in healthy individuals. In addition, little is known about the ethnic
      variation in BAT activity, particularly in Chinese adults. Due to the large amount in our
      cohort, we are able to look at the difference between subjects for cancer surveillance (CS)
      and subjects for medical check-up (MC), and to clarify the impact of clinical and lifestyle
      parameters.

      We will study scanning database including data from July 2006 to June 2010 in Shanghai. BAT
      activity will be measured via 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Age, imaging date, sex, and outdoor temperature will
      be collected for all patients. To evaluate the effects of multiple metabolic parameters on
      BAT activity, we will collect height, body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), medical
      history, diagnosis, smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, liver triglyceride content, and
      thyroid metabolic activity for all patients with detectable BAT and their negative controls,
      consisting of two patients who underwent PET/CT scans at the same day but without detectable
      BAT.
