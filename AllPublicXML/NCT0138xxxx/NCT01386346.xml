      The purpose of this study is to see whether giving azacitidine before each cycle of
      chemotherapy prior to surgery is safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently patients with resectable (can be removed by surgery) esophageal cancer will receive
      chemotherapy before surgery to try to shrink the tumor before it is removed. This study will
      evaluate whether giving azacitidine before each cycle of chemotherapy to increase the
      shrinkage of the tumor prior to surgery is safe.

      Azacitidine is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Azacitidine is not approved by the FDA for use in this study
      and is therefore considered investigational. Because azacitidine has not been given before in
      combination with epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine, we will also evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of azacitidine and find out what dose of azacitidine is safe to give with
      this chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma of the
             intrathoracic esophagus or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and deemed resectable by
             the thoracic surgeon.

          -  No prior chemotherapy for esophageal or GEJ cancer.

          -  ECOG Performance status 0-2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, kidney and liver function.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

             carcinoma morphology.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to azacitidine, epirubicin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine and mannitol.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure.
