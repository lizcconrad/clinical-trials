      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sirolimus and gold sodium
      thiomalate when given together in treating patients with advanced squamous non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Sirolimus and gold sodium thiomalate may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of ATM (gold sodium
      thiomalate) plus sirolimus. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the adverse event profile
      associated with this treatment combination. II. To preliminarily evaluate the response rate,
      time to progression, progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
      this treatment combination. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate tumor biomarkers of protein
      kinase C (PKCι) and mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling activity as predictors of
      response to ATM/sirolimus therapy. II. To evaluate the use of surrogate biomarkers of PKCι
      and mTOR inhibition in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to monitor response to
      ATM/sirolimus therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive sirolimus
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and gold sodium thiomalate intramuscularly (IM) on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3
      months.
