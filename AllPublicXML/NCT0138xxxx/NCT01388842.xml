  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if adding inhaled Nitric Oxide to other malaria
      treatments can improve the outcome of cerebral malaria in children aged 2months to 12 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite very effective antimalarial treatment, there is a residual and unacceptable high
      mortality rate of malaria, especially amongst young children. Recent progress has been made
      in understanding the role of Nitric Oxide (NO) in severe malaria, indicating that NO
      supplementation is likely to have a beneficial action in severe malaria possibly through
      down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines like TNF. Of the various ways to supplement NO, iNO
      appears to be the safest since it is very well studied in critically ill patients and does
      not cause systemic vasodilation. The safety of NO inhalation has been clearly demonstrated
      through its wide use in the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension in neonates and
      pulmonary hypertension in children and adults. Extensive data on its safety has been
      collected. This study is a phase 2 clinical trial that aims at demonstrating the efficacy of
      iNO when added to antimalarial treatment to treat cerebral malaria. This study will also
      provide a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in severe
      malaria.
