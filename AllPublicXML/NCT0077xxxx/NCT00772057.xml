      Background and Aims: The efficacy of portal pressure reduction by beta blockers for the
      management of small (≤5 mm) esophageal varices in patients of cirrhosis is not clear. The
      present randomized controlled trial aims to address these issues. The investigators also
      assessed the utility of serial HVPG measurements in these patients.

      Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients with cirrhosis with small varices, with no history
      of variceal bleed, were randomized to receive propranolol or placebo. These patients were
      further randomized to undergo no HVPG, only baseline HVPG, or serial HVPG measurement.
      Propranolol was titrated to reduce heart-rate to 55/min.

    <description>Beta-blocker (propranolol) was started at a dose of 20 mg twice daily. The principle of incremental dosing was used to achieve the target heart rate for propranolol. The dose was increased every alternate day to achieve a target heart rate of 55/min or to the maximal dose to 360 mg/day if the medication was well tolerated and the systolic blood pressure was &gt;90 mm Hg. On the occurrence of intolerable adverse effects, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg or pulse rate &lt;55/min, the dose of the medication was decreased step-wise, and eventually stopped if these adverse events persisted. Reintroduction of the medication was attempted if cessation of the medication did not result in improvement of the reported side-effect.</description>
