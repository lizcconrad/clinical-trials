    <textblock>
      Study X052070 will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of XOMA 052 administered to
      patients with active, stable, moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      It is hypothesized that administration of XOMA 052 is likely to improve inflammatory control
      in subjects with RA.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria for RA

          -  Moderate to severe disease, defined as follows - At least six tender and six swollen
             joints (28 joint count) AND ESR &gt; 28 mm/hr or CRP &gt; 1.0 mg/dL

          -  Current duration of RA at Screening ≥ 6 months and ≤ 20 years

          -  RA and other medical conditions must be stable.

          -  Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 at Screening

          -  Weight ≥ 80 lbs (36.3 kg) and ≤ 275 lbs (125.0 kg)

          -  For females with child-bearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to Day 0

          -  Joint replacement surgery within 60 days prior to Day 0 or joint replacement surgery
             planned within 9 months following Day 0

          -  Known HIV antibody, or hepatitis B surface antigen

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years prior to Screening other than carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix, or adequately treated, non-metastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin

          -  Immunodeficiency

          -  History or symptoms of a demyelinating disease

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to humanized or murine monoclonal
             antibodies. Respiratory distress (dyspnea, oxygen desaturation with pO2 &lt; 90% or onset
             of acute respiratory distress syndrome), flank or back pain, and/or hypotension may be
             signs of anaphylaxis.

          -  History of tuberculosis, positive PPD test, active atopic disease requiring
             medication, or asthma. A subject who has had a positive PPD test but has completed a
             course of treatment for tuberculosis, had a documented vaccination against
             tuberculosis, or had a negative QuantiFERON -TB test result is eligible.

          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or other pulmonary disease
             requiring more therapy than using one inhaler 4× daily

          -  Significant systemic involvement secondary to RA (e.g. vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis)

          -  Liver disease (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis) or abnormal hepatic function. If the
             diagnosis of liver disease was based on positive Hep C serology due to prior
             vaccination, the subject is eligible.

          -  Pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study, or
             breast-feeding
