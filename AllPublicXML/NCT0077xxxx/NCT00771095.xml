  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in both the existing and enhanced podcast groups will lose weight. The enhanced
      podcasting group will have a greater increase in weight loss, elaboration, self-efficacy, and
      perceived control than the existing podcast group.

      We will conduct a weight loss intervention study among adults. Using the weight loss podcast
      that receives the highest rating from a previous content analysis, we will conduct an
      intervention comparing the best existing weight loss podcast to an enhanced podcast. The
      enhanced podcast will be based on theoretical constructs that have been shown to be effective
      in producing weight loss in other research studies. We will then evaluate the effectiveness
      of podcasting to promote weight loss in adults. Weight change from baseline to 12-weeks and
      changes in psychosocial measures will be used to assess differences between the existing
      podcast, enhanced podcast, and control conditions. In conclusion, this research study aims to
      find innovative and inexpensive ways to help people lose weight. Podcasting has the
      possibility of reaching a wide range of age and ethnic groups and will allow people to
      receive weight loss information when and where it is convenient for them.
