  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leakage is a major and potentially mortal complication with an incidence of
      10-13% after resection of the rectum. For patients showing no clinical signs of peritonitis,
      the traditional method has been a conservative treatment with transrectal rinsing. This
      treatment is often associated with a very protracted postoperative course with healing times
      of up to a year or more for the anastomotic leakage.

      Treatment with vacuum drainage (VD) is a new method primarily developed for wound therapy.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of transrectal vacuum treatment on
      the healing of anastomotic leakage after rectum resection in a prospective, randomized,
      controlled multicentre trial in 60 patients found to develop clinically significant
      anastomotic leakages after elective rectal resection.

    <description>Treatment with vacuum drainage (VD) is a new method primarily developed for wound therapy. The principle of the method is application of negative pressure on the wound surface with the help of a sponge that is connected to a pump. Sponge dressings should be changed 3 times pr week as long as vacuum therapy is used. If there has been no development of granulation tissue or no shrinking of the cavity in 3 weeks Vacuum therapy can be stopped. Maximum vacuum therapy is 8 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically significant* anastomotic leakage after intended curative
             rectal resection (LAR) for rectal cancer with primary anastomosis.

          -  Patients whose operation did not include ileostomy must have surgery to create a stoma
             within two days after beginning of the vacuum therapy and before randomization.
             Anastomotic leakage must have been diagnosed within 21 days of the primary operation.

          -  Patients with and without preoperative radiation therapy may participate.

          -  Groups will be formed accordingly, because patients who had preoperative radiation
             therapy heal more slowly.

          -  Patients with anastomotic leakage (diagnosed by endoscopic or radiology techniques)
             and clinical signs and symptoms indicating a health impairment (fever, pain, elevated
             creatinine levels).

          -  Anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  Acute surgery

          -  Leakage diagnosed more than 21 days after the primary operation

          -  Patient does not consent to temporary ileostomy

          -  Anastomosis technically inaccessible for vacuum-assisted drainage

          -  Small intestine visible in abscess cavity

          -  Residual cancer tissue in the pelvic cavity

          -  Suspicion of fistulation between the abscess cavity and internal genitalia, urinary
             tract system, or small intestines.
