      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of Fosinopril sodium
      and hydrochlorothiazide 20-12.5 mg tablets of Ranbaxy laboratories Limited with that of
      Monopril 速 - HCT 20-12.5 mg tablets by Bristol Meyers Squibb following a single oral dose (1
      x 20/12.5 mg tablet) in healthy adult subjects under non-fasting conditions.

      This study was a single dose, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, crossover design study.
      It was used to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the Fosinopril sodium and
      hydrochlorothiazide tablet products when dose (1 x 20/ 12.5 mg) under non-fasting conditions.
      There was a washout of at least a week between the two study periods.

      A total of thirty six (36) healthy adult volunteers were recruited in the study of which only
      thirty three (33) subjects i.e. 18 males and 15 females completed the clinical portion of the
      study.
