  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single centre study is to evaluate whether the use of Harmonic Synergy
      Dissecting Hook (Harmonic Scalpel) in breast reconstruction surgery is superior to
      conventional diathermy in terms of improving ease and speed of perforator dissection,
      reducing postoperative pain, days of hospital stay and time taken to return to daily
      activities.

    <intervention_name>Harmonic Synergy Dissecting Hook (Harmonic Scalpel)</intervention_name>
    <description>Harmonic Synergy Dissecting Hook (Harmonic Scalpel) uses ultrasound waves to coagulate and cut in surgery. It is available on the market, holds a CE mark and is coded as a Class IIb medical device.</description>

    <intervention_name>Electrocautery Diathermy</intervention_name>
    <description>Electrosurgery uses high temperatures (150-400oC) and causes obliterative coagulation. Diathermy is the use of high frequency electric current to produce heat. In surgery it is used to cut or destroy tissue and/or to produce coagulation. The electrical frequency produced in diathermy is in the range of 300kHz to 3MHz.</description>
