      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-sequence,
      two-period, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study on carvedilol formulation comparing
      carvedilol 12.5mg of Ohm Laboratories, Inc. (a subsidiary of Ranbaxy pharmaceuticals Inc,
      USA) with Coreg® 12.5mg tablet (containing carvedilol 12.5 mg) of GlaxoSmithKline, USA in
      healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fasting condition.

      Forty healthy, adult, human subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria as
      described in the protocol were enrolled in the study. Thirty-six subjects completed both the
      periods of the study
