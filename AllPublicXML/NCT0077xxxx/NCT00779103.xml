      The purpose of this study is to follow and collect additional medical and developmental
      information on children after histrelin subcutaneous implant therapy is discontinued.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-two (32) patients will receive a histrelin subdermal implant under the anesthesia
      deemed appropriate by the administering physician. Ten-twelve (10-12) sites will enroll 2-3
      patients per site. It is anticipated that half the patients will be receiving GnRH analog
      treatment and the other half will be treatment na√Øve. All patients will undergo selective PK
      sampling post-implantation to assess histrelin profile. At 12 months, provided that the
      patient continues to meet the safety and efficacy parameters, the original implant will be
      removed and the patient can receive a new implant. At 13 months, patients who receive new
      implants will be evaluated at the study site and administratively transferred to the initial
      extension study. At Month 24), the implants inserted at Month 12 will be removed. At this
      time, patients who have completed the initial extension study and who wish to continue
      therapy with the histrelin implant will be eligible to receive a new (ie, third) implant and
      to enter an additional 12-month extended access phase at the discretion of the investigator.
      At Month 36, the implants inserted at Month 24 for the Extended Access Phase will be removed.
      At this time, patients who have completed the Extended Access Phase and who wish to continue
      therapy with the histrelin implant will be eligible to receive a new (ie, fourth) implant and
      to enter the Long Term Extended Access Phase (referred to as the Implant Treatment Phase) at
      the discretion of the investigator. The purpose of this phase is to provide patients with the
      opportunity to continue to receive a new implant at the end of each 12-month period until the
      patient no longer requires hormone suppression. Once implant therapy is discontinued, all
      patients are eligible to enter the Long Term Follow Up Phase (Post Implant Phase) of the
      study.
