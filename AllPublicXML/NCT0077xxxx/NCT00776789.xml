      Aims and Objectives

      Aim

      To determine the effect of delivery room Skin To Skin contact on breast feeding behavior of
      term neonates born by normal vaginal delivery at 36-48 hours.

      Objectives Primary objective To determine the effect of delivery room Skin To Skin contact on
      breast feeding behaviour of term neonates born by normal vaginal delivery, between 36-48
      hours (as measured by Infant Breast Feeding Score) by video recording using a randomized
      controlled design.

      Secondary objectives To determine the effect of delivery room Skin to Skin contact on

        1. Salivary cortisol at 6 hours as measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA)

        2. Weight at 48 hours as measured by digital infant weighing scale.

        3. Maternal perception of breast milk output, breast consistency, infant's feeding and
           activity at 36-48 hours as measured by a score graded as very satisfied, satisfied,
           acceptable and not satisfied.

        4. Number and duration of feeding sessions till 48 hrs according to the mother as assessed
           at 48 hours

        5. Breast feeding rates at 6 weeks measured at the time of vaccination at the time of visit
           to the hospital for the same or as asked by telephonic conversation.

      Hypothesis

      Infants receiving skin to skin contact when compared with neonates not receiving it,
      demonstrate better breast feeding behaviour.

    <measure>The Median Breast Feeding Score</measure>
    <time_frame>36-48 hours by video recording</time_frame>
    <description>This was a one point assessment done at 36-48 hours by video recording. The video recording was carried out in a separate well lighted room after taking informed consent from the mother. The mother had full right to see the video and only if she was satisfied, was then the video finally stored. These videos were analyzed later using the infant breast feeding assessment tool : a scoring measure [0 to 3] for i) readiness to feed ii) sucking iii) rooting and iv) latching. The total possible score could vary from 0 to 12, with 12 being the best possible total score. Successful breastfeeding was defined as a total score of more &gt;=8.</description>

    <measure>Salivary Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva samples were collected with a Salivette. The infant had to suck on the swab for atleast 5 minutes. The prerequisite for collection of the saliva included that the infant should not have fed atleast 2 hours prior to the collection of the salivary sample. The filtrates were then transferred to a separate tube and were stored at 2-8º C for 24 hours. They were later transported to the central laboratory where the samples were stored at -20ºC and later analyzed using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA).</description>

    <measure>Breast Feeding Status at 48 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The mother was given a form at the time of birth of the baby for recording the duration of each breast feeding session and documentation of any supplemental feeds taken from the neonatal intensive care unit. The number and the amount of supplemental feeds was confirmed with the nursing staff on duty when in the hospital and with the mother at 6 weeks when she reported for the first vaccination or by telephonic contact with her at 6 weeks. This was recorded by the principal investigator and crosschecked by the second investigator in all cases.</description>

        <title>The Median Breast Feeding Score</title>
        <description>This was a one point assessment done at 36-48 hours by video recording. The video recording was carried out in a separate well lighted room after taking informed consent from the mother. The mother had full right to see the video and only if she was satisfied, was then the video finally stored. These videos were analyzed later using the infant breast feeding assessment tool : a scoring measure [0 to 3] for i) readiness to feed ii) sucking iii) rooting and iv) latching. The total possible score could vary from 0 to 12, with 12 being the best possible total score. Successful breastfeeding was defined as a total score of more &gt;=8.</description>

        <description>Saliva samples were collected with a Salivette. The infant had to suck on the swab for atleast 5 minutes. The prerequisite for collection of the saliva included that the infant should not have fed atleast 2 hours prior to the collection of the salivary sample. The filtrates were then transferred to a separate tube and were stored at 2-8º C for 24 hours. They were later transported to the central laboratory where the samples were stored at -20ºC and later analyzed using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA).</description>

        <title>Breast Feeding Status at 48 Hours</title>
        <description>The mother was given a form at the time of birth of the baby for recording the duration of each breast feeding session and documentation of any supplemental feeds taken from the neonatal intensive care unit. The number and the amount of supplemental feeds was confirmed with the nursing staff on duty when in the hospital and with the mother at 6 weeks when she reported for the first vaccination or by telephonic contact with her at 6 weeks. This was recorded by the principal investigator and crosschecked by the second investigator in all cases.</description>

        <population>EBF rates were assessed using the standard WHO definitions. We asked the mothers about the method of feeding and the number and amount of supplemental feeds received in the first 2 days of life. Breastfeeding rates at 6 weeks were obtained by enquiring from the mothers at the time of the first vaccination of their infants in the follow-up clinic.</population>
