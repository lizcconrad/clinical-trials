    <textblock>
      Nodal staging is a key-step in pre-treatment assessment of prostate cancer. In patients with
      a low probability of nodal metastasis, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is controversial. The
      large majority of them (&gt; 80%) are free of nodal disease in obturator and external iliac
      stations. On the other hand, skip metastases located outside the standard lymphadenectomy may
      be missed, particularly in more proximal nodal stations (i.e. common iliac nodes and
      pre-sacral nodes).

      In prostate cancer, growing data indicate the potential utility of LM/SL, particularly in
      patients with a low pre-test probability of nodal disease. However, very few data have been
      reported on the feasibility and the utility of SPECT/CT following LM/SL. In a pilot study
      including 11 patients with prostate cancer, Kizu and colleagues used a software image fusion
      from separate SPECT and CT studies. These authors concluded to the utility of image fusion to
      localize anatomically the SLNs. They also suggested the use of hardware fusion from a single
      gantry SPECT/CT device for accurate detection of SLNs. Accordingly, Corvin and colleagues
      recently reported the suitability of sentinel node detection in a series of 28 patients with
      prostate cancer; in this study, an integrated single slice SPECT/CT device was used to
      localize the SLNs.

      In the light of the encouraging data from literature and our own preliminary clinical
      experience, we hypothesized that the use of integrated SPECT/low-dose multislice CT guided
      LM/SL may be of clinical interest in patients with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multidisciplinary team (urologist, oncologist, radiologist, pathologist, and nuclear
      medicine) will assess the technical feasibility of LM/SL with SPECT/CT as well as its
      clinical potential for the staging of regional lymph nodes in 30 consecutive patients with
      AJCC stages I-II-III prostate cancer scheduled for prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node
      dissection according to the standards of care.

      This is a 2-day protocol with a single isotopic tracer (Tc99m-cysteine rhenium colloids,
      10-15 nm). The tracer injections will be performed under trans-rectal ultra-sound guidance (1
      inj/lobe, 74MBq, 0.2 cc).

      The first day or injection day (D0), an early imaging session with planar acquisitions
      (anterior and posterior views) will be performed within 30 min post-tracer injection. A
      delayed imaging session with planar and SPECT/CT acquisitions will be also performed 1 to 3
      hours after tracer injection. The SPECT/CT device to be used in this research protocol is the
      Infinia Hawkeye 4-slice from GE Healthcare. This hybrid camera incorporates a low-dose CT
      with a 2.5 mA current (eff.dose &lt; 2mSv) on a dual-head gamma camera. SPECT/CT data will be
      analysed on the Xeleris 2.05v (Volumetrix for Hawkeye Oncology).

      The second day (D+1 post-tracer injection), all prostate cancer patients will undergo a
      radical prostatectomy with complete pelvic lymph node dissection (CLND). Sentinel lymph nodes
      (SLNs) will be detected intra-operatively by using a gamma probe (Navigator, Tyco
      Healthcare). In this single tracer study, SLNs are defined as hot nodes only including the
      hottest node and any hot node ≥ 10% of the hottest node. In this SPECT/CT protocol,
      additional non-radioactive nodes eventually detected on the CT component and suspicious of
      tumor involvement (lymphadenopathies &gt; 1cm) will be also removed, especially lymph nodes
      located in unpredictable lymphatic basins. Surgery will be performed by the same surgeons.

      SLNs and non-SLNs will be analyzed by the same pathologist. For SLNs, a Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin
      staining (H-E) will be firstly performed. If negative, 3 more H-E stains levels will be
      performed and immuno-peroxidase stains for Cytokeratins AE1/AE3, PSA, and PAP. Non-SLNs will
      be analyzed according to the routine protocol with 3 H-E stained levels only. The SLN
      features will be noted: number, anatomical localization in vivo, counting rates ex vivo. The
      pathological characteristics of metastatic SLNs and non-SLNs will be precisely recorded:
      size, involvement (micro-metastases ≤ 2mm; macro-metastases; isolated tumor cells), % of
      nodes involved (small &lt; 25%; moderate = 25-75%; massive &gt; 75%).
