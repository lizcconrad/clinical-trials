      The investigators intend to test in a single center, clinical pilot efficacy study the
      primary hypothesis that Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) as add-on therapy to a controlled
      pharmacotherapy is efficacious in the treatment of refractory major depression assessed with
      the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD).
