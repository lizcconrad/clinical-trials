  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry will collect data from patients routinely undergoing an ERCP and Cellvizio
      endomicroscopy procedure (and optionally an additional cholangiopancreatoscopy procedure) due
      to suspected pancreatic or bile duct cancer. The objective is to determine if endomicroscopy
      images collected using the marketed Cellvizio device may help endoscopists more accurately
      diagnose, in conjunction with traditional tissue sampling techniques, whether a suspected
      lesion is malignant or benign.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a registry study to collect high quality longitudinal data from patients with
      suspected or indeterminate pancreaticobiliary pathology who are undergoing an ERCP with
      Cellvizio probe-based endomicroscopy procedure, with or without supplemental direct
      cholangiopancreatoscopy. The hypothesis is that ERCP with Cellvizio probe-based
      endomicroscopy improves differentiation of biliary and pancreatic duct lesions versus ERCP
      alone.

      Direct measures of accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, etc.) in the differentiation of
      malignant versus benign biliary and/or pancreatic duct lesions will be compared for the
      combination of endomicroscopy and ERCP imaging and ERCP alone. These presumptive diagnoses
      will be compared against a 12-month follow-up confirmed histopathologic endpoint (an
      initially-benign pathologic diagnosis will be confirmed by a 12-month follow-up). Secondary
      objectives include collecting various safety and technical performance parameters.
