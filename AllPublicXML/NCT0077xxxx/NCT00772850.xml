      Background:

      With improved implant design and surgical technique, operative treatment of humeral shaft
      fractures increasingly has become accepted. Such treatment offers several advantages. The
      rigidly fixed, fractured limb can be used early without external support, and the patient can
      sleep, as normal, in the supine position. In addition, the angular deformity often seen with
      conservative treatment effectively is prevented. Although plate osteosynthesis can afford a
      rigid fixation and good functional recovery, its disadvantages have been reported. By
      comparison, locked nailing, which provides sufficient fixation stability and prevents slipout
      of the nail, offers the advantages of less soft tissue injury, a lower infection rate, and no
      need for radial nerve extrication. Locked nailing is preferred especially for open fractures,
      comminuted fractures, pathologic fractures, and fractures associated with osteoporosis. The
      use of Seidel locked nails with spreading fins can be complicated by inadequate fixation,
      intraoperative bone comminution, and unsatisfactory recovery of shoulder function.
      Biomechanically, locked nails with transfixing locking screws allow much better rotational
      control of the distal fragment than do Seidel nails. Most rigid humeral nails are inserted
      antegrade, but a disadvantage to antegrade nailing has been the risk of shoulder function
      impairment, which partially negates the advantages of closed nailing and of loadsharing
      mechanical properties. The disadvantages of retrograde nailing are potential risk of elbow
      joint injury and nonlinear entry portal of nailing.

      Gaullier O et al did a study of 23 cases with rotator cuff evaluation in 1999. Only humeral
      diaphyseal fractures were enrolled. Fracture type classification was according to AO.
      Clinical shoulder assessment was carried out using the Constant score. Treatment was Seidel
      intramedullary locked nailing.

      Seidel intramedullary locked nailing was too big for patients in Taiwan. Compared to patients
      in western countries, our patients had small stature. The humeral locked nail, invented by
      Jinn Lin, provided a proper treatment option for humeral fractures in Asian people.

      Although H-L nail has the advantages of minimal tissue trauma, it still has the possibility
      of rotator cuff injury. The purpose of our study is to evaluate rotator cuff injury in
      antegrade humeral locked nailing for humeral fractures by means of sonographic evaluation and
      shoulder functional examination.

      Materials and methods:

      I. Implant design:

      The Humeral Locked nail is a uniform closed cylindrical tube with a 5° bend at 70 mm from the
      threaded end. It is manufactured from 316L stainless steel (Carpenter Technology Corporation,
      Indianapolis, IN) in 4 sizes: 7 (diameter) x 190 (length) mm, 7 x 210 mm, 8 x 210 mm, and 8 x
      230 mm. The thickness of the nail wall is 1.5 mm for 8 mm nails and 1 mm for 7 mm nails.
      There are 3 parallel screw holes (the 2 outermost holes usually are used) at the threaded
      end, 45° oblique to the axis of the nail, and 2 transverse screw holes at the other end.
      Cortical screws are used as locking screws that are inserted under the guide of an L shaped,
      nail mounted targeting device.

      II. Patient selection:

      The inclusion criteria for patients in the present study were listed as follows: (1) subjects
      must sign and date informed consent; (2) subjects must be over fifteen years old, of either
      sex; (3) subjects suffered from acute humeral fractures or non-unions; (4) subjects were
      treated by antegrade H-L nailing (United, Taipei, Taiwan); 5) subjects had solid union of
      fractures; 6) postoperative time was at least 12 months; 7) subjects were operated between
      2003 and 2006. The exclusion criteria for patients in the present study were listed as
      follows: (1) subjects refusing to take the examinations, (2) subjects lost to follow up, (3)
      subjected with pre-existing shoulder problems.

      III. Study design:

      Our study design is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with acute humeral
      fractures or nonunions treated by antegrade H-L nailing were recruited and studied.
      Sonographic evaluation of rotator cuff was done by an experienced orthopedist and shoulder
      functional scores such as Neer score, Constant score and QuickDASH score was assessed at the
      same time.

      Real-time sonography was performed with a Sonoline Sienna scanner (HDI-5000, Philips, USA)
      equipped with a 5.5-9.4-MHz linear-array transducer. The patient was seated on a stool with
      the examiner sitting in front of him. Lateral transverse view and lateral longitudinal view
      were acquired. For these two views, the arm of the examined patient was placed in adduction
      and internal rotation, which gave a better exposure of the supraspinatus tendon under the
      acromion. Criteria for full-thickness rotator cuff tears were nonvisualization of the rotator
      cuff and hypoechoic or anechoic discontinuity. Besides, criteria for partial- thickness
      rotator cuff tears included focal heterogenous hypoechogenecity and incomplete hypoechoic
      cleft. Measurement of rotator cuff tears was done on lateral transverse and longitudinal
      views. The width of rotator cuff tears was measured on lateral transverse view, while the
      height of rotator cuff tears was measured on lateral transverse view. Moreover, the length of
      rotator cuff tears was measured on lateral longitudinal view. The thickness of rotator cuff
      at the dome of humeral head was measured on lateral transverse and compared between the
      operative and sound sides. We calculate the ratio of the thickness of supraspinatus on the
      operative side to that on the sound side.

      a. Thickness rotator cuff tear:

      Size (full or partial):

      i. width (mm) ii. height (mm) iii. length (mm)

      b. visualization of nail

      c. scar: nature and size

      d. supraspinatus thickness(mm) :

      IV. Baseline variables and primary endpoints:

      We included patient's age and gender, fracture location, fracture cause, presence of nail
      removal, post-operative period and comorbidity or associated disease as independent
      variables. Fracture location was either humeral neck or humeral shaft. Humeral neck fractures
      were defined as fractures above surgical neck of the humerus. Humeral neck fractures were
      further categorized into three groups: two-part, three-parts or four-parts, according to Neer
      classification. Meanwhile, humeral shaft fractures were defined as fractures below surgical
      neck of the humerus and 5 cm above the olecarnon fossa. Humeral shaft fractures were
      separated into three groups: proximal third shaft fractures, middle third shaft fractures and
      distal third shaft fractures. Fracture causes included simple falls and traffic accidents. We
      calculate post-operative period according to the latest operation involving rotator cuff
      injury, which included antegrade H-L nailing and nail removal. For example, if patient X was
      treated by antegrade H-L nailing two years ago and received nail removal one year ago, his
      (or her) post-operative period was twelve months rather than twenty-four months.

      The primary endpoints of the present study were functional scores and sonographic findings.
      As to functional scores, we chose Neer score, Constant score and QuickDASH score as our
      endpoints. Neer score consists of pain component, function component, range of motion
      component and anatomy component. The interpretation of Neer score are listed as follows:
      excellent when Neer score is above 89 units, satisfactory when Neer score is between 80 to 89
      units, unsatisfactory when Neer score is between 70 to 79 units, failure when Neer score is
      below 70 units. Constant score consist of pain, activity level, arm positioning, strength of
      abduction and range of motion. We examined Constant score of affected and healthy shoulder
      and calculated the difference of Constant scores between two shoulders. The interpretation is
      according to the difference of Constant scores: excellent (0~5 points), very good (6~10
      points), good (11~20 points), fair (21~30 points) and poor (above 30 points). The QuickDASH
      outcome measure is a questionnaire which asks about a patient's symptoms as well as his (or
      her) ability to perform certain activities. Patients should answer this questionnaire based
      on their conditions in the last week.

      V. Statistics:

      We include age, gender, fracture location, fracture cause, the presence of nail removal,
      post-operative period and comorbidity as independent variables. We use Neer score, Constant
      score, QuickDASH score, the presence of full-thickness rotator cuff tear, partial-thickness
      rotator cuff tear and scar , supraspinatus thickness ratio as dependent variables. Univariate
      analyses were conducted with Student's t tests for continuous variables and Chi square tests
      for binary variables. We also do multivariate regression analyses to adjust the confounding
      factors. The difference is considered statistically significant when p value is under 0.05.

      VI. Sample size calculations (power analysis):

      Neer score:

      The primary endpoint is used for calculation of sample size. We assume that the standard
      deviation of Neer score in our patients is 12 points. How many patients are required to have
      a 80% power of detecting a 10-point difference in the mean of functional score between the
      two groups at the 5% level of significance? The required sample size is 48 patients (24
      patients for each group).
