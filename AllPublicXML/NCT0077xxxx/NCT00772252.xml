      Background: In patients undergoing hemodialysis or hemofiltration will suffer from the injury
      of reactive oxidative species. Oxidative stress will affect cell membrane, protein, and DNA.
      It will damage the cell and result in organ dysfunction. We believe that in patients, who
      have acute hepatic failure, undergoing plasma exchange or Molecular Absorbent Recirculating
      System for bridge therapy will suffer from the injury of reactive oxidative species, too. It
      will damage the kidney, lung, cerebral cortex, and other organs. It may result in death
      before the recovery of liver function or undergoing liver transplantation.

      Aims: 1. Investigate the severity of oxidative stress and risk factors of high oxidative
      stress in acute hepatic failure patient undergoing plasma exchange or Molecular Absorbent
      Recirculating System. 2. Investigate the microcirculation status and risk factors in acute
      hepatic failure patient undergoing plasma exchange or Molecular Absorbent Recirculating
      System. 3. Study the relationship between oxidative stress and microcirculation status. 4.
      Study the correlation between oxidative stress and prognosis. 5. Study the correlation
      between microcirculation status and prognosis.
