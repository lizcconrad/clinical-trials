  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will investigate Quality of Life response in anemic participants with solid
      and lymphoid malignancies, who are receiving concomitant chemotherapy. Participants with
      solid and lymphoid malignancies will receive epoetin beta at a dose of 150 international
      units per kilogram (IU/kg) three times weekly. Participants with lymphoid malignancies will
      receive epoetin beta 30000 IU once weekly.

    <description>The SF-36 evaluates 36 questions related to participant-rated quality of life using 7 domains: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, overall health, vitality, and mental health. The total score is the average of the individual question scores, which is scaled from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning. The mean score at each timepoint was determined by averaging the scores among all participants.</description>
