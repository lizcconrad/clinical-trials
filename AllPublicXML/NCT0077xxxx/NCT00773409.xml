  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this long term study is to prospectively evaluate the incidence of NSF in
      patients with severe CKD or kidney failure including patients undergoing dialysis (stages 4
      and 5 i.e., with an eGFR below 30)who have not had exposure to a GBCA within 10 years prior
      to enrollment.

        A total of 400 patients will be enrolled into this study based on their renal function
        (eGFR) and the fact that they have been GBCA free for the past 10 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has CKD with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m2 and/or undergoing dialysis as calculated
             from a serum creatinine (SCr) value obtained from the local laboratory within 24 hours
             prior to signing the informed consent;

          -  Provides written informed consent and is willing to comply with protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received a GBCA within the past 10 years prior to inclusion in this study
             including the administration of a GBCA for something other than an MRI (e.g., CT or
             DSA);

          -  Has any medical condition or other circumstances which would significantly decrease
             the chances of obtaining reliable data and achieving study objectives;

          -  Has ever been suspected of, or diagnosed with, NSF;

          -  Is unable or unwilling to return for necessary office visits, to be examined by
             dermatologists or to undergo deep skin biopsy and laboratory/other diagnostic
             evaluations should development of NSF be suspected.
