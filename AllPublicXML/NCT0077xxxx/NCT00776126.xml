  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mammography remains the current standard in the detection of breast cancer. However,
      conventional two-view mammography will not detect all cancers. The major limiting factor of
      conventional mammography is the presence of superimposed breast tissue that can obscure
      clinically significant lesions. It is this limitation that decreases the sensitivity of
      mammography and leads to false negative results.

      The recent development of digital detectors has allowed imaging technologies such as
      tomosynthesis to become clinically feasible. The examination, similar to conventional
      mammography with regard to patient positioning and glandular dose, allows acquisition of a
      digital data set that can be reconstructed and viewed in multiple sections. The ability of
      tomosynthesis to unmask overlapping structures has been shown in preliminary studies to
      increase lesion visibility. Used as either a primary imaging modality, or as an adjunct to
      screening mammography, tomosynthesis has the potential to provide increased sensitivity and a
      lower number of false negative examinations.

      The purpose of this study is to compare radiologist impression of digital breast
      tomosynthesis to digital mammography with respect to their ability to see and characterize
      specific lesion features.

        Adult women who have undergone previous screening with CR digital mammography and were
        scheduled for diagnostic workup with full-field digital mammography (FFDM).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a woman â‰¥18 years of age or older who has no history of symptoms and/or
             physical signs of breast cancer in either breast (or, if she has had a mastectomy, in
             the remaining breast);

          -  The asymptomatic subject previously (within 3 months) underwent routine screening DM,
             which showed one or more abnormalities, and was referred for diagnostic mammography
             within the 30 days before study entry. The images from the screening examination must
             be available. If the prior screening examination was not conducted at the recruiting
             site, review of those images by the investigator must confirm that the recommendation
             for diagnostic mammography is warranted;

          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with study procedures, and has signed and
             dated the informed consent form;

          -  The subject is either surgically sterile (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy
             and/or documented hysterectomy), or postmenopausal (cessation of menses for more than
             one year); or, if of childbearing potential, the possibility of pregnancy is remote
             based on a negative patient history or a negative urine pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is pregnant or trying to become pregnant;

          -  The subject has been previously included in this study;

          -  The subject has a history of any symptoms and/or physical signs of breast cancer in
             either breast (or if she has had a mastectomy, no signs or symptoms of breast cancer
             in the remaining breast);

          -  The subject has breasts too large to be adequately positioned on 19 x 23 centimeter
             (cm) FFDM digital receptor without anatomical cut off during a DBT examination;

          -  The subject has participated in any of the on-going GE studies (GE 190-001, GE 190-002
             or GE 190-003), or is participating in, or has participated in (within the prior 30
             days), another trial of an investigational product;

          -  Has breast implant(s).

          -  Has reconstructed breast(s).
