             at screening or documented positive ANA (the titer should be at least 1:80) in the
             past.

          -  SLE duration of at least six months, as diagnosed by a physician;

          -  Stable disease, defined as no change in SLE therapy within the previous 30 days; and,
             in the opinion of the investigator, no anticipated need for a change in SLE therapy
             will be required while the subject is enrolled in the study;

          -  Normal or clinically acceptable ECG (12-lead reporting ventricular rate and PR, QRS,
             QT, QTc) at screening and Day -1 based on the opinion of the investigator;

          -  Body mass index from 18 to 40 kg/m2 at screening;

          -  Able and willing to complete entire study according to study schedule.

          -  Immunizations up to date, with a minimum of tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (td/Tdap),
             pneumococcal (polysaccharide) and influenza (during flu season) vaccinations, as
             determined by the Principal Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive serology for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C
             antibodies (confirmed by PCR or RIBA);

          -  Have had signs or symptoms of a viral, bacterial or fungal infection within 30 days of
             study randomization;

          -  Evidence of active or latent tuberculosis as assessed by PPD or Quantiferon testing at
             screening;

          -  Have donated blood or experienced a loss of blood &gt;500mL within 4 weeks of
             randomization;

          -  History of ethanol or drug abuse within the last one year prior to randomization;

          -  Evidence of significant renal insufficiency, defined by:

        The glomerular fitration rate &lt; 50 mL/min using the Cockroft and Gault equation;

          -  Evidence of liver disease (eg, serum ALT or AST &gt; 2x upper limit of normal);

          -  Total WBC &lt;3000 x 106/L;

          -  Neutrophil count &lt; 1500 x106/L

             (other than a diagnosis of SLE) that would, by it progressive nature and/or severity,
             interfere with the study evaluation, completion and/or procedures in the medical
             judgment of the investigator. This includes any age related co-morbidites such as

             administration of AMG 557;

          -  Presence of AMG 557 anti-bodies;

          -  Prior administration of rituximab &gt; 9 months with CD19+ B cells &lt;5/ÂµL;

          -  Participated in any another investigational drug or device trial within the previous
             30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever time period is longer, prior to randomization;
