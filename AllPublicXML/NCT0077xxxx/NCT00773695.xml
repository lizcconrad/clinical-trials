  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy or
      endocrine therapy, as preoperative treatment, in participants with HER2 negative breast
      cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive either chemotherapy (FEC100: Epirubicine
      100 milligrams per square meter [mg/m^2], 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m^2, and cyclophosphamide 600
      mg/m^2] for 12 weeks followed by taxane (paclitaxel/docetaxel) for 12 weeks or endocrine
      therapy (an aromatase inhibitor] daily for 24 weeks) with or without bevacizumab (15
      milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg] as intravenous [IV] infusion every 3 weeks up 24 weeks).
