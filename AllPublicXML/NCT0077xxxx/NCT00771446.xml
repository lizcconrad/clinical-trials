      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, concurrent control study of subjects with
      acute on chronic hepatitis. Subjects meeting the eligibility requirements of the study will
      be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either standard medical therapy for acute
      liver failure plus the ELAD system, or standard medical therapy alone, with the latter
      defined as conventional therapy for acute on chronic hepatitis determined to be clinically
      appropriate by the treating physician.

      Immediately prior to treatment initiation, subject eligibility will be confirmed. Treatment
      with ELAD will continue for a minimum of 3 days and up to a maximum of 10 days or until
      clinical status improves relative to study entry. Subjects will be followed until 30 days has
      elapsed since study enrollment (control) or 30 days has elapsed since cessation of ELAD
      therapy (ELAD group), whichever comes first.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Weight &gt;40 kilograms

          2. Age &gt;18 and &lt;70 years

          3. Acute decompensation of cirrhosis over the preceding 48-72 hour period

          4. Up to 4 weeks from symptom onset to presentation

          5. Presence of a precipitating event

          6. Either a MELD score of ≥32, or ≥24 with one or more of the following

               -  Severe encephalopathy of grade 3 or 4 on the Westhaven scale

               -  Renal dysfunction typical of type-1 hepato-renal syndrome, i.e. acute renal
                  failure without evidence of elevated serum creatinine (&gt;2.5mg/dL) during the 1 to
                  6 months prior to study entry. Serum creatinine at study entry &gt;2.5mg/dL does not
                  exclude the subject from enrolment

          7. SOFA score ≥9 at the initial Screening Visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Platelets &lt;50,000 or reducing to &lt;80,000 over a 72 hour period

          2. Renal failure: Serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL as measured during the 1 - 6 month period
             prior to study entry. If a subject has a contraindication to renal replacement therapy
             (hemodialysis or hemofiltration), then the subject should be excluded from entry into
             the study

          3. Active sepsis. Sepsis will be defined as positive microbiological culture, ascitic
             white cell count &gt;450 cells/mm³ (or ascitic neutrophil count &gt;250 cells/mm³), or

             gastrointestinal hemorrhage who have been successfully treated and remain
             hemodynamically stable for a period of 48 hours will then be eligible for the study

          5. Evidence (by physical exam, history, or laboratory evaluation) of significant

             thrombosis

          7. Evidence of Small Bowel Perforation within 48 hours of treatment;

          8. Evidence of brain death as determined by blood flow studies positive for herniation
             and/or absence of pupillary reflex

          9. Mean Arterial Pressures (MAP) &lt; 50 mm Hg for one hour or longer;

         10. Requirement for escalating doses of vasopressor support of an alpha-adrenergic agent
             for one hour or longer and evidence of hemodynamic instability;

         11. Clinical or radiographic evidence of a new stroke or intracerebral bleeding

         12. Seizures uncontrolled by medication

         13. Acute myocardial infarction based on clinical and/or electrocardiographic evidence

         14. Lung disease defined by a PaO2 &lt;60 mm Hg or a history of severe COPD or interstitial
             lung disease

         15. Pregnancy as determined by βHCG results, or lactation

         16. Participation in another investigational drug, biologic, or device study within one
