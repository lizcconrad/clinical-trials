  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of surfactant protein D under native and altered conditions will be investigated
      in immune cells that are derived from bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with allergic asthma
      following segmental allergen challenge. The goal of this study is to elucidate the pro-
      versus anti-inflammatory function of SP-D molecules and to identify motifs of SP-D that have
      treatment potential in allergic asthma.

      Following a baseline BAL, allergen (3×) and saline (1×) will be instilled into four different
      lung segments during a first bronchoscopy. After 24 hours during a second bronchoscopy BAL
      will be collected in these challenged segments to harvest invaded cells for in-vitro
      experimentation. In addition, bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushes will be taken to
      assess the degree of local inflammation in bronchial mucosa and to study the activation of
      airway epithelium following allergen challenge.

          -  Women will be considered for inclusion if they are:

          -  not pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test, and not nursing

          -  of non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is pre-menarchial or post-menopausal, with documented proof

             female should be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse from two
             weeks prior to the study until at least 72 hours after the end of the study -,
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs, or double-barrier
             methods, i.e. any double combination of IUD, condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm,
             sponge, and cervical cap)

          -  Available to complete all study measurements

        Exclusion Criteria:

             disease, psychiatric disease, endocrine disease, infectious disease, inflammatory
             disease, or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to chronic bronchitis,

          -  Any history of life-threatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required
             intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures.

          -  Suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of the medication in line with
             bronchoscopy (bronchodilators, sedatives and local anesthetics)

          -  Conditions or factors, which would make the subject unlikely to be able to undergo
             bronchoscopy or incremental allergen challenge

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and
             study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.
