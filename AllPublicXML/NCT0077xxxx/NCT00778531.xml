  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-approval study is to evaluate the continuing safety of ArteFill as
      an injectable implant for correction of nasolabial folds over the course of five years post
      implantation, with a focus on determining the incidence of granuloma formation. Incidence of
      adverse events and subject satisfaction with respect to the subject's personal expectations
      will be assessed.

      This study is a multi-center, non-randomized, non-controlled post-approval study designed to
      follow a total of 1000 consecutive qualified and consenting subjects treated with ArteFill in
      the course of clinical practice at approximately twenty-five centers. All potential
      qualifying subjects at a given site should be given the opportunity to participate in the
      study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be limited to those in the approved labeling for
      ArteFill and treatment will be according to the approved product labeling. Subjects must have
      a previously documented negative skin test prior to treatment.
