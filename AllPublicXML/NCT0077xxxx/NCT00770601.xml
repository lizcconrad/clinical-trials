    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether a medicine called canakinumab is safe and effective for
      treating patients with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), also known as
      chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome. This disease can cause
      rash, joint deformities, brain inflammation, problems with the eyes and learning
      difficulties. Canakinumab is an experimental drug that inhibits the action of a protein
      produced by the body called interleukin 1, which is responsible for the symptoms in NOMID and
      also contributes to many other kinds of inflammatory diseases.

      Patients 2 years of age and older with NOMID may be eligible for this study. Participants
      undergo the following procedures:

      Screening Phase

        -  Medical history and review of medical records

        -  Blood tests

        -  Daily diary of symptoms and medicines take

      Washout/Lead-in Phase

        -  Discontinuation of anakinra or other medications

      Treatment Phase

        -  Injection of canakinumab under the skin every 8 weeks for 6 months

        -  Monitoring and evaluations during treatment, including:

        -  Quality-of-life questionnaires and daily diary

        -  Vital signs measurements (heartbeat, blood pressure, temperature)

        -  Blood tests

        -  Electrocardiogram

        -  Tuberculosis skin test

        -  Neurological, eye and skin examinations at beginning and end of study

        -  Cognitive evaluation at beginning and end of study

        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) at the beginning of the study, 2 weeks after the second
           dosing of canakinumab and at the end of the study

        -  X-rays and bone density scan at beginning and end of study

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head at beginning and end of study

      Follow-up Phase

        -  Monthly clinic visits after the last dose of canakinumab for a minimum of 60 days

      End-of-Study Evaluation

        -  Series of tests 8 weeks after last dose of canakinumab to evaluate treatment response
           and side effects

      This open-label study was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of canakinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-1beta
      (anti-IL-1beta) monoclonal antibody, in patients with NOMID / CINCA syndrome. A total of 25
      to 30 patients will be enrolled into the study. The study consists of two stages:

      In the first pilot stage it is planned to enroll 5 patients undergoing PK/PD assessments in
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and monitoring of efficacy (CNS relapse and inflammatory
      relapse) to confirm the dose and dosing regimen before enlarging the number of patients
      enrolled into the study. Up to 5 additional patients may be enrolled in this stage if the
      variability of the responses to treatment is high. Interim analyses will be conducted as
      required. Following Stage 1, a second confirmatory stage will be conducted, enrolling 20
      additional patients. In this stage patients will be treated with the dose and dosing regimen
      based on the assessment of the efficacy profile in Stage 1 and exploratory PK/PD assessment.
      In each stage there will be a 3-week screening period to collect pre-treatment parameters, a
      run-in period (only for patients who discontinue anakinra), a baseline evaluation prior to
      each drug administration, a 24-week treatment period with fixed dosing of canakinumab, and a
      study completion visit. Patients whose body weight is greater than 40 kg will receive
      canakinumab 150 mg as a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, and patients with a body weight less
      than or equal to 40 kg will receive canakinumab 2 mg/kg s.c. Patients will be administered
      canakinumab every 8 weeks and will undergo an observation period after each dose
      administration in order to evaluate the response to treatment. Patients who do not achieve
      complete remission following canakinumab injection in any treatment period will be re-dosed
      within Day 15 or receive the following dose adjustments:

        -  300 mg s.c. (or 4 mg/kg for patients with a body weight less than or equal to 40 kg)

        -  450 mg s.c. (or 6 mg/kg for patients with a body weight less than or equal to 40 kg)

        -  600 mg s.c. (or 8 mg/kg for patients with a body weight less than or equal to 40 kg)

      End of Study will occur when patients discontinue from the study or complete this study. The
      End of Study visit should occur 8 weeks (plus or minus 1 week) after the last injection. All
      patients who complete the 6-month evaluation may be offered to enter an extension study
      (CACZ885D2201E1) conducted to assess long term safety and efficacy data.

             to the protocol whenever possible.

          3. Females of childbearing potential (young women who have had at least one menstrual
             period regardless of age) and/or aged greater than or equal to 8 years must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at each

          4. Women of childbearing age and men able to father a child, who are sexually active,
             must agree to use a form of effective method of contraception (e.g. birth control
             pills, abstinence, double-barrier contraception, etc.) during the study (from the date
             of screening) and for at least 3 months following the last dose. Periodic abstinence
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception.

          5. Presence, or history (prior to anakinra treatment), of at least 2 of the following

             (DMARDs) can be enrolled if they are on a stable dose (oral steroids: less than 20
             mg/day or less than or equal to 0.4 mg/kg prednisone or prednisone equivalent,
             whichever applies) for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. Steroid therapy
             may be tapered during treatment with canakinumab after the first canakinumab treatment
             period / cycle, at the discretion of the investigator.
