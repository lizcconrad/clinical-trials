      This work aims to measure the effectiveness of face mask worn by a patient with flu to avoid
      transmission to other persons in the household.

      Background. Non pharmaceutical interventions, and in particular the wearing of face masks,
      could play a role in controlling the transmission of influenza in the early stages of the
      epidemic. In the French pandemic plan, surgical masks are recommended in contagious patients
      in wards. The effectiveness of such masks in preventing transmission of influenza A virus is
      unknown. Our project aims to assess the preventive efficacy and tolerance of surgical mask.

      The primary objective is to measure the decrease of the number of secondary cases of flu in
      households where the index case will wear a surgical mask during its period of infectiousness
      (5 days), compared to households where the index case will not be subject to this
      intervention. Secondary objectives are: (1) to study the feasibility and tolerance of wearing
      a mask continuously during the period of viral shedding; (2) virological description of
      infection spreading among household contacts based on virological collections.
