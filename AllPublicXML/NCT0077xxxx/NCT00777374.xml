  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis or hay fever is a common atopic condition that is frequently
      seen in clinical practice. Grass pollen is the major cause of pollinosis in many parts of the
      world. Immunotherapy is the only treatment that may affect the natural course of allergic
      diseases, and it may also prevent the development of asthma in patients with allergic
      rhinitis. With conventional subcutaneous desensitization the duration of treatment is around
      3-5 years and usually comprises around 30-100 allergen injections. As high allergen doses
      have to be injected, allergic side effects may occur and patients must stay under medical
      supervision for at least 1 hour. Transcutaneous immunization (TCI) is a needle -free
      technique that delivers antigens and adjuvants to potent epicutaneous immune cells. The aim
      of the new epicutaneous route of desensitization is to more specifically target the immune
      system by loading Langerhans cells with the allergen. Lower antigen doses can be applied,
      such that side effects are reduced.
