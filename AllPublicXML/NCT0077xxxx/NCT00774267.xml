  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate quantitative changes in mammographic breast density
      from baseline to 24 months in postmenopausal women receiving daily doses of either BZA 20
      mg/CE 0.45 mg, BZA 20 mg/CE 0.625 mg, Raloxifene or placebo. The primary endpoint in this
      study is the change in mammographic breast density between baseline and month 24 for each
      group.
