  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether armodafinil treatment is more
      effective than placebo as adjunctive therapy to antipsychotic medication in alleviating the
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed and was powered to evaluate the efficacy and safety of armodafinil
      treatment at dosages of 150, 200, and 250 mg/day compared with placebo over 24 weeks as an
      adjunctive therapy to antipsychotic medication (olanzapine, oral risperidone, or
      paliperidone) in adults with schizophrenia who were clinically stable at study entry.
      Specifically, the effects of armodafinil treatment on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia
      were the primary assessment in this study.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) assesses the level of depression in patients with schizophrenia. Nine items (depression, hopelessness, self-depreciation, pathological guilt, guilty ideas of reference, morning depression, early awakening, suicidal, observed depression) are each scored on a 4-point scale: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The total score is a sum of the scores of each item and may range from 0 to 27. Higher score more severe pathology. Data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 12, positive values represent worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Negative Scale Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) From Baseline to Endpoint</title>
        <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in schizophrenics. 7 items measure NEGATIVE symptoms: blunted affect, social withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking. Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Negative Scale score ranges from 7-49 (higher more severe). Data represents change in Negative Rating Scale from baseline to endpoint with positive scores indicating more severe pathology.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Total Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) From Baseline to Endpoint</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician rating severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms (eg. delusions, hallucinations), 7 items measure negative symptoms (eg. blunted affect, social withdrawal), 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale (eg. anxiety, motor retardation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Total scores range from 30 to 210. Data represents change in total score from baseline to endpoint, higher (positive) scores indicate more severe pathology.</description>

          <title>Mean Change in Total Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) From Baseline to Week 2</title>
          <description>PANSS is a clinician rating severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms (eg. delusions, hallucinations), 7 items measure negative symptoms (eg. blunted affect, social withdrawal), 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale (eg. anxiety, motor retardation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Total scores range from 30 to 210. Data represents the change in total score from baseline to week 2, higher (positive) scores indicate more severe pathology.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Total Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) From Baseline to Week 12</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician rating severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms (eg. delusions, hallucinations), 7 items measure negative symptoms (eg. blunted affect, social withdrawal), 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale (eg. anxiety, motor retardation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Total scores range from 30 to 210. Data represents the change in total score from baseline to week 12, higher (positive) scores indicate more severe pathology.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Total Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician rating severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms (eg. delusions, hallucinations), 7 items measure negative symptoms (eg. blunted affect, social withdrawal), 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale (eg. anxiety, motor retardation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Total scores range from 30 to 210. Data represent the change in total score from baseline to week 24, higher (positive) scores indicate more severe pathology.</description>

          <description>PANSS rates the severity of psychopathology in schizophrenics. 7 items measure negative symptoms: blunted affect, social withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped thinking. Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Data represents change in Negative Rating Scale from baseline to week 2. Negative Scale score ranges from 7 to 49, higher (positive) score indicates more severe pathology.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Negative Scale Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) From Baseline to Week 12</title>
        <description>PANSS rates the severity of psychopathology in schizophrenics. 7 items measure negative symptoms: blunted affect, social withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped thinking. Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Data represents change in Negative Rating Scale from baseline to week 12. Negative Scale score ranges from 7 to 49, higher (positive) score indicates more severe pathology.</description>

          <description>PANSS rates the severity of psychopathology in schizophrenics. 7 items measure negative symptoms: blunted affect, social withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped thinking. Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Data represents change in Negative Rating Scale from baseline to week 20. Negative Scale score ranges from 7 to 49, higher (positive) score indicates more severe pathology.</description>

          <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility. Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. The data here represents the change in the Positive scale score from baseline to Week 1. The scale may range from 7 to 49, higher (positive) score indicating more severe pathology.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Positive Scale Score</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility. Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. The data here represents the change in the Positive scale score from baseline to Week 12. The scale may range from 7 to 49, higher (positive) score indicating more severe pathology.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Positive Scale Score</title>
          <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. 7 items measure positive symptoms: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility. Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. The data here represents the change in the Positive scale score from baseline to Week 24. The scale may range from 7 to 49, higher (positive) score indicating more severe pathology.</description>

        <description>PANSS rates psychopathology severity in schizophrenics. 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale:somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feeling, tension, mannerisms/posturing, depression, motor retardation, uncooperative, unusual thoughts, disorientation, poor attention, poor judgment/insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse control, preoccupation, social avoidance. Scored on severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 16 to 112, higher (positive) score more severe pathology.

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 20 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) General Psychopathology Scale Score</title>
          <description>PANSS rates psychopathology severity in schizophrenics. 16 items form a General Psychopathology scale:somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feeling, tension, mannerisms/posturing, depression, motor retardation, uncooperative, unusual thoughts, disorientation, poor attention, poor judgment/insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse control, preoccupation, social avoidance. Scored on severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 16 to 112, higher (positive) score more severe pathology. Data show change from baseline to week 20.</description>

        <description>PANSS rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms factor score includes 5 negative symptoms (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, positive/apathetic social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity) and 2 general psychopathology symptoms (motor retardation, active social avoidance). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 7 to 49. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening. Data represents change from baseline to endpoint.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 1 of Negative Symptom Dimension Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms factor score includes 5 negative symptoms (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, positive/apathetic social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity) and 2 general psychopathology symptoms (motor retardation, active social avoidance). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 7 to 49. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening. Data represents change from baseline to week 1.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 8 of Negative Symptom Dimension Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms factor score includes 5 negative symptoms (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, positive/apathetic social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity) and 2 general psychopathology symptoms (motor retardation, active social avoidance). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 7 to 49. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening. Data represents change from baseline to week 8.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 16 of Negative Symptom Dimension Scores From the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
          <description>PANSS rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms factor score includes 5 negative symptoms (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, positive/apathetic social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity) and 2 general psychopathology symptoms (motor retardation, active social avoidance). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 7 to 49. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening. Data represents change from baseline to week 16.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint of Positive Symptom Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The positive symptoms dimension is the sum of 4 positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinatory behavior, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution), 1 negative symptom (stereotyped thinking), and 3 general psychopathology symptoms (somatic concern, unusual thought content, lack of judgment/insight). Each item scored on 7-point scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 8 to 56. Higher (positive) scores indicate worsening. Data show change from baseline to endpoint.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 2 of Positive Symptom Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
          <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The positive symptoms dimension is sum of 4 positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinatory behavior, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution), 1 negative symptom (stereotyped thinking), and 3 general psychopathology symptoms (somatic concern, unusual thought content, lack of judgment/insight). Each item is scored on a 7-point scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 8 to 56. Higher (positive) scores indicate worsening. Data show change from baseline to week 2.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 of Positive Symptom Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The positive symptoms dimension is sum of 4 positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinatory behavior, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution), 1 negative symptom (stereotyped thinking), and 3 general psychopathology symptoms (somatic concern, unusual thought content, lack of judgment/insight). Each item is scored on a 7-point scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 8 to 56. Higher (positive) scores indicate worsening. Data show change from baseline to week 12.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 of Positive Symptom Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The positive symptoms dimension is sum of 4 positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinatory behavior, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution), 1 negative symptom (stereotyped thinking), and 3 general psychopathology symptoms (somatic concern, unusual thought content, lack of judgment/insight). Each item is scored on a 7-point scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 8 to 56. Higher (positive) scores indicate worsening. Data show change from baseline to week 24.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 1 From Anxiety/Depression Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
          <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The anxiety/depression dimension is the sum of 4 general psychopathology symptoms (anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, depression). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 4 to 28. The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 1. Higher (positive) scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 8 From Anxiety/Depression Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The anxiety/depression dimension is the sum of 4 general psychopathology symptoms (anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, depression). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 4 to 28. The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 8. Higher (positive) scores indicate worsening.</description>

Patients took 5 tablets orally each day, once daily in the morning. Study drug was titrated (using blister cards) during the double-blind treatment period starting with 50 mg/day of armodafinil or matching placebo. The dosage of armodafinil or matching placebo tablet was increased, as applicable, by 50 mg/day on days 2, 4, 6, and 8, up to the randomized dosage of 150, 200, or 250 mg/day.

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 16 From Anxiety/Depression Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
          <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The anxiety/depression dimension is the sum of 4 general psychopathology symptoms (anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, depression). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 4 to 28. The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 16. Higher (positive) scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint From Disorganized Thought Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in schizophrenic patients. Disorganized thought dimension is the sum of 1 positive symptom (conceptual disorganization), 1 negative symptom (difficulty in abstract thinking), and 5 general psychopathology symptoms (mannerisms/posturing, disorientation, poor attention, disturbance of volition, preoccupation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 7 to 49. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening. Data indicates change from baseline to endpoint.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 From Disorganized Thought Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in schizophrenics. Disorganized thought dimension is the sum of 1 positive symptom (conceptual disorganization), 1 negative symptom (difficulty in abstract thinking), and 5 general psychopathology symptoms (mannerisms and posturing, disorientation, poor attention, disturbance of volition, preoccupation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 7 to 49. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening. Data indicates change from baseline to week 4.</description>

          <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in schizophrenics. Disorganized thought dimension is the sum of 1 positive symptom (conceptual disorganization), 1 negative symptom (difficulty in abstract thinking), and 5 general psychopathology symptoms (mannerisms and posturing, disorientation, poor attention, disturbance of volition, preoccupation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 7 to 49. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening. Data indicates change from baseline to week 12.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 From Disorganized Thought Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS rates severity of psychopathology in schizophrenics. Disorganized thought dimension is the sum of 1 positive symptom (conceptual disorganization), 1 negative symptom (difficulty in abstract thinking), and 5 general psychopathology symptoms (mannerisms and posturing, disorientation, poor attention, disturbance of volition, preoccupation). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores range from 7 to 49. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening. Data indicates change from baseline to week 24.</description>

        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The hostility/excitement dimension is the sum of 2 positive symptoms (excitement, hostility) and 2 general psychopathology symptoms (uncooperativeness, poor impulse control). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 4 to 28.

          <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The hostility/excitement dimension is the sum of 2 positive symptoms (excitement, hostility) and 2 general psychopathology symptoms (uncooperativeness, poor impulse control). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 4 to 28. The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 1. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 8 From the Hostility/Excitement Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The hostility/excitement dimension is the sum of 2 positive symptoms (excitement, hostility) and 2 general psychopathology symptoms (uncooperativeness, poor impulse control). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 4 to 28. The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 8. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 20 From the Hostility/Excitement Dimension of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</title>
        <description>PANSS is a clinician-rated instrument that rates the severity of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. The hostility/excitement dimension is the sum of 2 positive symptoms (excitement, hostility) and 2 general psychopathology symptoms (uncooperativeness, poor impulse control). Each item is scored on a 7-point severity scale: 1=absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, 7=extreme. Scores may range from 4 to 28. The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 20. Higher (positive) score indicates worsening.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7, with higher scores indicating more severe illness. The data presented represents the change from baseline to endpoint in the CGI-S rating. A negative value indicates improvement.</description>

          <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7, with higher scores indicating more severe illness. The data presented represents the change from baseline to endpoint in the CGI-S rating. A negative value indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Rating</title>
        <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7, with higher scores indicating more severe illness. The data presented represents the change from baseline to week 4 in the CGI-S rating. A negative value indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Rating</title>
          <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7, with higher scores indicating more severe illness. The data presented represents the change from baseline to week 8 in the CGI-S rating. A negative value indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 14 in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Rating</title>
        <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7, with higher scores indicating more severe illness. The data presented represents the change from baseline to week 14 in the CGI-S rating. A negative value indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 20 in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Rating</title>
        <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7, with higher scores indicating more severe illness. The data presented represents the change from baseline to week 20 in the CGI-S rating. A negative value indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Rating</title>
          <description>The CGI-S is a standardized, clinician-rated assessment to rate the severity of illness of the patient. The clinician assessed the severity of illness using the following categories: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill. The minimum score is 1 and maximum score is 7, with higher scores indicating more severe illness. The data presented represents the change from baseline to week 24 in the CGI-S rating. A negative value indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>PSP is a validated clinician-rated assessment of functioning. Four areas of functioning (socially useful activities, personal/social relationships, self-care, disturbing/aggressive behaviors) are assessed on a 6-point scale (0=absent to 5=very severe). A transformed score from 1 to 100 is generated from the raw score based on the clinical interpretation of the scores generated in the 4 areas of functioning, with a higher transformed score indicating better function. Data presented here represents change from baseline to endpoint in the overall score with positive values signifying improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Scores</title>
        <description>PSP is a validated clinician-rated assessment of functioning. Four areas of functioning (socially useful activities, personal/social relationships, self-care, disturbing/aggressive behaviors) are assessed on a 6-point scale (0=absent to 5=very severe). A transformed score from 1 to 100 is generated from the raw score based on the clinical interpretation of the scores generated in the 4 areas of functioning, with a higher transformed score indicating better function. Data presented here represents change from baseline to week 12 in the overall score with positive values signifying improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in CNSVitalSigns Cognitive Battery Scores - Shifting Attention Test</title>
        <description>The Shifting Attention Test is a test in the CNSVitalSigns cognitive battery. The Shifting Attention Test assesses attention and executive function. Patients were instructed to match geometric objects either by shape or by color. Composite Scoring presented here was calculated as the number of correct responses minus the number of errors. A higher score indicates more correct responses. The data represent the change from baseline to endpoint and a positive value represents improvement.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in CNSVitalSigns Cognitive Battery Scores - Shifting Attention Test</title>
          <description>The Shifting Attention Test is a test in the CNSVitalSigns cognitive battery. The Shifting Attention Test assesses attention and executive function. Patients were instructed to match geometric objects either by shape or by color. Composite Scoring presented here was calculated as the number of correct responses minus the number of errors. A higher score indicates more correct responses. The data represent the change from baseline to week 24 and a positive value represents improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in CNSVitalSigns Cognitive Battery Scores - 4-part Continuous Performance Test [CPT]</title>
        <description>The 4-Part Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is a component of the CNSVitalSigns cognitive battery. The 4-Part CPT assesses working memory. The patient was presented with targets and had to remember target presentation sequencing in order to respond to the directions. The complexity of the directions increased as the patient proceeded through the 4 parts of the test. Scoring is based on the number of correct responses, with a higher number indicating more correct responses. Data represents change from baseline to endpoint with positive values demonstrating improvement.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 in CNSVitalSigns Cognitive Battery Scores - 4-part Continuous Performance Test [CPT]</title>
          <description>The 4-Part Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is a component of the CNSVitalSigns cognitive battery. The 4-Part CPT assesses working memory. The patient was presented with targets and had to remember target presentation sequencing in order to respond to the directions. The complexity of the directions increased as the patient proceeded through the 4 parts of the test. Scoring is based on the number of correct responses, with a higher number indicating more correct responses. Data represents change from baseline to week 24 with positive values demonstrating improvement.</description>

        <description>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is a 14-item, clinician-rated scale to assess the severity of dyskinesias in patients taking neuroleptic drugs. Items 1 through 10 were rated using a 5-point (0-4) scale, items 11 through 14 were rated using a 2-point (no or yes) scale. The AIMS total score is the sum of items 1 through 10, and can range from 0-40. A higher score indicates a presence of more severe dyskinesias. Data represents change from baseline to endpoint, positive value represents worsening.</description>

          <description>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is a 14-item, clinician-rated scale to assess the severity of dyskinesias in patients taking neuroleptic drugs. Items 1 through 10 were rated using a 5-point (0-4) scale, items 11 through 14 were rated using a 2-point (no or yes) scale. The AIMS total score is the sum of items 1 through 10, and can range from 0-40. A higher score indicates a presence of more severe dyskinesias. Data represents change from baseline to week 2, positive value represents worsening.</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline to Week 16 in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Total Scores</title>
        <description>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is a 14-item, clinician-rated scale to assess the severity of dyskinesias in patients taking neuroleptic drugs. Items 1 through 10 were rated using a 5-point (0-4) scale, items 11 through 14 were rated using a 2-point (no or yes) scale. The AIMS total score is the sum of items 1 through 10, and can range from 0-40. A higher score indicates a presence of more severe dyskinesias. Data represents change from baseline to week 16, positive value represents worsening.</description>

        <description>The Simpson-Angus EPS Scale is a clinician-rated scale to assess parkinsonian and extrapyramidal symptoms (10 items) associated with antipsychotic medications. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale. In addition, this scale was used to evaluate and characterize adverse events of extrapyramidal symptoms. Total scores are calculated by summing the scores of each item (minimum 0, maximum 40) and dividing by the number of items (10). Scores can range from 0-4. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms. Data represents change from baseline to endpoint, positive values represent worsening.</description>

Total scores are calculated by summing the scores of each item (minimum 0, maximum 40) and dividing by the number of items (10). Scores can range from 0-4. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms. Data represents change from baseline to endpoint, positive values represent worsening.</description>

          <description>The Simpson-Angus EPS Scale is a clinician-rated scale to assess parkinsonian and extrapyramidal symptoms (10 items) associated with antipsychotic medications. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale. In addition, this scale was used to evaluate and characterize adverse events of extrapyramidal symptoms. Total scores are calculated by summing the scores of each item (minimum 0, maximum 40) and dividing by the number of items (10). Scores can range from 0-4. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms. Data represents change from baseline to week 8, positive values represent worsening.</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline to Week 24 in the Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) Scale Total Score</title>
        <description>The Simpson-Angus EPS Scale is a clinician-rated scale to assess parkinsonian and extrapyramidal symptoms (10 items) associated with antipsychotic medications. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale. In addition, this scale was used to evaluate and characterize adverse events of extrapyramidal symptoms. Total scores are calculated by summing the scores of each item (minimum 0, maximum 40) and dividing by the number of items (10). Scores can range from 0-4. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms. Data represents change from baseline to week 24, positive values represent worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 1 in the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) Score</title>
        <description>Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) assesses the level of depression in patients with schizophrenia. Nine items (depression, hopelessness, self-depreciation, pathological guilt, guilty ideas of reference, morning depression, early awakening, suicidal, observed depression) are each scored on a 4-point scale: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The total score is a sum of the scores of each item and may range from 0 to 27. Higher score more severe pathology. Data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 1, positive values represent worsening.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) Score</title>
          <description>Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) assesses the level of depression in patients with schizophrenia. Nine items (depression, hopelessness, self-depreciation, pathological guilt, guilty ideas of reference, morning depression, early awakening, suicidal, observed depression) are each scored on a 4-point scale: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The total score is a sum of the scores of each item and may range from 0 to 27. Higher score more severe pathology. Data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 24, positive values represent worsening.</description>

        <title>Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Scores - Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Behavior at Week 24</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS was performed at weeks 8, 16, and 24 (or last observation after baseline), and at any time if clinically indicated. The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The data presented here represents the percentage of patients in each arm found to have suicidal behavior in the judgment of a clinician and based upon a clinicians interpretation of the subject's responses to the C-SSRS questions at week 24.</description>

        <title>Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Scores - Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Ideations at Week 24</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS was performed at weeks 8, 16, and 24 (or last observation after baseline), and at any time if clinically indicated. The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The data presented here represents the percentage of patients in each arm found to have suicidal ideation in the judgment of a clinician and based upon a clinicians interpretation of the subject's responses to the C-SSRS questions at week 24.</description>

        <description>A sleep questionnaire was used to evaluate the effect of armodafinil treatment on the patient’s nighttime sleep. Patients completed the questionnaire to evaluate the sleep latency (time till fall asleep), duration, nighttime awakenings, and overall sleep quality. The questionnaire was assessed at the screening visit and at weeks 12 and 24 (or last visit after baseline). The data presented here represents the change from baseline to endpoint in reported sleep latency. There is no range of possible values, positive values represent prolongation of sleep latency.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Sleep Latency</title>
          <description>A sleep questionnaire was used to evaluate the effect of armodafinil treatment on the patient’s nighttime sleep. Patients completed the questionnaire to evaluate the sleep latency (time till fall asleep), duration, nighttime awakenings, and overall sleep quality. The questionnaire was assessed at the screening visit and at weeks 12 and 24 (or last visit after baseline). The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 24 in reported sleep latency. There is no range of possible values, positive values represent prolongation of sleep latency.</description>

        <description>A sleep questionnaire was used to evaluate the effect of armodafinil treatment on the patient's nighttime sleep. Patients completed the questionnaire to evaluate the sleep latency, duration, nighttime awakenings, and overall sleep quality. The questionnaire was assessed at the screening visit and at weeks 12 and 24 (or last visit after baseline). The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 12 in reported time spent asleep at night. A positive value indicates increased time spent asleep at night.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Sleep Quality Rating</title>
        <description>A sleep questionnaire was used to evaluate the effect of armodafinil on the patient's nighttime sleep. Patients completed the questionnaire to evaluate the sleep latency, duration, nighttime awakenings, and overall sleep quality. The questionnaire was assessed at the screening visit and at weeks 12 and 24 (or last visit after baseline). The data presented here represents the change from baseline to week 24 in participants' ratings of their quality of sleep as measured on a 4-point scale (1=Poor, 2=Fair, 3=Good, 4=Excellent). A positive value represents improvement in sleep quality.</description>
