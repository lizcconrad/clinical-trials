      The best technique for this repair would be that which requires least time in realisation,
      least consumption of material for the repair and that which produces less pain at short and
      long-term permitting the resumption of intercourse quicker and with less pain thereby
      requiring less necessity to take out the stitches and less frequency of re stitching. The
      investigators research is looking for a technique for repairing the perineum more
      advantageously.

      445 women who participated in the project had undergone normal deliveries with episiotomy or
      second-grade tearing of the perineum. One group was repaired with continuous non-locking
      suture in the vagina, perineum and subcutaneous tissue. The other group used continuous
      locking suture of the vagina, interrupted sutures in the perineum muscle and interrupted
      transcutaneous suture. The threads used for stitching were identical in both groups. The same
      questions were asked concerning the sensation of pain and the use of painkillers, the second
      and the tenth day and at the three months.
