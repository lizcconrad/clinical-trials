    <textblock>
      This trial will use a new method of treating lymphoma using a therapy derived from a person's
      Killer T cells. These Killer T cells are taken from a person's blood and grown in a test tube
      to increase the number of these cells that are specifically active against the lymphoma
      cells. The cells are then given to the patient by intravenous infusion with the aim of
      killing the lymphoma cells. Potentially this treatment will help to kill the
      residual/recurrent tumour that is present after other lymphoma treatment and reduce the
      chance of the tumour recurring.
