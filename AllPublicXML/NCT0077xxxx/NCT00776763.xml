      Aims of the trial: Establishing the profile of the growth factors and other mediators of
      angiogenesis in different ocular fluids (aqueous humour, vitreous gel and ocular liquid in
      vitrectomized eyes), in the 2 most frequent proliferative retinopathies - diabetic
      proliferative retinopathy (PDR) and exudative age related macular degeneration (AMD).
      Following up the dynamic of this profile before and after intravitreal administration of
      Bevacizumab (Avastin) as an anti-VEGF blocker.

      Materials: The research will be conducted on the following categories of patients groups:

        -  nondiabetic patients without AMD or any other diagnosed proliferative ocular disease
           (controls)

        -  patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD groups) before and after
           intravitreal injections with Avastin

        -  diabetic patients with different types of diabetic retinopathy, before and after
           intravitreal Avastin (diabetic groups) Methods: Samples from different ocular fluids
           will be collected from each group of patients. 10 growth factors and other 10 cytokines
           will be determined in the ocular fluids samples.

      Results: The results from the biochemical measurements will be statistically interpreted in
      order to obtain conclusions for the clinical practice.

      Conclusions: The conclusions of this trial will be used exclusively for research publications
      and communications, as well as for clinical practice.
