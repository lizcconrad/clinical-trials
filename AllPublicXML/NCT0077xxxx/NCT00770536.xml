    <textblock>
      This study is a 2 part, 2 cohort, open-label, dose escalation/de escalation study of AMG 386
      in combination with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan in subjects with
      recurrent ovarian cancer. Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled to receive AMG 386 in
      combination with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin every 4 weeks (cohort A) or topotecan
      weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day dosing schedule (cohort B). Subject enrollment and
      assignment to either cohort will be based on eligibility and the investigator's discretion.

      It is hypothesized that AMG 386, in combination with each of the chemotherapy regimens:
      either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan will be safe and well tolerated in
      subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AMG 386 when used
      with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan in subjects with advanced recurrent
      epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
