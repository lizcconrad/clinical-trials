    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to assess the single-dose relative bioavailability of Ranbaxy
      and GlaxoSmithKline (Retrovir ®) 300 mg Zidovudine tablets, under fed conditions

    <textblock>
      This was an open label, randomized, single dose, 2-way crossover, comparative bioavailability
      study performed on 68 healthy adult volunteers. In each period, subjects were housed from at
      least 10 hours before dosing until after the 12 hour blood draw. Single oral dose 300 mg
      Zidovudine doses were separated by a washout period of 7 days.

      A total of sixty-eight (68) healthy adult subjects (29 males and 39 females) were enrolled in
      the study, of which sixty five (65) subjects (29 males and 36 females) completed the clinical
      portion of the study.
