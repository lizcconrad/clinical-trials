      Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability of GCS-100
      in combination with etoposide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of the combination of GCS-100 with
      etoposide and dexamethasone. In vitro data demonstrates potentiation of the killing of
      lymphoma cells when GCS-100 is combined with dexamethasone or etoposide (Linda Baum,
      unpublished data; Finbarr Cotter et al, Annals of Oncology, vol 16, 205, Suppl 5.) GCS-100
      will be administered in increasing doses to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in
      combination with these chemotherapeutic agents. When the MTD is defined, the cohort will be
      expanded to characterize the efficacy of this combination.
