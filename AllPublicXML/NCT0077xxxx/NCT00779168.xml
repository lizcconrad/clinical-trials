      RATIONALE: White button mushroom extract may stop or delay the development of recurrent
      prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of white button
      mushroom extract in treating patients with recurrent prostate cancer after local therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the feasibility and toxicity of prolonged white button mushroom extract
           therapy at six different dose levels in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate
           cancer after local therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To analyze the effect of this regimen on a variety of biomarkers including testosterone,
           dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, estrogens, aromatase, parameters of immune
           function, and circulating tumor cells.

        -  To assess the effect of this regimen on PSA kinetics as a measure of disease activity in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral white button mushroom extract twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and urine samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and
      immunologic correlative studies. Plasma and urine samples are analyzed for quantification of
      conjugated unsaturated fatty acids via gas chromatography-mass spectometry. Plasma samples
      are analyzed for inhibition of aromatase via aromatase activity analysis and the effect of
      treatment on immune cytokines levels via immunobiologic assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells are analyzed for the effect of treatment on immune cell subsets and NK cell function
      via multi-parameter flow cytometry; effect of treatment on NK cell activation status via
      staining method; and measurement of circulating tumor cells via fluorescence microscopy,
      fiber-optic array scanning technology (FAST), or high-speed flow cytometry. Additional serum
      samples are collected for future studies.

      Patients complete a diary listing days of administration of treatment and side effects.
