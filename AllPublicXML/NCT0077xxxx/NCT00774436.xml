  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if men, with low-risk prostate, can have the small
      amount of cancer within their prostate removed by freezing, called Focal Cryoablation or
      Cryotherapy.

    <description>After enrollment, patients will undergo a repeat transrectal ultrasound- guided prostate biopsy (minimum of 12 cores) to confirm the low-risk nature of their cancer. For study purposes, patients must meet the original entry crieteria on this repeat biopsy. If the patient meets the repeat-biopsy enrollment criteria, they will be treated with focal cryotherapy, meaning cryoablation of the regions of the prostate containing cancer. Efficacy is defined as all negative biopsy cores at the site of the focal ablation on a repeat transrectal biopsy 6 months after cryoablation. At baseline (prior to the re-staging biopsy), 3 months after focal cryotherapy, and at 6 months after focal cryotherapy (prior to the repeat prostate biopsy used to define efficacy), the patient will complete quality of life questionnaires as standard for all patients in the Urology Service.</description>

    <description>Those men meeting the re-staging biopsy criteria will subsequently be treated with focal cryotherapy. Clinical follow-up visits will be scheduled at 6 + 2 weeks, 3 + 1 months and 6 + 1 months after focal cryotherapy, at which time, a digital rectal examination and PSA test will be performed. Standard quality-of-life questionnaires, are completed by all patients treated by the Urology Service (whether on not they are treated on an IRB protocol).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        A two-step consenting process will be in place for all patients being enrolled to this
        study. The two-step method is necessary because all patients being enrolled will need to
        have a repeat transrectal biopsy after meeting the initial study requirements. The two step
        consent process would enroll patients considering focal cryotherapy into the initial part
        of the study (QOL assessment at baseline, PCA3 test, and repeat biopsy); those deemed
        eligible after the re-staging biopsy would be consented to participate in the remainder of
        the study (focal cryotherapy, QOL studies, repeat biopsy at 6 months for efficacy, PCA3
        test).
