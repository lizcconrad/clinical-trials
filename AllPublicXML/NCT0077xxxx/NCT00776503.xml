      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated duration and schedule of oral
      VORINOSTAT in addition to low dose cytarabine in the treatment of Intermediate-2 and High
      risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, Phase I/II study. Patients will be
      treated either with arm A or B dosing schedules which contain increasing durations of
      exposure to vorinostat. LD Ara-C will be administered once daily, subcutaneously(SC), at 10
      mg/m² in Cycle 1 and escalated to 20 mg/m² daily in Cycle 2 and above for 14 out of 28 days.
      Oral vorinostat will be administered as 400 mg, once daily either sequentially(Arm A) or
      concurrently (Arm B) with LD Ara-C in Dose Level #1 for 7 days, Dose Level #2 for 10 days, or
      Dose Level #3 for 14 days out of each 28-day cycle. Patients who do not have disease
      progression and who continue to meet eligibility criteria may receive up to 3 additional
      28-day cycles of treatment.
