      This proof-of-concept study is to assess the potential benefit of botulinum toxin for
      patients with sleep-related breathing disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mono-center, double-blind, 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial 18 treated patients, 9
      patients per group.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with NT 201 or placebo in a ratio of 1:1. In
      addition, within each treatment group patients will be randomly assigned to injection into
      the left or right soft palate.

      Primary variable:

      Comparison of the ratio of snoring time over sleeping time (Snoring Index). Other secondary
      variables will be analysed.

          3. Patients suffering from sleep-related breathing disorders for at least 3 months prior
             to study start and seeking help for their snoring.

          4. Non-REM RDI ≤ 25/h (according to Medicare Criteria) at baseline PSG.

          5. AHI ≤ 10/h at baseline PSG.
