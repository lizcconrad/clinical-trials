  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very little information is available about extremely obese (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 40 kg/m2)
      adolescents. The purpose of the Follow up of Adolescent Bariatric Surgery (FABS) study is to
      collect information obtained during the clinical care of obese adolescents from all over the
      country that can be used by researchers to study obesity, the complications of obesity, and
      the outcomes of obesity treatment during adolescence. This information will be used to
      describe the experience of the obese adolescent, including how obesity during adolescence and
      its treatment impacts health and well-being. The information may also be used to study causes
      of obesity, to determine the predictors of successful obesity treatment and for other obesity
      related research. Because of the importance of understanding the outcome of obesity and
      obesity treatments (surgical and non-surgical) on the patient over time, the data included in
      the study will be collected before, during and after any treatments rendered. For those who
      do not undergo a treatment which results in major weight change, it will be critical to
      determine the natural history of adolescent severe obesity as the adolescent transitions into
      adulthood. Finally, another important purpose of the FABS research study is to obtain
      patients' consent to be contacted for possible participation in future research studies.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. To describe the natural history of morbid obesity among adolescents who seek treatment
           for their obesity

        2. To describe major outcomes following bariatric surgery in adolescents evaluated at 3, 6,
           12, and annually for 10 years post-operatively and compare these to outcomes to patients
           managed non-surgically

        3. To organize a national cohort of severely obese adolescents who agree to be contacted in
           the future for research studies
