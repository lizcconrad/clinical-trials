    <textblock>
      Tools known as 'depression scales 'are widely used as assessments to evaluate a patient's
      response to treatment. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the remission rates for
      patients with MDD. The evaluation will involve the use of HAM-D 17, and HAM-D 7
      questionnaires and the comparison of those questionnaires.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Remission Based on Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Remission according to HAM-D: HAM-D17 score less than or equal to (=&lt;) 7 or a HAM-D7 score =&lt; 3. HAM-D17: standardized, clinician-administered rating scale; assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Individual items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe. Total score: 0 to 66; higher score indicates more depression. HAM-D7: subset of HAM-D17; assesses 7 items associated with major depression. Total score: 0 to 26; higher score indicates more depression.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Remission Based on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Remission according to BDI: BDI score less than (&lt;) 10. BDI: 21 item participant rated inventory evaluates depression symptoms, cognition, and physical symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, lack of interest in sex. Individual items are scored on a 4 point scale (0 to 3), with 0=none/absent and 3=most severe. Total score: 0 to 63; higher score indicates more depression.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Scale 17 (HAM-D17), HAM-D7 and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D17: clinician-administered scale; assesses 17 items related to major depression (MD). Individual items scored on 3 point (0 to 2) or 5 point scale (0 to 4); 0=absent, 4=most severe. Total score: 0 to 66. HAM-D7: subset of HAM-D17; assesses 7 items related to MD. Total score: 0 to 26. BDI: 21 item participant rated inventory evaluates depression symptoms, cognition, physical symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, lack of interest in sex. Individual item scored on 4 point scale (0 to 3); 0=absent, 3=most severe. Total score: 0 to 63. For all the 3 scales, higher score represented more depression.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Residual Symptoms in Case of Non Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with residual symptoms who did not achieve remission was assessed. Remission according to HAM-D: HAM-D17 score =&lt; 7 or HAM-D7 score =&lt;3. Remission according to BDI: BDI score &lt;10. HAM-D17: assessed 17 items associated with MD. Individual items scored on 3 point (0 to 2) or 5 point scale (0 to 4); 0=absent, 4=most severe. Total score: 0 to 66. HAM-D7: assessed 7 items associated with MD. Total score: 0 to 26. BDI assessed severity of depressive symptoms. Individual items are scored on a 4 point scale (0 to 3), with 0=none/absent and 3=most severe. The total score: 0 to 63. For all the 3 scales, higher score indicated more severe depression.</description>

        <description>HAM-D17: clinician-administered scale; assesses 17 items related to major depression (MD). Individual items scored on 3 point (0 to 2) or 5 point scale (0 to 4); 0=absent, 4=most severe. Total score: 0 to 66. HAM-D7: subset of HAM-D17; assesses 7 items related to MD. Total score: 0 to 26. BDI: 21 item participant rated inventory evaluates depression symptoms, cognition, physical symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, lack of interest in sex. Individual item scored on 4 point scale (0 to 3); 0=absent, 3=most severe. Total score: 0 to 63. For all the 3 scales, higher score represented more depression.</description>
