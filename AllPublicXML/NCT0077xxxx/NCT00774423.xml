      This is a multicentric, randomized, double-blind study versus placebo, with two parallel
      groups treated to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerance of Riluzole in children and young
      adults (6 to 20 years of age) with SMA. (Type II and Type III).

      ASIRI study should allow to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerance of Riluzole in children
      and young adults (6 to 20 years of age) with SMA. This is a multicentric, randomized,
      double-blind study versus placebo, with two parallel groups treated and followed during 2
      years. It has been preceded by a 7 days pharmacokinetic phase, concerning 14 patients, aiming
      to provide information on the kinetic profile of Riluzole in children. The drug could
      stabilize patients condition, and especially interrupt paralysis progression; those are the
      desired effects.

      There is an open-label study of the long term safety of riluzole therapy in spinal muscular
      atrophies types II and III, with patients previously enrolled in ASIRI double-blind study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients afflicted with spinal muscular atrophy, type II or III, with genetic defect
             confirmed.

             hepatotoxic medication that cannot be stopped, any other experimental product

          -  Hepatic insufficiency: SGPT and/or SGOT levels higher than or equal to twice the
             normal higher limit

          -  Renal insufficiency (creatinine above 115 micromoles/l)

          -  Severe cardiac insufficiency

          -  Current pneumopathy (clinical signs of an acute episode, confirmed by pulmonary X-ray,
             requiring specific treatment)

          -  Pregnancy or nursing for women; non-abstinence or absence of effective contraception
             for nubile women
