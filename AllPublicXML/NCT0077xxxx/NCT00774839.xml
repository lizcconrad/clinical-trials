  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the social and financial impact of colon
      cancer for older patients. We want to know how cancer has affected the patient financially
      and socially, and to know if the patient has resource needs that have gone unmet. By doing
      this study, we hope to learn about resources that can reduce the financial burden from
      cancer.

    <description>The patient will participate in a semistructured interview conducted by a trained staff member and designed to last approximately 45 minutes. All interviews will take place at least 4 months into or up to 7 months after the end of the treatment, if possible and will be scheduled to occur at the time of the chemotherapy infusion, or at another time at the care facility when it is convenient for the patient. If the patient is not scheduled or chooses not to be at the care facility within a time frame that fits the study parameters, the patient may opt to be interviewed at another location, including the patient's home.</description>
