    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers are a challenge to health care professionals because there are only few
      effective topical therapeutic interventions.

      Growth factor treatment has shown to be beneficial for healing of diabetic foot ulcers in
      conjunction with extensive surgical debridement. Autologues platelet releasate which contains
      platelet derived growth factor appears to be more effective than standard therapy in case
      studies.

      This protocol will evaluate the healing effect of Vivostat PRF treatment of non-eschemic foot
      ulcers to identify responders and to enable sample size calculation for a subsequent pivotal
      trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 4 weeks history (with wound area measurements) within a wound care
             institution before the first visit (week -3). In case of referral the patient history
             must be documented

          -  All patients must complete a 3 week screening period i.e. they will be interviewed and
             accessed at the first meeting. During the 3 week period patient compliance will be
             monitored.

          -  If there is more than one ulcer or bilateral ulcers, the investigator shall choose the
             one index ulcer to be treated (typically the largest one). The other ulcers will
             receive standard care and is not included in the study

          -  Patient foot is appropriately off loaded (contact cast, pneumatic walking cast)

          -  Orthopaedic assessment has been completed to rule out a mechanical source of
             ulceration

          -  Relative wound area reduction less than 50% from week -3 to week 0 (pre-screening
             period)
