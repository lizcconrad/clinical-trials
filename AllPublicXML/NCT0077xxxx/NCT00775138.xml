    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the safety and tolerability of 28 days of daily dosing of two
      doses (280mg and 560mg) of Arikace™ versus placebo in patients who have Bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic disorder of the major bronchi and bronchioles characterized by
      permanent dilation, microbial infection, a persistent inflammatory response with the release
      of immune mediators and microbial toxins leading to destruction. The origin of bronchiectasis
      varies, but the presence of microbial infection and a persistent inflammatory response is
      typical of the disease. The chronic nature of the infection and the associated considerable
      morbidity provides the rationale for using aerosolized antibiotics for the treatment of
      bronchiectasis patients.

      This is a multi-national Phase 2 study of safety and tolerability of 28 days of daily dosing
      with two dose levels (280 mg and 560 mg) of Arikace™ versus placebo in subjects with
      bronchiectasis (BR) and chronic pseudomonas infection. Study subjects will be randomized to
      receive either study drug or placebo by inhalation via a PARI eFlow nebulizer. Each subject
      will complete 28 days of daily dosing. All study subjects will be followed for microbiologic
      activity for 14 days after completion of treatment and for safety for 28 days post completion
      of study treatment.

      The total study duration will be 56 days, with screening visit occurring within the preceding
      14 days prior to study day 1. At Day 1 (baseline), subjects will be evaluated at pre-dose and
      during the first 4-5 hours post-dose. Subjects will return at 2 weeks (day 14) after start of
      treatment and at the end of 4 weeks (Day 28) treatment period to determine safety and,
      efficacy of Arikace™. Subjects will be followed up at study days 42 and 56 (about 2 and 4
      weeks after end of treatment) for safety determination. After completion of this study,
      subjects will be, followed up for an additional 6 months via phone contacts and records
      review, if hospitalized or treated for pulmonary exacerbation (under the extension protocol).

      Clinical laboratory parameters, audiology testing, clinical adverse events and pulmonary
      function will be evaluated for all study subjects in order to determine the qualitative and
      quantitative safety and tolerability of Arikace™ compared to placebo. Serum, urine and sputum
      specimens will be collected at periodic intervals to assess PK in subjectswho consent for the
      PK portion of the study. Additionally, sputum samples will be collected to determine changes
      in bacterial density. Total Pulmonary Symptom Severity Score will be assessed, and
      Respiratory quality of life will be evaluated by using the St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ).

    <description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to study drug dose of 280mg or 560mg and then within dose group to either Arikace™ or placebo in accordance with a code provided by the Sponsor/CRO. At each dose of study drug, randomization will be made in a 2:1 allocation between Arikace™ and placebo. Thus, the final allocation among study drug levels and placebo will be 1:1:1 (Arikace™ 280mg: Arikace™ 560mg: placebo, both doses). Because of the mode of study drug delivery, study subjects will not be blinded to whether they have been assigned to the 280mg concentration or the 560mg concentration, however, they will be blinded to whether they will receive Arikace™ or placebo. Study subjects will receive Arikace™ or placebo on Days 1 through Day 28. Drug is administered once a day via a nebulizer.</description>
