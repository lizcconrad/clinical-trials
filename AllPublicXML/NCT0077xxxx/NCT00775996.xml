      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioequivalence study on clorazepate dipotassium
      comparing clorazepate dipotassium 15mg tablets of Ranbaxy Laboratories with Abbott
      (TranxeneeT-Tab®) 15 mg, in healthy, adult, human, subjects under fasting conditions. A total
      of 32 subjects, 25 males and 7 females, were enrolled in the study, and 31 subjects, 24 males
      and 7 females, completed the study.
