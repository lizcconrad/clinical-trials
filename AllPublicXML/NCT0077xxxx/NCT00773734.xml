  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test if the drug apremilast was safe, if it helped improve
      psoriasis, and how well the participants tolerated it.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study fully explored the extent of treatment benefit achieved with doses of apremilast
      up to 30 mg by mouth (PO) twice daily (BID) with treatment duration for up to 6 months. In
      addition, it was important to determine the minimally effective dose for apremilast and more
      fully elucidate the dose response curve in this patient population. The results from this
      study helped guide the selection of the dose in the phase 3 trials.

      Participants meeting eligibility criteria at the Baseline Visit (Week 0) were centrally
      randomized with the use of a permuted-block randomization list, with equal allocation to each
      of the four treatment arms: 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg PO BID of apremilast or placebo. In an
      effort to mitigate the dose-dependent adverse effects of apremilast (e.g., headache or
      gastrointestinal disturbances), participants had their dose titrated over a 7-day period
      (Days 1 through7). Participants received 10 mg PO BID of apremilast or identically-appearing
      placebo during Days 1 to 2. Participants randomized to the 10 mg BID dose continued taking
      this dose throughout the treatment phase of the study. Those participants randomized to the
      20 mg BID dose were dose titrated to 20 mg PO BID of apremilast or identically-appearing
      placebo during Days 3 to 4 of dosing. Participants randomized to the 20 mg BID dose continued
      taking this dose throughout the treatment phase of the study. Those participants randomized
      to the 30 mg BID dose were dose titrated to 30 mg PO BID of apremilast or
      identically-appearing placebo during Days 5 to 7 and continued taking this dose throughout
      the treatment phase of the study. At Week 16, all participants originally randomized to the
      placebo arm were re-randomized to 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID of apremilast. All participants
      (i.e., those that were continuing their Apremilast dosing regimen, as well as those that were
      switched from placebo to apremilast) received drug at Week 16 in a treatment arm in a blinded
      fashion. In addition, participants who transitioned from placebo to active medication at Week
      16 completed a dose titration schedule to help mitigate any potential GI side effects that
      may have jeopardized the blinding of the treatment arms.

      At Week 24 (end of core study and beginning of an extension study), participants were given
      the option to enroll into an extension study (PSOR-005E NCT00953875) and continue on the same
      apremilast dosage they had received at the end of the core study, during Weeks 24-52, a total
      of 28 weeks. Participants who elected not to enter into the treatment extension study,
      completed a 4-week observational follow-up phase of the core study. At Week 52 (end of
      extension study and beginning of a long-term extension study), participants were given the
      option to enroll into a long term extension study (PSOR-005LTE NCT01130116), for 4 additional
      years. Participants who were treated with apremilast 10 mg BID in the extension study were
      randomly assigned and dose titrated to either apremilast 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID. Participants
      who were dosed with 20mg or 30 mg BID in the extension study continued to receive the same
      dose in the long-term extension study. The long-term extension study is anticipated to
      complete in May 2016.

    <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

    <description>Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3).</description>

    <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations-physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Extension Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 52. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

    <description>Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the subject and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3).</description>

Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value..</description>

    <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

    <description>Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3).</description>

    <description>The DLQI was a validated, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on subjects' quality of life, based on recall over the past week. Domains include symptoms, feelings, daily activities, social, leisure, work or studying, personal relationships and treatment. Each question on the extent of the impact of skin disease was answered on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the total DLQI score ranged from 0 to 30. A DLQI score greater than 10 is indicative of severe psoriasis.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0 to Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations-physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

    <description>The sPGA was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA was a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling . Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3). A lower sPGA score was associated with less severe disease</description>

        <title>Core Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Improvement (Response) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

          <description>PASI-50 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 24. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI score was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

        <title>Core Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 100% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>A participant was classified as having achieved a PASI-100 response if the PASI score was reduced by at least 100% from baseline. The PASI score was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

        <title>Core Study: Percentage of Participants With a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Greater Than 2 at Baseline Who Achieved a Score of 0 or 1 at Week 16</title>
        <description>The sPGA was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA was a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling . Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3). A lower sPGA score was associated with less severe disease</description>

At Week 24 (End of core study and beginning of extension study), participants were given the option to enroll into the extension study (PSOR-005E NCT00953875) and continued on the same apremilast dosage they had received at the end of the core study (Weeks 24-52). Participants who elected not to enter into the treatment extension study, completed a 4-week observational follow-up phase of the core study.</description>

          <title>Core Study: Shift Change (1 or More Points on a 0 to 5 Point Scale) in Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) at Week 24</title>
          <description>Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3).</description>
          <population>The Shift change in sPGA was not defined and analyzed. A response defined as achieving sPGA score 0 or 1 with at least 2 points reduction from baseline was a more meaningful clinical endpoint.</population>

        <title>Core Study: Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DLQI was a validated, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on subjects’ quality of life, based on recall over the past week. Domains include symptoms, feelings, daily activities, social, leisure, work or studying, personal relationships and treatment. Each question on the extent of the impact of skin disease was answered on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the total DLQI score ranged from 0 to 30. A DLQI score greater than 10 is indicative of severe psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Core Study: Change From Baseline in the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36), Version 2; Mental Component Summary Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations–physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations–emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

        <title>Core Study: Change From Baseline in the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36), Version 2; Mental Component Summary Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations–physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations–emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

        <title>Extension Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 75% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 52. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

          <title>Extension Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 50% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score at Week 40</title>
          <description>PASI-50 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16 of the extension study. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

        <title>Extension Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 90% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>PASI-90 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 90% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 52 of the extension study. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

          <title>Extension Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 100% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score at Week 52</title>
          <description>A participant was classified as having achieved a PASI-100 response if the PASI score was reduced by at least 100% from baseline. The PASI score was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>
          <population>The PASI 100 was not defined and analyzed since there were too few such participants.</population>

        <title>Extension Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 32</title>
        <description>The sPGA was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA was a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling . Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3). A lower sPGA score was associated with less severe disease.</description>

          <title>Extension Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of 0 or 1 at Week 32</title>
          <description>The sPGA was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA was a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling . Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3). A lower sPGA score was associated with less severe disease.</description>

        <title>Extension Study: Percent Change in PASI Score at Week 32</title>
        <description>The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling were scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions was scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) was multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. The values for each anatomic region were summed to yield the PASI score</description>

          <title>Extension Study: Percent Change in PASI Score at Week 32</title>
          <description>The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling were scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions was scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) was multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. The values for each anatomic region were summed to yield the PASI score</description>

        <title>Extension Study: Shift Change (1 or More Points on a 0 to 5 Point Scale) in Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) at Week 32</title>
        <description>Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the subject and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 32</time_frame>
        <population>The Shift change in sPGA was not defined and analyzed. A response defined as achieving sPGA score 0 or 1 with at least 2 points reduction from baseline was a more meaningful clinical endpoint. See pre-specified outcome measures.</population>

        <description>Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the subject and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 40</time_frame>
        <population>The Shift change in sPGA was not defined and analyzed. A response defined as achieving sPGA score 0 or 1 with at least 2 points reduction from baseline was a more meaningful clinical endpoint. See pre-specified outcome measures.</population>

        <title>Extension Study: Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 32</title>
        <description>The DLQI was a validated, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on subjects’ quality of life, based on recall over the past week. Domains include symptoms, feelings, daily activities, social, leisure, work or studying, personal relationships and treatment. Each question on the extent of the impact of skin disease was answered on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the total DLQI score ranged from 0 to 30. A DLQI score greater than 10 is indicative of severe psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Extension Study: Change From Baseline in the Medical Outcome Study Short Form,SF-36, Version 2; Mental Component Summary Score at Week 32</title>
        <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations–physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations–emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) in the Placebo Controlled Phase</title>
        <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) in the Apremilast Exposure Period</title>
        <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

        <description>An AE was any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. An AE is a treatment emergent AE if the AE start date is on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose.</description>

        <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

          <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

        <title>LTE Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 50% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score at 2 Years</title>
        <description>PASI-50 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

          <description>PASI-90 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 90% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 76 of the long-term extension study. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

          <title>LTE Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 90% Improvement (Response) in the PASI Score at 4 Years</title>
          <description>PASI-90 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 90% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 196 of the extension study. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement).</description>

          <title>LTE Study: Percent Change From Baseline in PASI Score at 3 Years</title>
          <description>The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling were scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions was scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) was multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. The values for each anatomic region were summed to yield the PASI score</description>

        <title>Core Study: Shift Change (1 or More Points on a 0 to 5 Point Scale) in Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) at Month 18, and Years 2, 3 and 4</title>
        <description>Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 196</time_frame>
        <population>The Shift change in sPGA was not defined and analyzed. A response defined as achieving sPGA score 0 or 1 with at least 2 points reduction from baseline was a more meaningful clinical endpoint.</population>

        <description>The DLQI was a validated, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on subjects’ quality of life, based on recall over the past week. Domains include symptoms, feelings, daily activities, social, leisure, work or studying, personal relationships and treatment. Each question on the extent of the impact of skin disease was answered on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the total DLQI score ranged from 0 to 30. A DLQI score greater than 10 is indicative of severe psoriasis.</description>

          <description>The DLQI was a validated, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on subjects’ quality of life, based on recall over the past week. Domains include symptoms, feelings, daily activities, social, leisure, work or studying, personal relationships and treatment. Each question on the extent of the impact of skin disease was answered on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the total DLQI score ranged from 0 to 30. A DLQI score greater than 10 is indicative of severe psoriasis.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations–physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations–emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

        <title>LTE Study: Change From Baseline in the Medical Outcome Study Short Form, SF-36, Version 2; Mental Component Summary Score at 2 Years</title>
        <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations–physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations–emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

          <title>LTE Study: Change From Baseline in the Medical Outcome Study Short Form,SF-36, Version 2; Physical Component Summary Score at 18 Months</title>
          <description>The SF-36 was a 36-item general health status instrument and consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations–physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations–emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores were obtained − a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS). Scores from the 8 scales, PCS and MCS were transformed to the norm-based scores using weights from U.S. general population, with 50 as the average and 10 as the standard deviation, higher scores indicating better health. For norm based scores, change from baseline were calculated for the 8 scales and the two summary scales, where change = visit value − baseline value.</description>

        <title>LTE Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of 0 or 1 at 18 Months</title>
        <description>The sPGA was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA was a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling . Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3). A lower sPGA score was associated with less severe disease</description>

            <description>Participants who were initially randomized to placebo BID during the Placebo-controlled Phase (Weeks 0-16) were re-randomized at Week 16 to apremilast 30 mg PO BID and continued dosing with apremilast 30 mg PO BID during the active treatment phase (Weeks 16-24). At Week 24 (End of core study and beginning of extension study), participants were given the option to enroll into the extension study (PSOR-005E NCT00953875) and continued on the same apremilast dosage they had received at the end of the core study (Weeks 24-52). Participants who elected not to enter into the treatment extension study, completed a 4-week observational follow-up phase of the core study.</description>

          <title>LTE Study: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Score of 0 or 1 at 4 Years</title>
          <description>The sPGA was a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the investigator. It does not compare assessments across visits or rely on investigator recall of prior disease severity. The sPGA was a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examined all of the lesions on the participant and assigned a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling . Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equaled the overall sPGA score. Fractional values for the sPGA were rounded to the next highest integer (eg, a score of 3.5 was rounded to 4, 3.4 was rounded to 3). A lower sPGA score was associated with less severe disease</description>
