  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:

          -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy
             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or

          -  Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a post-menopausal status.
             For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, HRT should be discontinued for
             2 weeks and then the subject rescreened, as HRT can suppress FSH.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg for men and ≥ 45 kg for women and body mass index (BMI) within the
             range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer)

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  If heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to
             heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

          -  An average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks/week for men or &gt;7 drinks/week for women. One
             drink is equivalent to (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces (360
             ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  Has a history or regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3
             months prior to screening.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine human chorionic
             gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  History/evidence of symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass
             grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA) or
             any clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  History/evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease.

          -  History of significant renal or hepatic diseases.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Serum creatinine values greater than the upper limit of normal. A single repeat is
             allowed for eligibility determination.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.

          -  ECG criteria outside protocol limits.
