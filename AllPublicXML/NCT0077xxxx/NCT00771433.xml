      RATIONALE: G-CSF may prevent or reduce febrile neutropenia in women receiving chemotherapy
      for breast cancer. It is not yet known which G-CSF regimen is more effective in preventing
      neutropenia.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well G-CSF works in preventing neutropenia in
      women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of filgrastim (G-CSF) in preventing hematological toxicity in
           women with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare actual vs theoretical dose intensity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (&lt; 65 years vs
      â‰¥ 65 years) and prior chemotherapy (adjuvant vs neoadjuvant). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      groups.

        -  Group 1: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 6-11
           of each course of chemotherapy as primary prophylaxis. Chemotherapy courses repeat every
           three weeks for 3-6 courses.

        -  Group 2: Patients receive G-CSF SC once daily on days 6-11 of each course of
           chemotherapy as primary prophylaxis. Chemotherapy courses repeat every three weeks for
           3-6 courses. Patients may also receive secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF if they
           experience an episode of neutropenia.
