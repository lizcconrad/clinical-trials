      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of KW-2449 in people with acute myelogenous leukemia
      who are not candidates for approved therapy. As well, the study will determine the response
      rate to KW-2449.

      Phase 1: To determine the maximum tolerated daily dose (MTDD) of KW 2449 when administered to
      subjects with AML who are not candidates for approved therapy.

      This was originally a Phase 1/Phase 2 study. However, a tolerable dose that had the potential
      for efficacy could not be identified in Phase 1. Therefore, Phase 2 was never conducted.

         17. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding; Pregnant women are excluded from

             whether KW-2449 passes into human breast milk. Nursing mothers should not use KW-2449.

         18. Male or female subjects of childbearing potential, unwilling to use an approved,
             effective means of contraception in accordance with the institution's standards;
             Pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving KW 2449 and in female partners of men
             receiving KW-2449. All subjects receiving KW-2449 should implement appropriate
             contraceptive methods.

         19. Known current drug or alcohol abuse;

         20. Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may compromise the safety of the subject during the study, affect the
             subject's ability to complete the study, or interfere with interpretation of study
             results;

         21. Subject is judged by the Investigator to be inappropriate for study participation for
             any reason, including an inability to communicate or cooperate with the Investigator;

         22. Use of hematopoietic growth factors (i.e., such as erythropoietin or darbepoetin alfa,
             filgrastim [granulocyte colony-stimulating factor {G-CSF}], sargramostim
             [granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor {GM-CSF}], or thrombopoietic agents)
             within 14 days preceding the first dose of KW-2449; or

         23. Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) or aldehyde oxidase (AOX) inhibitors within 7 days
             preceding the first dose KW-2449.
