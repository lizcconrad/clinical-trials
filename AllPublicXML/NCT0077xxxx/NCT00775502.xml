  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the ability of a specially designed monoclonal antibody to destroy
      multiple myeloma cells. This antibody is unique in its ability to promote the death of
      multiple myeloma cells by processes known as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
      (ADCC)and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The study is designed to determine both
      the optimal dose of the antibody to destroy multiple myeloma cells and frequency of dosing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BIW-8962 is a monoclonal antibody which targets the GM-2 ganglioside which is expressed at
      high levels on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. This is a Phase 1/2 study design. The
      Phase 1 component will establish the active biologic dose (ABD) or the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) as well as the appropriate dosing frequency based on the pharmacokinetics of the
      antibody and approximately 45 subjects will be enrolled in this part of the study. The
      initial dosing frequency will be every two weeks and the doses to be tested will range from
      0.03 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. Once the recommended Phase 2 dose and frequency have been established
      in Phase 1, the efficacy of the drug will be investigated in approximately 35 subjects in
      Phase 2.

      The study did not proceed beyond the Phase 1a portion.

      On 30 Nov 2010, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma, Inc. (KKP) notified Investigators of the decision
      to terminate BIW-8962-001 due to a lack of efficacy in Multiple Myeloma.

      The Phase 1 Part B and the Phase 2 components of the study were not conducted. The study was
      terminated and summarized in an abbreviated clinical study report (submitted 26 June 2012;
      SN045). Kyowa Kirin Pharma has no current plans to pursue the use of BIW8962 in multiple
      myeloma.
