  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare pioglitazone and metformin combination therapy, twice
      daily (BID), to glimepiride and metformin combination therapy for treating diabetic subjects
      with dyslipidemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is a major endocrinopathy preceding the development of hyperglycemia,
      diabetic dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. The most common pattern
      of dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes are elevated triglyceride levels, decreased
      hih-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a predominance of small dense low-density lipoprotein
      particles. Each of these dyslipidemia features is associated with an increased risk of
      cardiovascular events.

      Pioglitazone and Metformin are established drugs which can be used for the treatment of type
      2 diabetes. This study will investigate the effects of treatment with fixed
      Pioglitazone/Metformin combination therapy of Metformin and Glimepiride in
      Metformin-pretreated type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia.

      Total participation time in this study is anticipated to be approximately 24 weeks.
