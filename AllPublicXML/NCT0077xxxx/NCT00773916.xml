  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of adverse environmental factors,
      parental psychopathology, family functioning and genetic factors and the response to
      methylphenidate treatment in children and adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
      Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic disorder, with a worldwide
      estimated prevalence of 5,29%. It is associated with a high risk of functional impairment in
      many aspects of the patient´s life, such as academic achievements, peers relationships and
      physical injuries. There are few studies assessing predictive factors of clinical response to
      treatment. Different patterns of family functioning, such as high family conflict and low
      family cohesion might be associated with a poor treatment response, possibly mediating the
      effects of higher severity af the disorder and/or higher prevalence of comorbidity. Parental
      psychopathology has been associated with a poorer prognosis and is related with family
      functioning. Adverse social factors have long been studied and are associated with an
      increased risk for general mental disease, including ADHD, as well as a poorer prognosis.
      Different genetic factors have been studied and associated with different aspects of the
      disorder and different clinical responses to treatments. There are no studies evaluating how
      those factors interact with each other in a Brazilian population.
