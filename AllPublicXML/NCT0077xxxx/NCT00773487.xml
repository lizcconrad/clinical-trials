  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the effects of Diesel particles on the
      allergic inflammation in the airways of asthmatic patients.

    <textblock>
      A first bronchoscopy will be performed with a baseline bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and
      epithelial brushes followed by a segmental instillation of allergen (grass mix or house dust
      mite) alone, in combination with Diesel particles, further in combination with Diesel
      particles without organic compounds and saline as control into four different lung segments.
      After 24 hours, during a second bronchoscopy, BAL samples will be collected in these
      challenged segments in order to obtain cells and lavage fluid for cell biological and
      immunological analysis.

             guidelines {Bateman, 2008 34 /id}

          -  Age 18-55 years

          -  Nonsmokers with a history of less than 1 packyear having been nonsmokers for at least
             the last five years

          -  FEV1 &gt;= 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC &gt;= 70 %

          -  Positive skin prick test for grass mix or D. pteronyssinus at or within 12 months
             prior to the screening visit

          -  Positive response to inhaled methacholine (&lt;= 8mg/ml)

          -  Positive response to an incremental inhaled allergen challenge with house dust mite
             allergen or grass pollen allergen

          -  Available to complete all study measurements

        Women will be considered for inclusion if they are:

          -  Not pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test, and not nursing

          -  Of non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is pre-menarchial or post-menopausal, with documented proof
             of hysterectomy or tubal ligation, or meet clinical criteria for menopause and has
             been amenorrhoeic for more than 1 year prior to the screening visit)

          -  Of childbearing potential and using a highly effective method of contraception during
             the entire study (vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence - the lifestyle of the
             female should be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse from two
             weeks prior to the study until at least 72 hours after the end of the study -,
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of upper or lower respiratory tract infection four weeks prior to the informed
             consent visit

          -  Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the outcome
             of this study. These diseases include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease,
             malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological disease, neurological
             disease, psychiatric disease, endocrine disease, infectious disease, inflammatory
             disease, or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to chronic bronchitis,
             emphysema, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis).

          -  Clinically significant pathological findings in safety laboratory tests

          -  Regular intake of any medication other than short acting inhaled beta agonists,
             paracetamol for pain relief, birth control medication, hormonal replacement therapy,
             dietary and vitamin supplements

          -  Specific Immunotherapy (SIT) within two years prior to the study

          -  Use of anti-inflammatory medication including systemic or inhaled corticosteroid
             within the last four weeks

          -  Any history of life-threatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required
             intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures.

          -  Suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of the medication in line with
             bronchoscopy (bronchodilators, sedatives and local anesthetics)

          -  Conditions or factors, which would make the subject unlikely to be able to undergo
             bronchoscopy or incremental allergen challenge

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and
             study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial 30 days prior to enrolment

          -  Segmental allergen challenge 3 months prior to treatment

          -  Risk of non-compliance with study procedures
