    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter Phase II study evaluating folinic acid +
      fluorouracil + irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus cetuximab (Erbitux) or folinic acid + fluorouracil +
      oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) plus cetuximab as first-line therapy of patients with KRAS wild-type
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Only subjects with k-ras oncogene (KRAS) wild-type tumors are eligible. Efficacy will be
      assessed every 8 weeks. Treatment will be continued until progressive disease or unacceptable
      adverse events occur. After the end of study treatment, information on further anticancer
      treatment and survival will be collected every 3 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Best Overall Confirmed Response Rate (BORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the trial until disease progression, death or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first subject recruited until data cut-off date (31 May 2012)</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with BORR (confirmed complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.0) criteria. As per RECIST v 1.0 criteria for target lesions and assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): CR = disappearance of all target lesions; PR = at least 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Response rate will be assessed every 8 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the trial until disease progression, death or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first subject recruited and until data cut-off date (31 March 2014)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS time was defined as the time from first administration of study drug until first observation of disease progression or death when death occurs within 90 days of the last tumor assessment or first study drug dose whichever occurred.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the trial until disease progression, death or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first subject recruited and until data cut-off date (31 March 2014)</time_frame>
    <description>OS time was defined as the time from first administration of study drug until date of death, assessed up to 5 years. OS time was censored if the subject was found to be alive on the last date of the assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation and TEAEs Leading to Death</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the trial until disease progression, death or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first subject recruited and until data cut-off date (31 March 2014)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <description>Response rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with BORR (confirmed complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.0) criteria. As per RECIST v 1.0 criteria for target lesions and assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): CR = disappearance of all target lesions; PR = at least 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Response rate will be assessed every 8 weeks.</description>
