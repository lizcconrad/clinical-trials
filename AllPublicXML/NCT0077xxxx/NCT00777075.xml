      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the treatment with L-arginine leads to an
      improvement of erectile dysfunction in patients with erectile dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common medical disorder often affecting the aging male. Nitric
      oxide (NO) is a physiological signal essential to penile erection. NO synthase (NOS)
      catalyzes the production of NO from L-arginine. ADMA, a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase
      increases with age and many disorders that reduce NO in the erectile tissue are commonly
      associated with ED. Although new pharmacological strategies have been identified for medical
      treatment of ED, patients often seek alternative therapies for cost or side effect reasons.

      The aim of the present study is to determine the efficacy of orally administered L-arginine
      on ED not caused by established organic disease.

             before the beginning of the drug administration.

          -  The hormonal status including dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), Prolactin and
             Testosteron of each patient had to be within the normal range. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with primary erectile dysfunction, congenital anomalies, Diabetes mellitus,
