    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial assessing the benefit of cesarean wound drainage in pregnant
      women at increased risk of hemorrhage. The pregnant women at increased risk of hemorrhage
      were randomised in two groups. In one group 2 wound drainages were placed during the cesarean
      section, in the other group none. Outcome measures were difference between preoperative and
      postoperative hemoglobin, postoperative fever, cumulative opiate dose adjusted to body
      weight, length of stay and operation time. It is postulated that the pregnant women with
      increased risk of hemorrhage do not profit from the routine placement of wound drainages.
