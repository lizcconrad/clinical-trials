      This study compared the relative bioavailability (rate and extent of absorption) of the test
      Gabapentin tablets 800 mg by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited to the reference Neurontin ® 800 mg
      tablets of Parke Davis Pharmaceuticals Ltd., distributed by Parke Davis, division of
      Warner-Lambert Co. in 28 healthy, adult subjects (21 males and 7 females) under fasting
      conditions using randomized, two-way crossover design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single oral dose of the test or reference product was administered to the volunteers on two
      separate occasions under fasting conditions with at least a 7 day washout between doses. Food
      and fluid intake were controlled during each confinement period.

      A total of twenty eight (28) healthy subjects (21 males and 7 females) were enrolled in the
      study of which twenty seven (27) subjects completed the study.
