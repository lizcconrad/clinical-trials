      This study will compare high intensity focused ultrasound to standard brachytherapy in the
      treatment of primary, organ confined prostate cancer.

      The proposed study is a prospective, non-randomized concurrently controlled study. The active
      treatment arm uses the HIFU procedure with the Sonablate device. The control arm uses the
      brachytherapy procedure. The safety and effectiveness of the Sonablate arm will be compared
      with the brachytherapy arm. The control arm of the study will be conducted at clinical sites
      different from the Sonablate arm.
