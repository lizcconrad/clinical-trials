      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate efficacy, safety and clinical benefit of
      Trazodone Contramid® OAD (Once A Day) in the treatment of Unipolar Major Depressive Disorder
      (MDD).

    <textblock>
      This two-arm, multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-design
      study consisted of a baseline phase (screening and wash-out) and a double-blind randomized
      phase (randomization to Trazodone Contramid® OAD or placebo). The total study duration
      including wash-out of prohibited medications was approximately 11 weeks; the total duration
      of the randomized phase was 8 weeks (titration: 2 weeks + treatment: 6 weeks).

    <measure>Change in Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) Total Score From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 items [HAMD-17] is a 17-item scale that evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and co-morbid anxiety symptoms. The 17 items are rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3-point (0-2) scale. In general, the 5 point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=doubtful to mild; 2=mild to moderate; 3=moderate to severe; 4=very severe. The 3-point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=probable or mild; 2=definite. The total HAMD-17score ranges from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill).</description>

          <description>Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder who were randomized to Trazodone Contramid OAD. Dose was titrated to each subject optimal dose every 3 to 4 days by 75 mg increments from a starting dose of 150 mg to a maximum daily dose of 375 mg. At each dosing step, if a dose was not well tolerated after 2 days, subjects had the option to decrease to the previous dose. Patients then continued six weeks of treatment; further dose adjustments were allowed based on efficacy and tolerability.</description>

        <title>Change in Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) Total Score From Baseline</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 items [HAMD-17] is a 17-item scale that evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and co-morbid anxiety symptoms. The 17 items are rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3-point (0-2) scale. In general, the 5 point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=doubtful to mild; 2=mild to moderate; 3=moderate to severe; 4=very severe. The 3-point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=probable or mild; 2=definite. The total HAMD-17score ranges from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill).</description>

        <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10 item clinician-administered depression rating scale. The 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts) are rated on a scale ranging from 0 (low severity/difficulty) to 6 (high severity/difficulty) with anchors at 2-point intervals. The overall total score range is from 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms).</description>

At each dosing step, if a dose was not well tolerated after 2 days, subjects had the option to decrease to the previous dose.

          <description>Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder who were randomized to Trazodone Contramid OAD. Dose was titrated to each subject optimal dose every 3 to 4 days by 75 mg increments from a starting dose of 150 mg to a maximum daily dose of 375 mg. At each dosing step, if a dose was not well tolerated after 2 days, subjects had the option to decrease to the previous dose. Patients then continued six weeks of treatment; further dose adjustments were allowed based on efficacy and tolerability.</description>
