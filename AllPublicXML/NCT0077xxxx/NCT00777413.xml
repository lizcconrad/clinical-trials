    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the bioequivalence of Minocycline formulations
      after administration of single doses to normal healthy subjects under fed conditions. These
      data were to be evaluated statistically to determine if the products meet bioequivalence
      criteria.

      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioequivalence study on minocycline comparing
      minocycline 100mg tablets of Ranbaxy with Minocin 100mg capsules of in healthy, adult, human,
      subjects under fed conditions.

      A total of 24 non-smoking subjects (17 men and 7 women) were included in this study, of which
