      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as cyclophosphamide and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. Giving rituximab together with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and
      prednisone may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving rituximab together with
      cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and prednisone works as first-line therapy in treating patients
      with stage III or stage IV follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes
           on day 1, bortezomib IV on days 1 and 8, and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-5.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment
           repeats every 6 months for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <description>Rate of overall response (CR, CRu, PR) to protocol therapy according to International Workshop Criteria (IWC):
Complete Response (CR) includes complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy, and normalization of those biochemical abnormalities definitely assignable to NHL;
Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRu) includes above CR criteria but a residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters (SPD), or indeterminate bone marrow;
Partial Response (PR) includes &gt;= 50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase in size of other nodes, liver or spleen.</description>

    <description>Progression free-survival will be assessed according to according to the International Workshop Criteria (IWC). Progression-free survival will be measured as the time from date of enrollment to relapse, progression or death due to follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), whichever occurs first.

        <description>Rate of overall response (CR, CRu, PR) to protocol therapy according to International Workshop Criteria (IWC):
Complete Response (CR) includes complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy, and normalization of those biochemical abnormalities definitely assignable to NHL;
Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRu) includes above CR criteria but a residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters (SPD), or indeterminate bone marrow;
Partial Response (PR) includes &gt;= 50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase in size of other nodes, liver or spleen.</description>
