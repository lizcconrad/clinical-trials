  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in mechanical intervention (PCI) and anticoagulation therapy have been the
      cornerstone of treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. However, the large
      diversity of approaches to anticoagulation during PCI introduces gaps in knowledge regarding
      management of cardiac patients. As such, we have initiated a national PCI registry to
      elucidate anticoagulant choice, dosing strategies, case selection dynamics, and clinical
      outcomes in the Canadian health care environment.
