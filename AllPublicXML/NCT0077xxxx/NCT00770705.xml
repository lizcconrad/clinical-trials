      Phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker, may prove beneficial to infants
      and children with congenital heart disease undergoing open cardiac repair, due to a theoretic
      benefits of a uniform and smooth reduction in systemic vascular resistance in the
      perioperative period. Vasodilation allows for low pressure, high flow systemic perfusion
      while on cardiopulmonary bypass. Support for the use of phenoxybenzamine in humans has been
      documented in several studies involving the perioperative management of both adults and
      children requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, and in management of patients with
      pheochromocytoma. 1-7 Phenoxybenzamine has been associated with more uniform body cooling and
      rewarming, and improved tissue perfusion during bypass.8 It is also known to increase cardiac
      output, stroke volume, and renal blood flow when given intravenously. 9 Specifically in
      pediatric open heart surgery, the combined use of phenoxybenzamine and dopamine provided a
      stable hemodynamic condition without a high total peripheral vascular resistance and
      stimulated postoperative diuresis. 9 Afterload reduction with parenteral phenoxybenzamine in
      neonates undergoing the Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome is associated
      with improved systemic oxygen delivery and stabilization of systemic vascular resistance.10
      Furthermore, a strategy of reducing afterload with phenoxybenzamine and stabilizing the
      pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in this select population of patients has also been shown to
      improve operative survival. 11 We hypothesize that phenoxybenzamine will reduce afterload on
      the systemic ventricle in our selected patient population, thereby improving ventricular
      performance and decreasing the risks of pulmonary to systemic flow imbalance associated with
      current short-acting vasodilator therapy. We will plan to evaluate both physiologic variables
      as well as surgical outcomes in the selected study population.

      II. Background

        1. Description of the Problem One of the effects of cardiac operations involving
           cardiopulmonary bypass is reversible myocardial dysfunction lasting a number of days
           postoperatively. Typically this period of myocardial dysfunction is treated with
           vasoactive drugs aimed at improving contractility and reducing afterload. Problems exist
           with the current vasodilator therapy, including: variable response, inadequate response,
           complications of delivery mechanism with the potential for swings in blood pressure and
           ongoing dose adjustments. These are necessary due to the patients' autonomic nervous
           system reactivity changes during the post-cardiopulmonary bypass period. Evidence to
           support therapies targeting control of systemic vascular resistance include randomized
           controlled studies looking at the outcome of high risk neonates undergoing open cardiac
           procedures with very high dose synthetic narcotic anesthesia. This is known to reduce
           sympathetic nervous system activity. There exist numerous, uncontrolled but widely
           accepted, studies documenting the adjunctive use of vasodilators such as sodium
           nitroprusside, nitroglycerin and alpha-adrenergic blockers including phenoxybenzamine in
           the perioperative period. The results of all of these studies point towards a salutatory
           effect of measures to control vasoconstrictor responses on blood flow to the organs at
           risk, primarily the organs in the splenic circulation: the liver, kidneys, and
           intestines. Ischemia to these organs is responsible for a significant amount of
           morbidity in the post-bypass period including late onset sepsis and renal dysfunction.
           In addition, after myocardial injury the natural vasoconstrictor responses that
           mammalian organisms have to falling cardiac output are counterproductive and may
           initiate a cascade of responses, necessitating medical interventions culminating in
           overt myocardial pump failure. This then can lead to patient death or need for
           institution of extracorporeal circulatory support after the initial cardiopulmonary
           bypass period.

        2. Physiologic Role of Phenoxybenzamine Numerous reports have demonstrated that with nearly
           complete blockage of alpha-adrenergic receptors (i.e. phenoxybenzamine) that both
           infusions of exogenous catecholamines and the neural release of endogenous
           catecholamines result not in vasoconstrictor responses but instead augmented myocardial
           contractility without increases in afterload. While medical interventions to effect
           circulatory responses are already in use commonly in the perioperative period, including
           synthetic narcotic analgesia and the use of short-acting vasodilator agents, these
           measures alone have not been universally effective in preventing the sort of hemodynamic
           deterioration described above. Therefore, we propose to use phenoxybenzamine, a drug
           which irreversibly binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors and some dopamine receptors, as
           an adjunct to the management of the perioperative vascular tone abnormalities in high
           risk infants and children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for open heart procedures.

        3. Existing pharmacologic and clinical data Phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline: Wellspring
           Pharmaceutical Corporation, Bradenton, FL) is a haloalkylamine that irreversibly blocks
           both α-1 and α-2 adrenergic receptors. The drug exhibits a slightly higher affinity for
           the α-1 receptor. 12 There exists a body of literature concerning intravenous
           administration of phenoxybenzamine in the setting of congenital heart disease surgery,
           specifically in the Norwood repair for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The use of
           phenoxybenzamine during cardiac surgery has been demonstrated to facilitate higher pump
           flow rates during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and is associated with attenuation of
           postoperative metabolic acidosis. 13 Specifically, phenoxybenzamine has been shown to be
           more effective than sodium nitroprusside in improving tissue perfusion postbypass (as
           demonstrated by a comparison of rewarming characteristics), with lower base deficits in
           patients treated with phenoxybenzamine. 14 Indeed, to date there are many congenital
           heart disease surgical centers in the United States who, prior to the Norwood procedure,
           administer 0.25 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine at the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass in
           an attempt to optimize systemic organ perfusion in the perioperative period. Such a
           protocol, at this dose specifically, has been described to improve systemic oxygen
           delivery in patients undergoing the Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart
           syndrome, as well as an improvement in survival to future surgical palliations. 10

      III. Aims and Objectives

      Our general hypothesis is that a blockade of vasoconstrictor responses in the period around
      cardiopulmonary bypass will result in better organ preservation and improvement in cardiac
      output postoperatively. More specifically, as serum lactate serves as a surrogate for
      demonstrating the adequacy of end organ perfusion, we will utilize this continuous variable
      as our primary endpoint for the purposes of this protocol. Our hypothesis is that the use of
      phenoxybenzamine in this select population will reduce initial postoperative lactate levels
      by a clinically-relevant level of 25%, relative to historical controls. Secondary endpoints
      evaluated as well will include utilization of inotropic support, duration of hospitalization,
      and time to resolution of postoperative lactic acidosis. Both physiologic and outcome
      variables will be examined and compared to a matched cohort of patients drawn from our recent
      experience without the use of phenoxybenzamine.

      IV. Patient Selection and Clinical Management

      Patient selection will be determined by an assessment of the risk of systemic ventricular
      dysfunction following open cardiac repair in a population of infants undergoing stage I
      palliation (Norwood procedure) for the diagnosis of either hypoplastic left heart syndrome or
      similar left-sided obstructive lesions in the setting of single-ventricle physiology.
      Eligible neonates and infants include those aged 0 days to 6 months. These patients will be
      evaluated on an individual basis and the decision to give phenoxybenzamine would be
      determined by the attending surgeon, anesthesiologist, and cardiologist. No other change in
      the patients' perioperative management will occur. Efficacy will be assessed by evaluating
      the need for vasodilators and inotropic agents, as well as by evaluating the effects of
      alpha-blockade on the clinical course and hemodynamics of the patient. Comparison to a
      matched historical cohort of patients not receiving the drug will be performed. Likewise, the
      historical cohort population to be included in this population include all infants who have
      undergone the Norwood procedure for either hypoplastic left heart syndrome or those with a
      similar univentricular lesion requiring aortic arch reconstruction. Aside from the importance
      of meeting protocol inclusion criteria, there are no specific criteria to exclude subjects

      V. Drug Administration and Safety Monitoring

      Parenteral phenoxybenzamine requires an IND for human administration, which has been
      submitted to the FDA and is pending (see attached). The only significant risk of parenteral
      phenoxybenzamine has been excessive alpha-adrenergic blockade resulting in diastolic
      hypotension. This problem has been treated with intravenous adrenergic support in the form of
      norepinephrine or vasopressin. Precautions in place during the use of phenoxybenzamine will
      include physician presence during administration, invasive arterial blood pressure
      monitoring, and inotropic agents available for immediate use. This drug will be obtained from
      WellSpring Pharmaceuticals and stored in the Investigational Drug Pharmacy.

      The drug will be administered in the operating room. After induction of anesthesia and the
      pIacement of appropriate cardiovascular monitoring lines, an initial loading dose of 0.25
      mg/kg will be administered intravenously immediately prior to cardiopulmonary bypass.For up
      to 72 hours postoperatively, 0.25 mg/kg/day will be administered Based on published
      pharmacokinetic data these doses should block 90 -95% of alpha-peripheral receptors with a
      half life of 24 - 36 hours for regeneration. This period of time corresponds nicely with the
      period of highest hemodynamic vulnerability of this patient population. No alteration in
      usual perioperative monitoring will occur solely to allow drug administration. Monitoring of
      anesthesia, preload, afterload, contractility, and cardiac output will be maintained
      throughout the period of administration and recovery in ways which are at present, performed
      in this patient population: invasive transthoracic cardiac lines, echocardiography, venous
      and systemic oximetry, and analysis of acid/base abnormalities. Secondary end-organ function
      will be monitored including kidneys (urine output, creatinine,) and brain (cerebral
      oximetry).

      Potential toxicity of the drug is related to the effects of excessive vasodilatation.
      Subjects will be monitored for toxicity through both frequent physical examination as well as
      continuous blood pressure monitoring in the immediate postoperative period. The ultimate
      rescue therapy for excessive vasodilation and hypotension would be the institution of high
      flow extracorporeal circulation, which we would be in a position to provide in a most timely
      fashion in both the operating room and intensive care unit. Pharmacologic management to
      counteract adverse effects of alpha-adrenergic blockade would be norepinephrine, administered
      in the dose 0.01-0.05 mcglkglmin. Epinephrine may be relatively contraindicated in this
      setting because beta-adrenergic receptors are left unopposed. Therefore, drugs that stimulate
      both types of receptors (e.g., epinephrine) may produce an exaggerated hypotensive response
      and tachycardia. Those subjects experiencing hypotension refractory to conventional
      postoperative management, who are experiencing end-organ dysfunction related to hypotension,
      or who require norepinephrine reversal of the previous dose of phenoxybenzamine would be
      strongly considered for withdrawal from the study.

      Adverse reactions reported in oral administration include nasal congestion, mycosis,
      tachycardia, drowsiness and fatigue. This drug has been FDA approved for oral administration
      in treatment of pheochromocytoma to control episodes of hypertension and sweating. It has
      also shown efficacy in micturition disorders resulting from neurogenic bladder, functional
      outlet obstruction and partial prosthetic obstruction.

      Subjects will be followed throughout their hospital course until the time of discharge home.
      There will be no further follow up asked of subjects related to this study. Historical cohort
      analysis will include analysis of clinically-relevant endpoints as noted below, as well as
      laboratory values and vital signs during the perioperative period and until time of discharge
      home.

      A three-physician panel, comprised of those involved in operative and postoperative care of
      this particular patient population (but not an investigator in this study) will be appointed
      to review subject cases. The panel will meet at 5-subject intervals to review the data and
      safety profile from each case.

      VI. Data Storage, Acquisition, and Analysis An electronic database, which is
      password-protected and available only to the PI and co-investigators will be utilized for the
      purposes of data analysis. A copy of the data acquisition form accompanies this application.
      The data will be destroyed 5 years following completion of the study and analysis of the
      resulting data. Data acquired for the study will be stored in a password-protected database.
      Only the PI and the co-investigators will have access to this password and the database. Upon
      identification of eligible historical cohorts, their charts will be reviewed with pertinent
      data entered in the above-described database. The data of historical cohorts will be
      de-identified as an attempt to maintain confidentiality. Subject ID numbers in the historical
      cohort group will be assigned only to differentiate between subjects for the purpose of data
      analysis, and will not specifically identify subjects.

      Data analysis will include several clinically-relevant endpoints, including overall surgical
      mortality (survival to discharge), time to initial extubation and cessation of mechanical
      ventilation, and length of hospital stay. End-organ function status post cardiopulmonary
      bypass will be assessed by evaluating lab values currently studied, including serum lactate.
      Monitoring of hemodynamic values including blood pressure and left atrial pressure will be
      utilized to indirectly assess cardiac output. Other end organs evaluated will include kidney
      (urine output and other tests of renal function such as creatinine) and brain (clinical
      evaluation and tests ordered as indicated, as well as cerebral oximetry). We will also
      evaluate the need for inotropic and/or vasodilator support (both dose and duration). The
      study will not require additional lab or radiology testing based on patient inclusion. Data
      reviewed from historical cohorts include those as specified in the data collection sheet,
      namely the above-described clinically-relevant endpoints, as well as laboratory values (serum
      lactate, serum creatinine), vital signs (blood pressure, cerebral oximetry, and left atrial
      pressure), evidence of end organ perfusion (urine output), and postoperative inotrope
      requirements.

      As serum lactate serves as a surrogate for demonstrating the adequacy of end organ perfusion,
      we will utilize this continuous variable as our primary endpoint for the purposes of this
      protocol. Our hypothesis is that the use of phenoxybenzamine in this select population will
      reduce initial postoperative lactate levels by a clinically-relevant level of 25%, relative
      to historical controls. Secondary endpoints evaluated as well will include utilization of
      inotropic support, duration of mechanical ventilation and overall hospitalization, and time
      to resolution of postoperative lactic acidosis.

      Recent experience with the Norwood procedure, the conventional palliative surgical therapy
      for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, demonstrated a mean initial serum lactate of 7.3 ± 3.3
      mmol/L in 21 neonates. 15 Assuming a clinically significant reduction by 25% to 5.5 mmol/L
      (at 80% power and an assumed p ≤ 0.05 demonstrating statistical significance), one would
      require a total of 54 study subjects. Given an anticipated surgical volume of approximately
      20 Norwood procedures annually, along with a 15% dropout or refusal rate, we would expect to
      accrue a total required volume of 62 subjects in approximately 3 years. We will also compare
      data with data that already exists within our cardiac registry for further evaluation.

      VII. Consent and Peer Judgement

      The drug will not be administered without the knowledge of attending surgeon and
      anesthesiologist and after discussion with the perfusionists in order to ensure safety and
      advisability. In the postoperative period the drug will not be administered without
      discussion with all relevant participants in the patient's postoperative care. Informed
      consent will be obtained from the patients family and documented in the chart prior to
      administration of the drug. Because this drug is not yet FDA approved in the United States,
      specific consent is necessary. An investigational new drug application has been filed and
      permission from the FDA is pending. Significant adverse effects will be reported to the Food
      and Drug Administration and to the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board Health
      Sciences Committee within 24 hours, and annual status reports will be filed with Food and
      Drug Administration according to their policies.
