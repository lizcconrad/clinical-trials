  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 1 year review of all patients who had surgery to correct pelvic organ
      prolapse (i.e. cystocele, rectocele, enterocele) using the Avaulta synthetic mesh kit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort analysis of all patients who experienced vaginal prolapse and
      were operated on with the Avaulta synthetic vaginal mesh &quot;kit&quot; from January 2006 to April
      2007. The Avaulta synthetic mesh is composed of polypropylene which is a monofilament. The
      objective of this trial is to compare patients objectively and subjectively at least one year
      after placement of the Avaulta synthetic vaginal mesh in terms of prolapse symptoms.

      This data will be compared to pre-operative data already collected for these patients as a
      part of their routine surgical work-up. Mesh-related complications will be quantified,
      including erosions, new-onset pain, and infections. Success and anatomic recurrence rates
      will be recorded as well
