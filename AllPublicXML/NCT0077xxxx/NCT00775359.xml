      This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover, relative bioavailability
      study performed on 24 healthy adult male and female volunteers A total of 23 subjects (16
      males and 7 females) completed the clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were
      housed from the evening before dosing until after the 24-hour blood draw. Subjects returned
      for all subsequent blood draws. Doses were separated by a washout period of 10 days.

      Of the 24 healthy adult male and female volunteers enrolled in the study, 23 subjects (16
      males and 7 females) completed the clinical phase of the study. Subject No. 10 failed to
      return for Period 2 check-in.
