  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well this combination of chemotherapy drugs
      works with bevacizumab in eliminating primary tumor in the breast prior to
      surgery(pathological complete response or pCR in the breast). Bevacizumab is a drug that
      works by blocking new blood vessel formation by the tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy and
      bevacizumab before surgery may allow for lesser amount of breast tissue to be removed. To be
      able to predict in the future which patients are more likely to get pCR to this drug
      combination, specialized tests on tumor tissue will be performed.
