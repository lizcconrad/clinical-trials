  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is a cutaneous malignancy that has the potential for local (skin) and regional
      (lymph node) recurrence. These recurrences may be difficult to detect in their earliest
      stages. We are attempting to use novel form of skin imaging that uses ultrasound combined
      with laser to identify these recurrences early, when they may be most amenable to treatment.
      This imaging will detect melanoma pigment below the surface of the skin and in the draining
      lymph nodes, as well as new blood vessel formation that occurs with these loco-regional
      metastases.
