    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, open-label, 2-way cross-over study, comparing desloratadine RediTab
      2.5 mg to a marketed chewable antihistamine oral medication (Zyrtec® 5 mg

      Chewable Tablet). Subject preference for one product or the other was determined.
      Acceptability of product attributes (Taste and Feeling in the Mouth) was rated using a
      &quot;smile&quot; face scale.
