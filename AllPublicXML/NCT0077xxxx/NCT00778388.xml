      The objective is to confirm the optimal dose of IC43 in regard to immunogenicity, safety and
      tolerability.

      The study will be designed as a multi‐center, observer‐blinded, randomized, placebocontrolled
      phase 1 study in healthy adult subjects of 18 to 65 years of age. A total of 160 healthy male
      and female subjects is planned to be enrolled and randomized in five groups receiving
      different dosages and formulations of IC43 or placebo.

IC43 vaccine will be administered intramuscularly during study visit 0 and 7 at three different doses, adjuvanted with Al(OH)3, or in one dose without Al(OH)3. Injection volumes will be 0.5 mL, 1 mL or 2 mL. Placebo will be administered intramuscularly at a dosage of 1 mL.</description>

          -  Active or passive vaccination 4 weeks before and during the entire study protocol

          -  Use of any other investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine in addition to the
             study vaccine during the study period or within 30 days preceding the first dose of
             study vaccine

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to one of the components of the vaccine

          -  Clinically significant diseases as judged by the investigator

          -  Immunodeficiency due to immunosuppressive therapy
