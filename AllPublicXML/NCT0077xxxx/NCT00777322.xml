  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether excimer laser corneal surface ablation
      (T−Cat) can be safely combined with simultaneous corneal collagen cross−linking treatment to
      produce an improved and stable corneal profile in the treatment of keratoconus.

      Theoretical framework:

      Corneal ectasia is a relative weakness in the structure of the cornea, which produces a
      progressive change in its shape with resultant visual distortion.

      Excimer laser surface ablation can be used to re−shape the corneal profile. When the corneal
      shape is very irregular, corneal topography data gives the best information as to how to
      re−shape the cornea into a normal profile, and this Topography−Computer Assisted Treatment
      (T−Cat) will be used to modulate the surface corneal shape.

      It is known that collagen cross−linking in the cornea occurs naturally with age, and in
      diabetes, both of which seem to prevent progressive ectasia. Corneal collagen cross−linking
      with riboflavin has been shown to stabilize the cornea in keratoconus, and prevents
      progression of the disease. If cross−linking is performed at that moment that the cornea has
      been re−shaped by T−Cat treatment, it should help prevent the corneal thinning resultant from
      the laser treatment from destabilising the cornea and causing progressive ectasia.

      Purpose:

      To determine whether excimer laser corneal surface ablation (T−Cat) can be safely combined
      with simultaneous corneal collagen cross−linking treatment to produce an improved and stable
      corneal profile.

      Design:

      Prospective, interventional trial.

    <description>Patients with known keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration will be invited to join the study. The study is partly a continuation in the management of patients who have had previous keratophakia, who will have near−normal or supra−physiological levels of corneal thickness. It is also intended for patients with relatively mild keratoconus who have sufficient corneal thickness to allow a limited laser ablation whilst still leaving a residual stromal bed of at least 350μ.</description>

    <intervention_name>Excimer laser ablation, and collagen cross-linking</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgery is performed with topical anaesthesia. The central corneal epithelium is removed. Excimer laser ablation is applied (typically 15−30 seconds). Residual bed thickness is checked with an ultrasonic pachymeter. Topical application of riboflavin 0.1% in dextran is commenced at 5 minute intervals. When an adequate saturation of the anterior chamber with riboflavin has been achieved, cross−linking treatment will proceed. Output from the UV light generating equipment is measured with a UV light meter and set at 3mW/cm². Thirty minutes of treatment is given, interrupted at five minute intervals by the application of more topical riboflavin drops. Finally the eye has a bandage soft contact lens placed, with preservative free topical antibiotic, steroid, and cycloplegic drop application.</description>
