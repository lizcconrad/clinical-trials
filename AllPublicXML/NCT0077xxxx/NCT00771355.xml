    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the findings of the Reflectance Confocal Microscopy when
      performed in cutaneous pigmentary disorders, such as vitiligo, melasma, post-inflammatory
      hyper-pigmentation and hypo-pigmentation. Confocal Microscopy is a recent diagnostic
      technique that has been used for observation of skin conditions that affect the superficial
      layers of the skin.

        Subjects 20-70 years of age with the clinical diagnosis of vitiligo, melasma,
        post-inflammatory hypo or depigmentation or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation will be
        recruited from Dermatology practice at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects 20-70 years of age.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of vitiligo, melasma, post-inflammatory hypo or depigmentation or
             post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

          3. Willing and able to understand and sign informed consent.

          4. Able to complete study and comply with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of topical therapies such as corticosteroids, protopic, hydroquinone and azelaic
             acid within the past 2 months.

          2. Use of light therapy such as narrow-band-UVB, PUVA or laser within the past 2 months.

          3. Intake of medications that can cause pigmentary changes within the past year. Examples
             are:

               -  Antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine)

               -  Chemotherapeutics (bleomycin, busulfan, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, fluorouracil,
                  cyclophosphamide, and carmustine)

               -  Heavy metals (gold, silver, bismuth, and mercury)

               -  Tetracyclines (including minocycline, doxycycline)

               -  Amiodarone

               -  Azidothymidine

               -  Clofazimine

          4. Clinically significant abnormal findings or conditions (other than the pigmentary
             disorder), which might, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, interfere with
             study evaluations or pose a risk to subject safety during the study.

          5. Subjects who are known to be pregnant or planning a pregnancy.
