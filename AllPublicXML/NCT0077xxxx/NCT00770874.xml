  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, multinational, two-arm, parallel randomized Phase 3
      study evaluating the efficacy and safety of S-1+Cisplatin versus single-agent Cisplatin in
      patients with stage IVB, recurrent or persistent carcinoma of the cervix.

    <textblock>
      Japanese phase II study of S-1 in cervical cancer suggested promising response rate and good
      tolerability. Since recommended chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent cervical carcinoma
      is either single-agent Cisplatin or Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, this is
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S-1 in combination with Cisplatin compared
      with single-agent Cisplatin.

    <description>S-1 will be administered orally, twice daily from Day 1 through Day 14 followed by a recovery period from Days 15 through Day 21. Initial dose of S-1 will be determined according to the patient's body surface area (80 to 120 mg/day). On Day 1, Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously (IV). This regimen is to be repeated every 3 weeks.</description>
