      healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fasting condition.

      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, A single oral dose of one Cyclobenzaprine
      hydrochloride 10 mg tablet was administered with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient
      temperature during each period of the study under supervision of a trained Study Personnel.

      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Laboratory parameters of hematology and
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.

      A total of forty (40) subjects were enrolled in the study. Out of which thirty-four (34)
      subjects completed both the periods of the study.
