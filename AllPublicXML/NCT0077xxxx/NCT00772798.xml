      TITLE:A Phase II non-comparative study of paclitaxel plus carboplatin in combination with
      Vorinostat in patients with advanced, recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.
      INDICATION:Second-line treatment of patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial
      ovarian cancer. RATIONALE:Recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer is today an incurable disease.
      The current standard of care consists of systemic chemotherapy using either carboplatin plus
      paclitaxel (in platinum-sensitive patients) or single agent chemotherapy with agents like
      liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, weekly paclitaxel or gemcitabine (platinum non-sensitive
      patients). The outcome for patients with advanced ovarian cancer nevertheless remains
      poor.Preclinical evidence suggests that vorinostat, a potent histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor, may potentiate the antitumor activity of paclitaxel and/or carboplatin. The study
      will assess whether the addition of vorinostat to paclitaxel plus carboplatin is manageable
      and induces reasonable response rates in patients with advanced recurrent, platinum-sensitive
      ovarian cancer. Biomarkers will be collected from both primary tumors and biopsies before and
      after start of treatment with vorinostat.

      DESIGN:Phase II, single-center study. All eligible patients will be treated with intravenous
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus oral vorinostat. Patients will be treated with a maximum of
      6 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.
      Clinical endpoints will include adverse experiences, progression-free survival (PFS) and
      response rate (RR). SAMPLE:Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of
      epithelial ovarian cancer, cancer of the Fallopian tube or primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma.
      All patients will have received first-line therapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Patients
      should be platinum sensitive, defined as recurrence or progression of ovarian cancer, cancer
      of the Fallopian tubes or primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma 6 months or later after the end
      of first-line chemotherapy. Patients to be enrolled on this study must have acceptable
      performance status and acceptable renal and hepatic function, and be free of other serious
      intercurrent illness that could impair their ability to receive protocol therapy. The study
      will include up to 55 assessable patients, of which 20 will provide biomarkers. It is
      estimated that the inclusion period will last approximately 24 months. DOSAGE/DOSAGE FORM,
      ROUTE, AND DOSE REGIMEN Eligible patients will be treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and
      carboplatin AUC5 administered by intravenous infusion (IV) on day 1 of each treatment cycle.
      In addition, all eligible patients will receive treatment with oral vorinostat (400 mg)
      administered once daily by mouth with food on days -4 through 10 of Cycle 1 (25-day treatment
      cycle) and days 1 through 14 of each subsequent 21-day treatment cycle. Patients will receive
      antiemetic therapy according to institutional guidelines as well as premedication with
      dexamethasone, and antihistamines (an H1-receptor antagonist and an H2-receptor antagonist)
      for prevention of the side effects of paclitaxel.
