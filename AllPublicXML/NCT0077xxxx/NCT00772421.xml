  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that a higher proportion of responders to deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) in the anterior nucleus (AN) of the thalamus in refractory epilepsy
      patients in the SANTE study exhibit a recruitment rhythm relative to non-responders.

        The study will enroll the number of patients necessary to achieve the required sample size
        of 18 responders and 18 non-responders at a minimum of six (6) centers participating in the
        U.S. SANTE study.
