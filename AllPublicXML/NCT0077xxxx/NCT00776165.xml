      A Phase III Randomized Controlled Open Label Comparative Multicentric Trial To Compare The
      Safety And Efficacy of Indigenous Recombinant Human Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor
      (rhG-CSF) With Neupogen In Patients on Myelosuppressive Therapy for Non Myeloid Malignancies.

      Adult patients (18 years of age or older) diagnosed as having any malignancy (except myeloid
      malignancy, ECOG status of 0-2 and having a history of experiencing neutropenia (absolute
      neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm3) in a previous chemotherapy cycle and have one more cycle of
      chemotherapy on the same drugs would be recruited into the study.

      Treatment will be initiated not earlier than 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic
      chemotherapy in both groups.

      Group 1: Recombinant Human Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (rhG-CSF)(Shantha)

        -  Dose: 300 mcg/day administered subcutaneous/intravenous/continuous subcutaneous infusion
           for a minimum of 7 days and for a maximum of 14 days or till Neutrophil count of
           10,000/mm3 is reached whichever is earlier Group 2: Neupogen (rhG-CSF)

        -  Dose: 300mcg/day administered subcutaneous/intravenous/continuous subcutaneous infusion
           for a minimum of 7 days and for a maximum of 14 days or till Neutrophil count of
           10,000/mm3 is reached whichever is earlier Primary End Point would be to evaluate the
           percentage of patients developing febrile neutropenia (defined as body temperature ≥
           38.2°C or developing a temperature of &gt; 38°C twice in a 12-hour period and absolute
           neutrophil count &lt; 0.5 x 109/L on the same day of the fever or the day after)in the two
           treatment groups.
