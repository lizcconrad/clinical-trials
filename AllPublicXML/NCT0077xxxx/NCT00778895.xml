  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children younger than 5 years of age are at high risk for severe influenza disease (flu) and
      hospitalization due to flu. Scientists are in the process of re-evaluating the dosing
      initially based on whole virus vaccines to improve their efficacy in infants. In this study,
      we will compare two different dose levels of GSK1557482A flu vaccine. Another already
      approved flu vaccine made by a different company will be used as a control.

    <textblock>
      This is a study of two different dose levels of a new formulation of flu vaccine for the
      2008/2009 flu season using the World Health Organization recommended virus strains. Subjects
      will be randomly put into one of three different groups to receive either one or two doses
      of:

      0.25 mL dose of the new flu vaccine, or 0.5 mL dose of the new flu vaccine or the licensed
      Vaxigrip flu vaccine (control) The parents of the subjects and the study doctor and nurses
      will not know the group of their child until the study is completed.

      The children will be vaccinated with either one dose or two doses depending on whether or not
      they have received a flu vaccine before. The doctor will decide on the schedule for each
      child based on the information provided by the parents. The active phase of the study will
      last approximately two months for children receiving two doses and one month for those
      receiving a single dose. An extended safety follow-up will continue until Study Month 6.

      Two blood samples will be taken from each subject. These will be used to evaluate how well
      the vaccine works in the children and which dose level works best compared to the control.

      The parents will fill in a diary card for four days to record any reactions or symptoms which
      may occur after vaccination. Parents will also keep a record of other symptoms that may occur
      between vaccinations and up to six months after the first vaccination and will keep a record
      of any medication their child takes in this time period.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were differentiated according to priming status. Primed Subjects – subjects who had a prior 2-dose priming influenza immunization received a 1-dose vaccination course in the study. Unprimed Subjects – subjects who had not previously received a complete 2-dose priming influenza immunization received a 2-dose vaccination course in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study comprised an Active phase of approximately 2 months and a post-vaccination 180 day extended safety follow-up period (ESFU phase).
374 subjects out of the 390 who were enrolled in the study were vaccinated. Remaining subjects were not included in the participant flow as started as they failed to meet protocol criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling. Any was defined as any solicited local symptom reported regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = Cried when limb was moved/spontaneously painful. Grade 3 redness and swelling were defined as redness/swelling above 50 millimeters (mm). This primary outcome measure was assessed for Fluviral F1 Group and Fluviral F2 Group respectively as per the study protocol.</description>

Any = Occurrence of any unsolicited symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 = Occurrence of any unsolicited AE that prevented normal, everyday activities. Related = Occurrence of an unsolicited AE assessed by the investigator to be causally related to study vaccination. This primary outcome measure was assessed for Fluviral F1 Group and Fluviral F2 Group respectively as per the study protocol.</description>

          <description>Titers are presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The reference cut-off value was the seropositivity cut-off of 1:10. Antibodies assessed were antibodies against the A/Brisbane (H1N1), A/Uruguay (H3N2) and B/Florida flu strains.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the According-To-Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity which included all vaccinated and eligible subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available and for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination.</population>
