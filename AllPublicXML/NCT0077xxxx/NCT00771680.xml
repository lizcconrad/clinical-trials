    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Europe and Asia. The aim of this observational study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness and the incidence of serious adverse reactions while using
      Levemir®, NovoMix® and/or NovoRapid® in subjects with type 2 diabetes that have not used
      insulin previously under normal clinical practice conditions.
