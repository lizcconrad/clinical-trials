  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the nicotine patch reduces post operative nausea
      and/or vomiting (PONV) among non-smoking patients who are at high risk of PONV.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are certain known risk factors for post-operative nausea and/or vomiting: the use of
      opioids during surgery, female gender, laparoscopic surgery, gynecologic surgery, strabismus
      repair, the use of a general anesthetic, obesity, and non-smoker. Patients with four or more
      of these risk factors have an 80% occurrence rate of post-operative nausea and/or vomiting
      and are classified as &quot;high risk&quot;. It has been shown that those who use tobacco have about a
      50% reduction in post-operative nausea and/or vomiting.
