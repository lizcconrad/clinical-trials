    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study to compare the
      single-dose relative bioavailability of Cefprozil 250 mg/5 mL Oral suspension versus Cefzil
      TM Powder for Oral Suspension (250 mg/5 mL) following one 5 mL dose under fed conditions

      The study was designed to compare the rate and extent of absorption of cefprozil from the
      following products under fed condition:

        1. CEFPROZIL FOR ORAL SUSPENSION USP 250 mg/ 5 mL (Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, India)

        2. Cefzil ® (CEFPROZIL) for oral suspension equivalent to 250mg/5mL anhydrous, cefprozil
           (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company USA) The bioequivalence of these formulations was assessed
           for cefprozil (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, USA)

      Thirty -two subjects (32) were recruited for the study of which 16 were males and 16 were
      females. All of them completed the study
