      The purpose of this study is to assess treatment and outcomes data in patients receiving
      treatment with long-acting injectable risperidone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational (study in which patients/participants are observed) and multicentre
      (at multiple sites) study. This is one-country arm of a multinational study. This study
      consists of 2 years of retrospective (a study in which the patients are identified and then
      documented backward in time and 2 years of prospective (a study in which the patients are
      identified and then followed forward in time for the outcome of the study) study periods
      during which medication utilization review will be done, determining medication usage
      patterns and outcomes associated with the use of risperidone long acting, in clinical
      practice. Usage of risperidone according to label was recommended during the study. The
      planned recruitment period will be 6 months. Retrospective observation will be 2 years for
      hospitalization history and at least 1 year for medication usage. Total duration of
      prospective observation for each patient with a complete follow-up will be 24 months. Data
      collection during the follow up period will be scheduled every 3 months ± 2 weeks. In
      addition, this study is proposed in Belgium to satisfy the demand from Belgian Reimbursement
      Authorities to collect clinical data on the impact of risperidone long acting on treatment
      compliance, number of hospitalizations and potential prevention of relapses. Also, this data
      will provide documentation on switch from oral to parenteral treatment. Data will be pooled
      from different physicians and/or countries. The objectives of this study are: collect
      clinical outcome data at the request of the Belgian Reimbursement Authorities; prospectively
      assess medication usage patterns to document clinical efficacy and long-term treatment
      outcomes of risperidone long acting, in a naturalistic setting; collect retrospective data,
      to compare with risperidone long acting; document reasons for initiating risperidone; collect
      data on switch of treatment to risperidone long acting.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 24 months in Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, (just before the first injection of long-acting injectable risperidone) to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are rated for overall severity of schizophrenia disorder using the CGI scale (7 point scale) in which 1 = Not Ill and 7 = Extremely Severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 24 months in Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This GAF scale rates the functioning of the patient on a scale of 1 - 100 where &quot;1 - 10&quot; is &quot;Persistant danger of severely hurting self or others (eg, recurrent violence) OR persistant inability to maintain personal hygiene OR serious suicidal act with clear expectations of death&quot; and &quot;91- 100&quot; is &quot;Superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his of her positive qualities. No symptoms&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 24 months in clinical deterioration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, in 3-monthly intervals (± 2 weeks) for 24 months and Last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical deterioration is assessed by evaluating presence or absence of deliberate self injury, suicidal or homicidal ideation, violent behaviour, and increased need in levels of care and increase in CGI by 2 points or more. The maintenance of treatment effect is documented by the time to significant deterioration of the psychotic condition. If signs of significant deterioration occurred more than once within each 3 monthly interval, this is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 24 months in assessment of remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical status will be assessed by presence or absence of the following core symptoms: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, mannerisms and posturing, unusual thought content, blunted affect, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation. Score will be given for each symptom as follows: Score 1: Absent, Minimal, Mild; Score 2: Moderate, Moderately severe, Severe, Extreme. Symptomatic remission is defined as a clinical status where for each and every of the symptoms prespecified, a score of 1 can be given for duration of 6 months.</description>
