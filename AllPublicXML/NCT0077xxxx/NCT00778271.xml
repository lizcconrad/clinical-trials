      The objective of this study was to compare the single-dose relative bioavailability of
      Ranbaxy and Parke-Davis (Neurontin®) 400 mg Gabapentin, following administration of a 400 mg
      dose under fasting conditions

      This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover relative bioavailability
      study performed on 24 healthy adult volunteers and 2 alternates. A total of 26 subjects (22
      males and 4 females) completed the clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were
      housed from at least 10 hours before dosing until after the 36-hour blood draw. Both periods
      were separated by a wash out period of 7 days A total of 26 healthy adult volunteers (22
      males and 4 non-pregnant females) enrolled in and completed the clinical phase of the study
