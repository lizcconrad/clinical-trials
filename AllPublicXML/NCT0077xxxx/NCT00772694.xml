  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Germ cell tumors, a relatively rare disease, but most common malignancy in young males, occur
      most frequently in testis. The incidence is about 1%, but is increasing in the majority of
      developed countries. The testicular cancer is an extremely important oncological condition
      due to his high rate of 80-90% of curability, which can be achieved by combination of
      chemotherapy and surgery.

      Some of 20-30% of patients will experience disease progression after first line
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy and salvage 2nd line conventional-dose cisplatin-based salvage
      chemotherapy will result in long term remissions in &lt; 50% of patients (VeIP - vinblastine,
      ifosfamide, cisplatin, VIP/PEI - ifosfamide, etoposide, cisplatin, TIP - paclitaxel,
      ifosfamide, cisplatin). In multiple relapsed patients the 3rd line chemotherapy can induce
      remission in up to 40% (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin), 23% RR (TG - paclitaxel, gemcitabine), 20%
      CR (IPO - irinotecan, paclitaxel, oxaliplatin), but only small proportion of them can be
      cured, usually with subsequent consolidation surgery. At that stage the disease is usually
      chemorefractory and there are no other chemotherapy regimens of proven benefit (7).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if multiple-relapsed chemorefractory pts may
      benefit from sorafenib monotherapy.
