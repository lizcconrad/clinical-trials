  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The identification and characterization of individuals who vary in their response to
      exercise-induced weight loss is important. Weight loss in response to exercise is variable
      and it remains unknown who will succeed, why, and more importantly how to improve weight loss
      efficacy.

      This study will examine changes in behavioural, metabolic, physiological and biochemical
      variables in response to a 12 week supervised exercise programme and evaluate their
      association with weight loss in overweight and obese sedentary individuals.

      Our hypothesis is that changes in the plasma levels of appetite related hormones undermine
      the inter individual variation in weight loss in response to exercise.

      This study will improve the understanding of variability to exercise-induced weight loss and
      allow more individually tailored and appropriate strategies for weight management programmes.

      Purpose - To identify predictors of weight loss in overweigh/obese volunteers following a 12
      week supervised exercise programme, and to characterise the variability in weight loss
      response.

      Method - Longitudinal study aiming to identify predictors of weight loss in response to a
      12-week exercise programme in healthy overweight/obese volunteers.

      Subjective and objective measures of appetite, cardiovascular fitness, anthropometry, body
      composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), fat and carbohydrate oxidation in the fasting
      state will be measured at baseline, before participants enroll for the study and after the
      exercise intervention.

      The preload/test-meal paradigm (using a high and low-energy preload: HEP vs LEP) will be used
      to assess short-term appetite control before and after the exercise intervention following a
      randomized single-blinded crossover design. Moreover, the long-term effects of exercise on
      cytokine plasma levels and fasting and postprandial levels of appetite related
      hormones/metabolites will also be assessed at baseline and end of the study. Participants
      will act as their own controls throughout the study.
