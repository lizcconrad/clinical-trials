      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of Loperamide HCl 2 mg
      and simethicone 125 mg tablets (Ranbaxy) with that of Imodium® Advanced caplets (McNeil) in
      healthy subjects under fasting condition

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as a single-dose, randomized, 2-period sequence crossover study under
      fasting condition comparing equal dose of test and reference products with an interval period
      of at least 7 days. The period of confinement was at least 10 hours before dosing until after
      24 hours blood collection in each period. Subjects were asked to return to the clinic for
      subsequent blood circulation Twenty-six subjects (26) were recruited for the study of which
      twenty-three (23) completed the clinical portion of the study. Subject #17 was withdrawn by
      sponsor's representative due to adverse event unrelated to the drug), subject #18 and subject
      #25 voluntarily withdrew due to adverse event

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All subjects selected for this sudy will be at least 18 years of age

          2. Each subjects shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of
             initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood
             pressure, general observations, and history

          3. Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study
             screening process At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation,
             and clinical laboratory measurements Adequate blood and urine samples should be
             obtained within 28 days before beginning of the first period and at the end of the
             clinical laboratory measurements Clinical laboratory measurement will include the
             haematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, HIV screen, Hepatitis-B,C screen,
             Drugs of abuse screen

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject candidates who met the following criteria were excluded::

          1. Subjects with a history of alcoholism or drug addiction (during past 2 years), or
             serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis,
             epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, psychosis or glaucoma will not be eligible for study

          2. Subjects whose clinical laboratory tests are outside the normal range may be retested
             at the request of clinical investigator. If the clinical values are outside this range
             on retesting, subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the
             clinical investigator deems the result to not to be significant

          3. Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested
             should be excluded from the study

          4. All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as a
             part of the clinical laboratory screening procedure and at each check-in. Subjects
             found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will not be allowed to
             participate

          5. Subjects should not have donated blood and/ or plasma for at least 30 days prior to
             the first dosing of the study

          6. Subjects who have taken investigational drug within 30 days prior to the first dosing
             of the study

          7. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding, or who are likely to become pregnant
             during the study will not be allowed to participate. Female subjects of child bearing
             potential must either abstain from sexual intercourse or use a reliable barrier method
             (eg. Condom, IUD) of contraception during course of the study or they will not be

             contraceptives before 14 days of dosing will not be allowed to participate

          8. All female subjects will be screened for pregnancy at check-in in each period.
             Subjects with positive or inconclusive results will be withdrawn from the study
