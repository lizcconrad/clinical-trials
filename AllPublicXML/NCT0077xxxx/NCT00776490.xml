      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of glimepiride 1 mg
      tablets (manufactured by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited) with that of AMARYL® 1 mg tablets
      following a single oral dose (1 x 1 mg tablet) in healthy, adult subjects under fasting
      conditions.

      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioequivalence study on glimepiride comparing
      glimepiride 1mg tablets of Ranbaxy laboratories limited with Amaryl 1mg tablets of in
      healthy, adult, human, subjects under fasting conditions.

      A total of 32 subjects were entered into this study and 31 subjects completed the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Source of Subjects: Non-institutionalized subjects consisting of members of the
             community at large.

          -  Characterization of Study Group.

               -  All subjects selected for this study will be at least 18 years of age.

               -  Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of
                  initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood
                  pressure, general observations, and history.

          -  Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study
             screening process. At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation
             consisting of interim history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory
             measurements.

          -  Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of
             the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.

          -  Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following:

               -  Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelets, and white
                  blood cell count (with differential).

               -  Clinical Chemistry: creatinine, BUN, glucose, SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, bilirubin, and
                  alkaline phosphatase.

               -  Urine Analysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones,bilirubin, occult
                  blood, and cells.

               -  HIV Screen:(pre-study only)

               -  Hepatitis-B, C Screen:(pre-study only)

               -  Drugs of Abuse Screen: pre-study and at check-in each study period

          -  Subjects will be selected if all above are normal.

          -  Electrocardiograms of all participating subjects will be recorded before initiation of
             the study and filed with each subject's case report forms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption I,(during past 2 years), drug
             addiction, or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular
             disease,tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma (during past 5 years), diabetes, psychosis or
             glaucoma will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater than 20% outside the normal
             range may be retested. If the clinical values are outside the range on retesting, the
             subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical
             investigator deems the result to not be significant.

          -  Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested
             should be excluded from the study.

          -  All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as
             part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at each check-in.

          -  Subjects found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will not be
             allowed to participate.

          -  Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days
             prior to the first dosing of the study.

          -  Subjects who have taken any investigational drug within thirty (30) days prior to the
             first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or who are likely to become pregnant
             during the study will not be allowed to participate. Female subjects of child bearing
             potential must either abstain from sexual intercourse or use a reliable barrier method
             (e.g. condom, IUD) of contraception during the course of the study (first dosing until
             last blood collection) or they will not be allowed to participate.

          -  Subjects who have used implanted or injected hormonal contraceptives anytime during
             the 6 months prior to study dosing, or used oral hormonal contraceptives within 14
             days before dosing will not be allowed to participate.

          -  All female subjects will be screened for pregnancy at check-in each study period.

          -  Subjects with positive or Inconclusive results will be withdrawn from the study.
