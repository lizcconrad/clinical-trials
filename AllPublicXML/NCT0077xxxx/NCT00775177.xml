  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the bioequivalence of Doxycycline monohydrate
      formulations after administration of single doses to normal healthy subjects under fasted
      conditions. These data were to be evaluated statistically to determine if the products meet
      bioequivalence criteria.

      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioequivalence study on Doxycycline monohydrate
      comparing Doxycycline monohydrate 100mg tablets of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc with Adoxa ®
      100mg tablets of Bradley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in healthy, adult, human, subjects under
      fasting conditions.

      A total of 32 non-smoking subjects (men and women) were included in this study, of which 31
