    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL765 in combination
      with erlotinib (Tarceva®) in subjects with solid tumors. XL765 is a new chemical entity that
      inhibits the kinases PI3K and mTOR. In preclinical studies, inactivation of PI3K has been
      shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells, whereas
      inactivation of mTOR has been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Erlotinib is an
      orally administered inhibitor of EGFR (also known as HER1) tyrosine kinase. It was approved
      by the FDA as a single agent for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of at least one prior
      chemotherapy regimen and in combination with gemcitabine for first line treatment of patients
      with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
