  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the this study is to determine if Echinacea purpurea stimulates the immune system
      in children. For the study, 40 healthy children, 6-11 years old will be randomized to receive
      Echinacea purpurea or placebo for 10 days in 3 consecutive months. Blood samples will be
      obtained in the children just before starting study medication, during the first course of
      medication and either just prior to starting the second course of medication or 50 days
      following the last of the three courses of medication. Markers of immune activity in children
      receiving Echinacea or placebo will be compared.

      This is an application to study the biologic activity of a specific formulation of Echinacea
      purpurea in children 6-11 years old. The goal of the study is to determine if Echinacea
      purpurea is associated with activation of immune markers including cytokines such as tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interferon alpha, interferon gamma, and interleukins 2, 6, and
      12 (IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12), as well CD25 and CD69 activation. A total of 40 study children
      will be randomized to receive either the Echinacea purpurea formulation or placebo for 10
      consecutive days at the start of 3 consecutive 30-day periods. Blood samples will be obtained
      at baseline, at the time of &quot;peak&quot; TNF activity, and either 30 or 120 days after beginning
      the study medication. Prior to beginning this pediatric study &quot;peak&quot; TNF activity will be
      determined by administering the Echinacea purpurea to 3 adult volunteers for 10 days and
      doing frequent blood sampling during this period. If it is demonstrated that this formulation
      of E purpurea has biologic activity, a large randomized controlled trial is planned to
      determine if E purpurea can prevent upper respiratory tract infection (URI) in children 2-11
      years old.
