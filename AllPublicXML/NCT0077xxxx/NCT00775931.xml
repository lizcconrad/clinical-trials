  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to explore what we believe may be a safer and more effective
      means of performing stem cell transplantation in patients with Osteopetrosis, using
      chemotherapy and radiation designed to bring about engraftment and lessen transplant
      mortality. Prior multi-institutional data in past studies found that approximately 30% of
      Osteopetrosis patients do not engraft. Therefore, in this study, we utilize a reduced
      intensity design of pre-transplant drugs to try to make transplants safer for this disease,
      as well as to provide a second infusion of stem cells in patients with matched related or
      unrelated donors.

      This revised transplant protocol will test the following: 1) the ability to achieve
      engraftment with the reduced intensity protocol and a second infusion of stem cells on day
      42, 2) the mortality associated with transplant by day 100, 3) patient outcomes, based on
      differential imaging and biologic evaluations prior to transplantation and at designated
      points after transplantation (day 100, 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years). Additional biologic
      studies will include microarray analysis, and evaluation of blood parameters and genes that
      may be important in the disease process. In older patients, studies to evaluation osteoclast
      differentiation and function will also be offered.

    <description>Umbilical cord blood will be collected, processed and shipped according to existing protocols. 2 cord blood units will be utilized if available. The choice of units will be based on the HLA typing standards of the University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Program. If 2 units are not available, a single unit may be used. If a single unit is used, the unit should provide at least 10 x 107 nucleated cells/kg recipient body weight.</description>

    <description>Related donor marrow will be collected, processed and shipped according to existing protocols of the National Marrow Donor Program or other URD registry, with the goal of achieving a cell dose of â‰¥ 6.0 x 108 nucleated cells/kg. The proportion of cells that are CD34+ will be determined prior to the administration of the graft. This will allow a portion of the graft (2 x 106 CD34+ cells) to be frozen for a subsequent infusion on day +42.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients eligible for transplantation under this protocol will be &lt; or = 45 years of
             age, and will be diagnosed with severe osteopetrosis. This will be defined as having
             the following manifestations of the disease.

               1. Bones that are uniformly markedly dense based on skeletal survey

               2. No history that would suggest autosomal dominant inheritance

               3. Evidence of hematologic changes that are attributed to the underlying disease,
                  including

          -  the need for ongoing transfusions, OR

          -  the presence of progressive anemia or thrombocytopenia, OR

          -  a white blood cell differential with a predominance of immature forms and evidence of
             extramedullary hematopoiesis, OR

          -  persistence of serious infectious complications that are thought to be due to the
             abnormal architecture of the bone that are resistant to surgical and medical
             interventions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt;45 years of age

          -  Renal dysfunction with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30% of predicted.

          -  Cardiac compromise sufficient to substantially increase the risk of transplantation

          -  Severe, stable neurologic impairment.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females
