  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b/2a study will evaluate safety, tolerability PK and PD of AMG 827 when
      administered in multiple SC and IV doses in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in
      combination with a stable dose of DMARDs. Part A is dose escalation (to assess safety &amp;
      tolerability), and Part B is dose expansion (to assess clinical efficacy) at the highest
      tolerated dose level of AMG 827 from Part A.
