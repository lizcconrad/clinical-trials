      The objective of this study was to assess the single-dose relative bioavailability of Ranbaxy
      and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (CEFZIL 速) 500 mg cefprozil tablets, under fasting
      conditions.

      This was a blinded, randomized, single dose, 3-way crossover comparative bioavailability
      study performed on 27 healthy adult volunteers (13 males and 14 females). In each period,
      subjects were housed from at least 10 hours before dosing until after the 10 hour post dose
      events. Subjects received a single oral 500 mg cefprozil dose of their assigned formulation,
      with 240 mL of water under fasting condition. Food was restricted from 10 hours before dosing
      until 4 hours post dose and water was not permitted from 2 hours before dosing and was
      restricted until 2 hours following dosing but was allowed ad libitum at all other times. The
      doses were separated by a washout period of 14 days.

      A total of twenty seven (27) healthy adult volunteers (13 males and 14 females) were enrolled
      in the study, out of which only twenty four (24) subjects (11 males and 13 females) completed
      the clinical phase of the study.
