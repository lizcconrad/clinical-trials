      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of clarithromycin 500
      mg tablets (Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited) with that of BIAXIN速 500 mg tablets in healthy,
      adult subjects under fasting conditions.

      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioavailability study on clarithromycin formulations
      comparing clarithromycin 500mg tablets of Ranbaxy Laboratories with Biaxin速 tablets 500mg
      (containing clarithromycin 500 mg)in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fasting
      conditions

      Eligible subjects underwent pre-study examinations that included a physical examination,
      12-lead ECG, and laboratory tests - including hematology, blood chemistries, urinalysis,
      infectious diseases (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis Ci HIV), and urine drugs of abuse. Laboratory
      testing for female subjects also included a serum pregnancy test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Source of Subjects: Non-institutionalized subjects consisting of members of the
             community at large.

          -  Characterization of Study Group:

               1. All subjects selected for this study will be at least 18 years of age.

               2. Female subjects must be unable to become pregnant (postmenopausal for at least 1
                  year, or surgically sterile).

          -  Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of
             initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood
             pressure, general observations, and history.

          -  Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study
             screening process.

          -  At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation consisting of
             interim history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory measurements.

          -  Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of
             the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.

          -  Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following:

               -  Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit,red blood cell count, platelets, and white
                  blood cell count (with differential).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption (during past 2 years), drug
             addiction, or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease,
             tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma(during past 5 years), diabetes, psychosis or glaucoma
             will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater than 20% outside the normal
             range may be retested. If the clinical values are outside the range on retesting, the
             subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical
             investigator deems the result to not be significant.

          -  Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested
             (including any penicillin product) should be excluded from the study.

          -  All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as
             part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at check-in each study
             period. Subjects found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will
             not be allowed to participate.

          -  Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days
             prior to the first dosing of the study.

          -  Subjects who have taken any investigational drag within thirty (30) days prior to the
