  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase 1b open label, non-randomized, single institution clinical trial that is
      designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of three repeat infusions of ISF35 followed
      by a standard regimen of three cycles of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) in
      subjects with refractory, resistant, and/or 17p- CLL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ISF35 has already been used in two Phase I clinical trials. The trials demonstrated that
      ISF35 treatment is well tolerated and patients did not experience any significant or
      unexpected adverse events. Patients reported flu-like symptoms from ISF35, which disappeared
      within one to three days.

      The trials also showed that ISF35 stimulates the immune system to act against CLL cells and
      sensitize leukemic cells to subsequent treatment. Repeat infusions of ISF35 administered as a
      single agent to subjects with CLL resulted in durable reductions in circulating and
      lymph-node bound leukemic cells. Furthermore, CLL patients with 17p deletion responded to
      standard courses of FCR after receiving ISF35 and achieved durable remissions.

      ISF35 is an abbreviation for Immune Stimulatory Factor 35, an offspring of technology
      discovered by Dr. Thomas J. Kipps, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Medicine and Deputy
      Director for Research,UCSD Moores Cancer Center.

          1. Subjects must have a diagnosis of B cell CLL including:

               -  Lymphocytosis of monoclonal B-cells co-expressing ≥ one B-cell marker (CD19,
                  CD20, or CD23) and CD5 in peripheral blood or lymph node AND

               -  Bone marrow with ≥ 30% mononuclear cells having the CLL/SLL phenotype

          2. Measurable disease, and at least one of the IWCLL 2008 Guidelines &quot;Indications for
             Treatment&quot; as follows:

               -  Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or
                  worsening of, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.

               -  Massive (i.e., &gt;6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive or asymptomatic
                  splenomegaly.

               -  Massive nodes (i.e., &gt;10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic
                  lymphadenopathy.

               -  Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of &gt;50% over a 2-month period, or
                  lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) of less than 6 months. LDT can be obtained by
                  linear regression extrapolation of absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) obtained at
                  intervals of two weeks over an observation period of 2-3 months; patients with
                  initial blood lymphocyte counts of less than 30,000 per microliter may require a
                  longer observation period to determine the LDT. Also, factors contributing to
                  lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy other than CLL (e.g, infections) should be
                  excluded.

               -  Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroids or
                  other standard therapy.

               -  A minimum of any one of the following disease-related symptoms must be present:

               -  Unintentional weight loss ≥10% within the previous 6 months.

               -  Significant fatigue (i.e., ECOG PS 2 or worse; cannot work or unable to perform
                  usual activities).

               -  Fevers of greater than 100.5 degrees F or 38.0 degrees C for 2 or more weeks
                  without other evidence of infection.

               -  Night sweats for more than 1 month without evidence of infection.
                  Hypogammaglobulinemia or monoclonal or oligoclonal paraproteinemia does not by
                  itself constitute a basis to initiate treatment.

          3. Subjects must have CLL that is documented to be resistant or refractory to standard
             chemotherapy regimens containing alkylating agents and/or purine analogues.
             Chemotherapy refractory or resistant is defined as the following:

               -  CLL progression during treatment (2 cycles) with chemotherapy; OR

               -  Failure to achieve a PR or CR after at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy; OR

               -  No response to treatment or stable disease after at least 2 cycles of
                  chemotherapy; OR

               -  Disease progression within 6 months of treatment with chemotherapy; OR
