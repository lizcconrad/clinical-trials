      RATIONALE: Ridaforolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of ridaforolimus and to see how
      well it works in treating patients with recurrent metastatic and/or locally advanced
      endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the efficacy, in terms of objective response rate, of ridaforolimus, in
           patients with recurrent metastatic and/or locally advanced endometrial cancer.

        -  To assess the adverse events, time to progression, and response duration of this drug in
           these patients.

        -  To correlate objective tumor response with PTEN expression and other potential markers
           in primary tumor tissue from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral ridaforolimus once daily on days 1-5 for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every
      4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Archived tumor tissue samples (paraffin block or unstained slides) are analyzed for PTEN gene
      expression and other mTOR pathway elements to explore possible markers of response or
      non-progression by immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
