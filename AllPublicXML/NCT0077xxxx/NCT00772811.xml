      Treatment plan

        -  Conditioning chemotherapy before infusion of allogeneic stem cells will include
           fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days (days -6 to -2) and melphalan 100 mg/m2
           at day -2.

        -  Fludarabine and Melphalan will be infused intravenously over 30 minutes in D5W 100 mL.

        -  Melphalan will be administered following the completion of Fludarabine infusion at day
           -2.

        -  In case of unrelated donor HCT, thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg in N/S 500 mL (less than 0.5
           mg/mL) or lymphoglobuline 15 mg/kg in N/S 500 mL (less than 2 mg/mL) IV qd on days -4,
           -3 and -2. Infuse over 4 hrs. Premedicate with Avil 45.5 mg IVP and Tylenol 600 mg po.
           Methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg in D5W 100 ml will be given IV over 30 minutes before
           thymoglobulin (or lymphoglobuline) on days -4 to -2.

        -  Before the administration of melphalan, prehydration will be done intravenously with
           0.9% NS 1L over 3 hours.

        -  30 minutes before melphalan infusion, premedication with dexamethasone 10 mg and ativan
           1 mg i.v. push will be given. Appropriate antiemetics such as ondansetron 8 mg i.v. push
           every 4-6 hours and ativan 1-2 mg i.v. push every 4-6 hours will be administered.

        -  Hydration with 0.9% NS at 80 mL/hour will be administered for at least 7 days.
           Appropriate amount of KCl should be mixed.

        -  GVHD prophylaxis will include cyclosporine A (CSA) and methotrexate.
