  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical utility of the ArteFill® pre-treatment
      Skin Test in predicting and preventing hypersensitivity reactions to treatment with ArteFill®
      implant
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label study in approximately 485 healthy male and female
      subjects to obtain 450 evaluable subjects. In this protocol, an ArteFill® Skin Test study
      will be conducted to evaluate the test's clinical utility to determine the incidence of
      positive skin reactions to ArteFill®. The results of this skin test study will determine if
      the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction against ArteFill® without a skin test is no greater
      than the published historical risk of a hypersensitivity reaction against a Zyderm or Zyplast
      treatment after a patient demonstrates a negative response to a single Zyderm skin test.
      Based on prior clinical experience with ArteFill® implant in commercial use outside the
      United States, it is anticipated that no reactions will be observed. As such, it may be
      suggested that there is no practical use of the ArteFill® Skin Test for screening patients,
      and therefore, the test may be eliminated as a requirement prior to treatment with the
      ArteFill® product as is the clinical practice outside the United States.
