  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of pioglitazone, once daily (QD), on
      low grade inflammation and vascular function in hypertensive patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with insulin resistance and an activated inflammation are prone for cardiovascular
      complications like myocardial infarction or stroke. Pharmacological interventions reducing
      vascular inflammation are thought to reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetic and in
      non-diabetic patients.

      Intervention with ACE inhibitors like ramipril is an established and widely used treatment
      for patients with high blood pressure, proven to reduce cardiovascular risk. Treatment of
      non-diabetic patients with pioglitazone has shown to improve the cardiovascular risk profile
      in non-diabetic patients beyond its effect on blood glucose levels.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects on low grade inflammation and vascular
      function of pioglitazone in non-diabetic, hypertensive patients with pre treatment with
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (that will be replaced by the study medication at
      time of randomization).
