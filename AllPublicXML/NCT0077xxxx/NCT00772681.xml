      -  To assess the efficacy of docetaxel, cisplatin combination in terms of disease free
           survival.

        -  Time to progression of the disease in terms of local and distant failure; assess the
           survival time, and assess the objective (clinical and radiological) response rate and
           the safety of the treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically/cytologically confirmed, patients with stage T2b-T4N1 or TanyN2-3
             undifferentiated or nonkeratinized squamous cell carcinoma of nasopharynx who are

             defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dl), and hepatic function (as defined by bilirubin
             ≤ 1.5 x maximum normal value even with hepatic metastasis; transaminases (ALT, AST) ≤
             1.5 x maximum normal value; alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x maximum normal value, except
             in case of a bone metastasis)

        Exclusion Criteria:
