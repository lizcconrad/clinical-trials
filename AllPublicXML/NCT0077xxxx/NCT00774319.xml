    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare two different treatments for fit patients with head
      and neck cancer:

      All patients are given induction-chemotherapy (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU).

      Subsequently patients are being randomised into two groups:

        -  The first group receives neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ('high' dose cisplatin) and
           conventional radiotherapy

        -  The second group receives neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ('low' dose cisplatin) and
           accelerated radiotherapy.

      Induction Chemotherapy TPF(arm A and B)

      : Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 iv on day 1, Cisplatin 75 mg/ m2 iv on day 1, 5-FU 750 mg/ m2/day iv
      continuous infusion (in Hickman or port a cath) on days 1-5; prophylactic G-CSF

      This cycle will be repeated every 21 days for a maximum of 4 cycles. Clinical evaluation
      after each cycle and radiological evaluation after 2 cycles will take place. In case of PD or
      SD (after 2 cycles) with no minor response (no decrease in measurable disease from baseline)
      concomitant chemoradiotherapy will started per protocol.

      Surgery The investigators in each centre can decide neck surgery for residual tumor
