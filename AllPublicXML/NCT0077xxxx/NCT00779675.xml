    <textblock>
      This is a prospective Phase 4, open-label, non-randomized, observational, multi-center study
      of infliximab in participants with plaque-type psoriasis to assess the clinical response in
      real-world practice of long-term maintenance therapy with infliximab 5 mg/kg body weight in a
      psoriasis population, prescribed in a regimen in accordance with the product monograph (PM)
      for Canada, the approved summary sheet of product characteristics (SPC) for countries in the
      European Union (EU), or per label according to local guidelines for all other participating
      countries.

    <time_frame>Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>Participant PASI scores were used to measure the severity and extent of psoriasis. Using a scale of 0=none to 4= very severe, each body region (head, trunk, arms, and legs) is rated for redness, thickness and scaling of the largest psoriatic area in that region; these 4 totals (totals ranging from 0 to 16) are then multiplied by the standardized percentage of total body area that each region represents (head = 0.1 of body surface area, trunk = 0.2 of body surface area, arms=0.3 of the body surface area, and legs = 0.4 of body surface area). An assessment is then made of the percentage of the area in that body region that is involved by the psoriatic lesions; this is expressed by a score from 0 (0% involved) to 6 (100% involved) and this score is multiplied by the subtotal of the total body area of that region; the four region scores are then added to produce the total PASI score. PASI-75 response was defined as &gt;=75% improvement in overall PASI score when compared to baseline.</description>

        Participants with plaque-type psoriasis in which the treating physician has selected for
        treatment with infliximab, in accordance with local clinical practices, will be advised
        about this trial. It is highly recommended that 30% of the participants enrolled be naïve
        to previous biologic therapy. For example, if a site recruits 10 participants, 3 out of
        these 10 participants should be naïve to previous biologic therapy.

        <title>Number of Participants With a Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index (PASI)-75 Response at Week 50</title>
        <description>Participant PASI scores were used to measure the severity and extent of psoriasis. Using a scale of 0=none to 4= very severe, each body region (head, trunk, arms, and legs) is rated for redness, thickness and scaling of the largest psoriatic area in that region; these 4 totals (totals ranging from 0 to 16) are then multiplied by the standardized percentage of total body area that each region represents (head = 0.1 of body surface area, trunk = 0.2 of body surface area, arms=0.3 of the body surface area, and legs = 0.4 of body surface area). An assessment is then made of the percentage of the area in that body region that is involved by the psoriatic lesions; this is expressed by a score from 0 (0% involved) to 6 (100% involved) and this score is multiplied by the subtotal of the total body area of that region; the four region scores are then added to produce the total PASI score. PASI-75 response was defined as &gt;=75% improvement in overall PASI score when compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Number of Particpants With a PASI-90 or PASI-75 at Week 50 Among Participants With a PASI-75 Response at Week 14</title>
        <description>Using a scale of 0=none to 4= very severe, each body region (head, trunk, arms, and legs) is rated for redness, thickness and scaling of the largest psoriatic area in that region; these 4 totals (totals ranging from 0 to 16) are then multiplied by the standardized percentage of total body area that each region represents (head = 0.1 of body surface area, trunk = 0.2 of body surface area, arms=0.3 of the body surface area, and legs = 0.4 of body surface area). An assessment is then made of the percentage of the area in that body region that is involved by the psoriatic lesions; this is expressed by a score from 0 (0% involved) to 6 (100% involved) and this score is multiplied by the subtotal of the total body area of that region; the four region scores are then added to produce the total PASI score. PASI-90 and PASI-75 response were defined as &gt;=90% improvement and a &gt;=75% improvement, respectively, in overall PASI score when compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a PASI-90 or PASI-75 Response at Week 98 Among Participants Who Had a PASI-75 Response at Week 50 and Who Entered the Extended Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>PASI socres were used to measure the severity and extent of psoriasis. Using a scale of 0=nonoe to 4=very severe, each body region (head, trunk, arms, and legs) is rated for redness, thickness, and scaling of the largest psoriatic area in that region; thse 4 totals (ranging from 0 to 16) are then multipled by the standardized percentage of total body area that region represents (head=0.1 of body surface area, trunk=0.2 of body surface area, arms=0.3 of body surface area, and legs=0.4 of body surface area). An assessment is then made of the percentage of area in that body region that is involved by the psoriatic lesions; this is expressed by a score from 0 (0% involved) to 6 (100% involved) and this score is multiplied by the subtotal of the total body area of that region; the four region scores are then added to produce the total PASI score. PASI-90 and PASI-75 response were defined at &gt;=90% and &gt;=75% improvement in overall PASI score when compared to baselne, respectively.</description>

        <description>Using a scale of 0=none to 4= very severe, each body region (head, trunk, arms, and legs) is rated for redness, thickness and scaling of the largest psoriatic area in that region; these 4 totals (ranging from 0 to 16) are then multiplied by the standardized percentage of total body area that each region represents (head = 0.1 of body surface area, trunk = 0.2 of body surface area, arms=0.3 of the body surface area, and legs = 0.4 of body surface area). An assessment is then made of the percentage of the area in that body region that is involved by the psoriatic lesions; this is expressed by a score from 0 (0% involved) to 6 (100% involved) and this score is multiplied by the subtotal of the total body area of that region; the four region scores are then added to produce the total PASI score. PASI-50, PASI-75, PASI-90, and PASI-100 response were defined as &gt;=25%, &gt;=50%, &gt;=75%, &gt;=90%, =100% improvement in PASI score versus baseline, respectively.</description>

        <description>Participant PASI scores were used to measure the severity and extent of psoriasis. Using a scale of 0=none to 4= very severe, each body region (head, trunk, arms, and legs) is rated for redness, thickness and scaling of the largest psoriatic area in that region; these 4 totals (totals ranging from 0 to 16) are then multiplied by the standardized percentage of total body area that each region represents (head = 0.1 of body surface area, trunk = 0.2 of body surface area, arms=0.3 of the body surface area, and legs = 0.4 of body surface area). An assessment is then made of the percentage of the area in that body region that is involved by the psoriatic lesions; this is expressed by a score from 0 (0% involved) to 6 (100% involved) and this score is multiplied by the subtotal of the total body area of that region; the four region scores are then added to produce the total PASI score. PASI-75 response was defined as &gt;=75% improvement in overall PASI score when compared to baseline.</description>
