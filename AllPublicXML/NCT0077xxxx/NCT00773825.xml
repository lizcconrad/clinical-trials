  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genomic imprinting, referring to an epigenetic marking resulting in monoallelic gene
      expression, plays a critical role in development. Recently, various imprinting diseases were
      reported in animals (Large Offspring syndrome (LOS)) and humans (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
      (BWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS)) born after ART. In all cases, an imprinting defect was
      involved (loss of methylation at ICR2 in BWS, at SNRPN in AS and at IGF2R DMR2 in LOS). These
      data suggest that ART procedures may impair the establishment or the maintenance (following
      fertilization) of methylation marks at maternally imprinted loci. In view of these data, the
      aim of this study is to determine if children born following ART exhibit an increased risk of
      imprinting defects. If the answer is yes, the second objective is to identify the problematic
      step in the ART procedure and thus to suppress or modify this step.

      Methodology: assessment of the methylation status at 9 different imprinted loci (using
      Southern blot and methyl-specific quantitative PCR) in 3 groups of patients: 150 children
      naturally conceived, 150 children conceived after ovarian stimulation but with in vivo
      fertilization, and 150 children conceived after ovarian stimulation and in VITRO
      fertilization. These analyses will be performed on cord blood. Fragments of placental tissue
      will also be collected for further analyses. Patients will be selected in maternity hospitals
      associated with ART departments ( ANTOINE BECLERE HOSPITAL, Cochin HOSPITAL, Saint-Vincent de
      Paul HOSPITAL, Jean VERDIER HOSPITAL, Tenon HOSPITAL and Dijon Hospital).

      This work is also a unique opportunity to establish a DNA, RNA and tissue collection allowing
      further investigation regarding other epigenetic modifications than DNA methylation, not only
      at imprinted loci, but also in other genomic regions regulated by epigenetic modifications.
