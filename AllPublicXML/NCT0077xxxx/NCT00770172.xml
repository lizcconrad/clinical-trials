      RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, may increase the number of white blood
      cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may prevent persistent neutropenia in
      patients receiving chemotherapy. It is not yet known which regimen of G-CSF may be more
      effective in preventing neutropenia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two different regimens of G-CSF to see
      how well it works in preventing persistent neutropenia in patients with solid tumors who are
      receiving chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of filgrastim (G-CSF) in preventing persistent moderate
           neutropenia in patients with solid tumors while maintaining chemotherapy courses.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the tolerability of 2 regimens of G-CSF in these patients.

        -  Determine the number of courses of G-CSF needed in each regimen.

        -  Evaluate the frequency of infections.

        -  Determine dose intensity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily for 6 days
           beginning 1 week after the start of chemotherapy (days 7-12). If chemotherapy begins on
           day 8, patients receive G-CSF SC on days 9-14.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive G-CSF SC every 2 days on days 10-20 for up to 6 injections.
