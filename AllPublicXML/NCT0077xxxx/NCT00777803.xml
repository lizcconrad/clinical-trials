  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NT 201, also known as IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®/Bocouture®), is a Botulinum toxin type A
      preparation free of complexing proteins (150 kiloDalton). Injected into the muscle, NT201
      causes a reversible local relaxation of the injected muscle. Botulinum toxin type A is used
      for aesthetic treatment of mimic wrinkles and in the therapy of neurologic diseases. This
      study will investigate the safety and efficacy (non-inferiority) of NT 201 in comparison with
      OnabotulinumtoxinA (Vistabel®) in the treatment of glabellar frown lines.

    <description>The Outcome Measure Data Table describes the number of responders. A subject is a responder if at least 2 out of 3 independent rater identified a response. A response is defined as an improvement of at least one point on a 4-point facial wrinkle scale from baseline to 4 weeks thereafter at maximum frown. The scale comprises the items 0 = 'none', 1 = 'mild', 2 = 'moderate', 3 = 'severe' wrinkles.</description>
