  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared the effectiveness of a
      telephone delivered, recovery focused, peer-support intervention to enhanced usual care for
      VA patients with depression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peer-support interventions have been recommended by prestigious national task forces and
      incorporated into the VA Comprehensive Mental Health Strategic Plan. Patients who cope with
      longer term depressive symptoms may benefit from these interventions.This study examines the
      effectiveness of a feasible, scalable mutual peer-support intervention for VA patients in
      depression treatment and will inform leaders who are considering implementing peer-support
      initiatives.

      In this study, each study participant (a veteran in treatment for depression) was matched
      with another participating veteran and the pairs were randomized to enhanced usual care or to
      the telephone based peer-support intervention (DIAL-UP). All study participants received
      usual care plus written materials outlining depression self-management strategies, behavioral
      activation, and recovery.

      DIAL-UP participants also received: a) a peer-support manual that outlined peer support
      principles and provided peer discussion topics and b) access to a specialized telephone
      platform that permited free calls to their partners, ready access to mental health staff for
      back-up and advice, and recorded tips on depression management. Patients were encouraged to
      call their partners at least once per week during the 6-month intervention period. Patient
      outcomes were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months following enrollment.

    <time_frame>Change over study period</time_frame>
    <description>The Veterans Rand 36 Item Health Survey (VR-36) mental health component score (MCS) and physical health component score (PCS) were used as measures of functional status. The MCS and PCS have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, with higher scores indicating better health.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over study period</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), which has good reliability and has been used in multiple depression studies, was used to assess quality of life. Responses are scored on a 5-point scale ('not at all or never' to 'frequently or all the time'), where higher scores indicate better enjoyment and satisfaction with life (possible range 14-70).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over study period</time_frame>
    <description>The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory-2nd Edition (BDI-II) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery Orientation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over study period</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-item Mental Health Recovery Measure (MHRM) was used to assess recovery orientation. The MHRM has been fielded among diverse populations and has a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's Î± =.93) and shows change following engagement in recovery oriented treatments. The MHRM is scored using a 5 point Likert Scale (0 to 4) for each item, yielding a theoretical range from 0 - 120 for Total Score. Higher scores correspond to a higher self-reported level of mental health recovery.</description>

        <description>The Veterans Rand 36 Item Health Survey (VR-36) mental health component score (MCS) and physical health component score (PCS) were used as measures of functional status. The MCS and PCS have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, with higher scores indicating better health.</description>

Telephone-based peer support: Patients received a) a peer-support manual that outlines self-management and recovery principles and provides peer discussion topics and b) access to a specialized telephone platform that permits free calls to their partners, ready access to mental health staff for back-up and advice on being effective partners, and recorded tips on depression management. They were asked to call their peer partner at least once a week for 24 weeks.

        <title>Recovery Orientation</title>
        <description>The 30-item Mental Health Recovery Measure (MHRM) was used to assess recovery orientation. The MHRM has been fielded among diverse populations and has a high level of internal consistency (Cronbachâs Î± =.93) and shows change following engagement in recovery oriented treatments. The MHRM is scored using a 5 point Likert Scale (0 to 4) for each item, yielding a theoretical range from 0 â 120 for Total Score. Higher scores correspond to a higher self-reported level of mental health recovery.</description>
