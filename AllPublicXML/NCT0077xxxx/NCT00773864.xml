      Medical staff will be screened for MRSA and ESBL (including: doctors, nurses, nurse aids,
      physical therapists, dietitians, Janitors and other medical staff).

      PURPOSE:

      To define the carriage of, and risk factors for carriage of resistant organisms among
      healthcare employees of carriers of resistant bacteria.

      To define activities of healthcare employees who likely to lead to dissemination of resistant
      bacteria in rehabilitation centers.

      Detailed activity:

      Medical staff will be screened for MRSA and ESBL (including: doctors, nurses, nurse aids,
      physical therapists, dietitians, Janitors and other medical staff).

      Screening will be performed by obtaining nares and perirectal cultures. Nares cultures will
      be obtained by ward staff or research personnel who are experienced in performing this
      activity: a moisture swab will be applied gently to the distal part of both nares. Perirectal
      cultures, will be taken by swab, who will be applied to the perirectal area, either by staff
      as mentioned above, or will be given to the healthcare workers to perform by himself (with
      explanation on how to perform it).
