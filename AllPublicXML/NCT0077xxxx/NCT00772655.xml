    <textblock>
      This is a European multicenter study of 90Yttrium-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (90Y-Ibritumomab
      Tiuxetan) (Zevalin®) as a front line therapy for patients with follicular lymphoma grade
      I-IIIa and stage III-IV (as well as for selected patients with extended abdominal stage II).
      For patients with complete clinical remission but persistent molecular disease subsequent to
      90Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan treatment a consolidation immunotherapy with Rituximab is added, to
      eradicate minimal residual disease.

      Only patients requiring treatment (B-symptoms, lymphoma progression &gt; 50% within an
      observation period of 6 months or less, organ compression by lymphoma or bulky disease as
      defined by lesions above 5 cm on one axis) may enter the study.

Observation for patients achieving complete clinical and molecular response or partial clinical response. Consolidation/maintenance therapy with 4 weekly courses of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 followed by 4 bimonthly courses of Rituximab 375 mg/m2 for patients in clinical CR but with persistent Bcl-2 (t14;18)-positivity 6 months after 90Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan.</description>

             requiring hemodialysis, pulmonary disease, liver disease)

          -  Abnormal liver function: transaminases or total bilirubin &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal
             (ULN) (unless caused by the lymphoma)

          -  Abnormal renal function: serum creatinine &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal (unless caused
             by the lymphoma)
