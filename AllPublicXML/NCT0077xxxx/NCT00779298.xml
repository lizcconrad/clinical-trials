  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased intake of dietary fibre and whole grains is related to reduced risk of developing
      diabetes. The term &quot;whole grain&quot; is often used for whole-meal products in which the structure
      of the cereal grain is destroyed in the flour containing the original dietary fiber, but also
      for cereal products in which a large proportion of whole cereal grains is intact. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial rye whole-meal bread (RWMB) compared to
      white-wheat bread (WWB) on gastric emptying rate (GER), postprandial glucose response in
      healthy subjects.

      Ten healthy subjects, without symptoms or a prior history of gastrointestinal disease,
      abdominal surgery or diabetes mellitus, were assessed by using a blinded crossover trial. The
      subjects were examined regarding blood glucose levels and GER after ingestion of 150g WWB or
      RWMB on two different occasions after an overnight fast. GER was measured using a
      standardized real time ultrasonography. GER was calculated as a percentage change in antral
      cross sectional area 15 and 90 minutes after the finished meal with WWB and RWMB.
      Finger-prick capillary samples were collected before and 40, 60, and 90 min after the start
      of the meal to measure blood glucose levels.
