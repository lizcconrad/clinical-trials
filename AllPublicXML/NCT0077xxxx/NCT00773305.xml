    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of prostate seed implantation
      for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer for patients treated at Summa Health
      System/Akron City Hospital and Salem Community Hospital.

      Charts of early stage prostate cancer patients receiving prostate seed implants with or
      without external beam radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy will be reviewed and abstracted.
      The abstracted data will include pathology reports including Gleason score and T stage, PSA,
      treatment assignment and dosimetry parameters including dose and percent compliant with
      established criteria based on guidelines established by the American Brachytherapy Society.

      A database will be developed for capture of the abstracted data. Outcomes will be determined
      based on PSA levels at 2 and 5 years after prostate seed implantation. The role of hormonal
      therapy with prostate seed implantation and outcomes will be evaluated. The outcomes will be
      compared to national statistics.

    <description>A retrospective chart review of PSA values on 85 patients from 2001-2008 with prostate cancer stage T1c-T2a NX MO, who were treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy using conventional transrectal ultrasound guided placement of Iodine-125 seeds delivering 145 Gy or 110 Gy, depending on whether mono or combination therapy with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was used. Those who had EBRT received 45 Gy prior to seed implants. Some patients also received hormonal therapy.</description>
