      This study (https://pdrisk.ninds.nih.gov) will determine if people who have risk factors for
      Parkinson disease (PD) have biomarkers (objective ways to measure a disease process) that
      show that the disease process is actually going on, and if people who have abnormal
      biomarkers go on to develop PD during several years of follow-up. Biomarkers of Parkinson
      disease (PD) might identify people who are healthy now but may develop the disease later in
      life.

      Healthy volunteers and people who have certain risk factors for developing PD who are between
      18 and 70 years of age may be eligible for this study. People with the following risk factors
      are included:

        -  Family history of PD

        -  Loss of sense of smell

        -  Fall in blood pressure when standing up

        -  REM behavior disorder (a type of sleep disturbance)

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Screening examination

        -  Medical and neurological history and physical examination

        -  Tests or rating scales for movement, sense of smell, mood, attention, fatigue, pain, and
           thinking.

        -  Measurement of blood pressure and pulse rate while lying down and then standing up

        -  Blood draw for genetic testing

        -  Inpatient testing at the NIH Clinical Center for 2-3 days, including:

        -  Measurements while blowing against a resistance

        -  Measurements of blood pressure and pulse rate

        -  Blood draws for levels of various chemicals

        -  PET and MRI scanning

        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)

        -  Electrocardiogram

        -  Skin electrical conduction test (test of sweat production)

        -  Skin and core temperature measurements

        -  Transcranial ultrasound (sound-wave test of the head)

        -  Follow-up testing (up to five visits in 18-month intervals) to repeat some of the tests
           listed above, excluding the genetic testing and spinal tap

      Objective: This Protocol is to test whether individuals with statistical risk factors for
      Parkinson disease (PD) have abnormal values for biomarkers of central or peripheral
      catecholaminergic innervation and whether at-risk individuals with positive biomarkers
      develop PD within up to 7.5 years of follow-up.

      Study Population: The subjects are individuals who may be at risk for developing PD, because
      of (a) genetic risk i.e., a family history of PD or genotypic abnormalities known to be
      associated statistically with PD; (b) olfactory dysfunction i.e., decreased ability to
      distinguish among odors; (c) symptomatic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder
      (RBD); or (d) orthostatic hypotension. A total of 200 at-risk subjects undergo
      catecholaminergic biomarker testing by (18)F-DOPA brain and (18)F-dopamine cardiac scanning.
      At-risk subjects with positive biomarkers are compared to at-risk subjects without positive
      biomarkers, in terms of development of PD during follow-up. Up to 20 control subjects are
      included, to add to a database of normal values for catecholaminergic biomarkers.

      Design: The study includes four phases recruitment, screening, laboratory biomarkers testing,
      and follow-up. Recruitment is by advertisement and a web site questionnaire of self-reported
      risk. A screening examination is done at the NIH Clinical Center, to confirm risk status.
      Based on the screening examination results, subjects undergo inpatient clinical laboratory
      testing, to identify central and peripheral catecholaminergic denervation. In the follow-up
      phase, subjects are re-tested as inpatients approximately every 18 months for a total of up
      to 5 re-evaluations (90 months, or 7.5 years), to detect the onset of the characteristic
      movement disorder in PD and follow the status of catecholaminergic innervation.

      Outcome Measures:

      Primary: Diagnosis of PD by a Board-certified neurologist who is blinded to risk factor
      status and the results of catecholaminergic biomarkers testing. If PD diagnosed, time to
      diagnosis.

      Secondary: UPDRS; (18)F-DOPA brain scanning, (18)F-dopamine cardiac scanning; CSF and plasma
      neurochemicals; neuropsychological rating scales; autonomic function testing, retrospective
      CSF proteomics; retrospective DNA analyses.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals who report at least 3 of the following 4 risk factors at the protocol-specific
        website may be invited to the Screening Examination. All subjects must have ability to
        provide their own consent for participation in the study. Otherwise eligible candidate
        participants who are taking medications that would interfere with the scientific results
        may be included, if (1) the medications are held temporarily or safely substituted for, and
        (2) the medications are held while the participants are inpatients. The prescribing
        physician will be contacted, with the participant's permission, if withholding or
        substituting medication is considered.

          1. Genetic Risk: A positive family history (one immediate or more than one non-immediate
             family member with PD) or positive genetic testing (e.g., LRRK2, alpha-synuclein,
             glucocerebrosidase) satisfies this risk factor criterion.

          2. Olfactory Dysfunction: Olfactory dysfunction reported at the protocol-specific website
             satisfies this criterion. This may be confirmed by the UPSIT sent by mail prior to the
             Screening Examination.

          3. REM Behavior Disorder (RBD): To satisfy this risk factor criterion, the individual
             must have movements of the body or limbs associated with dreaming and at least one of
             the following: potentially harmful sleep behavior, dreams that appear to be acted out,
             and sleep behavior that disrupts sleep continuity.

          4. Orthostatic Hypotension (OH): To satisfy this risk factor criterion, the individual
             reports symptoms of orthostatic hypotension or having orthostatic hypotension at the
             protocol-specific website. This may be confirmed by orthostatic vital signs prior to
             the Screening Examination.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Age: People younger than 18 years old or older than 70 years old are excluded.

          2. Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal
             Investigator, Protocol participation would place the subject at substantially
             increased acute medical risk. This includes the risks associated with air travel to
             the NIH. A candidate subject may be excluded from the study if, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator or Clinical Director, the medical risk outweighs the potential
             scientific benefit. An example of such risk is inability to travel safely to the NIH
             Clinical Center, in Bethesda, Maryland, due to a neurological disorder associated with
             frequent falls.

          3. Disqualifying Conditions: A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying
             condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are insulin-dependent diabetes,
             hepatic or renal failure, symptomatic congestive heart failure, severe anemia,
             psychosis, ventricular arrhythmias, and symptomatic coronary heart disease.

               -  Unable to Provide Consent: Persons who are unable to provide their own consent
                  (e.g., due to dementia) are excluded.

               -  MRI: Persons who are unable to undergo MRI safely, due to implanted metal, are
                  excluded from the MRI procedure.

               -  Safe Travel: A candidate participant is excluded if the person is unable to
                  travel safely to the NIH Clinical Center, in Bethesda, Maryland, such as due to a
                  neurological disorder associated with frequent falls.

          4. Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require
             continued treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results.
             Chronic, ongoing use of drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants that affect the
             clinical laboratory results exclude candidate subjects. People with known or suspected
             allergy or hypersensitivity to any test drug are excluded. Candidate subjects are not
             to discontinue any medications before discussion with the Principal Investigator,
             Research Nurse, Nurse Practitioner, or Clinical Fellow. Temporary discontinuation of
             serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine
             (Effexor), duloxetine (Cymbalta), or des-venlafaxine (Pristiq) can result in rapid
             rebound of depression or anxiety, and so treatment with SNRIs is exclusionary.

          5. Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: If a subject wishes to continue herbal
             medicines or dietary supplements while on study, but a search of the available medical
             identifies drug effects that are known or expected to interfere with the experimental
             results, then the subject may be excluded, at the discretion of Principal Investigator

          6. Practical Limitations: People in whom we feel it would be difficult to insert a
             catheter into a vein may be excluded. People who are not expected clinically to
             tolerate lying still supine during the testing will be excluded.

          7. Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating women are excluded
