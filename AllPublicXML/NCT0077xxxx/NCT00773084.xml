  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare the effects that 2 different combinations of heart
      failure medications have on the levels of certain blood markers which cause and/or worsen
      heart failure. Additionally, the investigators will investigate any differences that may
      exist between Hispanics and Non-Hispanics. The investigators hope to find that Hispanic
      Americans will have a greater response to this new regimen compared to non-Hispanic
      Americans.

      Our main hypothesis is that in contrast to non Hispanic whites, the degree of RAAS system
      activation is more pronounced in Mexican Americans with diastolic HF and consequently their
      response to RAAS inhibition therapy is greater. Blocking the RAAS with renin inhibitor plus
      aldosterone receptor blocker should produce measurable changes in biomarkers as well as
      physiologic improvement that could therefore translate into improved clinical outcomes. These
      changes should be greater appreciated in Mexican Americans if the central pathophysiologic
      influence of HF in this population was RAAS maladaptation.

    <description>Subjects will be in the study for a total of 8 weeks. Subjects with stable diastolic HF on current ACEI therapy will be randomized into two treatment groups. The study group will receive Aliskiren plus spironolactone and the control group will receive Lisinopril plus spironolactone. These 2 groups will be further divided according to ethnicity: Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Sixty patients will be recruited, 30 per treatment group. Subjects will have a 2 week wash-out period. At the end of this period, blood will be collected and subjects will be asked to take the assigned medication once daily for 6 weeks. Subjects will be asked to return every 2 weeks at which time blood pressure, serum potassium and creatinine levels will be assessed. Their medications will be titrated depending on clinical tolerance and symptom control. At the end of 6 weeks of treatment blood markers will be drawn and differences will be analyzed.</description>
