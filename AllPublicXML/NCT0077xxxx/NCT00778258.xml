  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if children who are allergic to milk can increase
      tolerance through frequent dose-escalation every 6 months versus 12 months leading to
      eventual tolerance of less heated milk and ultimately unheated milk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Milk is among the most common food allergens in infants and children. The majority of
      children outgrow their milk allergies; however, the exact mechanisms by which food tolerance
      is achieved are unknown. Strict avoidance of the offending food is currently the only known
      therapy. However, some have been known to tolerate milk products cooked at high heat such as
      when baked in foods.

      This clinical trial involves a diet containing extensively baked milk protein to investigate
      the effects of ingestion of heat-denatured milk on development of oral tolerance to non-baked
      milk.

    <time_frame>Randomization through end of study (up to 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were grouped based on the food to which they experienced a reaction at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1=reacted to muffin; Group 2=reacted to pizza; Group 3=reacted to rice pudding; Group 4=reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5=did not react. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, participants performed an OFC where they were given food products containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. Participants were considered to have a positive progression in tolerance of baked milk if they experienced a reaction to a less denatured milk protein food item at any post randomization visits than the one to which they reacted at their baseline visit.</description>

    <description>Participants were grouped based on the food they experienced a reaction to at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, performed an OFC where food products containing milk protein denatured through baking were given. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until an allergic reaction occurred. A positive progression in tolerance of baked milk was defined as a reaction to a less denatured milk protein food at 12 months than at baseline. Positive progression at 24 months was defined as experiencing a reaction to a less denatured milk protein food at 24 months than at 12 months.</description>

    <description>This endpoint evaluates the correlation between the mechanistic biomarkers of basophil reactivity and the food to which participants reacted at baseline. Participants were grouped according to food at which participants experienced a reaction during their baseline oral food challenge: Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Basophils come from blood drawn at baseline. Basophils counts were done using whole blood specimens. Basophil reactivity as measured as maximal degranulation percentage after stimulation with titrated dilutions of milk powder (from 1x103 to 1x10-1 Âµg/mL total protein) and was correlated to group assignment using Spearman correlation coefficients.</description>

    <description>Participants were grouped based on the food to which they experienced a reaction at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, participants performed an OFC where they were given food products containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12, Month 24, Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were grouped based on the food to which they experienced a reaction at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, participants performed an OFC where they were given food products containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. The relationship between serum IgE to betalactoglobulin and casein, and the food level at which the participant reacted, were evaluated at each post randomization OFC visit. It is expected that those who reacted to muffin would have a higher ratio of casein to betalactoglobulin than those who reacted to less heated forms of milk.</description>

    <description>Participants were grouped based on the food they reacted to, at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1= reacted to muffin; Group 2= reacted to pizza; Group 3= reacted to rice pudding; Group 4= reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5= did not react. Groups 2- 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and Group 1, and a Control group that chose not to participate in the study, continued to avoid milk. Randomized participants performed an OFC at each visit during which they were given progressively less denatured/ baked milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. Participants were considered tolerant to unheated cow's milk if at any post-randomization visit up through 36 months, they did not react to any food, including unheated whole milk. Tolerance of non-heated milk was assessed by report among those who continued to avoid milk.</description>

Participants in this group received instructions for intake of baked milk foods at home and were followed up to 46 months.</description>

Participants were given progressively increasing quantities of less denatured milk protein foods until they had an allergic reaction. The food they experienced a reaction to was their baseline group. Participants in this group passed all OFCs without a reaction were not randomized. Participants were instructed to include full milk products to their diet for 3 months, followed by complete dietary milk elimination for 1 month. Participants were then re-challenged to unheated milk. Following successful challenge, participants were placed on an unrestricted milk diet and brought in for re-evaluation at 6 months. If participants were not successful in their challenge to unheated milk, they had baked milk products progressively re-introduced to their diets.</description>

          <title>Baseline Boiled Milk Wheal</title>
          <description>A skin prick test (SPT) measured the presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies for the food tested. During the SPT, a drop of solution containing the food allergen was placed on the forearm. Using a small plastic needle, the skin was gently pricked or scratched to allow a tiny amount of the solution to enter just below the surface. After 15 minutes, positive results were indicated by a wheal, a raised white bump surrounded by a small circle of red skin. The wheal was measured in millimeters. Larger sizes indicated a greater chance of experiencing an allergic reaction to the food tested.</description>

          <title>Baseline Unheated Milk Wheal</title>
          <description>A skin prick test (SPT) measured the presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies for the food tested. During the SPT, a drop of solution containing the food allergen was placed on the forearm. Using a small plastic needle, the skin was gently pricked or scratched to allow a tiny amount of the solution to enter just below the surface. After 15 minutes, positive results were indicated by a wheal, a raised white bump surrounded by a small circle of red skin. The wheal was measured in millimeters. Larger sizes indicated a greater chance of experiencing an allergic reaction to the food tested.</description>

          <title>Baseline Cowâs Milk IgE</title>
          <description>When cowâs milk immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies are present in serum samples, this is indicative of a potential for an allergic reaction to cowâs milk. The greater the concentration of IgE antibodies present, the more likely an allergic reaction to cowâs milk is to occur.</description>

        <description>Participants were grouped based on the food to which they experienced a reaction at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1=reacted to muffin; Group 2=reacted to pizza; Group 3=reacted to rice pudding; Group 4=reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5=did not react. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, participants performed an OFC where they were given food products containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. Participants were considered to have a positive progression in tolerance of baked milk if they experienced a reaction to a less denatured milk protein food item at any post randomization visits than the one to which they reacted at their baseline visit.</description>

        <title>Percent of Participants Becoming Tolerant to Unheated Cow's Milk</title>
        <description>Participants were grouped based on the food to which they experienced a reaction at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, participants performed an OFC where they were given food products containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. Participants were considered to become tolerant to unheated cow's milk if at any post-randomization visit up through 36 months, they did not react to any of the food given in the OFC.</description>

        <title>Comparison of Baseline Basophil Percent Maximal Degranulation With the Outcome of the Baseline OFC to Identify the Biomarkers of Clinical Reactivity</title>
        <description>This endpoint evaluates the correlation between the mechanistic biomarkers of basophil reactivity and the food to which participants reacted at baseline. Participants were grouped according to food at which participants experienced a reaction during their baseline oral food challenge: Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Basophils come from blood drawn at baseline. Basophils counts were done using whole blood specimens. Basophil reactivity as measured as maximal degranulation percentage after stimulation with titrated dilutions of milk powder (from 1x103 to 1x10-1 Âµg/mL total protein) and was correlated to group assignment using Spearman correlation coefficients.</description>

        <description>This endpoint evaluates the correlation between the mechanistic biomarker of the number of basophils and T regulatory cells reactive to milk proteins and the food to which participants reacted at baseline. Participants were grouped according to food at which participants experienced a reaction during their baseline oral food challenge: Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Quantitative IgE to milk proteins was done using FEIA (UniCAP) on serum from blood drawn at baseline.</description>

        <title>Relationship Between Initial Dose of Tolerated Baked-milk Protein and Time to Complete Tolerance</title>
        <description>Participants were grouped based on the food to which they experienced a reaction at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, participants performed an OFC where they were given food products containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. Participants were considered to become tolerant to unheated cow's milk if at any post-randomization visit up through 36 months, they did not react to any food, including unheated whole milk.</description>

        <title>Relationship Between Dose of Baked-milk Protein and Reactivity to Casein Versus Whey</title>
        <description>Participants were grouped based on the food to which they experienced a reaction at the baseline Oral Food Challenge (OFC). Group 1 = reacted to muffin; Group 2 = reacted to pizza; Group 3 = reacted to rice pudding; Group 4 = reacted to non-baked milk; Group 5 = did not react. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, participants performed an OFC where they were given food products containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. The relationship between serum IgE to betalactoglobulin and casein, and the food level at which the participant reacted, were evaluated at each post randomization OFC visit. It is expected that those who reacted to muffin would have a higher ratio of casein to betalactoglobulin than those who reacted to less heated forms of milk.</description>

Groups 2, 3 and 4 were randomized to dose escalation or maintenance, and at each visit following randomization, participants performed an OFC where they were given food products containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively less denatured milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. The relationship between serum IgE to betalactoglobulin and casein, and the food level at which the participant reacted, were evaluated at each post randomization OFC visit. It is expected that those who reacted to muffin would have a higher ratio of casein to betalactoglobulin than those who reacted to less heated forms of milk.</description>

Randomized participants performed an OFC at each visit during which they were given progressively less denatured/ baked milk protein food items until they had an allergic reaction. Participants were considered tolerant to unheated cow's milk if at any post-randomization visit up through 36 months, they did not react to any food, including unheated whole milk. Tolerance of non-heated milk was assessed by report among those who continued to avoid milk.</description>

          <description>At baseline, participants had an oral food challenge (OFC). They were given food containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively increasing quantities of less denatured milk protein foods until they had an allergic reaction. The food they experienced a reaction to was their baseline group. Participants in this group reacted to pizza and were then randomized to return for re-evaluation every 6 months (dose escalation) to determine whether they might progress to ingesting higher amounts of baked milk protein.

          <title>Maintenance - Reacted to Rice Pudding</title>
          <description>At baseline, participants had an oral food challenge (OFC). They were given food containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively increasing quantities of less denatured milk protein foods until they had an allergic reaction. The food they experienced a reaction to was their baseline group. Participants in this group reacted to rice pudding and were then randomized to continue eating the food at the same level of milk denaturalization and come in for OFCs every 12 months.

          <title>Non-Randomized - Tolerant to Baked and Non-baked Milk</title>
          <description>At baseline, participants had an oral food challenge (OFC). They were given food containing milk protein denatured through baking. Participants were given progressively increasing quantities of less denatured milk protein foods until they had an allergic reaction. The food they experienced a reaction to was their baseline group. Participants in this group passed all OFCs without a reaction were not randomized. Participants were instructed to include full milk products to their diet for 3 months, followed by complete dietary milk elimination for 1 month. Participants were then re-challenged to unheated milk. Following successful challenge, participants were placed on an unrestricted milk diet and brought in for re-evaluation at 6 months. If participants were not successful in their challenge to unheated milk, they had baked milk products progressively re-introduced to their diets.</description>
