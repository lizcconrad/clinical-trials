      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test
      formulation of sertraline 100 mg tablets with an already marketed reference formulation
      Zoloft® 100 mg tablets (Pfizer), under non-fasting conditions in healthy male and female
      adult subjects.

      This randomized, single-dose, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative
      bioavailability of two formulations of 100 mg sertraline hydrochloride tablets under
      non-fasting conditions. The study was conducted with 36 (34 completing) healthy adults in
      accordance with protocol No.

      10540324 (Revision 0). In each study period, a single 100 mg dose was administered to the
      subjects following a standardized high fat breakfast preceded by an overnight fast of at
      least 10 hours. The test formulation was Ranbaxy Research Laboratory's Sertraline
      Hydrochloride 100 mg Tablets and the reference formulation was ZOLOFT® (sertraline
      hydrochloride) 100 mg Tablets Manufactured by Roerig (Division of Pfizer). The subjects
      received the test product in one study period and the reference product in the other period;
      the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. There was a
      14-day interval between treatments.

      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 144 hours after each dose. The
      plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to Helen
      Fassoulas, B.Sc., Director of Operations, Warnex Bioanalytical Services Inc., 3885 boul
      Industriel, Laval, Quebec, H7LAS3 Canada, Telephone: 450-663-6724, ext. 438, FAX:
      450-975-8111 for determination of sertraline plasma concentration.

      Statistical analysis was performed by Yetta I. Wilbur, Biostatistician, Novum Pharmaceutical
      Research Services, 5900 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, USA, Telephone: 412-363-3300, Fax:
      412-362-5783 to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test formulation to that of the
      reference product.

      A total of 36 healthy adult subjects.
