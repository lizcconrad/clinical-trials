      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and activity of TRF-1101 on
      microvascular blood flow, vascular endothelial injury, and vasoocclusive pain associated with
      sickle cell disease.

  <why_stopped>
    Study was stopped due to perceived futility because the baseline pain score in first 40

          -  Have a history of thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100 x 103/mm3) induced by heparin
             or related drugs;

          -  Have had fewer than 2 documented pain crises in the past year;

          -  Have had a pain crisis within one month of screening or randomization;

          -  If currently on or recently discontinued hydroxyurea treatment, have initiated or
