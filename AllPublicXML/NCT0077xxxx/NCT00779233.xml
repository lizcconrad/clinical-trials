      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test formulation
      of Zidovudine 300 mg tablets with an already marketed reference formulation RETROVIR ® 300 mg
      tablets (GlaxoSmithKline), under fasted conditions in healthy male and female adult subjects.

      A randomized, single dose, two way crossover study was conducted with up to 32 healthy, male
      and female adult subjects to compare two Zidovudine 300 mg tablet formulations under fasting
      conditions.

      In each period one x 300 mg tablet was administered to fasting subjects. Subjects received
      the test product in one study period and the reference product in the other period. The order
      of the treatment administration was as per the dosing randomization schedule. Each dose was
      separated by at least a 7 day interval.

      A total of thirty two (32) subjects (23 males and 9 females) were enrolled for the study, of
      which only twenty eight (28) subjects completed the clinical portion of the study.
