  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for individuals with lupus who have developed complications in their kidneys,
      or lupus nephritis. The study will determine whether adding the experimental medication
      abatacept to standard cyclophosphamide therapy is more effective in improving lupus nephritis
      than standard cyclophosphamide therapy by itself.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lupus nephritis is an inflammation of the kidney that occurs in patients with systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE). It is caused by the immune system attacking the kidney and is among the
      most serious complications of SLE: left untreated it can cause long term damage to the
      kidneys or, in some cases, result in kidney failure.

      One of the more common treatments for lupus nephritis is the &quot;Euro-lupus&quot; therapy. In this
      therapy, patients receive three different drugs - cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and
      prednisone - over the course of several months. However, some patients do not respond to this
      therapy and many only show some improvement.

      In this ACCESS trial for lupus nephritis, an experimental medication known as abatacept will
      be added to the Euro-lupus therapy to assess if it works better than Euro-lupus therapy
      alone. Abatacept is a man-made protein that suppresses parts of the immune system that can
      cause autoimmune disease. While abatacept is experimental for lupus, it has been approved by
      the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Abatacept is also being studied for use in other
      autoimmune diseases, like multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes.

      Participants in the ACCESS trial for lupus nephritis will receive bi-weekly intravenous
      infusions of cyclophosphamide for 3 months, then will take azathioprine tablets daily for at
      least 3 months more. Abatacept or a placebo will be administered every 2 weeks initially,
      then every 4 weeks for at least the first 6 months. Treatment of abatacept or placebo and
      azathioprine may continue for the remainder of the year. All participants will take
      prednisone tablets daily during the entire study.

      Because the ACCESS trial is a randomized, controlled study, each participant has a 50-50
      chance (like flipping a coin) of receiving abatacept. Others will receive an inactive,
      placebo form of the drug. Note however, that all participants will receive the Euro-lupus
      therapy. As a blinded (masked) study, neither participants nor study physicians will know to
      which group a person has been assigned.

      All participants will undergo regular physical examinations, medical history and various
      blood and urine tests. Many of these tests will be repeated throughout the study.
      Participants will be asked to attend 18 study visits in the first year, and one study visit
      at the end of the second year.

      The study will reimburse participants for certain expenses incurred as part of the study.

    <measure>Lupus Disease Activity - Participants Who Were Anti-dsDNA Positive at Baseline and Negative at Week 104</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Lupus disease activity was assessed by 7 different measures: reduction in anti-dsDNA, negative anti-dsDNA, resolution of hypocomplementemia (C3, C4), frequency of flares, patient global assessment, SF36 total scores, and BILAG-2004 scores.
Participants with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may have autoantibodies (e.g., self against self) to double-stranded DNA. Double-stranded DNA is one of multiple diagnostic tests for SLE and levels may be associated with disease activity. One measure used to assess disease activity is the number of participants who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline but negative at Week 104. Going from positive to negative is indicative of lowered lupus activity.</description>

Flares can be renal or non-renal. A renal flare is defined as two successive evaluations at least 1 week apart as proteinuria &gt;1 gm/24h for participants who attain a complete response at Week 12 and for all other participants either 1) Increasing serum creatinine and persistent proteinuria, or 2) Worsening proteinuria. A non-renal flare is defined as any new post-baseline BILAG A in a non-renal organ system using BILAG-2004. This outcome measures the number of participants with the presence of renal and non-renal flares from Week 24 through Week 52 by response status. Having flares is indicative of more lupus disease activity.</description>

The SF-36 is a quality of life assessment that was performed at Weeks 9, 24, 36, 52, and 104. Eight scale scores are derived from responses to the 36 items of the SF-36 questionnaire which were combined to produce the Physical Component Score and the Mental Component Score. The Physical Component Score is based on the Physical Functioning Scale (10 items), the Role-Physical Scale (4 items), the Bodily Pain Scale (2 items), and the General Health Scale (5 items). The Mental Component Score is based upon the Vitality Scale (4 items), the Social Functioning Scale (2 items), the Role-Emotional Scale (3 items) and the Mental Health Scale (5 items). Each component score is transformed into a 0-100 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater quality of life.</description>

Subjects also received: 1) cyclophosphamide 500 mg IV every 2 wks for 6 doses followed by azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day by mouth dosed by body weight at Visit 6 (rounded to the nearest 25 mg and to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for 16 wks; 2) prednisone 60 mg/day for the first 2 wks (subjects less than 60 kg could receive 1 mg/kg/day).* Prednisone was tapered until Wk 12 to a dose of 10 mg/day. This dose was continued until Wk 24 unless the subject had a prednisone-related toxicity requiring further reduction.* After Wk 24, prednisone was permitted to be tapered further to 5mg/day.* Subjects who achieved a complete response discontinued abatacept and switched to azathioprine placebo up to Wk 52 (to assess response durability). *Based on principal investigator [PI] judgment.</description>

          <description>Participants with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may have autoantibodies (e.g., self against self) to double-stranded DNA. Double-stranded DNA is one of multiple diagnostic tests for SLE and levels may be associated with disease activity. A positive test for autoantibodies to double-stranded DNA is based on the normal range from the local laboratory. Baseline is defined as the last measurement taken on or prior to the first day of dosing. Not all subjects had available data.</description>

Participants had to meet all of the referenced criteria to be considered a complete responder.
Partial response: a serum creatinine &lt;= 1.2 mg/dL or &lt;= to 125% of the higher value at either screening or baseline visit, and improvement &gt;= to 50% in the urine protein to creatinine ratio at either screening or baseline visit, and prednisone dose has been tapered to 10 mg/day or according to protocol dosing allowances in protocol.
Participants who discontinued treatment and/or terminated from the study were defined as response failures for all subsequent visits. CRs successfully responded to treatment and have minimal activity of their lupus nephritis. Partial responders showed some response to treatment and low activity of their lupus nephritis.</description>

        <title>Lupus Disease Activity – Participants Who Were Anti-dsDNA Positive at Baseline and Negative at Week 104</title>
        <description>Lupus disease activity was assessed by 7 different measures: reduction in anti-dsDNA, negative anti-dsDNA, resolution of hypocomplementemia (C3, C4), frequency of flares, patient global assessment, SF36 total scores, and BILAG-2004 scores.
Participants with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may have autoantibodies (e.g., self against self) to double-stranded DNA. Double-stranded DNA is one of multiple diagnostic tests for SLE and levels may be associated with disease activity. One measure used to assess disease activity is the number of participants who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline but negative at Week 104. Going from positive to negative is indicative of lowered lupus activity.</description>

        <title>Lupus Disease Activity – Frequency of Flares</title>
        <description>Lupus disease activity was assessed by 7 different measures: anti-dsDNA, negative anti-dsDNA, resolution of hypocomplementemia (C3, C4), frequency of flares, patient global assessment, SF36 total scores, and BILAG-2004 scores.
Flares can be renal or non-renal. A renal flare is defined as two successive evaluations at least 1 week apart as proteinuria &gt;1 gm/24h for participants who attain a complete response at Week 12 and for all other participants either 1) Increasing serum creatinine and persistent proteinuria, or 2) Worsening proteinuria. A non-renal flare is defined as any new post-baseline BILAG A in a non-renal organ system using BILAG-2004. This outcome measures the number of participants with the presence of renal and non-renal flares from Week 24 through Week 52 by response status. Having flares is indicative of more lupus disease activity.</description>

        <title>Lupus Disease Activity – SF-36 Scores</title>
        <description>Lupus disease activity was assessed by 7 different measures: anti-dsDNA, negative anti-dsDNA, resolution of hypocomplementemia (C3, C4), frequency of flares, patient global assessment, SF36 total scores, and BILAG-2004 scores.
The SF-36 is a quality of life assessment that was performed at Weeks 9, 24, 36, 52, and 104. Eight scale scores are derived from responses to the 36 items of the SF-36 questionnaire which were combined to produce the Physical Component Score and the Mental Component Score. The Physical Component Score is based on the Physical Functioning Scale (10 items), the Role-Physical Scale (4 items), the Bodily Pain Scale (2 items), and the General Health Scale (5 items). The Mental Component Score is based upon the Vitality Scale (4 items), the Social Functioning Scale (2 items), the Role-Emotional Scale (3 items) and the Mental Health Scale (5 items). Each component score is transformed into a 0-100 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater quality of life.</description>

Subjects also received: 1) cyclophosphamide 500 mg IV every 2 wks for 6 doses followed by azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day by mouth dosed by body weight at Visit 6 (rounded to the nearest 25 mg and to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for 16 wks; 2) prednisone 60 mg/day for the first 2 wks (subjects less than 60 kg could receive 1 mg/kg/day).* Prednisone was tapered until Wk 12 to a dose of 10 mg/day. This dose was continued until Wk 24 unless the subject had a prednisone-related toxicity requiring further reduction.* After Wk 24, prednisone was permitted to be tapered further to 5mg/day.* Subjects who achieved a complete response discontinued abatacept and switched to azathioprine placebo up to Wk 52 (to assess response durability). *Based on principal investigator [PI] judgment.</description>

          <title>Lupus Disease Activity – SF-36 Scores</title>
          <description>Lupus disease activity was assessed by 7 different measures: anti-dsDNA, negative anti-dsDNA, resolution of hypocomplementemia (C3, C4), frequency of flares, patient global assessment, SF36 total scores, and BILAG-2004 scores.
The SF-36 is a quality of life assessment that was performed at Weeks 9, 24, 36, 52, and 104. Eight scale scores are derived from responses to the 36 items of the SF-36 questionnaire which were combined to produce the Physical Component Score and the Mental Component Score. The Physical Component Score is based on the Physical Functioning Scale (10 items), the Role-Physical Scale (4 items), the Bodily Pain Scale (2 items), and the General Health Scale (5 items). The Mental Component Score is based upon the Vitality Scale (4 items), the Social Functioning Scale (2 items), the Role-Emotional Scale (3 items) and the Mental Health Scale (5 items). Each component score is transformed into a 0-100 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater quality of life.</description>

          <title>Abatacept</title>
          <description>Subjects received abatacept IV dosed according to body weight (&lt;60 kg, 500mg; 60-100 kg, 750 mg; or &gt;100 kg, 1 g) at the following visits: Weeks (wks) 0, 2, and 4, then every 4 wks until Wk 24. Subjects also received: 1) cyclophosphamide 500 mg IV every 2 wks for 6 doses followed by azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day by mouth dosed by body weight at Visit 6 (rounded to the nearest 25 mg and to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for 16 wks; 2) prednisone 60 mg/day for the first 2 wks (subjects less than 60 kg could receive 1 mg/kg/day).* Prednisone was tapered until Wk 12 to a dose of 10 mg/day. This dose was continued until Wk 24 unless the subject had a prednisone-related toxicity requiring further reduction.* After Wk 24, prednisone was permitted to be tapered further to 5mg/day.* Subjects who achieved a complete response discontinued abatacept and switched to azathioprine placebo up to Wk 52 (to assess response durability). *Based on principal investigator [PI] judgment.</description>
