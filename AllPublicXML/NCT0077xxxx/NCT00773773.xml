  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, serum proteomics study of men who are to undergo prostate biopsy. The
      purpose is to determine if proteomic profiles can be used to distinguish between men with
      prostate cancer on biopsy from men with no cancer on biopsy.

    <description>This study will enroll two groups of 250 patients who are to undergo prostatic biopsy as part of their routine medical care because of suspicion of prostate cancer (elevated PSA between 2 and 10 ng/ml, abnormal rectal examination, or both). The first group will contain 250 patients of African-American descent and the second will contain 250 Caucasian men.</description>

    <description>Patients referred for prostate biopsy as part of their routine care are to be recruited. Patients will undergo standard medical evaluation/care by undergoing a prostate biopsy because of an elevated PSA blood test and/or an abnormal digital rectal prostate examination. The protocol involves obtaining the research blood sample at the time of routine pre-biopsy blood draw. As such, an extra five (40 mL) tubes of blood will be drawn. The serum specimens obtained will be utilized for proteomic profiling comprising MALDI-TOF MS, and serum biomarker assays.</description>
