    <textblock>
      This study will compare the Adaptive Physical Activity program (APA) to a less vigorous group
      exercise program, (Sittercise) to see if APA leads to greater improvements in walking
      endurance, quality of life, and participation in social activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to translate the Italian APA exercise model into a sustainable,
      evidence-based VA community program of exercise for older adults with chronic stroke. The
      investigators' short-term objectives are to test study hypotheses using a Randomized Clinical
      Trial (RCT) with an Attention Control (also referred to as the &quot;Sittercise&quot; exercise
      program). The investigators will also explore factors related to exercise adherence in a
      community program for chronic stroke survivors. The investigators' longer term objective is
      to disseminate this model to facilitate the development of a network of community-based
      exercise programs for older adults with chronic stroke. In the RCT the investigators propose
      to offer courses in Office of Aging (OoA) Senior Centers and National Rehabilitation
      Hospital. At the conclusion of the research study, the OoA plans to continue offering
      APA-stroke courses. Through partnership, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the
      Administration of Aging (AoA) can potentially replicate this model at the community
      throughout the U.S. using local OoA Senior Centers and other facilities that would increase
      community access for Veterans.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total distance walked for 6 minutes (in meters) is the primary outcome measure. Participants use the same assistive devices and/or orthoses they use when walking across a parking lot. They are instructed to cover as much distance as they can over a flat 100 foot walking surface demarcated by traffic cones during the six minute time period. Change in distance covered is the outcome variable of interest for this study. Walking a greater distance (e.g. more meters during the 6 minute test) reflects improvement in walking speed and endurance. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance as Measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg is a widely used test for assessing balance and to predict fall risk in the elderly. It has been validated with patients post stroke. The Berg consists of 14 items, each graded on a scale of 0-4. Thus a score for the Berg could in theory range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 56. A score below 45 is indicative of balance impairment; thus the lower the score the greater the fall risk. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB, which is extensively used in stroke studies, includes three components and a composite score. Components include gait speed, a repeated chair stand, and a standing balance test. Scores for gait speed, chair stand, and total balance are calculated and then summed for the total score. Each component can range from 0-4 points, thus the maximum composite score can range from 0-12 points, with 0 reflecting the lowest functioning while a score of 12 indicates the subject reached the maximum measured competency in all three domains. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS Version 3.0 is a self report scale widely used to assess health status after stroke. It includes 59 items and assesses 8 domains (strength, hand function, ADL/IADL, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation/role function). The SIS uses a 5-point Likert Scale. Summative scores for each domain range from 0-100. Total scores range from 0 to 800. A higher score reflects better function. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>

Scores for gait speed, chair stand, and total balance are calculated and then summed for the total score. Each component can range from 0-4 points, thus the maximum composite score can range from 0-12 points, with 0 reflecting the lowest functioning while a score of 12 indicates the subject reached the maximum measured competency in all three domains.</description>

        <title>6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</title>
        <description>Total distance walked for 6 minutes (in meters) is the primary outcome measure. Participants use the same assistive devices and/or orthoses they use when walking across a parking lot. They are instructed to cover as much distance as they can over a flat 100 foot walking surface demarcated by traffic cones during the six minute time period. Change in distance covered is the outcome variable of interest for this study. Walking a greater distance (e.g. more meters during the 6 minute test) reflects improvement in walking speed and endurance. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>

        <description>The Berg is a widely used test for assessing balance and to predict fall risk in the elderly. It has been validated with patients post stroke. The Berg consists of 14 items, each graded on a scale of 0-4. Thus a score for the Berg could in theory range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 56. A score below 45 is indicative of balance impairment; thus the lower the score the greater the fall risk. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>

          <title>Balance as Measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</title>
          <description>The Berg is a widely used test for assessing balance and to predict fall risk in the elderly. It has been validated with patients post stroke. The Berg consists of 14 items, each graded on a scale of 0-4. Thus a score for the Berg could in theory range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 56. A score below 45 is indicative of balance impairment; thus the lower the score the greater the fall risk. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>

        <title>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</title>
        <description>The SPPB, which is extensively used in stroke studies, includes three components and a composite score. Components include gait speed, a repeated chair stand, and a standing balance test. Scores for gait speed, chair stand, and total balance are calculated and then summed for the total score. Each component can range from 0-4 points, thus the maximum composite score can range from 0-12 points, with 0 reflecting the lowest functioning while a score of 12 indicates the subject reached the maximum measured competency in all three domains. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>

It includes 59 items and assesses 8 domains (strength, hand function, ADL/IADL, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation/role function). The SIS uses a 5-point Likert Scale. Summative scores for each domain range from 0-100. Total scores range from 0 to 800. A higher score reflects better function. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effects ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>

APA-Stroke: Exercise program design specifically for individuals with residual hemiparetic gait deficits due to stroke. Exercises are progressive, beginning with a 5 minute walk at the beginning and end of each class and gradually progressing to a 15 minute walk at the beginning and end of each class. Exercises focus on walking and are designed to improve walking ability and balance. Program includes a homework component.</description>
