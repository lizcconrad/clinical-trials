      This is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way cross-over study.
      At each study visit a standardised treadmill test will be performed to provoke EIA. Before
      and after the challenge test pulmonary function variables (e.g. forced expiratory volume in
      one second (FEV1)) will be measured in order to assess the protective effect of the study
      medication.

      -  Primary objective: to demonstrate superiority of the protective effect of the fixed
           combination of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) plus reproterol in comparison to the single
           component reproterol in adults suffering from exercise induced asthma (EIA).

        -  Secondary objectives: to demonstrate superiority of the protective effect of DSCG plus
           reproterol in comparison to the single component DSCG; to demonstrate superiority of the
           protective effect of each single component in comparison to placebo. In addition, the
           tolerability of medications will be documented.

          -  Exercise induced asthma with reversible airway obstruction: twice proven EIA defined
             as maximum decrease in FEV1 against the baseline value of at least 20% (first test
             results can be obtained during the last 12 months)

          -  Baseline FEV1 before challenge must be &gt; or = 70% of the predicted FEV1

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Safety concerns:
