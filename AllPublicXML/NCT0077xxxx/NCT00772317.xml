      For the treatment of locally recurrent prostate cancer following failed external beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a non-randomized, prospective, single arm study. The safety and
      effectiveness of the Sonablate treatment in subjects with locally recurrent prostate cancer
      will be evaluated with regard to freedom from biochemical failure and disease recurrence
      following HIFU treatment.

      Men with histologically confirmed, locally recurrent, organ-confined, non-metastatic
      prostatic adenocarcinoma two or more years following EBRT, PSA ≥0.5 ng/mL and ≤10 ng/mL, 40
      to 85 years of age, and with initial staging of T1c-T2 prior to radiation, who meet the
      criteria for salvage treatment, will be enrolled.

      This pivotal study will cover pre-treatment through the 12-month post-treatment follow-up
      visit (8 visits).

      A 5 year extended follow-up study will be conducted annually for the 2nd-5th years post
      treatment (4 additional visits).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects with initial presentation of organ confined recurrent prostate cancer (Stages
             T1c and T2 only) who have been treated with EBRT (conventional, 3D conformal, or IMRT)
             or proton therapy, two or more years prior, and currently have biopsy proven local
             recurrence. Previous radiation therapy must be a documented therapeutic dose of 60 to
             81Gy or GyE (gray equivalent) for proton therapy;

          -  Negative bone scan within 6 months prior to enrollment to rule out possibility of
             metastases;

          -  Negative CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis within 6 months prior to
             enrollment to rule out possibility of metastases;

          -  age ≥40 years through ≤85 years of age;

          -  prostate biopsy with ≥10 core biopsies demonstrating 1 or more cores positive for
             cancer cells, within 6 months prior to treatment;

          -  prostate volume ≤ 40 gms(cc) (HIFU subject prostate volume will be initially
             calculated utilizing TRUS measurements during screening and verified with the use of
             the Sonablate before initiating the HIFU procedure. Patients with prostate volumes
             greater than 40 gm(cc) as determined by either measurement will not be enrolled in the
             study);

          -  AP diameter of the prostate must be ≤4.0cm;

          -  serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) ≥0.5 ng/mL and ≤10 ng/mL;

          -  &gt;90 days post hormone therapy usages, subjects who have or are currently undergoing
             hormone therapy (GnRH agonist/antagonist) must discontinue hormone therapy and go
             through a 90 day washout period prior to consideration for study participation, and
             must remain off hormone therapy throughout the duration of the follow-up period (5
             years);

          -  signed informed consent for the HIFU treatment study through the 12 month follow-up
             visit (7 visits) and then through the extended follow-up period of 5 years (4
             additional visits);

             imaging;

             (Proscar) or Dutasteride (Avodart);

          -  a debulking transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is not acceptable once the
