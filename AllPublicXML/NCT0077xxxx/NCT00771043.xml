    <textblock>
      Phase IV, proof-of-concept, randomized, open-label, multi-center, two-arm, 9-month study to
      evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Natalizumab (TYSABRIÂ®) or Interferon beta-1a
      (AVONEXÂ®) treatments initiated at the time of acute optic neuritis (AON) as measured by RNFL
      thickness from Optical Coherence Tomography in patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis (RRMS).
