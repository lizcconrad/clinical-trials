  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blinded clinical trial comparing overnight laminaria versus same-day
      Dilapan for cervical preparation for surgical abortions occurring between fourteen and
      eighteen weeks gestation. Comparisons will be made between procedure time, need for
      additional dilation, occurrence of complications, and patient and provider satisfaction.

      Hypothesis:

      Cervical preparation for surgical abortion, between fourteen and eighteen weeks gestation,
      with same-day Dilapan is non-inferior to cervical preparation with overnight laminaria within
      a five-minute difference.

      Primary objective:

      Determine differences in procedure times

      Secondary objectives:

      Examine complications, and need for additional dilation between early second-trimester
      surgical abortions performed after cervical preparation with same-day Dilapan versus those
      performed after cervical preparation with overnight laminaria

            <groups_desc>Null Hypothesis: A surgical abortion performed between 14-18 weeks gestation performed after the cervix has been prepared with same-day Dilapan-S is inferior with respect to procedure time, which is specifically outside a five minute margin of non-inferiority, when compared to procedures during the same gestational duration range performed after the cervix has been prepared overnight with laminaria.</groups_desc>
            <non_inferiority_type>Non-Inferiority or Equivalence</non_inferiority_type>
            <non_inferiority_desc>Power: We assumed a standard deviation of five minutes based on historical clinic data for surgical abortions during this gestational duration range, a non-inferiority margin of five minutes, and a 10% potential attrition rate to power the study for a non-inferiority hypothesis. Thirty participants in each arm gave us 95% power to conclude non-inferiority of same day Dilapan-S compared to overnight laminaria with respect to procedure time of surgical abortions between 14-18 weeks gestation.</non_inferiority_desc>
