      The purpose of this study is to investigate neurobehavioral, affective, and social processes
      that may influence and predict treatment response in pediatric anxiety disorders.

      This protocol proposes to study neurobehavioral and social correlates of treatment response
      in 200 youth (ages 9-13) with general anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder
      (SAD), and social phobia (SP). All youth with an anxiety disorder will receive 14 weeks of
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Client Centered Therapy (CCT) for child anxiety
      disorders. The study combines state-of-the-art measures from affective neuroscience,
      ecologically valid (EMA) measures of mood and behavior in natural environments, and measures
      of family and social context within a developmentally framed treatment study. The study
      design focuses on predictors and mechanisms of treatment response. This protocol will test
      key features of a &quot;vigilance-avoidance&quot; model focusing on hypotheses that pretreatment neural
      correlates of affective reactivity will predict treatment response and early changes in
      emotional processing will correlate with clinical response during treatment. In addition, the
      protocol examines how affective experiences within the family and social context are
      associated with treatment response and change across treatment, and how these are associated
      with and interact with neurobehavioral changes in affective functioning. Taken together these
      aspects of the study will advance understanding of the neurobehavioral, affective, and social
      processes that underpin treatment response in ways that will inform the design, refinement,
      and optimal developmental timing of cognitive behavioral treatments, and thus, decrease the
      morbidity, mortality, and lifetime impairments from these common disorders in youth.
