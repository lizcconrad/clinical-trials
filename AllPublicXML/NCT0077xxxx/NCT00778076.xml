  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a regular course of treatment with
      Hyaluronic acid (HA) injections on gait in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Three
      consecutive HA injections will be compared to three consecutive placebo injections to
      determine whether HA's analgesic effect is greater than that of a placebo injection, and to
      observe whether HA's viscoelastic properties are manifested in a human knee OA population. We
      hypothesize that HA injections will relieve pain to a greater extent than placebo injections
      in knee OA patients, and will afford them with improved walking characteristics, such as
      increased walking speed, and step length.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a severely debilitating disease associated with stiffness and
      pain in the knee joint, and with a loss of function. Hyaluronic acid (HA) injections are
      incorporated into non-surgical standard of care for knee OA patients and have been proven to
      relieve pain in patients who have not received symptomatic relief with other knee OA
      interventions. HA allows synovial fluid to act as a lubricant and shock absorber for joints,
      and although this is encouraging ground to advocate for the use of HA treatment in knee OA
      patients, these properties have yet to be proven in a controlled clinical trial setting.
      Therefore, we are undertaking this study to observe whether the physiological adaptation in
      the OA knee joint, initiated by HA injection, will result in biomechanical improvements in
      human knee OA patients, specifically walking mechanics.
