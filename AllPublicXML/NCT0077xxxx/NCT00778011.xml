    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting is a common complaint in the emergency department. Treatment is important
      for many reasons. In addition to patient comfort, there are adverse effects secondary to
      vomiting such as dehydration, metabolic alkalosis, Mallory-Weiss tears, and aspiration. Two
      mediations common used for nausea in ED patients include Ondanesetron and Metoclopramide.

      This study will compare Ondansetron 4 mg vs 2 mg vs Metoclopramide 10 mg to look for efficacy
      in nausea and vomiting treatment for patients in the ED with many different causes. We will
      also look for cost effectiveness as well, since Metoclopramide is much less expensive than
      Ondansetron, which is less expensive at lower doses. There is little research about nausea
      medication in the ED literature even though these medications are used frequently in the ED
      for many causes of nausea.
