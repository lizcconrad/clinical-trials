      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending single oral
      doses of bosutinib administered with multiple doses of ketoconazole and to provide the
      pharmacokinetic profile of bosutinib when administered with multiple doses of ketoconazole
      and with food in healthy adult subjects.
