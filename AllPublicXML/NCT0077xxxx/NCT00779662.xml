  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an epidemiological observational cross-sectional study designed to estimate the
      prevalence of echocardiographically confirmed RHD in school children from 5-14 years of age
      in Fiji. The study will be conducted in the Central Division of Fiji within a selection of up
      to16 primary schools located in the Korovou/Tailevu and Rewa/Nausori sub-divisions. School
      children will be enrolled after informed consent has been obtained. A standard cardiac
      examination (auscultation) will be performed as part of the routine annual health check by
      both school nurses, who have attended a training workshop, and by a paediatrician. All
      children with or without murmur will have a screening echocardiogram performed at a
      subsequent visit. Children found to have possible, probable or definite RHD or other cardiac
      pathology on the screening echocardiogram, will have a full echocardiogram performed by the
      echocardiography technician at the time of the second study visit. They will all also be
      referred to a paediatric cardiologist for further investigation and management and monitoring
      . Cases of RHD will be referred to and followed up by the National Fiji RHD register based at
      CWMH in Suva.
