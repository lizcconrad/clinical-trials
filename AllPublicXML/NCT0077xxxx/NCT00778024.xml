      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of fluoxetine HCL 40
      mg capsules (by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited) with that of PROZAC® 40 mg capsules (by Dista
      Products Company) following a single oral dose (1 x 40 mg capsule) in healthy, adult subjects
      under fasting conditions

      This is a single-dose, open-label, randomized two-way crossover study to evaluate the
      bioequivalence of a test formulation, versus an equivalent dose of a commercially available
      reference drug product, in 36 adult subjects, under fasted conditions. Drug administrations
      are separated by at least 49 days.

      Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse rate) were obtained at baseline (Hour 0), and
      at post-dose Hours 3, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 360, and 1056.

      Of the 36 subjects enrolled into the study, 31 subjects completed the study in its entirety.
      Five (5) subjects were dropped out from the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Sex: Male and Female; similar proportion of each preferred.

          2. Age: At least 18 years.

          3. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by
             medical history, complete physical examination, and laboratory tests, all obtained
             within four (4) weeks prior to study start. The subject may not have a history of
             significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. The normal status of
             subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures:

             • Laboratory Tests: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, differential count, serum
             electrolytes (Na, K, CL), fasting blood glucose, BUN, bilirubin, creatinine, AST, ALT,
             LD, alkaline phosphatase, and urinalysis. HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of
             abuse testing will be done for screening purposes only. Urine drugs of abuse testing
             will be repeated at each check-in. Female subjects will have a serum pregnancy test
             done at screening and urine pregnancy test prior to each study period at check-in.
             Laboratory values which are greater than :E20% of the normal range will not qualify
             unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the Principal Investigator. Results of
             HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse must be negative or non-reactive for
             the subject to qualify for the study.

             • Electrocardiogram: A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all
             subjects. The original tracings, plus interpretation, will be included in the case
             report form packet.

          4. Subjects must read and sign the Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects not complying with the above inclusion criteria must be excluded from the
             study.

          2. In addition, any one of the conditions listed below will exclude a subject from the
             study:

               -  History of treatment for alcoholism, substance abuse, or drug abuse within past
                  24 months.

               -  History of malignancy, stroke, diabetes, cardiac, renal or liver disease, or
                  other serious illness.

               -  History of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), malabsorption syndrome, colon
                  cancer, or chronic colitis, including Crohn's disease.

               -  History of treatment for astlzurta within the past five (5) years.

               -  History of neurological impairment.

               -  History of seizures.

               -  History of Parkinson's Disease.

               -  History of diabetes mellitus.

               -  Females who are pregnant or lactating.

               -  History of hypersensitivity to fluoxetine HCL, or any serotonin reuptake
                  inhibitor.

          3. Conditions upon screening which might contraindicate or require that caution be used
             in the administration of fluoxetlne HCL, including:

               -  Sitting systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, or diastolic Pressure below 50 mm
                  Hg.

               -  Heart rate less than 50 beats per minute after a 5-minute rest

          4. Inability to read and/or sign the consent form.

          5. Treatment with any other investigational drug during the four (4) weeks prior to the
             initial dosing for this study.

          6. Subjects who have donated blood within four (4) weeks prior to the Initial dosing for
             this study.
