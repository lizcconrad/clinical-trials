  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immune response of healthy subjects who received neonatal
      vaccination course with GSK Biologicals' Engerix™-B vaccine, approximately 20 years ago. The
      presence of immune memory against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in these subjects will
      be investigated by the administration of a challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine and the
      comparison of their antibody concentration before and one month after vaccination.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. No new
      subjects will be recruited during this booster phase of the study.
