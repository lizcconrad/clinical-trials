  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure the levels of ceftobiprole in the blood,
      urine and tissues of the lungs during and after administration of four doses of ceftobiprole.
      Safety of the drug will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a intravenous dose of ceftobiprole infused over 4 hours. Multiple blood
      samples will be obtained to determine the concentration of Ceftobiprole in the blood.
      Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples will be collected to determine the concentration of
      ceftobiprole in the BAL fluid. The penetration of the drug into the lung will be calculated.
      Four 1000mg administered every 8 hours
