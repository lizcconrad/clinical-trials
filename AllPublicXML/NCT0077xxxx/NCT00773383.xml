  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study in patients with advanced Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who have progressive
      disease after deriving clinical benefit (defined as response or stable disease after 12
      weeks) from second or third line Tarceva monotherapy will determine the proportion of
      patients with progression-free survival at 12 weeks following combination therapy with R1507
      and Tarceva. Patients will receive R1507 (9mg/kg iv) weekly in combination with Tarceva
      (150mg oral daily) for up to a maximum of 24 months. Other disease-related endpoints
      including overall survival, objective response rate, time to response, time to progressive
      disease and duration of response will also be evaluated. The anticipated time on study
      treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is progression-free survival at 12 weeks after start of therapy. A progression-free survival rate at 12 weeks will be calculated, with patients categorized in a dichotomous manner as alive and progression-free or in progression or dead at 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Objective response is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that has been confirmed by a second tumor assessment no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial documentation. Response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)criteria.

    <description>This is defined similarly for complete and partial responders. Complete response or partial response lasts from the date the complete response or partial response was first recorded to the date on which progressive disease is first noted or date of death. If a patient does not progress or die while being followed, the date of the last valid tumor assessment will be taken.

    <description>A fasting glucose was required at baseline, and random non-fasting glucose testing was performed weekly for the first 6 weeks followed by day 1 of each 3 week treatment phase. The number of participants with the highest post-baseline fasting glucose level at any time point post baseline relative to the participant's baseline glucose level is reported.</description>

To determine HAHA specificity, screened positive samples were tested in a confirmatory assay in the presence of 10 ug/mL R1507. Samples with &gt; 19.7% inhibition were considered true positives, whereas those with &lt; 19.7% inhibition were considered to be false positives.</description>

    <description>12 lead ECG is required at baseline and will be measured during the trial as clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigators. For each reading, QTcF value will be calculated as the QT value (seconds) divided by the cube root of the RR interval in seconds (Fridericia correction). A listing will be generated showing, for each patient, the visits at which ECGs were taken and the results (normal or abnormal, as well as any comments provided).</description>
