    <description>A dose escalating study in a 3 + 3 design will be performed. At MTD dose 14 additional patients will be treated. First, the optimal dose of sunitinib in a continuous schedule will be determined, thereafter, further dose escalation of capecitabine and irinotecan will be investigated.</description>
