    <textblock>
      Women with metastatic breast cancer are usually treated with anthracyclines (ie, doxorubicin
      or epirubicin) but cardiac toxicity limits their use. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of Caelyx in combination with cyclophosphamide in women with
      metastatic breast cancer who have received adjuvant anthracyclines with or without a taxane.
