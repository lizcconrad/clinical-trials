  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is a feasible arrangement to have women receive
      their second and third birth control injection (with Depo-Provera) at a pharmacy compared
      with receiving it a Planned Parenthood Clinic. Compliance with returning for injections as
      well as patient satisfaction with the method, providers, and location where injection was
      received will be assessed and compared between the two sites. The hypothesis is that there
      will be no difference in return rates for injections at either the pharmacy or the clinic
      site.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who want to use or are currently using Depo-Provera for contraception will be
      randomized to receive their next two injections either back at the Planned Parenthood clinic
      or at a local pharmacy where pharmacists are trained to give injections. After each
      injection, women will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their attitudes about
      the method of birth control, their providers, and the location where they received the
      injection.
