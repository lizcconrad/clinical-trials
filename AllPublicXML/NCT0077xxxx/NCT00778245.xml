    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the single - dose relative bioavailability of
      Ranbaxy and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (CEFZIL ®) 500 mg cefprozil tablets, under fed
      conditions.

    <textblock>
      A single dose, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence crossover study design was
      used to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the cefprozil tablet products when dosed (1
      x 500 mg) under fed conditions. The washout period will be at least 14 days between doses.

      Twenty four plus two alternate (24 + 2) subjects were enrolled in this study and all
      volunteers were healthy adults. Twenty six (24 + 2) subjects began the study, and twenty-five
      (23 + 2) subjects completed the clinical portion of the study in its entirety.
