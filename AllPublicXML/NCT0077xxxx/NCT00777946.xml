    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Study in the Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using the automatic Blood Pressure monitor and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure for that visit. The difference of the msDBP at baseline from the msDBP at 8 weeks was calculated using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline as a covariate and treatment and region as two factors.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using the automatic Blood Pressure monitor and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure for that visit.
Blood Pressure control was defined as having a mean sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure &lt;90 and a mean sitting Systolic Blood Pressure &lt;140.</description>

        <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using the automatic Blood Pressure monitor and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure for that visit. The difference of the msDBP at baseline from the msDBP at 8 weeks was calculated using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline as a covariate and treatment and region as two factors.</description>

        <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using the automatic Blood Pressure monitor and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure for that visit.
A Diastolic Blood Pressure Response was defined as a mean sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) &lt;90 mmHg or a ≥ 10 mmHg reduction in msDBP from baseline.</description>
