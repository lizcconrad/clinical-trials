  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if putting local anesthetic through one or
      two percutaneous catheters placed next to the nerves that go to an amputated limb will
      decrease long-term pain in the amputated limb.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition
      of multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks decrease the incidence and
      severity of post-amputation phantom limb and stump pain.

      Hypothesis 1: Following upper or lower extremity amputation, the incidence of phantom limb
      and/or stump pain will be significantly decreased four weeks following multiple-day
      ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks as compared with patients receiving
      standard-of-care treatment.

      Hypothesis 2: Following upper or lower extremity amputation, the severity of phantom limb
      and/or stump pain will be significantly decreased four weeks following multiple-day
      ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks as compared with patients receiving
      standard-of-care treatment (as measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale).
