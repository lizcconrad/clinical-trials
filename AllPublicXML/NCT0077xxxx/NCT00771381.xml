  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In about half the cases of breast cancer, there is hypoxic (no, or little oxygen) tissue
      present. Hypoxic cells can be resistant to treatment and may cause increased tumour growth.
      This study will use 18F-FAZA PET scans before surgery or treatment to assess whether patients
      have hypoxic tumours. The results will be compared to tissue samples removed during surgery
      and to the distribution of 18F-FDG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia or anoxia can be found in 50% of locally advanced breast carcinomas. Assessment of
      pre-treatment in viva and in vitro hypoxia could allow patient selection for more aggressive
      therapy or clinical trails focused on targeting hypoxia. We will use the PET radiotracer
      18F-FAZA to monitor hypoxia in the protocol. We will study pathological characteristics on
      the final tumour restriction specimen and correlate prognostic and predictive factors with
      PET scan data. Tumour banking is optional.
