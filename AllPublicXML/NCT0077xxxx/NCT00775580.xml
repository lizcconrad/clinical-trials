    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the bioequivalence of atenolol formulations after
      administration of single doses to normal healthy subjects under fasted conditions. These data
      were to be evaluated statistically to determine if the products meet bioequivalence criteria.

      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioequivalence study on atenolol comparing atenolol
      100mg tablets of Ranbaxy with Tenormin 100mg capsules in healthy, adult, human, subjects
      under fasting conditions.

      A total of 36 non-smoking subjects (26 men and 10 women) were included in this study, of

             physician. Any nonprescription medication consumption reported will be reviewed by the
             investigator(s) prior to dosing. At the discretion of the investigator(s), these
             volunteers may be enrolled if the medication is not anticipated to alter study
             integrity.

          7. Regular smoking of more than 5 cigarettes daily or the daily use of
             nicotine-containing products beginning 3 months before study medication administration
             through the final evaluation.

          8. If female, the subject is lactating or has a positive pregnancy test at screening and
             prior to each of the treatment periods. Females must use a medically acceptable method
             of contraception throughout the entire study period and for one week after the study
             is completed. Medically acceptable methods of contraception that may be used by the
             subject and/or her partner are: oral contraceptives/patches, progestin injection or
             implants, condom with spermacide, diaphragm with spermacide, IUD, vaginal
             spermicidal/hormonal suppository, surgical sterilization of themselves or their
             partner(s) or abstinence. Females taking oral contraceptives must have taken them
             consistently for at least three months prior to receiving study medication.
