      Structural fat grafting is a form of tissue transfer where the autologous fat is harvested
      and subsequently transferred to a different region of the body at the same setting. It is an
      excellent technique for filling soft tissue and contour defects. Fat has the benefit of being
      abundantly available and easy to harvest. Further more, it is cheap and autogenous and thus
      lacks the side effects of synthetic fillers or implants. Autogenous fat transfer is a
      relatively common procedure performed by plastic and reconstructive surgeons. The goal of fat
      grafting is to provide the patient with a predictable, long lasting autogenous soft tissue
      augmentation. Autogenous fat transfer has been used extensively as an adjunct to facial
      rejuvenation. As well it has been applied to body contouring and augmentation of the hips,
      trochanteric areas, thighs and buttocks, back, torso and breast. The transfer of autologous
      fat dates back to 1890s and more specifically as injectable grafts since the 1920s. However,
      over the past 20 years the popularity of structural fat grafting has increased as a
      contouring modality. Fat transfer to the breast, popularized by Coleman, has been performed
      internationally since the 1990s. Despite the duration, the literature lacks accurate outcomes
      data on fat transfer to the breast and questions regarding the viability of adipocytes after
      the transfer exist. Sources from various publications show cell viability of up to 100%
      however studies of long term clinical outcomes quote rates of 10% to 80%.

      Our goal with this study is to prospectively acquire information with our protocol that will
      outline the accurate long-term outcomes of fat transfer to the breast. Currently, fat
      grafting to the breast is a treatment option in conditions such as micromastia, breast
      ptosis, post mastectomy breast reconstruction, asymmetric breasts, congenital malformations
      of breast development and for treatment of complications associated with implant augmentation
      mammoplasty. In addition to fat grafting, the current surgical treatment for these conditions
      is mainly based on techniques requiring implant augmentation or reconstruction. Although the
      safety of saline implants has been well studied and documented, this data cannot be
      extrapolated for the newer generation silicone implants and other alternatives such as fat
      grafting need to be investigated. Also implant augmentation and reconstruction comes at the
      price of capsular contracture, implant deflation, infection and more future corrective
      surgeries. We plan to prospectively study the outcomes of fat grafting in patients with these
      conditions for a period of 5 years. The collected information will be entered into a database
      and will be prospectively collected and reviewed. Patients demographics, information obtained
      during the preoperative and postoperative visits along with the pertinent findings regarding
      the fat transfer to the breast will be collected into the database for our investigation.
