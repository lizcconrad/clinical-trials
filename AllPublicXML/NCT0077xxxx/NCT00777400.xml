  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot trial is to determine whether a conversion from calcineurin
      inhibitors (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to a regimen consisting of efalizumab and
      sirolimus is associated with an increase in T regulatory cells, white cells that control the
      immune system and can prevent autoimmune diseases like arthritis or rejection of foreign
      organs,and does not result in an increase in acute rejection.

      The objective of this pilot trial is to determine whether the conversion from calcineurin
      inhibitors (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to efalizumab and sirolimus is associated
      with an increase in T regulatory cells and does not result in an increase in acute rejection
      following conversion. CNIs are associated with progressive nephrotoxicity, increased
      cardiovascular risk factor as well as an inhibitory effect on T regulatory cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine if the combination of efalizumab and sirolimus results in a significant increase
      in T regulatory cells. A hundred percent increase in T regulatory cells will be determined to
      be an important biologic effect of the combination of efalizumab and sirolimus.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the feasibility of the conversion from CNI/MMF to efalizumab/sirolimus and to
      determine that this combination is safe and effective

      To determine if there is an increase in FoxP3 mRNA in the urine of converted patients. Urine
      FoxP3 is believed to correlate with T regs in the kidney.

    <description>Efalizumab will be started on Day 0 until the end of the study at Week 24. At the end of the first week, after efalizumab is started, cyclosporine or tacrolimus will be decreased by 50% and at 2 weeks the dose of cyclosporine or tacrolimus will be completely discontinued. At 12 weeks Cellcept or myfortic will be discontinued and the patient will be converted to sirolimus for the remainder of the study.</description>
