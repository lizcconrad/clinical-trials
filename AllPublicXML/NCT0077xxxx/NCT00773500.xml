  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to determine the effects of electronic prescribing on medication safety
      including medication errors, near misses and preventable adverse drug events in the
      ambulatory setting. Study design will be a longitudinal evaluation of errors early after
      implementation and after sustained use.

    <textblock>
      We will compare the effects of different vendor-based electronic prescribing systems on
      ambulatory medication safety in various settings, including rural and underserved areas and
      determine the effects of electronic prescribing systems on ambulatory medication safety over
      time.

        Our study will take place in 2 NYS communities. We will select 2 communities in order to
        assemble a study population with the following characteristics: use of at least 2 different
        vendor-based systems, different implementation times (with some communities being early
        adopters and others experienced users), and inclusion of urban underserved and federally
        defined rural areas.

        We will select the following 2 communities/organizations: the community health centers
        implementing electronic prescribing with the New York City Department of Health (NYC DOH)
        and the Taconic Health Information Network and Community (THINC) in the Hudson Valley of
        New York. Both communities have expressed their interest in participating in this study.
