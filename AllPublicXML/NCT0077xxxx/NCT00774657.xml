  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This preliminary study will compare the effectiveness of two-dimensional and
      three-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of wall thickness and left ventricular mass
      in patients with Aortic Stenosis

      This study will evaluate left ventricular patterns of remodeling and hypertrophy in patients
      with aortic stenosis, and compare two-dimensional echocardiography measurements (wall
      thickness) with three-dimensional echocardiography data(left ventricular mass). Along with a
      second objective to assess Doppler diastolic filling indices associated with the various
      patterns of left ventricular remodeling.

      Previous studies(see reference list) were primarily derived from two-dimensional echo data
      set(based on wall thickness). Various patterns of left ventricular remodeling have been
      described in response to increased pressure overload.

      Three-dimensional echocardiography is a relatively new technique that is being increasingly
      used in the Echocardiography Lab in selected patients. This technique holds promise of being
      more accurate for volume-related measurements than the standard 2-dimensional
      echocardiography techniques.
