  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response to MUC1 - poly-ICLC vaccine, an
      investigational or study vaccine. The MUC1 - poly-ICLC vaccine is being tested in persons
      with a history of advanced adenomatous polyps, the precursor to colorectal cancer. The MUC1 -
      poly-ICLC vaccine is being developed to prevent polyps from advancing into colon cancer and
      to prevent polyps from recurring.

      MUC1 is mucus that is normally present on the lining of the human colon. However, MUC1 is
      expressed in a larger amount and in a modified form on adenomatous polyps and colorectal
      cancer. These changes in MUC1 are thought to be part of the process of progression from
      adenomas toward cancer. The goal of a vaccine is to help the immune system in the body
      identify the changes in MUC1 that accompany the progression to cancer and eliminate the
      abnormal cells that make abnormal MUC1.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a phase II trial designed to assess antibody and T cell responses to MUC1 vaccine
      among subjects at increased risk for colorectal cancer by virtue of a history of advanced
      adenoma. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of a combination of the
      100mer MUC1 peptide and adjuvant Poly-ICLC in boosting the immune response to MUC1. Among the
      secondary objectives is to determine if anti-MUC1 immunity, preexisting or vaccine induced,
      has an effect on the recurrence of polyps. Subjects with a history of advanced adenoma will
      be recruited for MUC1 vaccination. Vaccine will be administered at weeks 0, 2, and 10. Some
      subjects may have pre-existing immunity to MUC1, and this will be accounted for in the
      analytic phase. However, all subjects will be administered the vaccine, regardless of
      baseline antibody status. To insure accurate standardization in measurement and assessment of
      antibody levels, assays for baseline antibody status will be done at the same time as those
      for response to vaccine.

          -  Pregnant women, because the teratogenic or abortifacient effects of the study agents
             remain incompletely defined. Breastfeeding women, because there is an unknown but
