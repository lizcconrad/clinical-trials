  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the common complications after stem cell
      transplant. This is a complication, which happens when the new stem cells from the donor
      attack other cells in the body of the transplant recipient.

      Recently, an antibody (protein) called alemtuzumab or Campath has been found to be effective
      in the prevention of Graft vs. Host Disease.

      Previous studies have shown a low risk of GVHD with alemtuzumab, however the risk of disease
      recurrence was high. Previous studies have used a high dose of alemtuzumab. The purpose of
      this study is:

        -  To find if by lowering the dose of alemtuzumab, can serious GVHD be prevented without
           increasing the risk of relapse (your condition getting worse).

        -  To find whether low dose of alemtuzumab in combination with cyclosporine can prevent
           GVHD more effectively when compared to current standard of care and does not increase
           the risk of recurrence.
