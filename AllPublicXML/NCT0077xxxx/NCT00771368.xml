          -  Must be 19 years of age or over

          -  Must have an ulcer or lesion in which the presence of MRSA has been positively
             identified but which is not clinically infected.

          -  Must have an Ulcer / Lesion size not to extend beyond the inner borders of the wound
             cover

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of child bearing potential who is not using

          -  Has been using systemic antibiotics during 7 days prior to enrolment into this study.

          -  Has an Ulcer / Lesion which is identified as malignant in origin (e.g., Marjolin's
             ulcer)

          -  Has an Ulcer / Lesion size beyond the inner borders of the wound cover

          -  Is septic or has other signs of an invasive infection
