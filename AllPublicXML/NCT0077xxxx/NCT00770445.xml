      The purpose of this study is to determine the Anti-Inflammation Effects of Pioglitazone,
      twice daily (BID), and Pioglitazone/Metformin Combination Therapy BID in Type 2 Diabetes
      Subjects Treated with Insulin.

    <textblock>
      It is established that matrix metalloproteinases play an essential role in the degradation of
      collagen and other extra cellular matrix macromolecules. In addition, matrix
      metalloproteinases are implicated in plaque rupture through their capacity to thin the
      protective cap of the plaque, thus rendering it more vulnerable. In fact, matrix
      metalloproteinase-9 levels are elevated in patients with unstable plaques and in patients
      with acute coronary syndrome. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, matrix
      metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels are usually elevated and the
      atherosclerotic plaques are more vulnerable compared to non-diabetic patients, confirming the
      role of this proteinase in the development of acute coronary syndrome. Therefore, therapeutic
      strategies that reduce blood glucose levels and attenuate inflammation and matrix
      metalloproteinases activity may be a tool for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with
      diabetes.

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether the anti-inflammatory effects of
      pioglitazone are maintained and sustained over a longer observation period when given in
      combination with insulin in comparison to the metformin plus insulin combination. The
      duration of treatment for patients completing the study is approximately 6 months.
