      This will be a multi-center, Phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib in combination with
      131I-tositumomab in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bortezomib will be
      administered to patients twice weekly, with the first dose being given two days prior to the
      treatment dose of 131I-tositumomab, and the second dose two days after RIT for a total of 5
      doses.

      Patients will be enrolled and undergo standard staging studies, including history, physical
      examination, complete blood count, serum chemistries and LDH, TSH, HAMA, iliac crest bone
      marrow biopsy, and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. All patients will provide
      written informed consent.

      Bortezomib will be evaluated at 4 dose levels (0.30 mg/m2, 0.60 mg/m2, 0.90 mg/m2, and 1.2
      mg/m2) and 131I-tositumomab at 2 dose levels (50 cGy and 75 cGy TBD). Bortezomib will be
      administrated the day prior to 131I-tositumomab and twice weekly thereafter for 4 doses in
      order to provide proteasome inhibition throughout the period of 131I-tositumomab activity.
      The intention is to use 131I-tositumomab at full dose if possible. Therefore, the 50cGy dose
      will be used only with the lowest dose of bortezomib in case of unexpected toxicities with
      the combination.

      Dose levels will be as follow:

        1. 0.30mg/m2 bortezomib and 50cGy 131I-tositumomab,

        2. 0.30 mg/m2 bortezomib and 75 cGy 131I-tositumomab,

        3. 0.60 mg/m2 bortezomib and 75 cGy 131I-tositumomab,

        4. 0.90 mg/m2 bortezomib and 75 cGy 131I-tositumomab, and

        5. 1.2 mg/m2 bortezomib and 75 cGy 131I-tositumomab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically proven relapsed or refractory MCL, DLBCL including
             subtypes mediastinal large B cell, centroblastic, immunoblastic, T cell rich B cell
             and anaplastic large B cell lymphoma, or low grade B cell NHL.

          -  Patients must have received prior systemic therapy for their lymphoma.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is

             ECG abnormality at screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically
             relevant.

          -  Patient has hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol.
