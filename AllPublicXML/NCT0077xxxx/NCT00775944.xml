    <textblock>
      This study shall determine whether or not proactive telephone support for smoking cessation
      delivered to quitline callers is more effective than standard 'reactive' provision and
      whether or not the offer of a voucher for a cost free supply of nicotine replacement therapy
      (NRT) has any additional impact on smoking cessation rates achieved by behavioural
      interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence from other studies that telephone helplines are effective in helping
      individuals to stop smoking. This study will investigate whether or not two interventions
      that have been proven effective in other contexts are effective when offered via telephone
      helplines. The two interventions which will be tested are (1) additional proactive
      counselling via telephone(several calls from a trained smoking cessation advisor over a
      certain period) and (2) the offer of Nicotine Replacement Therapy.

      This trial will determine whether or not: (1)additional (proactive) telephone support for
      smoking cessation delivered to users of the National Health Service (NHS)Smoking Helpline, is
      more effective than standard support given by the helpline, and (2) whether the offer of free
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy influences rates of stopping smoking in individuals receiving
      either standard (reactive) or proactive telephone support.

      Current smokers over 16 years of age will be recruited by helpline staff with the appropriate
      consent. Participants will then be randomised into one of four groups:

      (i) usual care delivered by the helpline (called the Together Programme) (ii) usual care plus
      a programme of proactive telephone counselling (iii) usual care AND the offer of Nicotine
      Replacement Therapy (NRT) (iv) usual helpline support, proactive telephone counselling AND
      the offer of NRT.

      The researchers will not be aware of which group participants have been allocated. The
      results will determine if the use of proactive telephone counselling is effective in helping
      individuals to stop smoking. It shall also find out if the offer of NRT medication via a
      telephone helpline assists individuals in their efforts to stop smoking.
