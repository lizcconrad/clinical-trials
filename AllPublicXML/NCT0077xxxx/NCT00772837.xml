  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori eradication and its impact on symptoms in patients with non-ulcer
      dyspepsia remain controversial . Many studies have examined the effect of H. pylori
      eradication on dyspeptic symptoms, but the results have been conflicting and inconclusive,
      with as many studies yielding positive as negative results. Some studies have shown a
      significant (although weak) symptomatic improvement after H. pylori eradication, and while
      other yielding negative results. A recent Cochrane review has comprehensively demonstrated
      that H.pylori eradication therapy has a small but statistically significant effect in
      H.pylori positive non-ulcer dyspepsia. An economic model suggests this modest benefit may
      still be cost effective . However it is difficult to reconcile these results in areas with
      very high prevalence of H. pylori infection such as Pakistan since no such studies have been
      conducted in developing countries.

      The investigators hypothesize that eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) leads to a
      sustained improvement in symptoms of patients diagnosed with H. pylori associated functional
      (non-ulcer) dyspepsia.
