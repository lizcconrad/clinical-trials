      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a pain training program and systematic
      measurement of pain scores on actual pain levels and the use of analgesics in critically ill
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systematic evaluation of pain, though still not common practice in all ICUs, is recommended
      in clinical practice guidelines for optimal pain management. Pain is a frequently experienced
      problem in patients in the Intensive Care Unit(ICU). In search of literature to support the
      need for introduction of a pain management system and to train the entire health staff in our
      department little information was found concerning the effects of pain training and pain
      management systems in the ICU. The small number of available studies may be explained by the
      difficulty of systematic pain measurement in ICU patients, mainly due to the inability to
      communicate effectively with these patients.
