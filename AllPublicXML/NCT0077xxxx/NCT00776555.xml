    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare subjective drug liking using the Drug Rating
      Questionnaire, subject version (DRQ-S), question 2 and pharmacokinetics of Vyvanse™ and
      ADDERALL XR® when administered as an oral solution.

      Hypothesis: DRQ-S, question 2 will show no difference between the two drugs

    <description>Study is a two-period cross-over design where subjects will have 2 Screening visits, a Baseline visit, and then be enrolled into the study for 2 Periods. Each Period has 2-3 visits and lasts from 2-6 weeks. At each Period visit subjects will be given one of the two treatment arm drugs that have been solubilized and then have blood drawn for pharmacokinetic analysis and the Drug Rating Questionnaire administered. At the end of Period 1 subjects will be crossed-over to the alternative treatment drug for the Period 2. The Vyvanse™ capsule contents will emptied into water to make a solution and given to subjects to drink at the beginning of each Period visit.</description>
