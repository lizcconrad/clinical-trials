    <description>Diet: At noon the day prior to the procedure, patients will begin a clear liquid diet. Patient will discontinue any ingestion by mouth 4 hours prior to the procedure.
Purgative: Starting at 6pm the evening before the procedure, patient will ingest 250 ml of MoviPrep® at 15 minute intervals until 1 liter is consumed. Following this, an additional 500 ml (approximately 16 oz) of clear liquids will be consumed. The next day, 6 hours before the procedure, the patient will repeat ingestion of one liter MoviPrep® over the course of an hour, again ingesting 250 ml at 15 minute intervals. Patient will then ingest an additional 500 ml (approximately 16 oz) of clear liquid following the MoviPrep® consumption.</description>

    <description>Diet: Patients will refrain from solid food and have only clear liquids starting 8 am on the day before colonoscopy. In addition, patients will consume nothing by mouth, except clear liquids, from the time the preparation is completed until midnight. Patients will be instructed not to eat or drink anything from midnight until after the colonoscopy is completed.
Purgative: At noon on the day prior to colonoscopy patients will swallow (not chew or crush) 2 bisacodyl delayed release tablets (10 mg). Once the initial bowel movement has occurred (1 - 6 hours after taking the bisacodyl tablets), or if there has been no bowel movement, not more than 6 hours after ingestion of the bisacodyl tablets patients will then drink the reconstituted HalfLytely® solution over 1 hour and 20 minutes. Patients will drink one 8-oz glass every 10 minutes until the two liters is completed</description>
