      RATIONALE: Learning about quality of life and symptom management in patients with bladder
      cancer may help doctors learn about the effects of treatment and plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying of quality of life and symptom management in
      patients with bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom management in
           patients with non-invasive, low- or high-risk bladder cancer.

        -  To obtain feedback on data collection methods to enhance acceptability in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a 10-minute screening in person or by phone to obtain demographic
      data and medical information (e.g., bladder cancer diagnosis and treatment history).
      Additional information is obtained from the clinical databases at the Baylor College of
      Medicine and the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Patients who are
      eligible for the study are added to a waiting list for 1 of 4 focus groups based on disease
      status (high-risk or low-risk non-invasive bladder cancer) and gender. Patients participate
      in a 1.5- to 2-hour focus group discussion about the impact of bladder cancer on their
      quality of life and relationships. Patients receive information about community and
      Internet-based resources at the end of each group session.
