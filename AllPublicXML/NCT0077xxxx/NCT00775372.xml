      To compare the single-dose oral bioavailability of clarithromycin 250 mg/5 mL powder for oral
      suspension of Ranbaxy Laboratories with Biaxin 250 mg/5 mL granules for oral suspension in
      healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fed conditions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, four-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover fully replicated, bioavailability study on
      clarithromycin formulations comparing clarithromycin 250 mg/5 mL powder for oral suspension
      of Ranbaxy Laboratories with Biaxin® granules 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension in healthy, adult,
      human, male subjects under fed conditions

      A single oral dose of clarithromycin 250 mg/5 mL was administered during each period under
      supervision of a trained Medical Officer.

      During the course of study, the safety parameters including vital signs, physical
      examination, medical history, clinical laboratory and safety tests (haematology, biochemical
      parameters) were assessed and, clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology &amp; biochemical
      parameters) were performed again at the end of the study.
