    <textblock>
      At step 1, patients with advanced solid tumors will receive CP-4126 capsules following a dose
      escalation schedule until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. At step 2, 20 patients will
      be randomized. They will receive at days 1 and 8 in a double cross design either oral CP-4126
      at the recommended dose or gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 intravenously. At both steps, the schedule
      of treatment will be day 1, 8, 15 q4w until complete response or disease worsening/
      progressing. All further treatment at step 2 will be oral CP-4126.

      This is a multicentre clinical study conducted in Belgium and in The Netherlands. The study
      is a phase I divided in 2 steps: The first step is a dose escalation to define the RD. At the
      second step the PK profile of oral CP-4126 will be compared with the PK profile of IV
      gemcitabine. In addition, the study is conducted to characterize the tolerability of oral
      CP-4126, to evaluate its bioavailability, and to make a preliminary assessment of antitumor
      activity in patients with solid tumours.
