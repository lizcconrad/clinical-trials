      To evaluate the safety and performance of the I-ZIP Ocular Bandage in subjects undergoing
      uneventful unilateral clear corneal phacoemulsification with foldable monofocal intraocular
      lens (IOL) implantation compared with the Oasis 24-hour Soft Shield Collagen Corneal Shield
      (Oasis Medical, Inc. Glendora, California) for providing ocular protection and relief of pain
      or discomfort in the acute post-operative period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a cataract and is expected to undergo unilateral clear corneal cataract
             surgery with phacoemulsification and implantation of a posterior chamber monofocal
             intraocular lens through an incision ≤ 3.5mm in width measured after IOL implantation
             using internal calipers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any intraocular inflammation in the study eye that was present during the screening
             slit-lamp examination or presence of ocular pain in the operative eye as rated on the
             pre-operative NRPS

          -  Previous surgery (laser or incisional) or ocular trauma to the operative eye or
             planned multiple procedures during cataract/IOL implantation surgery

          -  Potential BCVA in fellow eye worse than 20/40 as assessed by the clinical Investigator

          -  Active or history of chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease (iritis, scleritis,
             uveitis, iridocyclitis, rubeosis iritis), evidence of acute external ocular
             infections, intraocular infection, dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, nasolacrimal duct
             obstruction, active chalazion, uncontrolled blepharitis, uncontrolled and clinically
             significant dry eye syndrome, anything more than trace guttata (&gt;10 guttae in the
             central 6 mm of cornea), evidence of glaucoma/glaucoma suspect, corneal dystrophy or
             other ocular disease that would interfere with study evaluations

          -  Subject is currently receiving antineoplastic therapy

          -  Use of topical ocular steroids within 14 days and/or systemic steroids (excluding
             inhalants) within 30 days prior to surgery.

          -  Subject is an insulin-dependent diabetic or has background diabetic retinopathy (BDR),
             proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or compromised macular function
