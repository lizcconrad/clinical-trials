      Objective: Melatonin production is known to be delayed in preterm-born infants up to 6 months
      of age. This might be related to exposure of preterm infants to continuous lighting in the
      NICU during a critical period of pineal gland development. The investigators aimed to test
      the profile of melatonin production in these infants at 9-12 months of age.

      Methods: Twenty three term-born and 23 preterm-born infants (gestational age: 29-34 weeks)
      were studied. The investigators tested nocturnal urinary melatonin excretion, within a
      repeated measures design, both at 9 and 12 months of age. Nocturnal urine was extracted from
      diapers and urinary melatonin derivate (6-sulphatoxymelatonin) excretion was analyzed by
      ELISA assay.

      Unlike other organs which show catch up in preterm infants after one year of life, the pineal
      gland shows persistent delay in melatonin production. This field of research has been
      neglected lately although there are published recommendations for decrease of bright light in
      NICUs which prevents melatonin development and production, and also recommendations for
      melatonin treatment in cases respiration recovery in hospitalized preterm infants.

        Design: Forty-six infants (23 full term and 23 preterm babies) infants and their mothers
        were randomly recruited from a successive list of preterm and term labors at a large urban
        medical center in Northern Israel and were assigned to the study. We calculated that a
        sample size of 30 mother-infant dyads is sufficient to show a significant effect of the
        intervention with a power of 90% and 5% risk of type alpha error (Cohen , chen, West &amp;
        Aiken, 2003). This calculation was based on the effect size found in full-term infants
        melatonin secetion (1).
