      The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test
      formulation of metformin hydrochloride 1000 mg tablets with an already marketed reference
      formulation GLUCOPHAGE® (metformin hydrochloride) 1000 mg tablets (Bristol-Myers Squibb
      Company) under fasted conditions in healthy, male and female adult subjects.

      This randomized, single-dose, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative
      bioavailability of two formulations of 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride tablets under fasting
      conditions. The study was conducted with 32 (30 completing) healthy adults in accordance with
      Protocol No. 10640302 (Revision 0). In each study period, a single dose (1 x 1000 mg tablet)
      was administered to all subjects following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The test
      formulation was Ohm Laboratories, Inc's (A Group of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc.) Metformin
      Hydrochloride 1000 mg Tablets and the reference formulation was GLUCOPHAGE® (metformin
      hydrochloride) 1000 mg Tablets (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company). The subjects received the test
      product in one study period and the reference product in the other period; the order of
      administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. There was a 7-day interval
      between treatments.

      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 24 hours after each dose. The
      plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to Helen
      Fassoulas, Director of Operations, Warnex Bioanalytical Services Inc., 3885 boul Industriel,
      Laval, Quebec, H7L4S3 Canada, Telephone: 450-663-6724, Fax: 450-975-8111 for determination of
      metformin concentrations.

      Statistical analysis was performed by Braulio Suarez, M.D., Novum Pharmaceutical Research
      Services, Wilcrest Green Office Park, 3320 Walnut Bend Lane, Houston, Texas 77042-4712, USA,
      Telephone: 832-251-8100, Fax: 832-251-7133.

      A total of 32 healthy adult subjects (30 completing).
