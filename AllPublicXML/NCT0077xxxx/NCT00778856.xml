  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ transplantation has become the treatment of choice for most patients suffering end
      stage diseases of the kidney, pancreas, liver, heart or lung.

      Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA) {a.k.a. composite tissue
      allotransplantation} is the term used to describe transplantation of multiple tissues (skin,
      muscle, bone, cartilage, nerve, tendon, vessel) as a functional unit (e.g. hand). Several
      recent advances in clinical organ transplant immunosuppression and experimental limb VCA have
      now made it feasible to consider clinical VCA for the functional restoration of patients with
      loss of one or both hands.

      This protocol facilitates the development of limb VCA at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical
      Center (VAMC) and at Emory University for patients with below the elbow amputations. It will
      evaluate the patients' use of transplanted limb(s) in activities of daily living and compare
      the function of the transplanted hand to the function with their previous prosthesis.

      Patients with below the elbow amputations will be enrolled. Donor tissue will be recovered
      from deceased donors following the guidelines of and in cooperation with the regional Organ
      Procurement Organization. The transplantation procedure and postoperative care will be
      performed using the standard technique for limb replantation. Patients will receive standard
      immunosuppressive regimen. Rejections will be treated in keeping with experience from the
      solid organ transplant experience. Graft failure will be treated with allograft amputation.

      This protocol will study patients with below the elbow amputations who are selected to
      undergo limb allotransplantation. We will study patients after they have been trained on the
      use of a prosthetic limb device prior to transplantation. We will treat them with
      immunosuppression known to prevent the rejection of other allografted tissues and designed to
      minimize their dependence on chronic maintenance immunosuppression. These patients will be
      studied to determine whether the transplanted limb functions better, worse or the same as a
      prosthetic hand, and to quantify those differences

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  male or female, 18-55 years of age, with below elbow amputation

          -  ability to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition that precludes serial follow-up.

          -  Any active malignancy or any history of a hematogenous malignancy or lymphoma.
             Patients with primary, cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell cancers may be enrolled
             providing these are appropriately eliminated prior to transplant. For amputations due
             to malignancy, 5 years recurrence free survival will be required prior to enrollment.

          -  Any known immunodeficiency syndrome.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with protocol monitoring and therapy, including,
             among others, a history of noncompliance, circumstances where compliance with protocol
             requirements is not feasible due to living conditions, travel restrictions, access to
             urgent medical services

          -  Pregnancy or unwillingness to practice birth control methods during the first year of
             the study.

          -  Unwillingness to undergo blood transfusion if clinically indicated
