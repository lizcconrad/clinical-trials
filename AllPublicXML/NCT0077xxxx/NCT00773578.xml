    <textblock>
      The allergic respiratory diseases such as asthma or allergic rhinitis are the main chronic
      diseases in children. The airway inflammation plays an important role in their
      pathophysiology. Several epidemiological studies show that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
      exacerbates the symptoms of asthma and allergies.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of environmental tobacco smoke on the
      measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and biomarkers of nasal inflammation in atopic
      asthmatic children.

      Type of study :

      This study is a epidemiological observation study type exposed or unexposed to environmental
      tobacco smoke.

      Methods :

      The eNO is determined by a method On-line, at a rate expiratory 50 mL / s, using a
      chemiluminescence NO analyzer, before the allergy assessment (skin tests and assay of serum
      total and specific IgE ) and measurement of lung function (spirometry). Nasal lavage is
      performed by using a validated technique . Cells are counted and differentiated after Giemsa
      staining. We measured 1-anti-trypsin, neutrophil elastase, albumin, urea, IL4 , IL6, IL8 and
      IL13. Exposure to ETS is assessed by questionnaire to the parents. Statistical analysis
      include a narrative strand to verify the normality of distribution and an analytical
      analysis, including a bivariate followed by a multivariate analysis by multiple linear
      regression and / or logistic regression to model concentrations of biomarkers of inflammation
      and adjustment variables such as age, sex, atopic status, eosinophilia and severity of
      asthma.
