      This study is a Phase I (non-randomized) study evaluating three dose-levels of Lenalidomide
      in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, accomplished in two institutions
      (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf/ University Medical Center Heidelberg).

    <description>Lenalidomide-treatment starts between 100 and 180 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Three dose-levels will be investigated.
Dose-level -1: 2.5 mg/d if 2.5mg capsules are available, day 1-21, otherwise 5 mg every other day, day 1-21
Dose-level 0: 5 mg/d, day 1-21
Dose-level 1: 10 mg/d, day 1-21
Dose-level 2: 15 mg/d, day 1-21</description>

    <description>3 pat. will be enrolled on dose level 0. If no DLTs are observed during cycles 1+2 dose will be escalated to the next higher level in the 3 patients. If 1 of 3 pat. experiences DLT at the current dose, then up to 3 more pat. will be accrued at the same level. If none of these 3 additional pat. experience DLT dose will be escalated in subsequent patients. If 1 of these 3 patients experiences DLT, the next lower level will be declared to be MTD and the study will be filled up with patients at this dose level up to 25 pat. overall.
If 2 or more of 3 pat. or 3 or more of 6 pat. in the same cohort encounter DLT, the MTD has been exceeded and the previous lower dose level will be declared as MTD and the study will be filled up with patients at this level up to 25 pat. overall.
If DLT is observed in level 0, the next dose level will be -1 for the following cohort of 3 patients. If level 2 is well tolerated without DLT, this level will be claimed as recommended dose for further trials.</description>
