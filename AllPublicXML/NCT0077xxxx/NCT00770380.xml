  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A majority of smokers who quit return to smoking within three months of their quit date. This
      study is a randomized trial to investigate the effectiveness of hypnosis versus behavioural
      counseling to promote maintenance of abstinence or relapse prevention in quitting smokers.
      The hypothesis is that hypnosis will be at least as effective as behavioral counseling in
      preventing relapse to smoking in smokers who are able to quit for at least three days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll 520 current smokers in the study. All subjects will participate in an initial
      smoking cessation intervention involving brief counseling and nicotine replacement therapy.
      Participants who are able to achieve at least 3 consecutive days of abstinence will be
      randomized to one of two relapse prevention interventions. The participants in Study Arm 1
      will receive a hypnosis intervention designed to facilitate relapse prevention. Participants
      in Study Arm 2 will participate in empirically-supported behavior relapse prevention
      counseling, utilizing the National Cancer Institute's Forever Free materials. Both
      interventions will be conducted in two 60-minute individual sessions scheduled one week apart
      in addition to counseling phone calls on their quit date and after relapse prevention
      treatment.

      Outcomes for the two study arms will be compared by assessing biochemically-validated
      point-prevalence smoking status at 9 weeks(end of treatment), 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Hypnosis
      for relapse prevention is designed to sustain the ex-smokers commitment to remain abstinent,
      to provide a review of behavioral skills to resist the temptations to smoke, and to encourage
      attempts to quit again if relapse occurs.

    <description>In the behavioral relapse prevention counseling, participants were taught coping strategies for resisting the urge to smoke. This intervention focused on relapse prevention (i.e., maintenance stage of change) and was based on the theoretical concepts and treatment procedures advocated by Marlatt and Gordon and recent smoking relapse data.</description>
