  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research sub-study is to learn about the levels of an antiretroviral
      (ARV) medication called Raltegravir, and response to HIV virus in the genital tract of
      HIV-positive women.

      We would like to see how this study medication is tolerated, and how the body processes the
      study medication in women who are HIV-positive. More specifically, we are interested in how
      Isentress® might penetrate into the female cervicovaginal secretions thereby potentially
      reducing the amount of HIV in those secretions. A reduction in the amount of HIV in genital
      secretions may prevent female subjects from transmitting HIV to their sexual partners. This
      information will help the research team know how a medication such as Isentress® might be
      used to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV.

      Purpose: This study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in
      cervicovaginal fluids of HIV-infected women, and compare this to the blood plasma
      pharmacokinetics being obtained in the main study, CID 0706.

      Participants: Six HIV-positive women from the CID 0706 study Procedures: During the
      pharmacokinetic visit to obtain blood plasma in the CID 0706 study, women will be asked to
      self-collect cervicovaginal samples using a vaginal aspirator at the following timepoints:
      pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after raltegravir 400mg dose administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection documented by HIV serology or detectable viral load

          -  Self-described as African-American

          -  Less than 7 days cumulative of prior HIV therapy

          -  Plasma HIV RNA PCR equal to or greater than 1000 copies/mL within 90 days prior to
             study entry

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with study medication and
             procedures

          -  ALT (SGPT) &lt; or equal to 3.0 x ULN within 45 days prior to study entry

          -  GRF &gt; 60 as calculated by MDRD within 45 days prior to study entry

          -  All women of reproductive potential (who have not reached menopause or undergone
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum or
             urine β-HCG pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before entry.

        All study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active
        attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) and,
        if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study
        volunteer/male partner must use at least one reliable method of contraception (e.g.,
        condoms, with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide;
        an IUD; or hormonal-based contraception), simultaneously while receiving the
        protocol-specified medication(s) and for 6 weeks after stopping the medication(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Breastfeeding

             follow-up or ability to take the study medication appropriately
