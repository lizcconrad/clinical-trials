  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-way cross-over study
      to investigate and evaluate the efficacy of eszopiclone in Japanese participants with primary
      insomnia. The treatment period consists of two consecutive days (two nights) as one term.
      Patients will receive oral eszopiclone (1, 2, 3 mg), zolpidem tartrate (10 mg), or placebo
      once daily at bedtime for each use. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 10
      prespecified treatment sequence patterns.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Latency To Persistent Sleep (LPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days (5 intervals of two consecutive nights)</time_frame>
    <description>The objective measure, LPS, defined as the amount of time measured in minutes it takes to fall asleep was based on polysomnography (PSG) objective assessments of sleep disturbance. PSG recording was performed according to a manual for overnight PSG. The start time for PSG recording was individualized and scheduled within +/- 30 minutes of the participant's median bedtime as recorded in the sleep diary. During the screening period, participants were provided a diary in which they recorded the time of lights out before bedtime for 1 week pror to PSG evaluations. PSG recording duration for scoring was 8 hours. PSG data recorded during treatment were centrally scored by a trained expert.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Latency (SL)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days (5 intervals of two consecutive nights)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective measure, SL, defined as the amount of time measured in minutes it takes to fall asleep was based on participant-reported subjective assessments of sleep disturbance and was obtained from participants' responses to morning questionnaires.

    <measure>Total Sleep Time (Objective &amp; Subjective)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days (5 intervals of two consecutive nights)</time_frame>
    <description>Total sleep time defined as total sleeping time from bedtime to final awakening (measured in minutes) was objectively determined by polysomnography and subjectively determined based on participant-reported measures following treatment.
The objective total sleep time was based on PSG-based assessments. PSG recording was performed according to a manual for overnight PSG. The start time for PSG recording was individualized and scheduled within +/- 30 minutes of the participant's median bedtime as recorded in the sleep diary. PSG recording duration for scoring was 8 hours. PSG data recorded during treatment were centrally scored by a trained expert.

    <time_frame>10 days (5 intervals of two consecutive nights)</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency (SE) was an assessment obtained from PSG during the treatment period and was defined as the ratio of total sleep time to the total time in bed of 8 hours * 100, expressed as a percent.
PSG recording was performed according to a manual for overnight PSG. The start time for PSG recording was individualized and scheduled within +/- 30 minutes of the patient's median bedtime as recorded in the sleep diary. During the screening period, participants were provided a diary in which they recorded the time of lights out before bedtime for 1 week pror to PSG evaluations. PSG recording duration for scoring was 8 hours. PSG data recorded during treatment were centrally scored by a trained expert.</description>

    <description>Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO) defined as total awakening time from falling asleep to final awakening was objectively determined by polysomnography and subjectively determined based on participant-reported measures following treatment.
The objective WASO was based on PSG assessments. PSG recording was performed according to a manual for overnight PSG. The start time for PSG recording was individualized and scheduled within +/- 30 minutes of the participant's median bedtime as recorded in the sleep diary. PSG recording duration for scoring was 8 hours. PSG data recorded during treatment were centrally scored by a trained expert.
The subjective measure was based on participant-reported subjective assessments and were obtained from participants' responses to morning questionnaires. Questionnaires were administered during each visit during the treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Awakenings (Objective &amp; Subjective)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days (5 intervals of two consecutive nights)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of awakenings defined as the total number of spontaneous awakenings from falling asleep to final awakening was objectively determined by polysomnography and subjectively determined based on participant-reported measures following treatment.
The objective number of awakenings was based on PSG assessments. PSG recording was performed according to a manual for overnight PSG. The start time for PSG recording was individualized and scheduled within +/- 30 minutes of the participant's median bedtime as recorded in the sleep diary. PSG recording duration for scoring was 8 hours. PSG data recorded during treatment were centrally scored by a trained expert.
The subjective measure was based on participant-reported subjective assessments and were obtained from participants' responses to morning questionnaires. Questionnaires were administered during each visit during the treatment period.</description>

        <description>The objective measure, LPS, defined as the amount of time measured in minutes it takes to fall asleep was based on polysomnography (PSG) objective assessments of sleep disturbance. PSG recording was performed according to a manual for overnight PSG. The start time for PSG recording was individualized and scheduled within +/- 30 minutes of the participant's median bedtime as recorded in the sleep diary. During the screening period, participants were provided a diary in which they recorded the time of lights out before bedtime for 1 week pror to PSG evaluations. PSG recording duration for scoring was 8 hours. PSG data recorded during treatment were centrally scored by a trained expert.</description>

The objective total sleep time was based on PSG-based assessments. PSG recording was performed according to a manual for overnight PSG. The start time for PSG recording was individualized and scheduled within +/- 30 minutes of the participant's median bedtime as recorded in the sleep diary. PSG recording duration for scoring was 8 hours. PSG data recorded during treatment were centrally scored by a trained expert.
The subjective measure was based on participant-reported subjective assessments of sleep disturbance and were obtained from participants' responses to morning questionnaires. Questionnaires were administered during each visit during the treatment period.</description>

        <title>Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO)- Objective &amp; Subjective</title>
        <description>Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO) defined as total awakening time from falling asleep to final awakening was objectively determined by polysomnography and subjectively determined based on participant-reported measures following treatment.
The objective WASO was based on PSG assessments. PSG recording was performed according to a manual for overnight PSG. The start time for PSG recording was individualized and scheduled within +/- 30 minutes of the participant's median bedtime as recorded in the sleep diary. PSG recording duration for scoring was 8 hours. PSG data recorded during treatment were centrally scored by a trained expert.
The subjective measure was based on participant-reported subjective assessments and were obtained from participants' responses to morning questionnaires. Questionnaires were administered during each visit during the treatment period.</description>
