      This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover, relative bioavailability
      study performed on 40 healthy adult male subjects.

      As per protocol, enough healthy, adult, human subjects were to be enrolled in the study to
      allow the dosing of 40 subjects in the first period. 40 subjects were enrolled and a total of
