      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group comparison study to verify the
      clinical equivalency of the old formulation (50 mcg as mometasone furoate [MF] in 50 μL of
      solution per spray) to the new formulation (50 mcg as MF in 100 μL of solution per spray) in
      patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.
