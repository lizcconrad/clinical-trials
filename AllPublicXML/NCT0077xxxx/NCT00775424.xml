    <textblock>
      A phase Ib partially blinded pilot study to evaluate the safety and immunological effects of
      PENNVAX-B with or without co-administration of constructs containing DNA encoding for the
      expression of either IL-12 or IL-15.

      Primary objectives

        1. To determine the safety of HIV-1 DNA constructs (PENNVAX-B).

        2. To determine the safety and optimal doses of the IL-12 and the IL-15 adjuvant constructs
           when given with PENNVAX-B.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To compare the various vaccine groups for their immunological responses to several HIV-1
           antigens, utilizing the ELISPOT assay.

        2. To analyze antibody responses to the vaccine antigens over time.

        3. To measure CD8 cell proliferative responses to vaccine antigens over time.

    <description>PENNVAX-B is a cocktail of three expression plasmids. The plasmids include the genes which encode a synthetic HIV-1 envelope protein (pEY2E1-B), Gag (gagCAM02), and Pol (pK2C1). Each plasmid is manufactured to a concentration of 4.0 mg/mL and is formulated with bupivacaine (0.25%) as a facilitating agent for DNA uptake. All plasmids (2.0 mg each gag, pol, env) are premixed by the manufacturer in the same vial.</description>
