      The objective of this study was to compare the single-dose relative bioavailability of
      Ranbaxy and GlaxoSmithKline (Augmentin®) 400 mg amoxicillin (as the trihydrate) and 57 mg
      clavulnic acid (as the potassium salt) chewable tablet, following administration of 2 tablet
      dose under fed conditions

      The study was conducted as an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study to compare the
      single-dose relative bioavailability of Ranbaxy and GlaxoSmithKline (Augmentin® 40o mg)
      amoxicillin (as the trihydrate)/57 mg clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt) chewable
      tablet, following administration of 2 tablet dose under fed conditions A total of 40
      Subjects, 20 males and 20 females; were enrolled in the study, and 39 subjects, 20 males and
      19 females, completed the study.
