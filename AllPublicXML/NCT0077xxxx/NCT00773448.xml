  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood clots in leg veins (deep vein thrombosis) or lung arteries (pulmonary embolism) that
      happen for no reason (i.e. unexplained) are both called &quot;unprovoked venous thromboembolism&quot;
      (VTE). These unexplained blood clots can be the first symptom of cancer. Up to 10% of
      patients with unexplained blood clots will be diagnosed with cancer within one year of their
      blood clot diagnosis.

      These cancers can be found anywhere in the body although the relationship appears stronger
      with the pancreas, ovary and liver. Cancer testing in patients with blood clots is
      controversial. There is presently a wide variety of expert opinions and practices. Previous
      studies showed that a limited cancer screen including a medical history, physical
      examination, basic blood work and chest X-ray, will find about 90% of cancers. More recent
      and better designed studies showed that the limited cancer screen misses many cancers and
      needs to be improved. More extensive cancer testing may find more cancers but is potentially
      uncomfortable for patients, costs a lot of money and involves a lot of people.

      The &quot;comprehensive computed tomography&quot; is less uncomfortable, inexpensive, radiological test
      made to find many cancers at once. Thus, the scientific question to be asked is: Does a
      &quot;comprehensive computed tomography&quot; miss less cancers than a limited cancer screen in
      patients with blood clots?

      The main goal of this study is to find out if a &quot;comprehensive computed tomography&quot; misses
      less cancers than a limited cancer screen in patients with unexplained blood clots.

      The second goal of the study is 1) to find out if a &quot;comprehensive computed tomography&quot; finds
      more &quot;curable&quot; cancers than the limited cancer screen; 2) to find out if the patients
      diagnosed with cancer are still alive and cancer-free after one year (i.e. the patients with
      curable cancer were treated and are doing well); 3) to prove that a negative &quot;comprehensive
      computed tomography&quot; means that the patient will not have cancer and; 4) to find out if a
      &quot;comprehensive computed tomography&quot; is well tolerated and safe for patients.
