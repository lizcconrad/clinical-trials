    <textblock>
      The primary purpose(s) of this study is to determine the highest tolerated dose of
      tanespimycin and to determine anti-tumor activity (via objective response rate) of
      tanespimycin in patients with breast cancer who have not previously responded to Herceptin

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;=18 years

          -  KPS performance status &gt;= 70%

          -  For the Phase 1 portion of the trial, all patients must have a histologically
             confirmed solid tumor malignancy. For the Phase 2 portion of the trial, patients must
             have metastatic breast cancer with HER2 amplification by FISH or 3+ HER2
             overexpression by immunohistochemistry (&quot;IHC&quot;) Patients may have had either
             progressive disease within 3 months following last dose of adjuvant treatment with
             trastuzumab OR progressive disease following initial therapy for metastatic disease
             with trastuzumab (trastuzumab may have been administered with cytotoxic chemotherapy,
             hormonal therapy or as single agent.) Patients who have received trastuzumab single
             agent therapy (without documented progressive disease) followed by trastuzumab
             combination therapy remain eligible for this study at the time of disease progression.
             Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST

          -  All Adverse Events of any prior chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy, must have
             resolved to NCI CTCAE (v. 3.0) Grade &lt;= 2 (except for alopecia)

          -  The following laboratory results, within 10 days of KOS-953 administration:

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 8.5 g/dL

          -  Absolute neutrophils count &gt;= 1.5 x 10*9* /L

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 75 x 10*9* /L

               -  Serum bilirubin &lt;= 2 x ULN

               -  AST and ALT &lt;= 2 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;= 2 x ULN

               -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented hypersensitivity reaction of CTCAE Grade &gt;= 3 to prior therapy containing
             Cremophor (for those patients who receive the Tanespimycin Injection only) or
             Herceptin

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Known active CNS metastases

          -  Except for trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) administered between 7-21 days prior to first
             tanespimycin (KOS-953) administration, administration of any other chemotherapy,
             biological, immunotherapy or investigational agent (therapeutic or diagnostic) within
             14 days prior to receipt of study medication. Patients should be 6 weeks from last
             dose of nitrosourea

          -  Severe dyspnea at rest caused by complications of advanced malignancy or requiring
             supplementary oxygen therapy

          -  Congestive heart failure, or a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 50%
             assessed by multigated radionuclide angiography scan or echocardiography

          -  Any medical conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, would impose excessive
             risk to the patient

          -  Patients with previous malignancies unless free of recurrence for at least 5 years
             except cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma-in-situ of either the uterine
             cervix or urinary bladder, or Stage T1 or T2 prostate cancer whose PSA is &lt; 2 ng/mL
