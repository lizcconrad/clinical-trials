                  according to the classification of severity in the guidelines for the treatment
                  of nasal allergy (partial revision) as well as a score of at least 4 in the score
                  of 4 nasal symptoms, at the time of obtaining the informed consent during the
                  pretreatment observation period.

               -  Patients in whom the skin or specific IgE test is positive and the cytological

                  evaluation of the investigational product.

               -  Patients who were complicated by acute upper respiratory tract inflammation
                  during the 7-day observation period prior to enrollment which may affect the
                  nasal symptoms.

               -  Patients who have previously received mometasone furoate nasal spray.

               -  Patients who have participated in clinical trial of other investigational
                  product(s) within 4 months before obtaining the informed consent or are
                  participating at present.

               -  Patients in whom prior medication effective against allergic rhinitis was
                  withdrawn not long enough before initiation of treatment with the investigational
