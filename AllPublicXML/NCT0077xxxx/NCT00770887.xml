    <textblock>
      This observational study will include new or current Depo Provera users who express interest
      in attempting subcutaneous self administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate.
      Candidates will be taught self administration by a clinic assistant at Planned Parenthood of
      Southwest and Central Florida. Patients who are able to correctly self administer the
      medication and wish to attempt to continue home self administration, will be provided the
      supplies and educational materials to do so. Continuation rates and satisfaction with this
      method will be assessed using preaddressed surveys that patients will return with the above
      information.

    <description>This study will enroll 50 English-speaking/literate women at least 18 years of age of any race who have sought contraception with DMPA at the Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida clinics in Tampa and Fort Myers. Patients who choose to begin DMPA or who have already been using DMPA will be approached regarding voluntary participation in the study. Because DMPA is contraindicated in pregnancy, women with a positive urine pregnancy will not be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant during the study, she will receive no further DMPA injections</description>
