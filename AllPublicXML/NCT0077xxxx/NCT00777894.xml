      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an
      effective treatment for liver cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of external-beam
      radiation therapy in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the feasibility and safety of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with
           hepatocellular carcinoma. (Phase I)

        -  To assess the safety and efficacy of RT in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To generate reproducible peptide patterns of the serum proteome or specific serum sub
           proteomes in these patients.

        -  To assess changes in the proteome or sub proteome patterns after RT in these patients.

        -  To detect peptides that discriminate between before and after RT in these patients.

        -  To identify these discriminating peptides in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy (RT) once daily, five days a week, for 6 weeks.
      Intensity-modulated, 3-dimensional conformal, or fractionated stereotactic RT may be used.

      After completion of study therapy, patients in the phase I portion are followed for 1 year
      and patients in the phase II portion are followed for 3 years.
