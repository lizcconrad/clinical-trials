  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1999, labor pain control has being performed in China, and the initial time of
      analgesia is at the cervix &gt;= 2 cm. Meanwhile, American Society of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology
      recommended that the labor analgesia with neuraxial block should be performed at the cervix
      &gt;= 4 cm in 2002. After that, the threshold has been revised to at least &gt;= 2 cm in 2006 by
      the Society. However, in China, the practice of labor analgesia with neuraxial block has
      being performed for over seven years. Up until now, the practice has being experienced during
      this ten-year period at the cervix around 1 cm. The investigators hypothesized that labor
      pain control in different stages had different characteristics and had different influence on
      patients short- and long-lasting outcomes. This study is mainly investigating different labor
      analgesia procedures in different stages since the initiation of the practice in 1999, and
      assessing their influence on the outcomes to display the trajectory of development of labor
      analgesia in China of which might fit to the the whole process of the study of labor
      analgesia throughout the world. All these were done by analyzing the data records since from
      January 1999 to December 2008.
