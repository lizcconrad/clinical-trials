    <textblock>
      Principal focus is to evaluate the effects of omega 3 fatty acids supplementation on the ADHD
      children's behaviour during 12 weeks on two years. The secondary focus is to evaluate the
      effects of omega 3 fatty acids supplementation on the lexical level,intentional abilities,
      anxiety and depression.

      The omega 3 fatty acids don't present adverse side effects. The inclusion to the trial could
      avoid the intake the methylphenidate and its associated adverse side effects.
