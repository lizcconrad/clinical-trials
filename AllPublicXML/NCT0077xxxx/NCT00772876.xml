    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of a novel compound P1446A-05. Aim of this study is to identify the
      the recommended phase II dose of the drug and to determine the nature of adverse effects
      associated with the drug. P1446A-05 capsules will be given continuously (28 days in each 28
      day cycle) to patients suffering from advanced malignancies with no effective treatment
      available. The dose of the study agent will be lower i.e. 75 mg per day for initial patients.
      If this dose is found safe, higher dose will be administered to next set of (three to six)
      patients. This will continued till the safest and best dose is identified. Treatment will be
      given for 4 cycles and continued further if found effective. Dose schedule may be modified to
      introduce treatment holiday,if frequent adverse effects are seen on continuous
      administration.
