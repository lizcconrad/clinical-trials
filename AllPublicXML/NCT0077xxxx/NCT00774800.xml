  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humalog and Humulin-R (recombinant human insulin) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      approved medications for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Recombinant human hyaluronidase
      PH20 (rHuPH20) is approved by the FDA for use as an aid in the absorption and dispersion of
      other injectable drugs. In this study, rHuPH20 will be co-administered with both Humalog and
      Humulin-R in order to determine if it improves the absorption of these insulins to more
      closely mimic the body's natural increase in insulin in response to a meal.

      Participants received all 4 interventions in the same order.

      Dose-finding visits were conducted to identify the appropriate dose of Humalog and Humulin-R.
      For each Humalog dose-finding visit, a total of 24 U of rHuPH20 was injected SC per unit of
      Humalog, corresponding to a mass concentration of 18.2 micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL)
      rHuPH20 (at final concentration of 91 U/mL of Humalog). For each Humulin-R dose-finding
      visit, a total of 24 U of rHuPH20 was injected SC per unit of Humulin-R, corresponding to a
      mass concentration of 20.0 μg/mL rHuPH20 (at final concentration of 100 U/mL of Humulin-R).

    <description>Humalog + Recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) (Intervention 1): 24 units (U) of rHuPH20 per unit of Humalog, injected subcutaneously (SC), for up to 3 visits until an appropriate dose was identified.
Humalog alone (Intervention 2): a single SC injection of the appropriate identified dose of Humalog, delivered before a liquid meal.
Humulin-R + rHuPH20 (Intervention 3): 24 U of rHuPH20 per unit of Humulin-R, injected SC, for up to 2 visits until an appropriate dose was identified.
Humulin-R alone (Intervention 4): a single SC injection of the appropriate identified dose of Humulin-R, delivered before a liquid meal.
Appropriate dose of either Humalog or Humulin-R was that at which blood glucose following a liquid meal was &lt;160 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for more than 30 minutes during the first 4 hours after injection and never fell below 60 mg/dL.
All dose finding visits and interventions were separated by 3-10 days.</description>

Humalog alone: After a 3-10 d washout (wo), a single SC injection of the appropriate identified dose of Humalog was delivered
Humulin-R+rHuPH20: After a 3-10 d wo, up to 2 DF visits (both visits separated by 3-10 d) until an appropriate dose of Humulin-R was identified. For each DF visit, a total of 24 U of rHuPH20 was injected SC per unit of Humulin-R, corresponding to a mass conc of 20.0 μg/mL rHuPH20 (at final conc of 100 U/mL of Humulin-R)

For each dose-finding visit, a total of 24 units (U) of rHuPH20 was injected subcutaneously per unit of Humulin-R, corresponding to a mass concentration of 20.0 micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL) rHuPH20 (at final concentration of 100 U/mL of Humulin-R).</description>
