      Open, prospective, multicenter, non controlled phase IIA trial

      Primary objectives Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of Velcade in monotherapy for
      patients with advanced stage Waldenström Macroglobulinemia.

      Secondary objectives Evaluation of the activity of the association of High Dose Dexamethasone
      (HD DXM) with Velcade for patients resistant to Velcade Alone For all patients

        -  Overall survival

        -  Safety

        -  Quality of life

        -  Duration of response

      sample size: With type I error alpha of 5% and type II error beta of 20% and a two-sided
      test, the number of patients needed in this study is 34 Number of centers: 28 Centers
      participating to the French cooperative group CLL/WM
