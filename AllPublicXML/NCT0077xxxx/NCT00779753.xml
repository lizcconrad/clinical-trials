      The purpose of this study is to establish the parenteral lysine requirements for neonates.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is important to identify the appropriate level of lysine requirements for parenterally fed
      neonates as this amino acid is the limiting amino acid in the diet of neonates. Feeding
      lysine at requirement improves the likelihood that other amino acids will be utilized
      appropriately for building proteins. In addition, lysine plays a major role in calcium
      absorption, development of muscle proteins and in the production of hormones, enzymes and
      antibodies. We believe that the lysine requirement will be 158 mg/kg/day which is
      significantly lower than the current 267 and 327 mg/kg/d that is found in the current
      Trophamine and Primene parenteral solutions.

    <description>Sixteen neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) will be required for this study. The diagnoses will include, but are not limited to, the following: Trachea-esophageal fistula and/or esophageal atresia, Congenital diaphragmatic hernia, imperforate anus, Hirschsprung's disease, Malrotation with or without volvulus, Intestinal atresias, Gastroschisis, Omphalocele, Necrotizing enterocolitis, Respiratory distress syndrome.</description>

    <intervention_name>Amino Acid Solution with different amount of Lysine</intervention_name>
    <description>The infants will be placed on a standard Primene solution for the first 24 hours of the study to obtain baseline values. During the second 24 hours they will receive an amino acid solution that has a different amount of lysine currently found in Primene, all lipid, CHO, minerals, vitamins and trace elements will remain unchanged. The Parenteral lysine will be studied at the following intake levels: 100, 110, 120, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150 , 155, 165, 170, 180, 200, 230, 245, 260mg/kg/d. The minimum energy intake will be 85-90 kcal/kg/day.</description>
