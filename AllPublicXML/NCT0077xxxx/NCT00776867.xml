  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether perifosine- a drug that inhibits the protein
      AKT, and has had some success in the treatment of adult cancers- is safe and effective in
      treating cancer. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on
      the patient and the cancer. The investigators are testing different dose schedules of
      perifosine and the patient will be asked to partake in one of the dose schedules.

    <description>Open label, phase I study of oral perifosine in recurrent/progressive pediatric solid tumors. This will be a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of perifosine alone in recurrent/progressive pediatric tumors. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be employed with 3-6 patients at each dose level. All patients will receive perifosine at a loading dose on the first day, followed by a maintenance dose to start on day two until progression each patient will be assigned to a dosing group based on one's body surface area (BSA).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any solid tumor that failed standard therapy.

          -  Patient must have evidence for tumor by CT, MRI, PET scan, MIBG scan, serum markers,
             or tissue sampling.

          -  Age ≤ 21 years.

          -  Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ≥ 50% (Karnofsky score for age&gt; 16 years and
             Lansky score for age ≤ 16 years)

          -  ANC≥ 1000 at least 24 hours off GCSF

          -  Platelets ≥ 75k at least one week off platelet transfusions

          -  Hg≥ 8g/dL at least one week off PRBC transfusion

          -  AST ≤ 3 x the upper limit of normal

          -  ALT ≤ 3 x the upper limit of normal

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl

          -  serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal for age, or calculated creatinine
             clearance or nuclear GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73 m2.

          -  ≥ 3 weeks since last non-nitrosourea chemotherapy

          -  ≥ 6 weeks since last nitrosoureas

          -  ≥ 4 weeks since last RT

          -  Patients must agree to practice adequate contraception. Females of childbearing
             potential must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented within 14 days prior to
             drug initiation. Females must not be breast feeding.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow tablets whole

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Patients must not have active infection or serious intercurrent medical illness.

          -  HIV-Positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study due to possible retro-viral drug interactions. HIV testing not required.

          -  Patients must not be taking EIAEDs. If patients were previously EIAEDs that have been
             discontinued, patients must have been off the agent for at least 2 weeks prior to
             registration.
