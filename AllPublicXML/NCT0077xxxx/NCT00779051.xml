      The study compared the relative bioavailability (rate and extent of absorption) of 10 mg
      Zolpidem tablets by Ohm Laboratories Inc. with that of 10 mg Ambien® tablets distributed by
      Sanofi-Synthelabo, Inc. following single oral dose (1x10 mg tablet) in healthy adult
      volunteers administered under fasting condition

    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, randomized, open label, two-way cross over study conducted under
      fasting conditions. Subjects checked into the clinical facility the day prior to dosing at
      least 10 hours prior to dose administration. On study day 1, subjects were dosed with single
      oral dose (1x10mg tablet) of the test and reference products thirty minutes after initiation
      of a standardized, high fat breakfast which was preceded by an overnight fast. Following a
      seven day wash out period, subjects returned and were dosed with an alternative treatment as
      per randomization

      Thirty-six (N=36) volunteers were enrolled in the study. Subject 07 elected to withdraw foe
      personal reasons prior to period II check in. Subject 22 was excluded from statistical
      analysis due to emesis before twice the median Tmax of reference product
