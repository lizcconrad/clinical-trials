  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate an increase in protein metabolism during
      treatment with Physioneal 35® (containing lactate 10 mmol/l, calcium 1.75 mmol/l) compared to
      treatment with Physioneal 40® (containing lactate 15 mmol/l, calcium 1.25 mmol/l) in children
      and adolescents with end stage renal failure receiving peritoneal dialysis.
