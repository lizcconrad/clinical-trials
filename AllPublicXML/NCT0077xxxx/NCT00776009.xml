    <measure>Change From Pre-dose in the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Combined Attention and Deportment Scores at 10, 11, and 12 Hour (Averaged) Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose to 10, 11, and 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>SKAMP is a 13-item rating scale that measures classroom manifestations of ADHD consisting of 2 subscales (7 items for Attention and 6 items for Deportment) used to generate a score at Hours 10, 11 and 12 on Day 7 of Weeks 1, 2 and 3. The ratings were based on both frequency and quality of specific behaviors. The rating scale is 0 (normal, no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment) for a total possible combined score of 0 to 78. The reported measure is the difference from baseline of the 2 combined subscores averaged over Hours 10, 11 and 12. A negative score indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Permanent Product Measure of Performance of Measurement (PERMP) is an age-adjusted, paper-and-pencil math test consisting of 5 pages of 80 math problems each presented in ascending order of difficulty (requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division computations, respectively) during a 10-minute time period. At the end of the 10-minute math test, papers are collected and scored; the number of problems attempted and the number of problems correctly answered are generated as objective measures related to &quot;academic productivity.&quot; A positive score indicates improvement.</description>

             predominantly hyperactive-impulsive subtype, as established by the K-SADS-PL (Kiddie
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version). If a
             DSM-IV-defined ADHD diagnosis is difficult to establish due to possible co-morbidity,
             the subject will not be enrolled into the study.

          -  Subjects should be on a stabilized total daily dose or nearest equivalent of 40-60 mg
             methylphenidate or 20-30 mg of d-methylphenidate for at least two weeks prior to
             Screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject or subject's guardian unable to understand or follow instructions necessary to
             participate in the study.

          -  Diagnosed with or history of a tic disorder or Tourette's syndrome.

          -  History of seizure disorder.

          -  The presence of a known medical condition that would preclude the use of
             methylphenidate.

          -  A history (within the past year) or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular,
             cerebrovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, immunological,
             hematological, endocrine, or neurological disease.

          -  ALT (Alanine Amino Transferase), AST (Aspartate Amino Transferase), GGT (Gamma
             glutamyl transferase) or serum creatinine greater then 2X the ULN (Upper Limit of
             Normal) at Screening.

          -  A history of psychiatric illness or substance use disorder (e.g., schizophrenia,
             bipolar disorder, autism, abuse or dependence, depression, severe Conduct Disorder or
             severe Oppositional defiant disorder)

          -  Subjects who have participated in an investigational trial within the past 4 weeks (28
             days)

          -  Subjects who are currently taking antidepressants or other psychotropic medication.

          -  Subjects who have initiated psychotherapy during the three months prior to
             randomization.

          -  Subjects with a positive urine drug screen.

          -  Subjects who have a history of poor response or intolerance to methylphenidate or
             d-methylphenidate.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply

        <title>Change From Pre-dose in the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Combined Attention and Deportment Scores at 10, 11, and 12 Hour (Averaged) Post-dose</title>
        <description>SKAMP is a 13-item rating scale that measures classroom manifestations of ADHD consisting of 2 subscales (7 items for Attention and 6 items for Deportment) used to generate a score at Hours 10, 11 and 12 on Day 7 of Weeks 1, 2 and 3. The ratings were based on both frequency and quality of specific behaviors. The rating scale is 0 (normal, no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment) for a total possible combined score of 0 to 78. The reported measure is the difference from baseline of the 2 combined subscores averaged over Hours 10, 11 and 12. A negative score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Pre-dose in the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Attention Score at 10, 11, and 12 Hour (Averaged) Post-dose</title>
        <description>SKAMP is a 13-item rating scale consisting of 2 subscales (7-items for Attention and 6-items for Deportment) that measures classroom manifestations of ADHD. SKAMP was used to generate a score on the Attention subscale at Hours 10, 11, and 12 on Day 7 of Weeks 1, 2, and 3. The rating scale is 0 (normal, no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment) for a total possible combined score of 0 to 42 for the Attention subscale. The reported measure is the difference from baseline of the subscore averaged over Hours 10, 11, and 12. A negative score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>Permanent Product Measure of Performance of Measurement (PERMP) is an age-adjusted, paper-and-pencil math test consisting of 5 pages of 80 math problems each presented in ascending order of difficulty (requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division computations, respectively) during a 10-minute time period. At the end of the 10-minute math test, papers are collected and scored; the number of problems attempted and the number of problems correctly answered are generated as objective measures related to “academic productivity.” A positive score indicates improvement.</description>
