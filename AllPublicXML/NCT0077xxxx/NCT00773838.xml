      Study of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma after at least 2 prior treatment regimens.

      Histone deacetylases (HDAC) facilitate gene transcription by modulating the uncoiling of
      chromatin. HDAC function is dysregulated in hematologic and solid malignancies, and this
      dysregulation may result in over-expression of oncogenes. Thus, inhibition of HDACs may
      result in anti-cancer effects. HDAC inhibitors, like vorinostat, represent a new class of
      antitumor agents that have the ability to induce antiproliferative effects including
      cyto-differentiation, cell cycle growth arrest or apoptosis in various cancer cell lines.
      Several studies have investigated the in vitro antimyeloma activity of vorinostat in
      combination with bortezomib and have demonstrated that vorinostat may act synergistically
      with bortezomib to modulate tumor cell growth. Mitsiades et al have shown that vorinostat
      enhances the sensitivity of bortezomib. Pei et al found that exposure of human multiple
      myeloma cell lines &amp;amp; patient-derived multiple myeloma cells to bortezomib and vorinostat
      resulted in synergistic interactions as a result of: (1) Interruption of NF-kB &amp; related
      signaling pathways (JNK, XIAP, Mcl-1, etc.) (2) Inhibition of Hsp90 (3) Induction of ER
      stress signal and (4) acetylation of Dynein/ disruption of aggresome function/formation,
      salvage for ubiquitinated proteins. In addition a marked increase in mitochondrial injury,
      caspase activation, and apoptosis was also observed.

      Bortezomib is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. Two Phase I
      dose-ranging studies of a regimen combining vorinostat and bortezomib among patients with
      relapsed as well as end-stage, refractory multiple myeloma have been conducted. These studies
      enrolled a total of 57 patients. In these studies, administration of vorinostat with standard
      doses of bortezomib resulted in responses in 20/45 (44%) evaluable patients (Weber et al
      2007, Badros et al 2007). The purpose of the present study is to definitively evaluate the
      clinical activity of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib in patients with multiple
      myeloma.

      Based on the preliminary safety &amp; efficacy presented by Weber et al and Badros et al at ASH
      2007, this protocol will further evaluate the clinical activity of vorinostat in multiple
      myeloma.

      The protocol has been amended to incorporate language to indicate the end of the study. The
      end of the study is designated as the time when the primary endpoint of 29 responders has
      been met, or the time when all patients have discontinued treatment or have been enrolled in
      the study for at least 6 months (if the primary endpoint is not reached by this time).
      Patients will be allowed to continue on protocol as long as they have not met the criteria
      for discontinuation.
