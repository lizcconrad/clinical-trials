      Objective: To determine if Lumigan (bimatoprost) causes increased lash length when used in
      gel suspension applied to the base of the eyelashes. Methods: Subjects recruited from the
      Bascom Palmer Eye Institute were screened and those who met inclusion criteria were enrolled.
      Each participant received two vials of gel suspension, which contained bimatoprost and normal
      saline, respectively, each mixed 1:1 with GonakTM gel and labeled &quot;right eye&quot; and &quot;left eye&quot;
      according to randomization. The suspension was applied to the eyelashes every evening on the
      designated eye for 6 weeks. Lash length was measured with a caliper at enrollment, at weekly
      intervals during the study and at 1 and 3 months after study completion. Visual acuity,
      ocular symptoms, intraocular pressure and photographs were documented at these same
      intervals. Results: The average eyelash growth in the Lumigan group was 2.01mm (vs. control
      average of 1.13mm) which was a statistically significant difference (p=0.009). The average
      intraocular pressure decreased equally in both groups (2.14 mmHg). No change in visual acuity
      or iris discoloration was noted in any of the subjects. Discussion: Our data showed an
      increase in eyelash length with use of Lumigan in gel suspension, suggesting that it may have
      eyelash lengthening properties.

Visual acuity, ocular symptoms, intraocular pressure and slit lamp exam were recorded at these same intervals.</description>
