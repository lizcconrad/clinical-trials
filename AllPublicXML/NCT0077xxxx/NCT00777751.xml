  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the radiation that you are receiving
      will result in an increase in certain proteins produced by the heart called cardiac
      biomarkers.

      Cardiac Biomarkers:

      Cardiac biomarkers are proteins made by the heart. When cardiac biomarkers are above normal
      levels, there may be damage to the heart. The relationship between cardiac biomarkers and
      radiation therapy has not been well studied. Learning more about this relationship may lead
      to better ways to check the heart during radiation therapy. How cardiac biomarkers can play a
      role in predicting future heart problems during radiation therapy will also be studied.

      Study Tests:

      If you agree to take part in this study, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure
      certain cardiac biomarkers up to 2 days before radiation therapy, following the first
      treatment of radiation, within 2 days of finishing radiation therapy, and about 1 to 2 months
      after completion of radiation therapy. Once the blood testing is completed, any leftover
      blood samples will be destroyed.

      You will also have electrocardiograms (ECGs -- tests that measure the electrical activity of
      the heart) at the same time points as the blood draws.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after the last blood draw and ECG.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Patients with tumors in the chest in close proximity to the heart, including histologically
        proven primary lung cancer, esophageal cancer, or thymoma, to be treated with single
        modality RT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A total of thirty patients will be prospectively enrolled in this study. Patients with
             tumors in the chest including histologically proven primary lung cancer, esophageal
             cancer, thymoma or mesothelioma to be treated with RT with or without concurrent
             chemotherapy to a final dose of &gt;/=45 Gy will be included in this study.

          2. Patients with tumors in close proximity to the heart where the treating radiation
             oncologist anticipates the mean cardiac dose will exceed 20Gy.

          3. All patients must sign a study-specific informed consent form. If the patient's mental
             status precludes his/her giving informed consent, written informed consent may be
             given by the patient's legal representative.

          4. Age &gt;/= 18

          5. Women of childbearing potential (A woman of child-bearing potential is a sexually
             mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., who has had menses at any
             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months]. For women of childbearing potential, a
             blood pregnancy test must be performed within 72 hours prior to the start of protocol
             treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who receive 5-fluorouracil or adriamycin as part of their chemotherapy
             regimen.

          2. Patients with recent myocardial infarction in the past month, decompensated heart
             failure or myocarditis/pericarditis in the past month

          3. Patients with renal failure indicated by a serum creatinine level of &gt;/= 2.0.

          4. Patients in the intensive care unite (ICU).

          5. Patients with systemic sepsis.

          6. Patients with acute pulmonary embolism in the past month.

          7. Women who are pregnant or nursing are not eligible as treatment involves unforeseeable
             risks to the fetus or child.

          8. Inability to obtain histologic proof of malignancy.
