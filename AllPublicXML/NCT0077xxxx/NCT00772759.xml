  <brief_title>Assess Safety, Tolerability and PK of AZD3199 in Japanese</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase I, Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Single-Centre Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Ascending Doses of AZD3199 Given Once Daily as Inhaled Formulation Via Turbuhaler to Japanese Healthy Men</official_title>

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of single
      and multiple once daily ascending doses of AZD3199 delivered as dry powder via the Turbuhaler
      inhaler in healthy male Japanese subjects by assessment of incidence and nature of adverse
      events (AEs), clinically significant abnormalities in ECG parameters, blood pressure (BP),
      pulse rate, lung function parameters, body temperature and laboratory variables (clinical
      chemistry, haematology and urinalysis). The secondary objectives of the study are to
      investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple ascending doses of AZD3199 by
      assessment of the degree of accumulation, dose proportionality and time linearity in healthy
      Japanese subjects, and to investigate systemic β 2- adrenoreceptor mediated effects of single
      and multiple ascending doses of AZD3199 by assessment of potassium and lactate
      concentrations, tremor and palpitations, heart rate, QTc, pulse rate, blood pressure and
      FEV1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be healthy Japanese volunteers, both of the volunteer's parents, and all grandparents
             must be Japanese. The volunteer must have been born in Japan, have a valid Japanese
             passport and must not have lived outside Japan for for more than 5 years.

          -  BMI 18 - 27, Weight 50 - 85 kg

          -  Be non-smoker or ex-smoker who has stopped smoking (or using other nicotine products)
             for &gt;6 months prior to study start.

          -  Clinical normal physical findings

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant disease or disorder

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, clinical chemistry,
             haematology, urinalysis, vital signs, ECG or lung function at baseline

          -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting
             ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes.

          -  Use of any medication (including OTC), herbal preparations, vitamins or nutritional
             supplements within 2 weeks prior to Visit 2, except for occasional intake of
