  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study in our medical intensive care unit will evaluate the clinical and
      cost-effectiveness of an active surveillance program for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA), compared to routine daily bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate
      (CHG)-impregnated cloths. Outcomes include rate of MRSA acquisition, and of other
      hospital-acquired infections (e.g., catheter-associated bloodstream infections).
