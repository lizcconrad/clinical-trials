        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21 to 75 years, inclusive

          -  Patient has a single target IA in the anterior or posterior circulation that:

             a) Is located in the following regions of the internal carotid artery: i.
             Paraophthalmic (including paraclinoid, ophthalmic and hypophyseal segments) ii.
             Cavernous iii. Petrous

             b) Has a neck &gt;4 mm or no discernible neck AND a size (maximum fundus diameter) &gt;10 mm

             c) Has a parent vessel with diameter 2.5 - 5.0 mm distal/proximal to the target IA

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent using the IRB-approved consent form

          -  Subject has the necessary mental capacity to participate and is willing and able to
             comply with protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than one IA requires treatment in the next 6 months

          -  Subarachnoid hemorrhage from target IA in the past 60 days

          -  Unstable neurologic deficit (i.e., any worsening of clinical condition in the last 30
             days)

          -  Irreversible bleeding disorder

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103 cells/mm3 or known platelet dysfunction

          -  Inability to tolerate, documented evidence of adverse reaction or contraindication to
             study medications

          -  Stent in place at the target IA

          -  Contraindication to CT scan or MRI

          -  Allergy to contrast used in angiography that cannot be medically controlled

          -  Known severe allergy to platinum or cobalt/chromium alloys

          -  Relative contraindication to angiography (e.g., serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL)

          -  Woman of child-bearing potential who cannot provide a negative pregnancy test

          -  Evidence of active infection at the time of treatment

          -  Other conditions of the heart, blood, brain or intracranial vessels that carry a high
             risk of neurologic events (e.g., severe heart failure, atrial fibrillation, known
             carotid stenosis)

          -  Any comorbid disease or condition expected to compromise survival or ability to
             complete follow-up assessments to 180 days

          -  Extracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the carotid artery for anterior circulation
             aneurysms

          -  Intracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the treated vessel
