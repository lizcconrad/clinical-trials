      This FDA Condition of Approval study will include up to 100 subjects at up to 13 US centers.
      Subjects are selected from those evaluated and planning to receive a SynchroMed II drug
      infusion system for treatment of severe spasticity or chronic pain. Subjects must return for
      refill visits at 1, 6, and 12 months. In addition, subjects return for any other medically
      necessary refills. Information is collected on all refills and adverse events.
