  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of an experimental drug (neratinib) versus a combination of drugs (lapatinib
      and capecitabine) in women who have erbB-2 (HER-2) positive metastatic or locally advanced
      breast cancer. The goal of this study is to compare the two regimens in shrinking tumors and
      extending the lives of women with erbB2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. The study will also
      compare the safety of the two regimens and to compare quality of life of patients taking the
      two regimens.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization date to progression or death, assessed up to 69 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival, Measured in Months, for Subjects Randomized. Investigator assessment. The time interval from the date of randomization until the earliest date of progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) or death due to any cause. For subjects without death or progression, censorship was at the last valid tumor assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization date to death, assessed up to 69 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects last known to be alive were censored at the last date of last contact or the data cutoff employed for the analysis, whichever was earlier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR).</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization date to progression or last tumor assessment, assessed up to 69 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response Rate, investigator assessment. The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants demonstrating a confirmed objective response, either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) during the study per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v.1.0: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and Non-PD for non-target lesions, and no new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization date to progression or last tumor assessment, assessed up to 69 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, or SD = 24 weeks) for women For ErbB2 Positive Advanced Breast Cancer. Clinical benefit rate was the percentage of subjects who achieved overall tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.0: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
Clinical Benefit (CB) = CR + PR + SD &gt;= 24 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From start date of response to first PD, assessed up to 69 months after the first subject was randomized.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was measured from the time at which response criteria were met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever status was recorded first) until the first date of recurrence or progressive disease (PD) or death. For subjects without death or progression, censorship was at the last valid tumor assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.0: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of CNS Metastases (Frequency)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization date to first CNS symptom or lesions</time_frame>
    <description>The percent of patients with symptomatic or progressive CNS lesions was the proportion of subjects who had PD considering CNS lesions only, according to RECIST criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to CNS Metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization date to first CNS symptom or lesions</time_frame>
    <description>Time to symptomatic or progressive Central nervous system (CNS) lesions. Time to symptomatic or progressive CNS lesions was the time from the date of randomization until the date of progressive disease (PD) considering CNS lesions only (ie, appearance of newly diagnosed CNS lesions or progressive CNS lesions).</description>
