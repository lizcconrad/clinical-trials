  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a walking model of osteoarthritis for use in testing of new
      therapeutic agents. The primary hypothesis is that participants treated with Naproxen or
      Ultracet will have lower Pain Intensity (PI) than those treated with Placebo during
      self-paced walks on Day 3 of treatment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time Weighted Average (TWA) Pain Intensity (PI) on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Due to Self-paced Walks on Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline measurements of participant-specific knee PI were gathered pre-dose on Day 1 from the briskest possible self-pace constant walks on a treadmill over the course of a 20 minute interval. Over this interval PI readings were taken at time points 0,3,6,9,12,15,18 and 20 minutes, rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), with 0: No Pain - 10: Worst Pain You Can Imagine. Following a single treatment on Day 3, PI was similarly measured over 20 minute self paced walks at 4 and 6 hrs post-dose. The difference between the TWA (0-20 minutes) PI determined at baseline, and the average of the two TWA (0-20 minutes) PI from the self-paced walks on Day 3 is reported as units on a scale.</description>

Over this interval PI readings were taken at time points 0,3,6,9,12,15,18 and 20 minutes, rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), with 0: No Pain - 10: Worst Pain You Can Imagine. Following the first treatment on Day 1, PI was similarly measured over 20 minute self-paced walks at 2, 4, and 6 hrs post-dose . The difference between the TWA (0-20 minutes) PI determined at baseline, and the average of the three TWA (0-20 minutes)PI from the self-paced walks on Day 1 is reported as units on a scale.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time Weighted Average (TWA) Pain Intensity (PI) on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Due to High-paced Walks on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline measurements of participant-specific knee PI were gathered pre-dose on Day 1 from the briskest possible self-pace constant walks on a treadmill over the course of a 20 minute interval. Over this interval PI readings were taken at time points 0,3,6,9,12,15,18 and 20 minutes,rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), with 0: No Pain - 10: Worst Pain You Can Imagine. Following the first treatment on Day 1, PI was similarly measured over a 20 minute high-paced treadmill walk at 5 hrs post-dose. A high-paced walk is the highest pace that can be walked safely for at least 5 minutes that is at a 10-30% higher rate than a self-paced walk. The difference between the TWA (0-20 minutes) PI determined at baseline, and the TWA (0-20 minutes) PI of the high-paced walk on Day 1 is reported as units on a scale.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time Weighted Average (TWA) Pain Intensity (PI) on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Due to Self-paced Walks on Day 3</title>
        <description>Baseline measurements of participant-specific knee PI were gathered pre-dose on Day 1 from the briskest possible self-pace constant walks on a treadmill over the course of a 20 minute interval. Over this interval PI readings were taken at time points 0,3,6,9,12,15,18 and 20 minutes, rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), with 0: No Pain – 10: Worst Pain You Can Imagine. Following a single treatment on Day 3, PI was similarly measured over 20 minute self paced walks at 4 and 6 hrs post-dose. The difference between the TWA (0-20 minutes) PI determined at baseline, and the average of the two TWA (0-20 minutes) PI from the self-paced walks on Day 3 is reported as units on a scale.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time Weighted Average (TWA) Pain Intensity (PI) on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Due to High-paced Walks on Day 1</title>
        <description>Baseline measurements of participant-specific knee PI were gathered pre-dose on Day 1 from the briskest possible self-pace constant walks on a treadmill over the course of a 20 minute interval. Over this interval PI readings were taken at time points 0,3,6,9,12,15,18 and 20 minutes,rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), with 0: No Pain – 10: Worst Pain You Can Imagine. Following the first treatment on Day 1, PI was similarly measured over a 20 minute high-paced treadmill walk at 5 hrs post-dose. A high-paced walk is the highest pace that can be walked safely for at least 5 minutes that is at a 10-30% higher rate than a self-paced walk. The difference between the TWA (0-20 minutes) PI determined at baseline, and the TWA (0-20 minutes) PI of the high-paced walk on Day 1 is reported as units on a scale.</description>
