  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in daily clinical practice the safety and efficacy
      of fentanyl Iontophoretic Transdermal (through the skin) System (ITS) for management of
      moderate (medium level of seriousness) to severe (very serious) acute (a quick and severe)
      pain in participants who have undergone elective spine or orthopedic (related to bones)
      surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (participants and physicians are told which treatment the participants
      are receiving), multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), single-arm study of fentanyl ITS. The study will consist of 2
      phases: screening phase and an open-label treatment phase. The duration of participation in
      the study for an individual participant will be 72 hours. All eligible participants (who
      require pain treatment with strong opioids [morphine like medications] for at least 48 hours
      after an elective spine or elective orthopedic surgery) will be treated with fentanyl ITS,
      delivering 40 microgram (mcg) fentanyl per on-demand dose, each deliver over 10 minutes for a
      maximum of 6 doses per hour (240 mcg per hour) for 24 hours or a maximum of 80 doses (3.2
      milligram). Participants will be analyzed for the use of intravenous (giving a medicine
      directly into a vein) access during postoperative pain treatment with fentanyl ITS.
      Participant's safety will be monitored.
