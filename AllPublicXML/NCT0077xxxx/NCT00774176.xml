  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of PA-SCOPE is to determine why black and rural residents of Pennsylvania
      might be at higher risk for deadly, debilitating, and costly hospitalizations for chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)— and then to show that repeat acute exacerbations in
      high-risk patients can be reduced with one simple intervention. We believe that 1) COPD
      patients who are black or who live in rural areas of Pennsylvania are at higher risk of acute
      exacerbations requiring hospitalization and 2) this elevated risk can be reduced with one
      simple intervention: access to a 1-800 Temple Call Center where patients can get immediate
      customized advice on managing COPD exacerbations in their early stages. We will test these
      beliefs in PA-SCOPE. The collaborators with Temple University Hospital on the PA-SCOPE
      project are Lancaster General Hospital, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, and the Philadelphia
      College of Osteopathic Medicine.

      -  Overall objective: To determine why African American and rural residents of Pennsylvania
           might be at higher risk for deadly, debilitating, and costly hospitalizations for
           COPD—and to show that repeat acute exacerbations in high-risk patients can be reduced
           with one simple intervention--access to a 1-800 Temple Call Center phone number where
           patients can get immediate customized advice on managing COPD exacerbations in their
           early stages.

        -  Phase 1: To compare and contrast the influence of race and geographic location in COPD
           exacerbation in relation to severity, comorbidities, treatment patterns, infection rate.
           To identify potential risk factors for COPD exacerbations leading to hospitalization.

        -  Phase 2: To reduce hospitalizations and deaths due to COPD exacerbations and to improve
           patient quality of life, lung function, and everyday activity levels
