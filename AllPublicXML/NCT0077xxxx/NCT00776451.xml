      To demonstrate the ability of intermediate AMD subjects to follow the instructions for use
      and properly operate on their own the Preview PHP in home use environment, after going
      through training session.

      The study purpose is to demonstrate that the target population can use the system after going
      through a supervised training session. The PreView PHP will be operated in the same manner in
      the simulated setting as it will be in future home use.
