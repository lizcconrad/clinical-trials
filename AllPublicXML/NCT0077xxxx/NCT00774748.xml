  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether subcutaneous ports are an effective and
      reliable way to administer the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin to patients for
      the prevention or treatment of venous thromboembolism.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous ports have recently been used to administer Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)
      to patients for the prevention or treatment of venous thromboembolism; however, no studies
      have been performed to evaluate the ports' reliability in delivering this type of drug.
      Hence, it is not known whether absorption of the drug is constant over the seven-day lifespan
      of the port. Although the use of subcutaneous ports is not currently the standard of care,
      health care providers are more frequently using this as an alternative method to direct
      injection of LMWH, particularly in pediatric patients.

      The main advantage of subcutaneous ports is the decreased number of needle sticks when using
      the ports to administer the medication. However, it is possible that, due to potential
      repeated bleeding into the subcutaneous space at the port site or other factors, drug
      absorption may decrease over the seven day lifespan of the port, resulting in a decrease of
      plasma drug level. Subtherapeutic LMWH levels and, hence, ineffective anticoagulation may
      result. This study's aim is to determine if the current use of subcutaneous ports is a safe,
      effective and reliable way of administering LMWH for the purpose of anticoagulation.

    <description>Blood levels taken from the first and last visits (when available) were combined to get an average. The anti-Xa test reports the low molecular weight heparin concentration in the blood.</description>

    <measure>Percent Difference of Each Participant's Subcutaneous Anti-Xa Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>6 time points (for each participant) in approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-Xa subcutaneous blood levels are displayed in percent difference to show normal fluctuations of anti-Xa levels without using the port. A percent difference is calculated by the current value has the previous value subtracted from it; this new number is divided by the absolute value of the previous value; then this new number is multiplied by 100. This allows each set of data to be compared to itself. Anti-Xa tests measure the concentration of low molecular weight heparin in the blood.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing anti-Xa levels from the first day of using the port and the last day of using the port. A percent difference is calculated by the current value has the previous value subtracted from it; this new number is divided by the absolute value of the previous value; then this new number is multiplied by 100.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Standard Deviation of Participant's Own Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 time points in approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>GFR was calculated from a creatinine blood level to establish a safe renal function that would validate anti-Xa levels. Low molecular weight heparin is primarily cleared from the body by the kidneys. Any condition that decreases kidney function can potentially decrease LMWH clearance, increasing its concentration in the blood and increasing the potential for excessive bleeding.</description>

          <description>Comparing subcutaneous baseline (without port) anti-Xa levels with day one of using the port. A percent difference is calculated by the current value has the previous value subtracted from it; this new number is divided by the absolute value of the previous value; then this new number is multiplied by 100. This allows each set of data to be compared to itself. Anti-Xa tests measure the concentration of low molecular weight heparin in the blood.</description>

        <description>GFR was calculated from a creatinine blood level to establish a safe renal function that would validate anti-Xa levels. Low molecular weight heparin is primarily cleared from the body by the kidneys. Any condition that decreases kidney function can potentially decrease LMWH clearance, increasing its concentration in the blood and increasing the potential for excessive bleeding.</description>
