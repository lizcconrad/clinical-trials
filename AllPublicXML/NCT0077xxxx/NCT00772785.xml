  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine (BPN) is an approved treatment for opioid dependence; however, in taking oral
      tablets, patients experience withdrawal and cravings when the variable BPN levels in the
      blood are low. Probuphine (buprenorphine implant) is an implant placed just beneath the skin
      that contains BPN. It is designed to provide 6 months of stable BPN blood levels. This study
      will test the safety and efficacy of Probuphine in the treatment of patients with opioid
      dependence. Patients who have completed at least 24 weeks of treatment in the Open-Label,
      Multi-Center Study of Probuphine in Patients with Opioid Dependence (PRO-807 Study), will be
      re-treated with Probuphine over an additional 24 weeks.

      This is a 6-month, open-label, multi-center extension study. It is estimated that
      approximately 200 patients will be enrolled at approximately 25 sites in the United States
      (US). Following completion of either the PRO-807(NCT00630201) or PRO-808 studies, eligible
      patients will be implanted with Probuphine implants in the opposite arm for the PRO-809
      study. Safety, BPN plasma levels, and efficacy measures will be collected during the 24-week
      treatment period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet the following eligibility criteria:

          -  Expected to complete 24 weeks of treatment in PRO-807 or PRO-808

          -  Voluntarily provide written informed consent prior to the conduct of any study-related
             procedures

          -  Deemed appropriate for entry into this re-treatment study by the Investigator

          -  Females of childbearing potential and fertile males must use a reliable means of
             contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients are not eligible for enrollment if any of the following criteria are met:

          -  Presence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels ≥ 3 X upper limit of normal and/or
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≥ 3 X upper limit of normal and/or total
             bilirubin ≥ 1.5 X upper limit of normal and/or creatinine ≥ 1.5 X upper limit of
             normal, measured at the time of the Week 20 Visit for the previous trial (PRO-807 or
             PRO-808), or any time less than 5 weeks prior to the Implant Visit.

          -  Current diagnosis of chronic pain requiring opioids for treatment

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Current use of agents metabolized through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) such as azole
             antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), and
             protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir)

          -  Current history of coagulopathy and anti-coagulant therapy (such as warfarin)

          -  Current use of benzodiazepines other than physician prescribed use

          -  Significant medical or psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, or other factors
             which in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude compliance with the protocol,
             patient safety, adequate cooperation in the study, or obtaining informed consent

          -  Concurrent medical conditions (such as severe respiratory insufficiency) that may
             prevent the patient from safely participating in study; and/or any pending legal
             action that could prohibit participation and/or compliance in the study
