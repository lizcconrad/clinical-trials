  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study enrolled 30 healthy volunteers and 30 patients with atopic asthma, for a total of
      60 subjects. The study examined the tolerability of omalizumab and omalizumab excipients in
      two successive cohorts of subjects, healthy volunteers and patients with allergic asthma
      without prior exposure to omalizumab, according to a skin test protocol, consisting of a
      prick skin test and/or intradermal test.

    <description>Skin test procedures were skin prick test or intradermal test. The test started with the lowest concentration. If a positive skin reaction was observed, escalation to the next dilution was stopped. Subjects were observed for 20 minutes following each test; subjects were observed for 1 hour after the last intradermal test. Those with a positive response were observed for an additional 6 hours.
Severity refers to the intensity of an AE (mild, moderate or severe). Mild is itching or hives, for example. A severe event requires emergency medical treatment and can result in death.</description>

Positive skin reaction was defined as a ≥ 3-mm wheal and/or &gt; 10-mm erythema from negative control. The skin prick test started with the lowest concentration. If a positive skin reaction was observed, escalation to the next dilution was stopped.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Positive Skin Reaction (Skin Prick Test)</title>
        <description>For skin prick, positive control (histamine 6 mg/mL) and negative control (saline) were used. Positive skin reaction was defined as a ≥ 3-mm wheal and/or &gt; 10-mm erythema from negative control. The skin prick test started with the lowest concentration. If a positive skin reaction was observed, escalation to the next dilution was stopped.</description>

        <population>Safety population, defined as subjects who received at least one concentration of omalizumab or omalizumab excipient. For healthy volunteer cohort, undiluted: n=29. The skin tests started with the lowest concentration. If a positive skin reaction was observed, escalation to the next dilution was stopped (i.e., reason for different Ns per dilution.)</population>

            <description>Healthy participants were tested sequentially in a skin prick test procedure with positive control (histamine 6 mg/mL), negative control (saline), and 1:1000, 1:100, 1:10 dilution and full concentrations of both omalizumab and omalizumab excipients. Without reaction, this then followed a sequential intradermal test procedure with positive control (histamine 0.1 mg/mL), negative control (saline), and 1:1000, 1:100 and 1:10 dilution concentrations of omalizumab and its excipients. There was a 20 minute observation period following all dosings.
Excipients include sucrose, histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate and polysorbate 20.
Dilutions of omalizumab and its excipients were made in sterile water for injection (SWFI).</description>

          <title>Healthy Subjects</title>
          <description>Healthy participants were tested sequentially in a skin prick test procedure with positive control (histamine 6 mg/mL), negative control (saline), and 1:1000, 1:100, 1:10 dilution and full concentrations of both omalizumab and omalizumab excipients. Without reaction, this then followed a sequential intradermal test procedure with positive control (histamine 0.1 mg/mL), negative control (saline), and 1:1000, 1:100 and 1:10 dilution concentrations of omalizumab and its excipients. There was a 20 minute observation period following all dosings.
Excipients include sucrose, histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate and polysorbate 20.
Dilutions of omalizumab and its excipients were made in sterile water for injection (SWFI).</description>

          <title>Allergic Asthma Participants</title>
          <description>Allergic asthma participants were tested sequentially in a skin prick test procedure with positive control (histamine 6 mg/mL), negative control (saline), and a succession of 1:1000, 1:100, 1:10 dilutions and full concentration of both omalizumab and omalizumab excipients. Without reaction, this then followed a sequential intradermal test procedure with positive control (histamine 0.1 mg/mL), negative control (saline), and 1:100,000 and 1:10,000 dilution concentrations of omalizumab and its excipients. There was a 20 minute observation period following all dosings.
Excipients include sucrose, histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate and polysorbate 20.
Dilutions of omalizumab and its excipients were made in saline solution.</description>
