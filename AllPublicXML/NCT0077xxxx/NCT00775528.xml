      <recruitment_details>Subjects were recruited in 9 centers in US between April 2009 and June 2009. During the period of screening (Days -21 to Days -7), subjects were evaluated for eligibility. They underwent a short period of up to 7 days on their usual pancreatic enzyme supplementation before receiving the study treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Nineteen subjects were consented and 18 subjects were allocated to pancrelipase delayed release capsule. One subject did not meet the fecal elastase requirement and did not receive study medication.</pre_assignment_details>
