      To set up a cohort of at least 400 IBS patients in order to identify different patient
      subgroups according to phenotypical and genotypical patterns and

      To set up a biobank for future translational studies on the pathophysiology of IBS, in order
      to identify genetic factors to unravel the pathogenesis of IBS and to provide novel
      therapeutic targets.

      Aim of the present study is to set up a large cohort of IBS patients in order to identify
      different disease characteristics as well as aetiological and pathophysiological factors in
      (sub)groups of patients with this heterogeneous disorder. Various phenotypical and
      genotypical markers will be evaluated. For this purpose, blood and faecal samples as well as
      symptom questionnaires will be collected and visceral perception and intestinal permeability
      will be measured. In order to increase the sensitivity of the barostat procedure, a pilot
      study will be performed by measuring patients and healthy controls under meal stimulated and
      fasting conditions. We aim to set up a biobank for studies on the pathophysiology of IBS, in
      order to identify genetic factors that may help unravel the pathogenesis of IBS and provide
      novel therapeutic targets. Consent will be asked to collect data from questionnaires, to
      store serum samples, DNA, stool and, when endoscopy is performed for clinical reasons, also
      biopsy specimens.
