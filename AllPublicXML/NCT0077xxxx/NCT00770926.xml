      This study aims to design and test the effectiveness of a lifestyle diabetes risk reduction

    <textblock>
      To design and test the effectiveness of a lifestyle diabetes risk reduction program, Live
      Well, Be Well, to increase physical activity, decrease weight, and improve diet, offered in
      community-based settings to primarily lower income, minority persons aged 25 and older at
      moderate to high risk of diabetes. The design is a randomized controlled trial with the
      primary outcome being fasting plasma glucose; secondary outcomes are weight, physical
      activity, blood pressure, and other physiological risk factors as well as health-related
      quality of life. This project is a partnership between the University of California San
      Francisco and the City of Berkeley Division of Public Health.
