  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status scale has been used worldwide for
      assessing the status of patients before operation. However, merely the value of ASA scale did
      not give enough information of patients to determine their prognosis and improvement of
      outcomes. Since 1948, World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as the state of complete
      physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the ASA scale only was needed to be modified
      and should be replaced by a comprehensive gauge to evaluate the status of patients in depth.
      Based on this thought, the investigators used a new system, i.e., physical-psycho-social
      (PPS) scale, to assess the overall state before surgical procedures.
