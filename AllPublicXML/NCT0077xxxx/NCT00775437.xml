    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE): Results in death, is life-threatening, results in hospitalization or the prolongation of hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent a serious outcome. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any AE with onset or worsening reported by a participant from the time that the first dose of adalimumab is administered until 5 half-lives (70 days) have elapsed following discontinuation of adalimumab administration (total of 32.5 months).</description>

    <description>The DICHAQ is a self-reported participant-oriented outcome measure, calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 to 3): Dressing and Grooming, Arising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. The score of each category is calculated as the maximum of the scores for the questions within that category. If aids and devices and/or help from another person are used for a category, a lower category score is adjusted to 2 for that category. A participant must have scores for at least 6 categories in order to compute the DICHAQ score. Total score is derived as average of all categories: 0 (no disability) to 3 (complete disability).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A parent or guardian has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent form,
             approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC),
             after the nature of the study has been explained and the subject's parent or legal
             guardian has had the opportunity to ask questions. The informed consent must be signed
             before any study-specific procedures are performed or before any medication is
             discontinued for the purpose of this study. The parent must also be willing to comply
             with all the requirements of this study protocol.

          2. Subject has a disease diagnosis of moderately to severely active polyarticular or
             polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; defined as arthritis
             affecting &gt; = 5 joints at the time of treatment initiation). This corresponds to the
             International League of Associations for Rheumatology categories of polyarticular
             rheumatoid factor positive (RF+), polyarticular Rheumatoid factor negative (RF-)
             disease, and extended oligoarthritis disease.

          3. Subject must be aged 2 to &lt; 4 years old with moderately to severely active
             polyarticular JIA or polyarticular course JIA or age 4 or greater weighing &lt; 15 kg
             with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA or polyarticular course JIA, per
             International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria.

          4. Subject is judged to be in generally good health as determined by the Investigator
             based upon the results of medical history, laboratory profile, and physical
             examination performed at Screening and confirmed at Baseline. This includes, but is
             not limited to, a normal cardiopulmonary and normal neurological exam result.

          5. Parent or legal guardian must be able and willing to administer subcutaneous (SC)
             injections or have a qualified person available to administer SC injections.

          6. Parent or legal guardian must be willing to actively supervise storage and
             administration of study drug and to ensure that the time of each dose is accurately
             recorded in the subject's diary.

          7. Subject must have negative purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent) at
             Screening. If subject has a positive (greater than or equal to 5mm induration) PPD
             test result, a chest x-ray (posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral view) must be
             performed. If subject has a positive test (or equivalent), has had a past ulcerative
             reaction to PPD placement, and/or a chest x ray consistent with tuberculosis [TB]
             exposure, subject may not be enrolled into the study.

          8. For subjects in the European Union [EU], subject must have previously failed, had an
             insufficient response, or have been intolerant to at least one Disease-Modifying Anti
             Rheumatic Drug (DMARD).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has had prior exposure to Tysabri® (natalizumab) or Raptiva® (efalizumab) or
             any other biologic therapy, such as Orencia® (abatacept), Kineret® (anakinra),
             Actemra® (tocilizumab), Rituxan® (rituximab). Any previous use of anti-tumor necrosis
             factor [TNF] agents, including Enbrel® (etanercept), Remicade® (infliximab), Cimzia®
             (certolizumab pegol), Simponi® (golimumab), and adalimumab is also prohibited.

          2. Infection(s) requiring treatment with intravenous (IV) anti-infectives within 30 days
             prior to Baseline Visit or oral anti-infectives within 14 days prior to the Baseline
             Visit.

          3. Subject has undergone joint surgery within the preceding two months of the Screening
             Visit (at joints to be assessed within the study).

          4. Subject has a previous diagnosis of a condition that could cause arthritis other than
             polyarticular JIA.

          5. Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to
             constituents of the study drug, adalimumab.

          6. Subject has been treated with any investigational drug of chemical or biologic nature
             within a minimum of 30 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) of the drug prior to
             Baseline visit. Should these biologics become approved, they would continue to be
             excluded.

          7. Subject has a poorly controlled medical condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes,
             unstable heart disease, recent cerebrovascular accidents, seizure disorder, and any
             other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at
             risk by participation in the study.

          8. Subject has a history of clinically significant hematologic (e.g., severe anemia,
             leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, a clotting disorder), renal, liver disease (e.g.,
             fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatitis), or active gastroenteric ulcer.

          9. Subject is considered by the Investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable
             candidate for the study.

         10. Subject has evidence of active TB infection.

         11. Subject has history of moderate to severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart
             Association [NYHA] class III or IV), recent cerebrovascular accident or thrombotic
             event and any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the
             subject at risk by participation in the protocol.

         12. Evidence of dysplasia or history of malignancy (including lymphoma and leukemia).

         13. History of demyelinating disease (including myelitis) or neurologic symptoms
             suggestive of central nervous system [CNS] demyelinating disease.

         14. History of invasive fungal infection (e.g., listeriosis, histoplasmosis), active viral
             disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

         15. Positive Hepatitis B test result.

         16. Chronic recurring infections or active TB.

         17. Screening laboratory and other analyses show any of the following abnormal results:

               -  electrocardiogram [ECG] - with clinically significant abnormalities;

               -  Aspartate transaminases (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt; 1.75 the upper
                  limit of the reference range;

               -  Total bilirubin &gt;=3 mg/dL;

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL (convert to mmol/L).

         18. Evidence of dysplasia or history of malignancy (including lymphoma and leukemia) other
             than a successfully treated non-metastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell
             carcinoma.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE): Results in death, is life-threatening, results in hospitalization or the prolongation of hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent a serious outcome. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any AE with onset or worsening reported by a participant from the time that the first dose of adalimumab is administered until 5 half-lives (70 days) have elapsed following discontinuation of adalimumab administration (total of 32.5 months).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Pediatric American College of Rheumatology (PedACR) 30% Response (PedACR30)</title>
        <description>The PedACR30 response is defined by the PedACR as ≥30% improvement in at least 3 of 6 JIA core set criteria, and ≥30% worsening in ≤1 of 6 JIA core set criteria. The 6 variables for the JIA core set criteria are Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of participant's disease activity, Parent's Global Assessment of participant's disease activity, number of active joints (joints with swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of passive motion [LOM] and joints with pain on passive motion [POM], tenderness, or both), number of joints with LOM, Disability Index of Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (DICHAQ), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Baseline is the last value prior to the first dose of study drug. Missing data were imputed up to Week 60 using last observation carried forward (LOCF) and non-responder imputation (NRI); observed values are presented for timepoints past Week 60. n=number of participants for either observed or imputed methods at given time point.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Pediatric American College of Rheumatology (PedACR) 90% Response (PedACR90)</title>
        <description>The PedACR90 response is defined by the PedACR as ≥ 90% improvement in at least 3 of 6 JIA core set criteria, and ≥ 30% worsening in not more than 1 of 6 JIA core set criteria. The 6 variables for the JIA core set criteria include PGA of participant's disease activity, Parent's Global Assessment of participant's disease activity, number of active joints (joints with swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM and joints with POM, tenderness, or both), number of joints with LOM, DICHAQ, and CRP. Baseline is the last value prior to the first dose of study drug. Missing data were imputed up to Week 60 using LOCF and by NRI; observed values are presented for timepoints past Week 60. n=number of participants for either observed or imputed methods at given time point.</description>

        <title>Disability Index of Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (DICHAQ): Mean Change From Baseline to Each Visit</title>
        <description>The DICHAQ is a self-reported participant-oriented outcome measure, calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 to 3): Dressing and Grooming, Arising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. The score of each category is calculated as the maximum of the scores for the questions within that category. If aids and devices and/or help from another person are used for a category, a lower category score is adjusted to 2 for that category. A participant must have scores for at least 6 categories in order to compute the DICHAQ score. Total score is derived as average of all categories: 0 (no disability) to 3 (complete disability). Baseline is the last value prior to the first dose of study drug. Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>

        <description>A joint assessment was recorded at all study visits to assess the number of active joints, with a total possible score of 0 (no active joints) to 73 (all active joints). Active joints are defined as joints with positive results for tenderness, swelling, pain on passive motion, or limitation of passive motion. Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>

        <description>Sixty-six joints were assessed by physical examination. The joints to be examined for swelling were the same as those examined for tenderness, except that the hip, subtalar, sacroiliac, lumbar spine, thoracic spine, and cervical spine joints were excluded. Joint swelling was classified as present (&quot;1&quot;), absent (&quot;0&quot;) or replaced/injected (&quot;9&quot;). Scores range from 0 to 594, with higher scores representing higher disease activity. Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug.

          <description>Seventy-five joints were assessed by physical examination. The joints to be examined for POM were the same as those examined for tenderness. POM of the joint was classified as present (&quot;1&quot;), absent (&quot;0&quot;), or replaced/injected (&quot;9&quot;). Scores range from 0 to 675, with higher scores representing higher disease activity. Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>

        <description>The CHQ-PF50 is a participant-reported outcome measure that includes 50 questions related to physical and mental health, social limitations, and impact on parents and family. Scores for each category were converted to a scale from 0 (implies higher disease activity) to 100 (implies lower disease activity). Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>

        <description>The CHQ-PF50 is a participant-reported outcome measure that includes 50 questions related to physical and mental health, social limitations, and impact on parents and family. Scores for each category were converted to a scale from 0 (implies higher disease activity) to 100 (implies lower disease activity). Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>

        <description>The CHQ-PF50 is a participant-reported outcome measure that includes 50 questions related to physical and mental health, social limitations, and impact on parents and family. Scores for each category were converted to a scale from 0 (implies higher disease activity) to 100 (implies lower disease activity). Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>

        <description>The CHQ-PF50 is a participant-reported outcome measure that includes 50 questions related to physical and mental health, social limitations, and impact on parents and family. Scores for each category were converted to a scale from 0 (implies higher disease activity) to 100 (implies lower disease activity). Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>

        <title>Child's Health Questionnaire Parent Form (CHQ-PF50) Parental Impact - Emotional Category: Mean Change From Baseline to Each Visit</title>
        <description>The CHQ-PF50 is a participant-reported outcome measure that includes 50 questions related to physical and mental health, social limitations, and impact on parents and family. Scores for each category were converted to a scale from 0 (implies higher disease activity) to 100 (implies lower disease activity). Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>

        <description>The CHQ-PF50 is a participant-reported outcome measure that includes 50 questions related to physical and mental health, social limitations, and impact on parents and family. Scores for each category were converted to a scale from 0 (implies higher disease activity) to 100 (implies lower disease activity). Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the first dose of study drug. Participants with nonmissing Baseline and at least 1 postbaseline observation are included in the analysis. n=participants with a nonmissing value at baseline and each visit.</description>
