      This was an open label, randomized, single dose, 2-way crossover, relative bioavailability
      study performed on a total of 36 healthy adult subjects (20 males and 16 females). Thirty
      five (35) subjects (19 males and 16 females) completed the clinical phase of the study. In
      each period, subjects were housed from at least 10 hours before dosing until after the 36
      hour blood draw. Single oral 120 mg Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride doses were separated by a
      washout period of 7 days.

      A total of thirty six (36) subjects (20 males and 16 females) were enrolled in the study. Out
      of which a total of thirty five (35) subjects (19 males and 16 females) completed the
