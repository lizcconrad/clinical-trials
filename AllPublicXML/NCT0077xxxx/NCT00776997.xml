      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the LINX Reflux
      Management System in the treatment of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the primary alternative for GERD patients with an incomplete symptomatic response
      to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) is laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. This surgical
      procedure continues to be the prevalent non-medical treatment option for GERD patients,
      despite several important limitations. First, it is a very traumatic procedure, requiring
      portions of the stomach to be dissected and then wrapped around the tubular esophagus,
      creating permanent anatomic alterations. Secondly, it can create significant side effects,
      such as gas bloat syndrome, the inability to belch and the inability to vomit.

      The intent of the LINX System is to allow a surgeon, using existing laparoscopic techniques
      and instruments, to augment a weak LES and restore the defective barrier at the
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). This defect of the GEJ is the source of abnormal reflux. The
      LINX device is an expandable string of individual titanium beads with magnetic cores. The
      device is laparoscopically placed as a ring around the lower esophageal sphincter. The
      magnetic attraction of the beads augments the esophageal sphincter's ability to resist
      gastric pressures that cause reflux. At rest, the LINX device encircles the sphincter with
      each bead resting against an adjacent bead, to avoid compression of the tubular esophagus.
      When swallowing, higher pressures are created, allowing the magnetic bond between beads to
      break, and the LINX implant to expand radially. This serves to preserve swallow and other
      physiologic functions, such as belching and vomiting, and avoids the side effect of
      post-prandial bloating. The device can be placed with minimal dissection, preserving anatomy,
      and is also removable, if necessary. This provides important benefits as it preserves the
      native anatomy, unlike the Nissen procedure.

    <description>The area of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is accessed using a standard laparoscopic approach. The tubular esophagus, in the area of the LES, is sized and the appropriately sized sphincter augmentation device is placed circumferentially around the esophagus in the area of the LES. After confirming proper placement, the ends of the device are secured. At this point, the implant procedure is complete, laparoscopic instruments are withdrawn and access points are closed.</description>

          <description>The GERD-HRQL scale was administered at baseline with GERD medications discontinued for at least seven days. GERD-HRQL scale objectively quantifies symptom severity. The GERD-HRQL scale consists of 10 questions with the following Responses Scale:
0 = No Symptoms
= Symptoms noticeable, but not bothersome
= Symptoms noticeable and bothersome, but not every day
= Symptoms bothersome every day
= Symptoms affect daily activities
= Symptoms are incapacitating, unable to do daily activities
The worst possible score is 50 based on a response of &quot;5&quot; to all 10 questions.</description>
