    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare healthy patients versus patients with muscle
      tightness in their leg(s) after an acquired brain injury using walking trials time, a balance
      test, and foot pressure data. This data is obtained using foot pressure sensors, timers, and
      distance walked.

      This study is being conducted to demonstrate the objective utility of the use of
      pedobarography as a tool to differentiate normal controls from people with spastic gait as
      well as having utility in objectification of treatment effect on level surfaces and on a ADA
      based obstacle course.

        Subjects ages &gt; 18 years of age for this study. A total of up to 10 age matched controls
        and 30 clinical patients with lower extremity spasticity will be enrolled. Of the 30
        clinical patients, 20 clinical patients will have received BOTOX ® injections from their
        clinical physician after their first visit.
