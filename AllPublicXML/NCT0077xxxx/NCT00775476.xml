    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease which often has
      debilitating and potentially life-threatening consequences. The cause of SLE is unknown and
      current therapies lack specificity and carry significant side-effects. Existing data in the
      literature provide evidence that a natural antioxidant, glutathione, is depleted in T cells
      of patients with SLE. This may be a key factor underlying abnormal activation and
      predisposition of T lymphocytes to pro-inflammatory cell death via necrosis. Administration
      of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), that serves as a precursor of glutathione (GSH), improves the
      clinical outcome of murine lupus, and limits the toxicity of pro-oxidant/immunosuppressant
      medications commonly used in patients with SLE. NAC is widely available in health food stores
      and large doses (up to 8 g/day) can be safely administered to humans. In a one-year study of
      patients with inflammatory lung disease treated with prednisone and azathioprine, addition of
      NAC (1.8 g/day) diminished disease severity and reduced drug toxicity in comparison to
      placebo. Moreover, oral NAC has been found to improve muscle fatigue which is reported to be
      the most disabling symptom in 53% of patients with SLE. Thus, establishing a dose ranging
      between 1.2-7.2 g/day that is well tolerated and capable of raising intracellular GSH in
      lupus patients and determining its immunological and therapeutic impact in SLE appears to be
      well justified.

      The study will consist of two parts, Aim 1 and Aim 2.

      AIM 1:

      The purpose of Aim 1 was to establish the optimal daily oral dose of NAC that can be well
      tolerated without side effects and can normalize or moderate the depletion of GSH in lupus T
      cells.

      36 SLE subjects and 42 healthy controls (matched by age and sex) were studied.

      The 36 SLE subjects were divided into 3 groups of 12. Each group received a different dose of
      NAC (N-acetylcysteine)or placebo as follows:

      Group 1: 9 received 600mg of NAC two times a Day, 3 received placebo; Group 2: 9 received
      1200mg of NAC two times a Day, 3 received placebo; Group 3: 9 received 2400mg of NAC two
      times a Day, 3 received placebo;

      To account for attrition 12 subjects were randomized in each group (9 active, 3 placebo).

      At each subject visit, blood from a healthy donor was drawn and used as control. The control
      blood was used for flow cytometry measurements of GSH and in vitro immunological studies. In
      addition to GSH measurements and immunologic studies, routine labs., ASRS self-reporting
      assessment questionnaire, and SLEDAI/BILAG/Fatigue scores were obtained for the SLE subjects.
      The healthy control subjects also answered the ASRS self-reporting questionnaire. The ASRS
      questionnaire was incorporated into the study procedures in October, 2009. It is designed to
      assess a patient's ability to concentrate which could be affected by the involvement of the
      Central Nervous System (CNS) in lupus. There were up to 5 study visits per SLE subjects in a
      period of four months.

      At each visit up to 100 ml of blood were drawn from each subject. 20 ml are needed for
      routine labs. and up to 80 ml are needed for the GSH and immunological tests.

      Dose comparisons were based on continuous monitoring of adverse events and drug tolerance.

      AIM 2:

      Aim 2 will determine the tolerance and impact of two NAC doses on disease activity and
      prednisone use in 165 subjects with SLE in a double-blind placebo-controlled 12-month study.
      It is designed to detect clinically meaningful differences in disease activity in the patient
      population.

      It was determined by statistical analysis that each group must have 55 subjects. SLE subjects
      will be randomized into 3 groups of 55 subjects to receive 1.2 g of NAC twice a day, 2.4 g of
      NAC twice a day, or placebo. There will be up to seven study visits per SLE subject,
      including the screening and wash out visits. Visits 1-5 will be scheduled three months apart.
      The study will last 13 months with the wash out visit. Each subject will donate approximately
      80 ml of blood for research at each visit. Healthy control subjects will donate blood at the
      same time. They will be matched to the SLE subjects by gender, age within 10 years, and
      ethnicity. Their blood will be used as reference for research assays.

      The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be the same as in Aim 1 and the same subjects may
      continue to participate. There is a new consent form required to participate in the second
      phase.

      Based on the analysis of the data obtained during Aim 1 the Safety Monitoring Board concluded
      during their meeting on April, 2011 that Aim 2 should proceed using two NAC dosing arms
      instead of one. Although a fourth dosing group was originally proposed for Aim 1, the board
      decided not to proceed with this last dosing group of 4800 mg of NAC two times a day. Per
      protocol, 75% of the active subjects in each dose needed to tolerate the dose in order to
      proceed to the next higher dosing group. Although 100% of the subjects tolerated the first
      and second doses, 3 out of 9 subjects experienced transient nausea with the third dose. The
      board concluded that NAC dose 1 of 0.6 g twice a day was ineffective while both doses 2 (1.2
      g twice a day) and 3 (2.4 g twice a day) provided benefits. All doses were safe. The onset of
      action and efficacy of dose 3 appears superior to that of dose 2.

      Lupus disease activity during Aim 2 will be assessed by SLEDAI and BILAG scores, liver and
      bone marrow function, and overall fatigue. Sustained improvement of T cell dysfunction, B
      cell subsets, mitochondrial function and production of nitric oxide will be investigated as
      immunological outcomes. Both SLE and Healthy control subjects will continue to answer the
      ASRS self-reporting questionnaire.
