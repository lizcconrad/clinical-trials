      <pre_assignment_details>Participants had glycosated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) screening values greater than, equal to 7.0% and less than, equal to 10.0%. Participants were between the ages of 17 and 80 years of age and Chinese Asian. Screening visit was up to 7 days prior to Day 1 (treatment).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Normal weight was defined as body mass index (BMI) greater than, equal to (&gt;=)18.5 kilogram per meter squared (kg/m^2) and less than (&lt;) 24 kg/m^2. Initial dose of Glucophage extended release (XR) on Day 1 was 500 mg taken once daily orally with the evening meal. Drug was titrated up by increments of 500 mg each week to a maximum dose of 2000 mg at Week 4 and for the remaining treatment if the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was greater than 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). If the FPG was more than 10.0 mmol/L (greater than 180 mg/dL) at Weeks 4, 8, or 12 and the values were confirmed at a repeated measurement, the participant was discontinued from the treatment. Participants were dosed for a total of 16 weeks.</description>

          <description>Baseline was defined as value obtained on Day 1 (first day of treatment). Adiponectin was measured in milligrams/liter (mg/L) and values obtained through a central laboratory; normal range was 1.20 to 20.00 mg/L.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) included participants who were enrolled, took at least 1 study medication and had at least 1 post baseline HbA1c assessment. For this outcome measure, 78, 70, and 72 normal, overweight, obese participants, respectively, were missing and were not included in the analysis.</population>

        <description>Day 1 was first day of treatment. Lactic acidosis defined as elevated blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Hypoglycemia (low levels of blood glucose) was reported as an adverse event. Safety population included participants who had enrolled in the study and took at least 1 dose of glucophage extended release (glucophage XR). If a subject experienced more than one adverse event, the subject was counted once at the highest severity.</description>
