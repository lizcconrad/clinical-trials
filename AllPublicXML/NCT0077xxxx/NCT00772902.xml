  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected subjects
      with raised cholesterol switching their nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
      backbone from Kivexa (Epzicom) to Truvada had an improvement in their fasting total
      cholesterol after 12 weeks of treatment. The study also investigated whether any improvement
      had a beneficial effect on the overall cardiovascular risk.

    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 4, open-label, randomized, multicenter (in the European Union), controlled
      study to assess the effect on lipid profile of switching from a stable highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen of Kivexa + Kaletra to Truvada + Kaletra in adult
      HIV-1 infected subjects with raised cholesterol.

             contraindicated with any of the study drugs. Administration of any of these

          -  Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
