      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN)for primary dystonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is an uncommon brain disorder in which there is abnormal muscle tone producing
      twisting, writhing movements and abnormal postures. It is associated with abnormal electrical
      activity in two groups of nerve cells in the brain called the globus pallidus internus (GPi)
      and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to be an
      effective treatment in patients with medically refractory dystonia and is currently approved
      for both the GPi and STN targets under a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) for use in
      segmental and generalized primary dystonia as well as focal cervical dystonia. GPi DBS
      appears to be effective for medication-refractory focal and segmental dystonia affecting the
      cranial and cervical regions in open-label series, but recently GPi stimulation has been
      associated with subtle motor disturbances in previously non-dystonic body regions (i.e., arms
      and legs) in this population of patients. DBS of the STN has also been reported to be
      effective for treating generalized and cervical dystonia in small open label trials. STN DBS
      for cranial and cervical regions may provide similar efficacy in the treatment of dystonia as
      GPi DBS, but without unwanted stimulation-induced motor effects. Objectives of this study are
      to 1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of STN DBS for dystonia; 2) determine the time course
      of STN potential efficacy and optimal stimulation parameters; and 3) determine the frequency
      and severity of stimulation-induced motor adverse effects in previously non-dystonic body
      regions. Twenty-five patients will be screened, consented, and enrolled in this study. All
      patients will undergo bilateral STN DBS for dystonia. Participants will be evaluated pre- and
      postoperatively with standard dystonia rating scales including the Burke-Fahn-Marsden
      Dystonia rating scale (BFMDRS), Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS),
      the Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS), and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) rating scale. Changes
      in cognitive function will be assessed with neuropsychological testing. Stimulation
      parameters will be documented, and a patient questionnaire will be administered
      postoperatively to determine if patients are experiencing stimulation-induced motor adverse
      effects. Patient weight will be recorded at study visits. This pilot study will provide
      preliminary open label efficacy outcomes for STN DBS in the treatment of primary dystonia and
      will help determine if this target should be compared to GPi DBS in a larger double-blind
      trial.
