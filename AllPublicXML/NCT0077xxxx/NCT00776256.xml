      The effect of beta-glucan or fructo-oligosaccharide or their combination in bars on satiety
      and food intake was tested by supplying these bars on two consecutive days.

      Background: Increasing gastro-intestinal viscosity or colonic fermentation is suggested to
      help improve appetite control and reduce food intake. Beta-glucan (BG) and
      fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) are food ingredients proposed to act this way, but results so
      far remain inconclusive.

      Objective: To test the effect of FOS, BG, or their combination in bars on appetite ratings
      and food intake during 2 consecutive days.

      Design: In a 4-way balanced order cross-over double-blind design, 21 healthy volunteers (mean
      BMI 25.9 kg/m2) received a meal replacement bar at 09.00h and an ad libitum lunch at 13.00h
      on 2 consecutive days. On day 1 only, subjects consumed a second (identical) bar at 17.00h
      and a fixed snack at 19.00h. The control bar contained 0.3g BG (control, from 6.8 g oats), vs
      equi-caloric bar formulations containing an additional: 1) 0.9 g BG (from 8.0g barley), 2) 8g
      FOS, or 3) 0.9 g BG + 8g FOS. Appetite scores and subsequent ad libitum test meal intakes
      were measured. Bar viscosities were determined under simulated gastric conditions. Results
      were analyzed using ANCOVA.

      Results: Addition of BG, FOS or their combination did not affect appetite ratings or food
      intake, although addition of BG to the bar doubled apparent gastric viscosity (841 vs 351
      mPa.s).

      Conclusions: BG, FOS or their combination in bars at these levels do not improve appetite
      control when consumed on 2 consecutive days. Efficacy might be increased by a longer exposure
      period, increasing the BG content, or a form of BG that generates even higher gastric
      viscosity.
