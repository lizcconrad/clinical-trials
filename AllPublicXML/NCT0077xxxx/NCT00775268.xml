      Background:

        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) uses radioactive substances called tracers to locate
           areas of cancer in the body. For this test, the patient is given an injection of tracer
           and lies in a large donut-shaped scanner that detects where in the body the
           radioactivity accumulates. Computed tomography (CT) scans use low dose x-rays that help
           to better localize where the radioactive tracer is concentrating. PET/CT scans are
           usually done in lymphoma patients before treatment starts and at the end of treatment to
           evaluate the response to therapy.

        -  PET scans typically use a sugar-like radioactive tracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
           and low-dose x-rays. Sometimes, however, FDG PET scans show what looks like active
           disease and presence of a mass after chemotherapy even when there are no live cancer
           cells. Doctors have particular problems in evaluating response to treatment when this
           happens because they can t tell if the mass is active cancer or just dead tumor cells.

        -  An experimental tracer called 18F- fluorothymidine (FLT) has high uptake in active tumor
           cells and may be better able to evaluate treatment response.

      Objectives:

      - To test the use of FLT PET/CT imaging in assessing treatment response in patients with
      lymphoma.

      Eligibility:

      - Patients 18 years of age or older who are enrolled in a lymphoma therapy study at the NIH
      Clinical Center or in the CALGB 50330 study at another location.

      Design:

      - There are two arms in this study:

        -  The first arm evaluates FLT as an early predictor of tumor response to therapy. Patients
           are imaged with FLT and FDG PET before starting treatment, following two cycles of
           therapy and after treatment ends.

        -  The second arm evaluates the ability of FLT to distinguish if a mass that remains after
           treatment is active cancer or dead tissue. Patients who have completed treatment and in
           whom FDG PET shows a remaining tumor mass are imaged with FLT PET. Following the scan,
           the tumor is biopsied for verification.

      Background:

        -  FLT PET/CT has been shown to correlate with the rate of cellular/tumor proliferation.

        -  The Imaging Subcommittee of the International Harmonization Project in Lymphoma
           recommends performing FDG PET at least 3 weeks, and preferably 6-8 weeks after
           chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy therapy and 8- 12 weeks after radiation or
           chemoradiation therapy due to high FDG accumulation in inflammatory tissues.

        -  FLT uptake in inflammatory lesions is less prominent than FDG and it is likely that FLT
           PET/CT can better differentiate inflammation from tumor.

        -  FLT PET/CT imaging is expected to better differentiate between treatment induced
           inflammation and malignancy and should enable early prediction of therapeutic response.

        -  FLT PET/CT imaging is expected to differentiate between residual inflammatory residual
           masses from residual malignancy and therefore guide appropriate treatment.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of FLT PET/CT as an early indicator of complete
           response to therapy in B and T cell lymphoma.

        -  To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of FLT PET/CT in the evaluation of residual masses
           after therapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Participant must be enrolled in a lymphoma therapy study at the NIH Clinical Center OR
           be enrolled in the CALGB 50303 study at another site OR undergoing a new course of
           treatment of lymphoma at another facility. The NCI Laboratory of Pathology will confirm
           diagnosis for subjects enrolled at all CALGB study sites.

        -  Participants must have a clinical course consistent with lymphoma and have available
           documentation of lymphoma from either the NCI or from an outside pathology laboratory.

        -  Subjects enrolling in the early response arm must undergo baseline FLT PET prior to
           receiving a new course of lymphoma therapy.

        -  Subjects enrolling in the residual mass evaluation arm can be enrolled at the time the
           FDG avid residual mass is discovered (i.e. no pre-therapy FLT image is required).

        -  Subjects can enroll in both arms of the study.

        -  Participant must be 18 years or older.

        -  ECOG Performance score of 0 or 1.

        -  SGOT, SGPT less than 5 times ULN.

        -  bilirubin less than or equal to 2 times ULN.

      Design:

        -  There are 2 arms in this study

             -  The first arm will assess of FLT as an early predictor of tumor response to therapy
                (treatment naive or recurrent disease). Subjects are imaged with FLT and FDG PET
                pre-therapy, following 2 cycles of therapy and post therapy.

             -  The second arm will assess lymphoma patients with FDG PET positive residual mass.
                Subjects are imaged with FLT PET prior to standard of care biopsy of residual mass.
                If initial FDG PET data is not available in DICOM format or is of suboptimal image
                quality, a repeat FDG PET/CT at the study site may be required.

        -  We will accrue 70 participants (40 in the early response arm and 30 in the residual mass
           arm) to this study.
