  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once daily use of LEO
      80185 topical suspension in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 17 years) with scalp psoriasis.
      LEO 80185 topical suspension has marketing approval in many countries under the brand names
      Taclonex Scalp® Topical Suspension and Xamiol® gel for the treatment of scalp psoriasis in
      adults. No studies have been performed in subjects younger than 18 years.

Each clinical sign, a single score (ranging from 0 to 4), reflecting the average severity of all psoriatic lesions on the scalp, were determined. The sum of the three scores (redness, thickness, and scaliness) constitutes the Total Sign Score of the psoriasis on scalp, ranging from 0 (best possible outcome) to 12 points (worst possible outcome).</description>
