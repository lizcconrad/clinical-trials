      Background:

      - Antiretroviral therapy has increased the lifespan of people with human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV), but recent research suggests that people with HIV also have an increased risk of
      developing cardiovascular disease. To better understand the prevalence and effects of heart
      disease in people with HIV, researchers are interested in comparing heart imaging and
      metabolism studies to see if there are differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative
      people.

      Objectives:

      - To study metabolism and heart function in people with HIV compared with healthy
      HIV-negative volunteers.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who either have been diagnosed with HIV or are healthy
      HIV-negative volunteers.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be evaluated with a physical exam, detailed medical history, and
           routine blood and urine tests including HIV testing.

        -  Participants will have the following imaging scans:

        -  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the health of the heart and blood
           vessels

        -  Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle

        -  Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan to measure calcium levels in the heart and
           nearby arteries

        -  Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure body fat and muscle mass.

        -  Stable isotope infusion to evaluate how the body processes fat (which will require an
           overnight stay before the test)

        -  Participants will also have blood tests, an echocardiogram, and an electrocardiogram to
           evaluate heart function.

      HIV is now a chronic infection as patients with access to antiretroviral therapy have
      significantly improved life expectancies. Patients with HIV also have an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease. Thus, cardiovascular disease is an important potential co-morbidity
      for patients living with HIV. The current proposal will perform a detailed cardiovascular
      assessment using state-of-the-art imaging techniques to evaluate intramyocardial lipid as
      well as coronary artery disease and myocardial function in a cohort of 100 HIV infected
      patients and 30 healthy volunteers as controls. This is an early exploratory cross-sectional
      study designed to both assess the burden of disease and apply novel techniques in this unique
      population.

             are not limited to the following devices or conditions:

               -  Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator

               -  Cochlear implants

          3. Subjects requiring sedation for MRI studies.

          4. Subjects with a condition precluding entry into scanner and acquisition of scans (e.g.
             morbid obesity, claustrophobia, back pain, motion disorders).

          5. Women who are lactating, pregnant, or actively seeking to become pregnant.
