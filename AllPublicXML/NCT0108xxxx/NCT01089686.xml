  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, multispecialty, randomized double blind placebo control feasibility
      clinical trial. The purpose is to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in treating extracranial venous obstructive lesions,
      and its influence on the clinical outcomes of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients that have been
      found to have chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI).

    <description>The evaluation of safety will be defined as the incidence of major adverse events at 30 days following the index procedure. The evaluation of feasibility and efficacy will be determined by those patients that do not have more than 50 percent restenosis within the 30 day time frame.</description>

    <intervention_name>Venoplasty</intervention_name>
    <description>Venous access is obtained from the groin through the femoral vein. The catheter will be advanced into the veins in the neck and chest. Angiographic images will be taken of the extracranial venous system as well as the azygous vein. These images will be used to confirm CCSVI. Venoplasty is performed by inserting an additional catheter with a balloon at the tip. The balloon will be inflated to open the vessel. Once dilation of the vessel is confirmed, the venous sheath will be removed and manual compression applied to the groin access.</description>

    <description>Venous access is obtained from the groin through the femoral vein. The catheter will be advanced into the veins in the neck and chest. Angiographic images will be taken of the extracranial venous system as well as the azygous vein. These images will be used to confirm CCSVI. Since the patient has been randomized to the non-treatment arm of the trial, the procedure will end without venoplasty. After completion of the diagnostic venogram, the venous sheath will be removed and manual compression applied to the groin access.</description>
