             by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID).

          -  Non pregnant female patients who agree to use acceptable birth control

             must be appropriate for the patient in the clinical judgment of the investigator.

          -  1 year history of Schizophrenia prior to entering the study

          -  At study entry patients with a history of antipsychotic treatment must have a lifetime
             history of at least one hospitalization for the treatment of schizophrenia, not
             including the hospitalization required for study. Patients who have never taken
             antipsychotic treatment may enter the study even without a history of hospitalization.

          -  At study entry patients with a history of antipsychotic treatment must have a history
             of at least one episode of illness exacerbation requiring an intensification of
             treatment intervention or care in the last 2 years, not including the present episode
             of illness. Patients who have never taken antipsychotic treatment may enter the study
             without a past history of illness exacerbation and intensification of treatment in the
             last 2 years.

          -  At study entry patients must have experienced an exacerbation of illness within the 2
             weeks prior to entering the study, leading to an intensification of psychiatric care
             in the opinion of the investigator. If exacerbation occurs in patients who are
             presently hospitalized, the patient must not have been hospitalized longer than 60
             days at entry of the study

          -  Treatment with clozapine at doses greater than 200 mg daily within 12 months prior to
             entering the study, or who have received any clozapine at all during the month before
             entering the study

          -  Patients currently receiving treatment (within 1 dosing interval, minimum of 4 weeks,

               -  brain surgery;

               -  an electroencephalogram with paroxysmal (epileptiform) activity, or

               -  brain structural lesion, including developmental abnormalities, as determined by
                  examination or previous neuroimaging studies that are consistent with a
                  diagnosable neurological disease or syndrome.

          -  Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within 3 months of entering the study or who will have
