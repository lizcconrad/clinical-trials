    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose at the end of treatment. The analysis included baseline FEV1, FEV1 pre-dose and 10-15 minutes post-dose of salbutamol/albuterol during screening, and FEV1 pre-dose and 1 hour post-dose of ipratropium during screening as covariates.</description>

          <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose on Day 2. The analysis included baseline FEV1, FEV1 pre-dose and 10-15 minutes post-dose of salbutamol/albuterol during screening, and FEV1 pre-dose and 1 hour post-dose of ipratropium during screening as covariates.</description>
