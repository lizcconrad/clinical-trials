  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurotrophins (NTs) constitute a family of growth factors, which regulated differentiation,
      proliferation, and survival of both neuronal cells and astrocytes. In recent years, several
      studies have provided evidences that the cellular effects of NGF &quot; Nerve Growth Factor &quot;,
      BDNF &quot; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor &quot; and NT-3 are not limited to the nervous system.
      Indeed, neurotrophins and their receptors are widely expressed on non neuronal cells. Data
      concerning the implication of NTs and their receptors in the immune system maturation and in
      the regulation of normal and pathological immune responses are numerous and suggest the
      existence of a specific &quot;neuro-immunomodulation&quot; through these neuropeptides.

      The aim of the study is to compare Sjögren's syndrome systemic activity to seric, lymphocytic
      and conjunctival levels of NTs (i.e NGF, BDNF and NT-3). A preliminary study has previously
      pointed out the link between high BDNF seric levels and Sjögren's systemic activity. The
      increased levels of BDNF were correlated to T cell activation. A similar correlation between
      high NGF level and hypergammaglobulinemia was also pointed out.

      2 supplementary blood sample for determination of seric and lymphocytic NT profile will be
      added to a standard biological analysis done for pSS follow- up.

      Salivary sicca syndrome will be evaluated with un-stimulated salivary flow rate. Saliva fluid
      will be collected from NTs levels determination (ELISA). Ocular sicca syndrome will be
      evaluated by Schirmer tests and Lissaline green test. A conjunctival cytological impression
      will be done in order to determine NTs conjunctival production by flow cytometry.
