      The purpose of this study is to evaluate blood clots after Percutaneous ASD Closure in
      different age, sexuality and defective diameter; evaluating the relationship of blood
      clotting with Occluder, injury of intima and inflammation;comparation of the effect and
      safety between different anticoagulation after Percutaneous ASD Repair; explore propose an
      optimal anticoagulation plan.

      Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common clinical congenital heart disease. It is estimated
      that the congenital heart disease increase in children by about 15 million annual in China ,
      of which ASD accounted for 10% to 15%. Secundum ASD is the most common clinical type of ASD,
      of which about 70% is suited to tanscatheter close.With the cardiac catheterization advancing
      and the devices developing in recent years ,the method has gradually replaced open-chest
      surgical repair to the person with Secundum ASD. At present, the most widely used device is
      Amplatzer occluder. With the wide ues of the occlur,there has gradually emerged occluder
      thrombosis after closure.there are much different methods to antiplatelet and
      anticoagulation，not only in China but also in the world.so we perfom the study to evaluating
      the blood clotting after Percutaneous ASD Closure in different age, sexuality and defective
      diameter; evaluating the relationship of blood clotting with Occluder, injury of intima and
      inflammation;comparation of the effect and safety between different anticoagulation after
      Percutaneous ASD Repair; explore propose an optimal anticoagulation plan.
