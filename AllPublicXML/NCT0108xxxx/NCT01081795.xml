    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine a recommended dose of topiramate in participants
      with migraine (type of severe headache that occurs periodically and is often associated with
      nausea, vomiting, and constipation or diarrhea), to verify the superiority (statistically
      more effective) of the drug to placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to
      test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), and to assess if a same
      therapeutic effect can be observed between this study and overseas Caucasian clinical
      studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter (more than 1 site), placebo-controlled (compared to placebo),
      randomized (participants assigned study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant nor the physician know the assigned study drug), parallel-group comparison
      (comparison for each group at the same time) study. The study period consists of 4 phases:
      the observation phase, double-blind phase, exit period and follow-up period. After the
      double-blind phase, the participants will be transferred to the continuous treatment study.
      The observation phase which is started after informed consent consists of the washout period
      (non-treatment period with migraine preventive medication: at least 2 weeks) and baseline
      determination period (at least 4 weeks). The participants who complete the observation phase
      and meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the topiramate 50 milligram (mg)
      group, topiramate 100-mg group or placebo group after registration. The double-blind phase
      consists of the titration period (dose-escalation, 4 weeks) and fixed-dose period (18 weeks).
      In the titration period, starting from 1 topiramate 25-mg tablet or 1 topiramate 25-mg
      placebo tablet once daily (1 tablet in the evening), the dose will be increased by 1 tablet
      every week up to twice daily (2 tablets in the morning, 2 tablets in the evening). After
      that, the twice-daily treatment (2 tablets in the morning, 2 tablets in the evening) will be
      continued for 7 days from Day 22 to Day 28. In the fixed-dose period, the topiramate 25-mg
      tablets or topiramate 25-mg placebo tablets at the same dose as that in the final treatment
      in titration period will be continued. The participants who are not transferred to the
      continuous treatment study after completion of the double-blind phase or after
      discontinuation during the double-blind phase will be transferred to the exit period (up to 1
      week).The participants who complete the exit period will be transferred to the follow-up
      period, and a follow-up of the participant's safety and headache symptoms such as the
      migraine period rate will be conducted for 4 weeks after the completion of investigational
      treatment. Meanwhile, the participants who complete the double-blind phase or those who
      discontinue the study at Week 4 or later in the fixed-dose period during the double-blind
      phase due to lack of efficacy and give consent to transfer to the continuous treatment study
      will be transferred to the transfer period (up to 3 weeks) under blind conditions.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Monthly Migraine Attacks (According to 24-Hour Rule) Through Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (28 days before randomization) through Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>As per 24-hour rule, if symptom of pain due to migraine continues for more than 24 hours, it should be considered as 2 or more migraine attacks considering the maximum duration up to 24 hours. If the interval between latest migraine attack (ending time) and previous migraine attack (onset time) is less than 24 hours, 2 migraine attacks should be considered as 1 migraine attack. If the onset of migraine was prevented by a rescue drug, it should be considered as 1 migraine attack even if aura had started. Mean change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from the mean of 6 months value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Monthly Migraine Attacks (According to 24-Hour Rule) Through Month 6</title>
        <description>As per 24-hour rule, if symptom of pain due to migraine continues for more than 24 hours, it should be considered as 2 or more migraine attacks considering the maximum duration up to 24 hours. If the interval between latest migraine attack (ending time) and previous migraine attack (onset time) is less than 24 hours, 2 migraine attacks should be considered as 1 migraine attack. If the onset of migraine was prevented by a rescue drug, it should be considered as 1 migraine attack even if aura had started. Mean change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from the mean of 6 months value.</description>

        <description>As per 48-hour rule, if the symptom of pain due to migraine continues for more than 48 hours, it should be considered as 2 or more migraine attacks considering the maximum duration up to 48 hours. If the interval between the latest migraine attack (ending time) and the previous migraine attack (onset time) is less than 48 hours, the 2 migraine attacks should be considered as 1 migraine attack. If the onset of the migraine was prevented by a rescue drug, it should be considered as 1 migraine attack even if the aura had started.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Number of Rescue Drug Treatment Days at Month 6</title>
          <description>Rescue medications are medicines that may be administered to the participants when efficacy of study drug is not satisfactory, or the effect of study drug is too great and is likely to cause a hazard to the participant, or to manage an emergency situation. If an aura of migraine, a migraine attack or a non-migraine headache attack occurred during the study period, use of following rescue drugs was permitted: analgesics, NSAIDs, ergotamines, triptans and anti-emetics. Average at Month 6 was calculated by dividing total number of rescue drug treatment days until that month by the total number of days of assessment, multiplied by 28 (a month was equal to 28 days).</description>

The 8 sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. Each item is scored on a 0-100 range so that total score ranges from 0-100 with high score indicating more favorable health state. Final evaluation was done at Day 155 or at discontinuation for those participants who discontinued before Day 155.</description>
