  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the OTIS Autoimmune disease in pregnancy study is to monitor planned and
      unplanned pregnancies exposed to certain medications, to evaluate the possible teratogenic
      effect of these medications and to follow live born infants for one year after birth. With
      respect to fetal outcome, it is important to evaluate the spectrum of outcomes that may be
      relevant to a medication exposure during pregnancy, and these include both easily
      recognizable defects that are visible at birth, as well as, more subtle or delayed defects
      that may not be readily identifiable without special expertise and observation beyond the
      newborn period.
