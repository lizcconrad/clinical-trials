    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, randomized, comparative, phase III study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of Crinone 8% in comparison with progesterone 60 mg intramuscular (i.m.)
      administered once a day in luteal phase support in 200 Chinese female subjects undergoing
      IVF/ET.

      This was an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicentric, phase III study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of Crinone 8% in comparison with progesterone 60 mg intramuscular
      administered once a day in luteal phase support in Chinese female subjects undergoing IVF/ET.
      The study planned to enroll 200 female subjects who underwent pituitary down-regulation as
      per each center's normal practice prior to and during stimulation of multiple follicular
      development. The progesterone administration was started on the day of ET. Randomisation was
      performed on the day of ET. If pregnancy was confirmed on day 14 of the progesterone
      administration, the progesterone was continued for another 45 days. The subjects were
      followed up and the treatment outcome (negative pregnancy test or pregnancy) was recorded.
