  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data on the burden of MIP in low transmission areas, such as Latin America, are very limited;
      there is even less information on the efficacy of case management of MiP. The treatment
      recommendations for MiP in Latin American countries have been changing rapidly in recent
      months; currently, either artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or mefloquine-artesunate (MA) is the
      first line treatment for P. falciparum (depending on country); however, no data exists on the
      efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy in Latin America to support
      their use.

      We propose a multi-center 2-arm open-label randomized Phase 4 clinical trial to assess safety
      and efficacy of the present therapies, AL and MA. We hypothesize that the drugs will both be
      efficacious for use in pregnant women in Brazil.
