                  end of follow-up, a subject who did not attain a 2 log decline in HCV RNA levels
                  at ~12 weeks and discontinued treatment, or subject who had no detectable viral
                  load while on treatment but had a detectable viral load post treatment.

          -  Subject with acceptable medical history, physical examination, and clinical laboratory
             evaluations consistent with CHC, compensated liver disease, and any associated
