  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder, defined by symptom-based diagnostic
      criteria. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and gut motor dysfunction is considered to be a
      contributing factor. Changes in motor patterns in the small bowel in IBS patients are
      quantitative rather than qualitative with no distinct patterns to distinguish patients from
      healthy individuals. Changes in motor patterns can affect transit of bowel contents. Indeed,
      variation in intestinal transit was reported in patients with IBS.

      Lubiprostone is a novel agent that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the
      treatment of chronic constipation. More recently 2 randomized double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trials showed the drug to be effective in relieving symptoms in patients
      with constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (C-IBS), resulting in approval for
      female patients with C-IBS at a dose of 8 micrograms twice a day.

      The investigators hypothesize that lubiprostone works not just as a laxative, but by actually
      altering motility patterns in the small intestine of female patients with C-IBS. These
      alterations can be measured through High Resolution Manometry (HRM), a new technique that
      uses catheters with multiple closely spaced sensors and special software that uses color
      schemes to portray a pressure gradient. This technique allows a detailed assessment of the
      direction and spread of contractions. The investigators would like to use HRM to see if
      lubiprostone affects intestinal contractions by giving blinded participants lubiprostone and
      placebo while they are undergoing High Resolution Manometry and seeing if any changes in
      contractions occur. Participants will be recruited from investigator's clinic. If interested,
      potential subjects will be provided with a copy of the consent form for review. Patients will
      be informed that after they have had an opportunity to review the consent form, they may
      contact the study team to further discuss the research and address any questions/concerns
      they have.

      Participants will undergo a screening visit and a manometry visit. During the screening visit
      investigators will determine eligibility, including application of inclusion/exclusion
      criteria and administration of a pregnancy test. Then during the manometry visit patients
      will receive two capsules, lubiprostone and placebo, three hours apart during HRM. Patients
      will receive each capsule only once and will not know which order they're receiving them in.

      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder, defined by symptom-based diagnostic
      criteria. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, and gut motor dysfunction is considered to be a
      contributing factor. Dysmotility affects both the small bowel and the colon. Changes in motor
      patterns in the small bowel in IBS are quantitative rather than qualitative, with no distinct
      patterns to distinguish patients from healthy individuals. Changes in motor patterns can
      potentially affect transit of bowel contents and contribute to symptoms. Indeed, variation in
      intestinal transit was reported in patients with IBS. Small bowel transit studies, using
      scintigraphy, radio-opaque markers and hydrogen breath test, have shown that transit is
      delayed in constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (C-IBS) and accelerated in
      diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (D-IBS).

      Lubiprostone is a novel agent that has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for
      the treatment of adult males and females with chronic constipation. More recently, 2
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials showed the drug to be effective in
      relieving symptoms in patients with C-IBS, resulting in approval for female patients with
      C-IBS, at a dose of 8 micrograms twice a day.

      The investigators hypothesize that lubiprostone works not just as a laxative, but by actually
      altering motility patterns in the small intestine of female C-IBS patients. These alterations
      could be measured through High Resolution Manometry (HRM), a new technique that uses
      catheters with multiple, closely spaced sensors, and special software that uses color schemes
      to portray a pressure gradient. This technique allows a detailed assessment of the direction
      and spread of individual contractions.

      The investigators would like to use HRM to see if lubiprostone affects intestinal
      contractions. The investigators would like to achieve this by administering blinded
      participants lubiprostone and placebo while they are undergoing HRM and seeing if any changes
      in contractions occur. Participants will be recruited both from the investigator's own clinic
      and by word of mouth. Patients of the investigators will be approached by a member of the
      research team during a regularly scheduled clinic visit. If interested, potential subjects
      will be provided with a copy of the consent form for review. Patients will be given ample
      time to review the consent form with friends, family, and/or other physicians. Patients will
      be informed that after they have had an opportunity to review the consent form, they may
      contact the study team to schedule an appointment with one of the co-investigators to further
      discuss the research and address any questions or concerns the patient may have. Once all the
      potential subject's issues and concerns have been addressed, and the individual would like to
      enroll in the study, an investigator or co-investigator will obtain informed consent.
      Referring physicians will be asked to give their patients the contact information for the
      study team and the recruitment process will proceed as described above.

      Participants will undergo two visits: a screening visit and a manometry visit. During the
      screening visit we will determine eligibility, including application of inclusion/exclusion
      criteria and administration of a pregnancy test. Then during the manometry visit, patients
      will receive the two capsules (lubiprostone and placebo), three hours apart during HRM.
      Patients will receive each capsule only once, but they will not know which order they're
      receiving them in.

      Patients may receive lubiprostone without participating in the research study. As
      lubiprostone is FDA approved, the indications would be the same, however, patients receiving
      the drug under standard of care would not be undergoing the HRM or receiving a placebo
      capsule. Patients also may not be required to undergo a washout from their standard
      medication before starting on lubiprostone.

        <title>A Change in Length of Spread of Long Distance Propagating Contractions After Placebo.</title>
        <description>Pressure waves are considered to represent contractions if the rise in intraluminal pressure is &gt;10mmHg above the baseline. They are considered propagating if they are recorded in more than one channel and occur within a time frame that allowed a minimal velocity of 0.7cm/sec and maximum velocity of 4cm/sec. All contractions, their direction (antegrade, stationary or retrograde) and the length of spread will be determined for each sequence at baseline (after taking Placebo)and within the following 3 hours.</description>
