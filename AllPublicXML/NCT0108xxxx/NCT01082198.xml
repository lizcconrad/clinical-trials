      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from dendritic cells and tumor antigen peptides or a person's tumor
      cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best way to give melanoma
      vaccine in treating patients with stage III melanoma after surgery to remove the lymph nodes.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of adjuvant melanoma vaccine comprising autologous dendritic
           cells pulsed with tumor antigen peptides in patients with stage III melanoma following
           lymphadenectomy.

        -  Determine the immune response (skin test of delayed-type hypersensitivity and flow
           cytometric enumeration of peripheral blood CD8+ lymphocytes producing IFN-Î³) to this
           regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine clinical outcome (disease-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events)
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells. Autologous dendritic cells (DCs) prepared from
      PBMCs and bone marrow mononuclear cells are exposed to various antigens and peptides, and
      autologous tumor cell lysate, if available. Patients receive autologous DCs pulsed with
      melanoma-associated antigen peptides, and autologous DCs pulsed with tumor lysates (if
      available), subcutaneously in weeks 0, 2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 20, 26, 31, 50, and 102. Patients
      with no evidence of disease may receive another booster injection 5 years after the start of
      vaccination.

      Blood samples are examined via flow cytometry and skin testing is performed to evaluate
      immune response.
