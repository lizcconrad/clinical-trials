  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster-randomized trial will evaluate the impact of a multifaceted intervention
      (including electronic medical alerts) coordinated by a Nutritional Support Team, on adherence
      to recommended practices for care of starved children, among health personnel of a large
      university hospital. A key component of the study is to assess whether improved adherence to
      guidelines leads to a reduction in rates of complications.
