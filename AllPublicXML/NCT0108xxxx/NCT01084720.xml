      -  To evaluate the palliative effects of a moisturising emollient, in patients with uremic
           xerosis of moderate, severe or very severe intensity, associated or not to uremic
           pruritus.

        -  To assess the local tolerance of the test product and its vehicle, and to evaluate the
           overall agreement (efficacy, tolerance easiness of use) of the patients for the test
           product.

          -  Patients suffering from moderate to severe xerosis, i.e. with a severity score of at
             least 2, on two symmetric areas of the lower legs (Phase I test areas)

          -  Patients who have not experienced phototherapy within 8 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Patients with no antipruritic treatment, or with stable antipruritic treatments (e.g.

             study entry

          -  Written informed consent (Appendix II) from the patients or parents

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under 10 years of age

          -  Patients undergoing renal dialysis for another reason than MRD

          -  Patients whose xerosis or pruritus is due to another reason than their MRD status

          -  Patients suffering from mild xerosis (score Â£ 1) on the lower legs

          -  Patients with xerosis of non comparable severity between the lower legs

          -  Patients with a known history of allergy to one of the ingredients contained in the
             test product

          -  Patient with an intercurrent condition which may interfere with a good conduct or the
             study parameters of the study

          -  Patients treated with any other emollient/moisturizing topical preparation within the
             7 days prior to study entry

          -  Patients with phototherapy within 8 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Patients who started an antipruritic treatment other than phototherapy, or who
             experienced unstable dosage schedule of antipruritic treatments (e.g. antihistamines,
             cholestyramin, opiod inhibitors, charcoal) within 4 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Patients who participated in a study within the 3 months prior to study entry
