      Primary Objective:

      Phase 1:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) of SAR650984
      (Isatuximab).

      Phase 2 (stage 1):

      To evaluate the activity of single-agent Isatuximab at different doses/schedules and to
      select dose and regimen to further evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of Isatuximab as
      single agent or in combination with dexamethasone.

      Phase 2 (stage 2):

      To evaluate the activity in terms of overall response rate (ORR) of Isatuximab at the
      selected dose/schedule from stage1, as single agent (ISA arm) and in combination with
      dexamethasone (ISAdex arm).

      Secondary Objectives:

      Phase 1:

        -  To characterize the global safety profile including cumulative toxicities.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Isatuximab in the proposed dosing
           schedule(s).

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamics (PD), immune response, and preliminary disease response.

      Phase 2 (stage 1): to evaluate the following objectives for Isatuximab as single agent:

        -  Safety

        -  Efficacy as measured by duration of response, clinical benefit rate, progression free
           survival, overall survival.

      Phase 2 (stage 2): to evaluate the following objectives in each arm (ISA and ISAdex):

        -  Safety

        -  Efficacy as measured by duration of response, clinical benefit rate, progression free
           survival, overall survival.

    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for
      inclusion of up to 2 weeks, treatment with Isatuximab QW (every week) or Q2W (every 2 weeks)
      unless discontinued earlier due to safety or disease progression. Patients will be followed
      for a minimum of 30 days following the last use of study drug or more than 30 days in case of
      unresolved toxicity, or up to initiation of another anticancer treatment.

      The Phase 2 study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for
      inclusion of up to 3 weeks, then a treatment period and a follow up period. Treatment will
      continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reactions or other reasons for
      discontinuation. Patients will be followed every 3 months following the last use of study
      drug until death or study cutoff whichever comes first.

    <description>Phase 1: Accelerated dose escalation phase (1 patient/cohort), two administrations every two weeks (Q2W) per dose cohort. Followed by basic dose escalation phase evaluating Isatuximab administration weekly (QW) and Q2W with 3-6 patients/cohort treated until disease progression or unsatisfactory safety. Cohort 1-10 will enroll patients with CD38+ hematological malignancies and cohort 11 onwards will enroll patients with multiple myeloma only. Two expansion cohorts will evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in standard risk and high risk multiple myeloma patients.
Phase 2: Stage 1 will further evaluate four randomized arms. Arm 1: Dose 1 Q2W, Arm 2: Dose 2 Q2W, Arm 3: Dose 2 Q2W for 2 cycles then every 4 weeks (Q4W), Arm 4: Dose 3 QW for 1 cycle then Q2W. Stage 2 will use the dose and schedule determined from stage 1 ie Isatuximab Dose 3 every week for 4 infusions followed by Dose 3 every 2 weeks.</description>
