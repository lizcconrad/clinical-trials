      In 50 breast cancer patients, heavily pretreated with anti-hormonal therapy, the
      investigators will evaluate the use of 16-alpha[18-fluoro]-17beta-estradiol positron emission
      tomography (FES-PET)as predictive biomarker for response to estrogen therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The estrogen receptor (ER) is expressed in approximately 70% of the breast carcinomas. In
      general, for these patients anti-hormonal therapy is the therapy of first choice. Despite
      good responses in 50-60% of the patients, unfortunately all patients develop (acquired)
      resistance. Patients with acquired anti-hormonal resistance can be subdivided into three
      different groups: (1) patients that have lost ER-expression (~25%), (2) patients with
      preserved ER-expression (~55%) and (3) patients with enhanced ER-expression (~30%). Several
      studies suggest different treatment strategies for these three different ER-phenotypes in
      antihormonal resistant breast cancer. In patients with acquired anti-hormonal resistance,
      ~30% of the patients still respond to hormone-additive therapy with estrogens. In vitro
      studies have shown estrogen-induced apoptosis in long-treated estrogen deprived cells
      (simulating aromatase inhibitor resistance). It is suggested that this
      estrogen-hypersensitivity is accompanied by increased ER-expression.

      Whole-body imaging of ER-density is now possible with positron emission tomography with the
      16-alpha[18-fluoro]-17beta-estradiol tracer (FES-PET). FES-PET has shown to be a predictive
      biomarker for response to first line anti-hormonal therapy.

      In this study we will include 50 patients, heavily pretreated with anti-hormonal therapy. All
      patients will undergo FES-PET at baseline and start estrogen therapy. Investigators and
      patients will be blinded for FES-PET results. Responders and non-responders will be defined
      using RECIST criteria and clinical follow-up. After response has been determined, FES-PET
      results will be analyzed. We hypothesize that patients responding to estrogen therapy can be
      identified on basis of high ER-expression determined by FES-PET.

    <description>FES-uptake (prior to estrogen therapy) of tumour lesions will be recorded for all patients.
Patients will be prospectively categorized into responders and non-responders during standard follow-up (consisting of monthly visits, 3-monthly CT, and other techniques when indicated). Patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease for &gt;6 months are defined as 'responders'.
With ROC analysis we will determine the optimal cut-off value for FES-uptake to predict response to estrogen therapy.</description>

    <description>In patients with acquired antihormonal resistance, eligible for estrogen therapy, a FES-PET scan will be made to determine FES-PET tumor uptake (which corresponds to estrogen receptor expression levels). Immediately after the FES-PET scan, all patients will start with a standard accepted dose of 2mg estradiol TID. Therapy response will be monitored by regular follow-up. RECIST criteria and clinical benefit will be used as criteria. In case of disease progression before end of the study period, estradiol treatment will be stopped.</description>
