      The purpose of this study is to see if the Neo-Urinary Conduit(NUC), which is made in the
      laboratory from a combination of a patient's own cells and other materials can be used to
      form a conduit to safety allow urine flow from the kidneys to outside the body after radical
      cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer.

      The NUC under investigation is a regenerative medicine product comprised of the patient's own
      smooth muscle cells, procured from a fat biopsy. Tengion has developed appropriate culture
      conditions to reproducibly generate the necessary quantities of SMC in vitro from autologous
      adipose tissue biopsies. The NUC is produced at Tengion's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)
      qualified clinical production facility. In this process, smooth muscle cells (SMC) obtained
      from an adipose tissue biopsy are propagated ex-vivo for approximately 3 - 4 weeks. At the
      end of this process, the SMCs are seeded onto the surface of a biodegradable PGA/PLGA mesh
      scaffold to form the NUC. The NUC is shipped to the investigative site for surgical
      implantation. Over time, the NUC should facilitate the regeneration of urinary tract tissue.
