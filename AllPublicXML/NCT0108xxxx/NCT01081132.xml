        <description>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) is a questionnaire composed of three indices: Global Executive Composite, Behavioral Regulation Index, and Metacognition Index. Items are rated 1 (never), 2 (sometimes), and 3 (often). The Global Executive Composite consists of 72 items with scoring ranging from 72 to 216. The Behavioral Regulation Index score is the total of 28 items and ranges from 28 to 84. The Metacognition Index score is the total of 44 items and ranges from 44 to 132. Lower scores reflect better functioning.</description>

        <description>C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period.

The assessment is done by the nature of the responses, not by a numbered scale.</description>
