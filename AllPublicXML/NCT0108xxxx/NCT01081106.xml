  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether low level laser therapy can help maintain normal
      hair growth on the scalp in people receiving chemotherapy, which is generally associated with
      hair loss.

    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is a common treatment given to patients with breast cancer. Many chemotherapy
      drugs cause rapid hair loss. While hair loss is temporary, this side effect is a significant
      concern for patients. Low level laser therapy has been shown to help make hair grow. It is
      hoped that it may stop hair loss from occurring.

      Participants will be receiving 20 to 30 minute laser sessions to their scalp twice a week
      beginning two weeks before treatment begins until one week past the last chemotherapy
      session. . Photographs will be taken during each study participant's initial visit, during
      treatment visits, and one month following the final chemotherapy treatment.
