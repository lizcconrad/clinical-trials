  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will modify our existing VMQ/VADIS mood telemetry software to run on a Motorola platform,
      and enhance it to collect information on both mood symptoms (currently covered by the
      VMQ/VADIS) as well as daily life stressors (currently outside the VMQ/VADIS' scope). By doing
      so, we will be able us to examine the role of daily stressors in the lives of teens with and
      without mood swings, to identify how changes in mood triggered by stressful events are
      similar to or different from mood changes linked to the bipolar disorder, borderline
      personality disorder, or other forms of affective instability.
