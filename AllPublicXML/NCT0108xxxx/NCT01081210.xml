  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound (US) is widely used as a diagnostic tool in a hospital setting. In a medical
      department, diagnosis like heart failure or most kinds of heart diseases, hypervolemia,
      hypovolemia, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites, diseases in the gall
      bladder/bile tract, urine tract and venous thrombosis are common. US is the key diagnostic
      tool in these diagnosis, and on early diagnosis is crucial both on behalf of the patients
      well-being, and for hospital logistic reasons.

        1. The aim is to study the clinical use of pocket sized US as a screening diagnostic tool
           in an department of internal medicine.

           Method: All patients admitted (in certain preset periods) to Department of medicine will
           be screened with pocket sized US by expert user. Changes in diagnoses, as well as
           medications as a result of US screening will be the endpoints. US findings will be
           validated against standard echocardiography, or standard US/CT/MRI performed at the
           Radiological department.

        2. The aim is to study the clinical use of pocket sized US as a screening diagnostic tool
           in a department of cardiology.

           Method: All patients admitted (in certain preset periods) to Department of cardiology
           will be screened with pocket sized US for heart disease, pericardial and pleural
           effusion. Examinations by expert users. Specific findings could be myocardial
           dysfunction as heart failure, cardiomyopathies, regional dysfunction due to ischemia,
           valvular dysfunction, atrial enlargement, and pleural/pericardial effusion. Changes in
           diagnoses, as well as medications as a result of US screening will be the endpoints. US
           findings will be validated against standard echocardiography in all.

        3. As in 1), but examination by non-expert users compared to expert users.
