  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an investigational drug known as the lidocaine 5%
      patch is safe and effective in reducing the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, to examine how
      topical lidocaine affects the nerve endings, and to determine whether treatment with the
      lidocaine patch can prevent the potential progression to chronic diabetic neuropathy pain in
      subjects who did not report pain at the start of the study.
