  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since a few years the SAGB-VC is used in our clinic. This type of band has a number of
      advantages when compared to the earlier versions of the adjustable gastric band (AGB),
      reducing the chances on leakage, tube disconnection and port problems. In our clinic the
      follow up is strict. All patients are required to follow a special follow-up program in which
      the patient is seen 19 times during the first two years after SAGB-VC placement.

      This is the first retrospective clinical study of a large study population of &gt;800 patients
      in which a SAGB-VC was placed. This study was conducted to evaluate the results and the
      efficiency of the SAGB-VC in our clinic.
