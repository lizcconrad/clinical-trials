      The aim of this study is to determine if assessment of additional measures of trunk
      neuromuscular control will improve the ability to identify patients with low back pain who
      successfully respond to trunk stabilization exercises.

      Question: What clinical characteristics are associated with patients that respond positively
      to a program of core stabilization exercises?

      Hypothesis: Clinical characteristics that show a decrease in trunk motor control will be
      associated with a positive response to stabilization exercises.

      Clinical identification of individuals with mechanical low back pain who would benefit from a
      program of stabilization exercises has been a struggle for the physical therapy profession.
      While changes in trunk muscle recruitment and motor control have been linked to patients with
      chronic low back pain and hypothesized to be adaptations for spinal instability, this has not
      been systematically established. However, a connection between spinal instability, poor trunk
      motor control, and low back pain is plausible. The real problem lies with the clinical
      identification of the subgroup of patients in either the acute or chronic phases of low back
      dysfunction who would most benefit from this approach to intervention.

      In creating their preliminary clinical prediction rule, Hicks et al (2005), looked at many
      variables including patient demographics and characteristics, hip and trunk motion, special
      tests for instability, and functional measures of muscle performance. However, measures of
      the performance of core stabilizing muscles and assessment of trunk dynamic control/
      coordination were not included as potential variables. The aim of this study is to determine
      if assessment of additional measures of trunk neuromuscular control will improve the ability
      to identify patients with low back pain who successfully respond to trunk stabilization
      exercises.

    <description>The 8-week program emphasizes use of specific local stabilizing muscles (transverse abdominis[TrA], lumbar multifidus[LM]) to restore active control to the trunk. Emphasis is on training isometric co-contractions and a progression (3 stages) based upon a motor learning paradigm.
Stage 1: neutral position of the spine and activation of the TrA and LM. Performance feedback is emphasized and monitored through observation and palpation.
Stage 2: maintenance the co-contraction while performing movements of the trunk and the upper and lower extremities. Trunk conditioning is also emphasized. Feedback is gradually reduced.
Stage 3: maintenance of the co-contraction while performing exercises on an unstable surface or during perturbation of the activity. Random practice patterns are used to enhance motor learning.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. duration of the current episode of low back pain less than 3 months,

          2. average pain intensity over past 3 days at least 4 on an 11 point (0 = no pain, 10 =
             worst pain ever) numeric pain rating scale,

          3. no medical intervention for low back pain in last 6 months,

          4. Oswestry score greater than 25%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. permanent structural spinal deformity (e.g., scoliosis)
