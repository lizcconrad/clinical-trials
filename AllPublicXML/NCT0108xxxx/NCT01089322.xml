  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of asthma treatment but despite being
      correctly diagnosed, conveniently prescribed and adherent to the therapeutics, 5% to 10% of
      asthmatics do not reach disease control.

      The aim of this study is to measure asthma control, evaluate inflammatory and functional
      characteristics, describe comorbidities and aggravating factors and phenotypes derived from
      the characteristics of a severe asthmatic population followed at an outpatient university
      service in Sao Paolo, Brazil.

      Study design: interventional

      Patients selection:

      Seventy-four severe asthma patients, aged between 18 and 65 years old were recruited from the
      outpatient clinics of the Pulmonary Division of the University of São Paolo Hospital.

      Severe asthma were defined according to GINA. Intervention: after 2 weeks screening period
      patients were treated with high inhaled corticosteroid dose plus long acting beta 2 agonist
      during 12 weeks plus oral corticosteroid ( prednisone 40 mg/day) during 2 weeks.

      Procedures ( baseline, after 2 weeks and 12 weeks): asthma control questionnaire (ACQ),
      asthma control (ACT) test, lung function test, quality of life questionnaire (SGRQ and
      SF-36), exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), induced sputum (IS). After 12 weeks patients underwent
      the following evaluation: Upper Digestive Endoscopy, Esophageal 24hs pHmetry, High Resolution
      Chest Tomography, Nasoscope exam,Bronchofibroscopy with endobronchial biopsy.
