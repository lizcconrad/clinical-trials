      Study to evaluate the safety and performance of a new blister patch intended to treat
      blisters on the heel of the foot.

      The study will require participation for up to 14 days of participation or less if the
      blister heals sooner, will recruit 100 subjects with fluid filled blisters on the heel of the
      foot that are intact and not broken. Some subjects will be asked to have their blisters
      photographed. All subjects will be required to have their blister unroofed (top layer of skin
      removed by the physician using sterile instruments). All subjects will receive study product,
      either test product or a marketed product.
