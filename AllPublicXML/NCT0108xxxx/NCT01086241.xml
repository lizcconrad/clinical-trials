  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tomosynthesis is a new digital mammographic tool which can be performed at the same time as
      routine screening mammography. It creates CT-like slices through the breast, minimizing the
      tissue overlap. Tomosynthesis has the potential to improve screening mammography outcomes by
      increasing cancer detection rates, decreasing false negative rates and false positive rates.
      This trial will help determine if tomosynthesis is useful in a screening setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will evaluate the effect of tomosynthesis mammography outcomes in a screening setting. We
      will collect data on interpretation time, recall rates, cancer detection rates, and interval
      cancer rates in dense breasts(≥ 50% glandular density). If the interpretation time is less
      than 4X a routine read, and the recall rates have dropped &lt; 30% of initial values, we will
      then conduct a study with larger numbers to better evaluate cancer detection rates and
      interval cancer rates.

    <description>Those patients randomized to the tomosynthesis arm will receive a combination of 3D and 2D screening mammogram. The additional tomosynthesis data is obtained immediately after acquisition of the 2D study, with the patient and breast remaining in the same position and compression. Compression lasts about 7 seconds longer for each of the 4 views. The x-ray tube is programmed to obtain an arc of low dose projection images through the breast.</description>
