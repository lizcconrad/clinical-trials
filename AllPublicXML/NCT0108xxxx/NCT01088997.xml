  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine a safe dose of milrinone to use in a larger
      study of babies with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a condition in which the pulmonary
      vasculature fails to relax after birth resulting in severe hypoxemia. This condition has a
      high rate of mortality and morbidity. The current standard of care is treatment with inhaled
      nitric oxide (iNO). However, for many babies this treatment does not provide sufficient
      improvement in oxygenation.

      In this study, subjects already receiving nitric oxide will be randomized to one of two
      dosing regimens of milrinone. They will receive milrinone IV for 24 hours and will be
      monitored for 24 hours afterwards. During this time, milrinone assays will be performed by
      blood sampling. Echocardiograms will also be performed to explore the pharmacodynamics of
      milrinone. Safety monitoring will be performed.

    <time_frame>End of bolus dose, 15 minutes prior to end of infusion (EOI), at four time points after EOI with final sample at 12-15 hours after EOI (timing based on infant's weight)</time_frame>
    <description>The schedule of milrinone pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling varied by weight to minimize blood sampling. For babies weighing less than 3kg, samples were drawn at the end of the bolus, 15 minutes prior to the end of infusion (EOI) and 20 minutes, 1, 2, 6 and 12 hours after EOI. For babies weighing 3kg or more, samples were drawn at the end of the bolus, 6 hours after start of infusion, 15 minutes prior to the EOI and 30 minutes, 1, 3, 9 and 15 hours after EOI. Milrinone plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-performance mass spectrometry assay.</description>

    <description>Oxygenation Index (mean airway pressure*Fraction of Inspired Oxygen/Partial Pressure of Oxygen in the blood) was calculated at baseline and every 6 hours after start of infusion until 12-24 hours after initiation of milrinone infusion.</description>

    <measure>Change in Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) From Baseline to up to 24 Hours After Start of Milrinone Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after start of infusion</time_frame>
    <description>An echocardiogram obtained while on milrinone was obtained with the goal of attempting to look for improvements in parameters associated with pulmonary hypertension. The primary parameter measured was the myocardial performance index (MPI). An Echocardiogram was performed at baseline (pre-infusion) and repeated 12-24 hours ater the initiation of the Milrinone infusion. Also known as the Tei index, the MPI is an index that incorporates both systolic and diastolic time intervals in expressing global systolic and diastolic ventricular function. Systolic dysfunction prolongs preejection (isovolumic contraction time, IVCT) and a shortening of the ejection time (ET). Both systolic and diastolic dysfunction result in abnormality in myocardial relaxation which prolongs the relaxation period (isovolumic relaxation time, IVRT). Normal value for MPI is 0.39+/-0.05 with dilated cardiomyopathy value of MPI at 0.59+/-0.10 (both units on a scale)</description>

        <description>The schedule of milrinone pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling varied by weight to minimize blood sampling. For babies weighing less than 3kg, samples were drawn at the end of the bolus, 15 minutes prior to the end of infusion (EOI) and 20 minutes, 1, 2, 6 and 12 hours after EOI. For babies weighing 3kg or more, samples were drawn at the end of the bolus, 6 hours after start of infusion, 15 minutes prior to the EOI and 30 minutes, 1, 3, 9 and 15 hours after EOI. Milrinone plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-performance mass spectrometry assay.</description>

        <title>Change in Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) From Baseline to up to 24 Hours After Start of Milrinone Infusion</title>
        <description>An echocardiogram obtained while on milrinone was obtained with the goal of attempting to look for improvements in parameters associated with pulmonary hypertension. The primary parameter measured was the myocardial performance index (MPI). An Echocardiogram was performed at baseline (pre-infusion) and repeated 12-24 hours ater the initiation of the Milrinone infusion. Also known as the Tei index, the MPI is an index that incorporates both systolic and diastolic time intervals in expressing global systolic and diastolic ventricular function. Systolic dysfunction prolongs preejection (isovolumic contraction time, IVCT) and a shortening of the ejection time (ET). Both systolic and diastolic dysfunction result in abnormality in myocardial relaxation which prolongs the relaxation period (isovolumic relaxation time, IVRT). Normal value for MPI is 0.39+/-0.05 with dilated cardiomyopathy value of MPI at 0.59+/-0.10 (both units on a scale)</description>
