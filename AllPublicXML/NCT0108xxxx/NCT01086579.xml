      Prospective multicentre randomized (1:1) investigator initiated study, in which consecutive
      patients undergoing percutaneous revascularization of small coronary vessels will be assigned
      to one of the two study arms:

        1. Treatment Arm: IN.PACT Falcon™ paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (DEB) dilatation and
           provisional spot bare-metal stenting (BMS).

        2. Control Arm: paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) implantation as per standard practice.

      Eligible subjects with coronary artery disease in a small vessel (reference diameter&lt;2.8mm)
      will be consecutively screened and enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria

      The objective of the study is to assess the non-inferiority of the DEB to the PES as regards
      to primary endpoint of mean late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months, defined as the difference
      between postprocedural minimum luminal (MLD) diameter and follow-up MLD, as assessed by
      quantitative coronary angiography and is based on the following assumptions:

        1. The means of LLL in the 2 groups are precisely equal

        2. A standard deviation in LLL of 0.5mm in both groups as demonstrated in the ISAR-SMART 3
           and PEPCAD II trials

        3. A non-inferiority margin of 0.25mm between groups is clinically unimportant

      Based on these assumptions:

        1. Null hypothesis (N0): mean LLL in DEB group is ≥0.25mm than that in the PES group (i.e.
           PES is superior to DEB)

        2. Alternative hypothesis 1 (H1): mean LLL between DEB and PES is &lt;0.25mm (i.e. DEB is
           non-inferior to PES)

        3. Alternative hypothesis 2 (H2): mean LLL between DEB and PES &lt;0 (i.e. DEB is superior to
           PES) Based on the above calculations, a sample size of 77 patients will be required in
           each group to show non-inferiority of DEB vs. PES with an α error of 0.025 (one-sided Z
           test) and a power of 80%. To account for a 20% rate of withdrawal, lost to follow-up or
           not presenting for follow-up angiography, a total of 182 patients (91 in each group)
           will be randomized.
