  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the addition of aliskiren, to amlodipine can
      attenuate ankle edema formation in hypertensive patients.

    <measure>Change in the Ankle Foot Volume (AFV) as Measured by Displacement Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AFV (mL) was measured using the principle of water displacement using a commercially available foot volumeter. The amount of water displaced in milliliters (mL) equals the volume of the foot/ankle. The study was terminated due to the publication of the results of a near identical study by Fogari et al. Hence, for the current study, no analysis was performed.</description>

          <title>Change in the Ankle Foot Volume (AFV) as Measured by Displacement Method</title>
          <description>AFV (mL) was measured using the principle of water displacement using a commercially available foot volumeter. The amount of water displaced in milliliters (mL) equals the volume of the foot/ankle. The study was terminated due to the publication of the results of a near identical study by Fogari et al. Hence, for the current study, no analysis was performed.</description>
