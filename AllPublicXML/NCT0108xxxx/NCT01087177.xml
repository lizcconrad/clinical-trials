    <textblock>
      The study involves the testing of a Pedialink module through parent exit interviews in one
      intervention practice and one control practice. Pedialink is the American Academy of
      Pediatrics' online home for continuous professional development. The intervention site will
      complete the Pedialink module and the control site will be given routine tobacco control
      materials.

      We will measure changes in practice patterns in the two pediatric practices following the
      implementation of the online training. At each of these practices, the parents or guardians
      of children seen by the practice will be surveyed for a one week period before, and a one
      week period six weeks after either using the online training module (intervention) or being
      given routine tobacco materials (control).

      A follow-up telephone survey will be given to some parents at 3-months. Those given the
      telephone survey are parents or guardians who smoke or parents or guardians who live with a
      smoker and are surveyed at the second time-point.

      We hypothesize that intervention practices will have higher rates of screening for home and
      car no-smoking rules and higher rates of advising for home and car no-smoking rules.

      This study will involve developing an online training and dissemination system to train
      pediatricians to address the secondhand smoke exposure of children. We will gather pediatric
      staff responses to the specific components of the online training and refine this training
      for a range of outpatient pediatric office settings. We will test the feasibility and
      efficacy of implementing the online training and dissemination system within the pediatric
      office setting. We will also gather parental responses to specific components of the
      pediatric visit, which will be impacted by the online training for pediatric offices.

      The following hypotheses will be tested:

      Primary Hypothesis

      H1. The following measures of physician behavior, as assessed by exit interviews, 3 month
      follow up telephone interviews of parents or guardians who smoke or parents or guardians who
      live with a smoker and chart review of 20 charts, will increase more in the intervention
      practice than in the control practice:

        -  Screening for home no-smoking rule

        -  Screening for car no-smoking rule

        -  Advising parents about the need for a strictly enforced no-smoking in the home rule

        -  Advising parents about the need for a strictly enforced no-smoking in the car rule.

      Secondary Hypothesis H2. Compared to the control practice, the intervention practice will
      have a greater increase in the summary scores that measure the key processes of practice
      implementation shown to predict successful practice change. This implementation process will
      be measured by administering previously validated surveys to physicians and key practice
      staff before and following the implementation of the office system.
