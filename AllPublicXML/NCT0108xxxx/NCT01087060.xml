    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to show additional diagnostic criteria of computed tomography (CT)
      scan to diagnose and predict the detection and recurrence of cystic renal cell carcinoma in
      the patients with complicated renal cysts. Furthermore, we would demonstrate the relationship
      between complicated renal cysts diagnosed by Bosniak system and some parameters of
      pathological results. The analysis about detection time of renal malignancy would help
      determine the practical guidelines of follow-up plan for complicated renal cysts.

      Even though there have been many trials and errors to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of CT
      scans for complicated cysts, the trial to obtain the enhanced accuracy using CT scan would be
      still valuable, when we consider its widespread use. A previous study demonstrated that the
      enhancement of HU with intravenous administration of contrast material on CT scan by 15 HU
      would be &quot;almost always indicative of a pathologic process although not always a malignancy&quot;,
      another study showed the cut-off as 42 or 47 HU gap would be helpful in the prediction of
      renal malignancy.

    <measure>additional diagnostic criteria of CT to diagnose and predict the detection and recurrence of cystic RCC in the patients with complicated renal cysts</measure>
    <description>First, the primary outcomes is to determine cut-off values of maximal HU and the maximal gap of HU (HU of early excretory phase minus that of non-enhanced phase in CT scan)to predict the detection of renal malignancy. Some clinical factors (age, height, body weight, etc) were also included in the analysis.
Second, the above-mentioned factors were included in the analysis of risk factors for recurrence of complicated renal cysts to determine the cut-off values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>informative to determine the time of operation and which is better for a patient with a complicated cyst between partial or radical nephrectomy</measure>
    <description>The cut-off values would show a guideline to determine the time of operation for a patient with complicated renal cysts, namely, the nephrectomy should be performed earlier if the patient is included in the high-risk group. Furthermore, the cut-off value would be helpful in the determination in what operation would be proper to the patient. A partial nephrectomy would be more beneficial to every patient than radical nephrectomy, however, if the patient is in the high-risk group for early recurrence, the patient should undergo 'radical' nephrectomy first for complicated renal cysts.</description>

          -  no serial CT images

          -  cysts of autosomal dominant adult polycystic kidney disease

          -  cysts less than 1cm in diameter (difficult to evaluate accurately)

          -  follow-up period less than 1 yr in the patients who had no surgery
