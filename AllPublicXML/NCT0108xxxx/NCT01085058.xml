      This investigator initiated trial was a prospective, open, single-arm, diagnostic-prognostic
      study. Patients who received high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation for
      the treatment of their lymphoproliferative disease were included into the study.

      After completion of the high-dose therapy (day -2 with respect to the stem cell
      transplantation) the first blood sample A for the cytocapacity test with determination of
      leukocytes and neutrophils was taken in the evening of day -1. Directly thereafter the study
      medication was administered. The second blood sample B for the cytocapacity test with
      determination of leukocytes and neutrophils was taken in the morning of day 0, 12-14 hours
      after administration of the study medication. Thereafter the stem cell re-infusion was
      performed.

      The primary objective of this study was to show that the cytocapacity test with lenograstim
      is a useful predictive tool with respect to the risk of post-transplant complications and
      prolonged myelosuppression, typically occurring after high-dose chemotherapy.

      The primary variables were:

        -  the rate of patients with documented infections

        -  the time to platelet engraftment
