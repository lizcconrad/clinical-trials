      Abstract

      Telbivudine is a potent inhibitor of HBV but, due to a low genetic barrier to resistance, a
      high incidence of resistance has been observed in patients with high baseline levels of
      replication and in those with detectable HBV DNA after 24 weeks of therapy (A1). Telbivudine
      might be used in patients with good predictors of response (HBV DNA &lt;2 X 106 IU/ ml, i.e.
      approximately 107 copies/ ml, or 6.3 log 10 IU/ ml at baseline) with verification of HBV DNA
      suppression below detection in real time PCR assay at 24 weeks.(EASL Guidelines for HBV 2009)
      The therapy of Pegylated-interferon-alpha-2a is considered as the standard of care for
      patients with chronic hepatitis b viral infection. However, recent study by Buster et al
      showed that a sustained viral response (SVR less than 2000 iu.ml at 6 months after
      treatment)) is obtained in 8 % of patients with genotype D, 30% genotype A, and 20-25%
      genotypes B or C (47). Vitamin D is a potent immune-modulator; and has been shown to improve
      SVR in combination with peg interferone in patients with chronic HCV viral infection (48).
      The impact of vitamin D on virologic response rates of interferon-based treatment of CHB is
      unknown. The aim of this study therefore was to assess whether Vitamin D, added to the
      conventional peg therapy in CHB, or to nucleotide analogues could improve the treatment
      efficacy

HBsAg titre during treatment and at 6 months follow up will be measured also (ROCH or Abott Kit).</description>

Vitamin D levels will be measures at baseline and three months after. The serum vitamin D-25-OH levels should be &gt; 32 ng/ml before the initiation of antiviral treatment). HBV DNA levels will be also measure at baseline and after 3 months of mono therapy with vitamin D</description>
