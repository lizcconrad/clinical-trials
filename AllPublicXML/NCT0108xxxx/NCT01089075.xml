  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydrocortisone replacement therapy
      in patients with partial cortisol deficiency after traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid
      hemorrhage on cognitive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, interventional
      study. The benefit of replacement in partial corticotropic failure on brain function
      (cognition), especially in cases with borderline low cortisol levels after stimulation is
      unknown.

      Moreover, since glucocorticoids might affect hGH secretion, the effect of hydrocortisone on
      hGH secretion reflected by IGF-1 levels will be assessed. If IGF-1 is below 2 SD at the end
      of the study, hGH secretion will additionally be determined by a GHRH-arginine-test.

      An improved cognition in TBI and SAH patients with partial corticotropic insufficiency would
      give a new treatment option in this population which may lead to better quality of life and
      an enhanced rehabilitation process.

             treatment

          -  Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient unsuitable

          -  Severe medical or psychiatric disease

          -  Change of dosage of any other drug which might influence the corticotrope axis or
             cognitive function (e.g. antidepressive treatment) during the last 3 weeks

          -  Oral contraceptives
