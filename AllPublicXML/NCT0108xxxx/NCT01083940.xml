    <textblock>
      In response to the Finding Answers: Disparities Research for Change call for proposals by the
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we were funded to evaluate the effectiveness of a planned
      computerized decision support (CDS) intervention aimed at medical providers to overcome
      clinical inertia when treating blood pressure for hypertensive patients. Based on prior
      evaluation of the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) adult primary care clinics, we
      hypothesize that racial and ethnic differences in blood pressure outcomes are largely
      attributable in differences in providers' aggressiveness in managing patients with
      hypertension based on patients' race and ethnicity. Within our network of 14 hospital and
      community-based Brigham and Women's Hospital adult primary care clinics, we aim to determine
      if the use of CDS to remind to medical providers of poorly controlled hypertensive patients
      to intensify their hypertension therapy will improve overall rates of blood pressure control
      and reduce the previously documented racial and ethnic disparities in blood pressure outcomes
      among our hypertensive patient population. Clinics will first be stratified by location
      (hospital-based versus community-based) and within each strata will be randomized to either
      have their providers receive CDS for hypertensive patients whose most recent blood pressure
      was uncontrolled or to usual care for hypertensive patients. More specifically, we will
      evaluate our planned intervention by utilizing an 18 month cluster-randomized controlled
      trial to examine the effectiveness the CDS for intensification of hypertension therapy in:
      improving levels of blood pressure control, improving provider adherence with recommended
      changes in drug therapy, and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in the processes of
      hypertension care and outcomes among our patients receiving primary care for a diagnosis of
      hypertension.
