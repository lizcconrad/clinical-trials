    <textblock>
      Approximately 150 female volunteers wishing to become pregnant will be recruited via web
      recruitment from around the UK and randomised 1:1 to receive Clearblue Digital ovulation
      tests (active arm) or no aid to conception (control arm) for 2 full menstrual cycles. All
      volunteers will complete study questionnaires and provide a urine sample at designated time
      points though out the menstrual cycle.

      A sub-arm to this study, applied the same protocol to women in an infertility treatment
      setting; Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield. Additional exclusion criteria were applied to
      this cohort; had regular menstrual cycles between 25 and 35 days, and who did not have a
      diagnosis of bilateral or unilateral tubal blockage, documented anovulation or severe
      male-factor infertility (with &lt;5 million motile sperm per ejaculate). For this arm, the
      protocol was reviewed by Sheffield Research Ethics Committee 09/H1308/134.
