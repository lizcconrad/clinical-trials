  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current spirochaete infection identification and diagnostic strategies have important
      limitations. Recent development may allow for an improvement in diagnostic, screening and
      survey capabilities. The goal of this study is to evaluate blood, urine and fecal samples
      from a variety of sources and generate information on the occurrence and epidemiology of
      spirochetes in the general and at risk populations.

      The intent of this protocol is to obtain blood, feces and urine samples from subjects with or
      without a suspected spirochaete infection, so these samples can be used in
      spirochaete-related scientific studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must be able to be fully consented to the study.

          2. The subject must be 18 years of age or older.

          3. The subject must be mentally competent as determined by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. The subject must not weigh less than 110lbs.

          3. If the subject will be contributing more that 60 ml of blood during an 8 (eight) week
             period, then the subject must not have donated red blood cells within the last 8
             (eight) weeks.

             blood.

          5. If in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject has any clinically significant
             medical diagnosis/conditions which would prevent participation.
