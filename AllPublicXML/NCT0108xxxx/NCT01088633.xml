    <measure>Characterization of particles in exhaled breath of subjects with COPD compared with healthy smokers.</measure>
    <time_frame>within one day</time_frame>
    <description>At visit 2, the exhaled particle analysis will be performed. These measurements will be repeated after 2 hours on the same day.
Visit 3:
After a baseline exhaled particle analysis, the subjects will inhale nebulized saline (2.5 ml of a 0.9 % NaCl-solution). Aerosol generation and transport will be recorded immediately after the end of inhalation as well as 2 hours and 4 hours.</description>

    <description>At visit 2, the exhaled particle analysis will be performed. Subjects will be asked to breath through the device and to perform several breathing maneuvers such as deep breathing, shallow breathing, rapid breathing, slow breathing. These measurements will be repeated after 2 hours on the same day.
Visit 3:
After a baseline exhaled particle analysis, the subjects will inhale nebulized saline (2.5 ml of a 0.9 % NaCl-solution). Aerosol generation and transport will be recorded immediately after the end of inhalation as well as 2 hours and 4 hours after the start of inhalation using the same techniques as in visit 2.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, aged â‰¥ 18 years

             according to GOLD guidelines)9

          3. Healthy smokers: current smokers with a history of at least 10 packyears and no signs
             of bronchial obstruction in spirometry (FEV1 &gt;= 80% pred, FEV1/FVC &gt;= 70%)

          4. Able and willing to give written informed consent

          5. Women will be considered for inclusion if they are:

               -  not pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test, and not nursing

               -  of non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming
                  pregnant, including any female who is pre-menarchial or post-menopausal, with
                  documented proof of hysterectomy or tubal ligation, or meet clinical criteria for
                  menopause and has been amenorrhoeic for more than 1 year prior to the screening
                  visit)

               -  of childbearing potential and using a highly effective method of contraception
                  during the entire study (vasectomized partner, sexual abstinence) - the lifestyle
                  of the female should be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse
                  from two weeks prior to the study until at least 72 hours after the end of the
                  study , implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs, or
                  double-barrier methods, i.e. any double combination of IUD, condom with
                  spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap)

          6. Available to complete all study measurements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of lower respiratory tract infection four weeks prior to the informed consent
             visit

          2. Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the outcome
             of this study. These diseases include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease,
             malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological disease, neurological
             disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to
             tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis)

          3. History of drug or alcohol abuse

          4. Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and
             study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study

          5. Inability to abstain from bronchodilators according to section 8.2 (Prohibited
             medication)

          6. Risk of non-compliance with study procedures
