      Primary Objective:

      To characterize left ventricular (LV) threshold behavior over time using daily left
      ventricular capture management (LVCM) measurements.

      Study Design:

      This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study with patients receiving their
      first cardiac resynchronisation therapy-implantable cardioverter defibrillator (CRT-ICD)
      device. The study design, based on the primary objective, is an observational examination of
      LV thresholds over time. Daily left ventricular threshold measurements will be collected
      using the LVCM feature. Up to 150 patients will be enrolled in Canada to evaluate the primary
      objective at up to 15 study centers.

      Data will be collected at Baseline, Implant, 12 months post-implant and all regularly
      scheduled follow-up visits up to 12 months post-implant.

      Devices:

      The ConcertoTM CRT-ICD device and future Medtronic CRT-ICD devices containing the LVCM
      feature will be used in this study.

      I. Study Purpose:

      The purpose of the LEARN Study is to provide information that will assist clinicians in
      managing LV thresholds.

      II. Device Description:

      The CRT-ICD devices to be used in this study are all Therapeutic Products Directorate
      licensed, market released Medtronic CRT-ICD devices equipped with the LVCM feature. Currently
      this includes only the ConcertoTM CRT Defibrillator. Future Medtronic models equipped with
      the LVCM feature that become Therapeutic Products Directorate licensed and market released in
      the future are also included.

      The study will allow all commercially available leads from all manufacturers that are
      compatible with Medtronic CRT-ICD devices. Devices will be programmed and interrogated with a
      Medtronic 9790 or 2090 programmer.

      Medtronic defibrillators automatically detect and treat episodes of ventricular fibrillation
      (VF), ventricular tachycardia (VT) and bradyarrhythmia. When a ventricular arrhythmia is
      detected, the implantable devices deliver defibrillation, cardioversion, anti-tachycardia
      pacing or standard pacing therapy to terminate the ventricular arrhythmia. In addition,
      Medtronic CRT defibrillators, including Concerto, also provide Cardiac Resynchronization
      therapy. All devices in this study will be used according to their intended use.

      III. Study Objective:

      Primary Study Objective: To characterize LV threshold behavior over time.

      IV. Study Scope:

      150 patients will be enrolled in Canada to evaluate the primary objective at up to 15 study
      centers. Individual centers will be limited to a maximum of 30 enrollments.

      Patients will be followed for a 12 month period with interim visits occurring according to
      regular clinic follow up schedules.

      V. Methodology:

      A. Study Design This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study with patients
      receiving their first CRT-ICD device. The study design, based on the primary objective, is an
      observational examination of LV thresholds.

      Patients will be followed in clinic as per the hospital ICD clinic standard follow up
      schedule with a mandatory follow-up visit at 12 months (± 30 days) post-implant. The
      following will be collected at the 12 month (± 30 days) visit and at all regularly scheduled
      follow-up visits: LV threshold measurements, changes in cardiovascular medications and a save
      to disk file.

      B. Patient Population Inclusion Criteria

        -  Patients who will be implanted with their first CRT defibrillator system.

        -  Patients who will be implanted with a Medtronic CRT defibrillator containing the LVCM
           feature.

        -  Patients who are willing and able to sign an IRB/MEC approved patient informed consent.

        -  Patients who are geographically stable and available for follow-up at the study center
           for the required follow-up duration of the study

      Exclusion Criteria

      Patients who meet any of the following criteria are excluded from entry into the study:

        -  Patients who have a pre-existing LV lead prior to enrollment

        -  Patients who have a life expectancy of less than 1 year

        -  Patients included in another clinical trial that will affect the objectives of this
           study

      VI. Study Procedures:

      A. Overview of Data Collection Requirements:

      Clinical data will be collected at baseline, implant, regularly scheduled follow-up visits
      over 12months, system modifications, and patient withdrawal/exit.

      Data will be collected via case report forms, and Save-to-Disk files.

      B. Enrollment Procedures:

      There are no medications or treatments that are required in this study. Patients enrolled in
      the LEARN Study will receive the standard of medical care that is typically provided by the
      investigator. There are no medications or treatments that are not permitted in this study,
      unless they conflict with the patient inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Patients planned to be implanted with a CRT-ICD will be evaluated for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Patients who meet these inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to
      participate in the study. Each study subject must sign an IRB/MEC approved consent form prior
      to implant. Once the patient signs the consent form the patient is enrolled in the LEARN
      Study. Patients must be consented and enrolled prior to hospital discharge.

      At the time of enrollment, a Baseline Case Report Form must be completed. The following
      information will be documented on this form:

        -  Verification that all inclusion/exclusion criteria were met

        -  Patient demographic information

        -  Cardiovascular status and history

        -  Arrhythmia status and history

        -  Current Cardiovascular and Medications

      C. Implant Procedures:

      The Medtronic device will be implanted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
      leads will be implanted according to the instructions provided with the applicable lead. Only
      commercially available RA, RV and LV leads may be used in this study.

      At implant, record the model number and serial number of the device and leads implanted on
      the implant form.

      In the event that a patient does not receive a ConcertoTM or equivalent LVCM equipped
      Medtronic CRT-ICD device, they will be withdrawn from the study via a study exit case report
      form. In the event that an LV lead cannot be placed at the time of implant and subsequent
      attempts to implant an LV lead are either not successful or not attempted, the patient will
      be withdrawn from the study via a study exit case report form.

      D. LVCM Programming Requirements:

      In order to collect data on LV thresholds, the LVCM feature must be set to either Monitor or
      Adaptive. The setting must be noted on the implant form.

      E. Follow-up Procedures:

      The following will be performed at all regularly scheduled in-clinic follow-up visits for 12
      months post-implant including the required 12 month visit. Record the required data on the
      corresponding CRF for each patient.

        1. Record LV lead data on the follow up CRF.

        2. Record results of manual LV threshold testing

      b) 'Interrogate all' and perform a final Save-to-Disk.

      F. Adverse Event Reporting:

      Adverse events will not be collected in this study.

      G. System Modification:

      In the event that the CRT defibrillator or lead system requires invasive modification (e.g.,
      device or LV lead explant, device or LV lead replacement, attempting to place LV lead after
      initial failed attempt, or lead repositioning), the System Modification Case Report Form must
      be completed.

      If the patient's CRT defibrillator system or LV lead is explanted and not replaced, complete
      a study exit form and exit the patient from the study.

      H. Study Exit:

      In the event that a patient is unable or unwilling to continue participation in the study,
      notify the Medtronic Clinical Research Manager immediately.

      Patients who are enrolled in the study, but do not receive a Concerto or equivalent Medtronic
      device, as well as patients who do not receive an LV lead must be withdrawn via a Study Exit
      Case Report Form.

      If a patient expresses desire to withdraw from the study, a Study Exit Case Report Form must
      be completed. The reason for patient withdrawal must be documented on this form.

      In the case that the patient fails to comply with the follow-up schedule, the study site must
      attempt to contact the patient. Each attempt to contact the patient must be documented in the
      patient's records. In the event that the patient is lost to follow-up, a Study Exit Case
      Report Form must be completed. Details on all attempts to contact the patient and the method
      used (e.g. telephone, registered mail) must be recorded on the case report form.

      In the event of a patient death, a study exit form should be completed with patient death
      listed as the reason for withdrawal.

      I. Study Deviations:

      A Study Deviation is defined as an event where the clinical Investigator or site personnel
      did not conduct the study according to the Investigational Plan, protocol, applicable laws or
      regulations or the Investigator Agreement. Examples include but are not limited to: failure
      to obtain informed consent, missing save to disk etc. It is the responsibility of the
      investigator to notify the study sponsor (Medtronic of Canada Ltd.) of any deviation and
      complete the Deviation CRF including rationale for the deviation. Any planned deviation that
      may affect the rights, safety or welfare of a patient involved in this study requires prior
      approval of the IRB/MEC and Medtronic. If a patient is enrolled in violation of the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria, the patient will not contribute to the study objectives. All protocol
      deviations should be reported by the investigator to Medtronic on a deviation CRF and to the
      sites IRB/MEC as per IRB/MEC policy.
