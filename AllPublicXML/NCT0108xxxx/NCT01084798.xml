    <textblock>
      This is an observational, non comparative, non-randomised, open-label, retrospective, single
      centre study planned to collect the data of subjects diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS)
      as per Poser or McDonald criteria between 1997 and 2007 in Taiwan. The clinical features and
      annual relapse rate in the first five years after the onset of disease have been compared
      between conventional and optico-spinal MS in the earlier studies. This study aims to
      understand the clinical care pathway of MS subjects and facilitate the subject's diagnosis
      before converting to MS.

      Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and
      is characterised by areas of demyelination, or plaques in the CNS. The disease is twice as
      prevalent in women as compared to men and causes considerable disability over time and
      continues for the lifetime of the subject. Subjects with MS are thought to have a genetic
      predisposition for the disease, though environmental factors such as geographic location and
      possibly viral infection also play an important role in the process of development of the
      disease.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To understand the clinical care pathways of MS subjects at the site over the last 10
           years in order to raise the medical attention of MS diagnosis

      Secondary objective:

        -  To review the pattern of MS treatment regimens in MS subjects at a particular site
           between 1997 and 2007
