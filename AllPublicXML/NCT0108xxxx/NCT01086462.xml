      This study is a first administration to man microdose study to describe the pharmacokinetics
      of GSK2239633.

    <textblock>
      The different shapes of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles following administration of
      GSK2239633 in rat and dog make it difficult to reliably predict the human PK profile. This
      microdose study will provide an early readout on the distribution and clearance profile of
      the drug in man and will be used to model potential clinical oral doses. The study will be
      conducted using an open-label, single dose design in one group of healthy male volunteers.
      Each subject will receive a single intravenous infusion of 100ug GSK2239633 (containing
      approximately 10kBq of [14C]-GSK2239633), administered over 15 minutes. Subjects will attend
      for a screening visit within 30 days prior to Day 1 and receive a single dose infusion of
      study drug on Day 1. Blood and urine samples will be taken over 48 hours for pharmacokinetic
      and total radioactivity analysis, and safety and tolerability will be monitored. Subjects
      will be discharged on Day 3 and a follow-up telephone call will be made 4-10 days post-dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects are defined as individuals who in the opinion of the Investigator are
             free from clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal,
             haematological, endocrine, neurological and psychiatric disease or malignancy as
             determined by medical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and other
             tests (including ECG). Subjects with values outside the normal range which are deemed
             to be clinically relevant should always be excluded from enrollment.

          -  Male between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          -  Subject must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. of
             the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of screening until 90 days
             after the follow up

          -  Body weight &gt;or= 50 kg and BMI within range 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  Single QTcF &lt;450 msec; or QTcF &lt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block

          -  Lifelong non-smokers or ex-smokers of greater than 6 months and &lt;5 pack year history.
             Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked.

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;or=1.5 ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 x
             ULN acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
