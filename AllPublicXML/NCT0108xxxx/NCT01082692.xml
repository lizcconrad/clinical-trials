  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DNA vaccines consist of small pieces of DNA also known as plasmids, and have several
      potential advantages over traditional vaccines. Thus far, DNA vaccines appear to be well
      tolerated in humans. We have developed DNA vaccine, PENNVAX-B, which includes plasmids
      targeting the gag, pol, and env proteins of HIV-1. The vaccine will be delivered via
      electroporation (EP) which uses the CELLECTRA constant current device to deliver a small
      electric charge following injection, since animal studies have shown that this delivery
      method increases the immune response to vaccine. The vaccine will be given to HIV-1 infected
      subjects whose viral load is undetectable on a HAART regimen, with CD4 lymphocyte count above
      400 cells/µL of blood. It is hypothesized that PENNVAX-B + EP will be safe and well
      tolerated.

      A single group of approximately 12 HIV-infected subjects will receive a 4 dose series of
      PENNVAX-B containing 3 mg of DNA/dose at study entry (Day 0), Week 4, 8, 16 and will be
      followed for a total of 48 weeks.
