  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether armodafinil treatment is more
      effective than placebo treatment in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift
      work disorder (SWD) by measuring improved clinical condition late in the shift, including the
      commute home.

      <recruitment_details>385 patients at 45 centers in the US met entry criteria and were considered eligible for enrollment into the study; 2 of these patients enrolled twice under different identification numbers. Of the 383 patients enrolled, 371 received at least 1 dose of study drug and were evaluated for safety; 12 patients withdrew before taking any study drug.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of a 1- to 3-week screening period, a 1-week baseline period (followed by randomization), and a 6-week double-blind treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>At the baseline visit, patients who continued to meet eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 150 mg of armodafinil or matching placebo treatment only on nights worked for 6 weeks. Study drug was taken once nightly, 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of the night shift, on nights worked. Armodafinil treatment was titrated as follows (only on nights worked): the first dose was 50 mg (1 tablet), the second and third doses were 100 mg (2 tablets), and the fourth and subsequent doses were 150 mg (3 tablets). Placebo tablets matching armodafinil tablets were administered on the same schedule.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients With at Least Minimal Improvement From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Rating as Related to Late Shift Sleepiness at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) is an assessment performed by the clinician, evaluating the change in the patient's symptoms over time. The clinician categorizes the change as: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse. The data presented here represents the percentage of patients whose condition showed at least minimal improvement in the CGI-C rating as related to late shift sleepiness (defined as the period 0400-0800, including the commute home).</description>

          <description>Mental-health related disability was assessed with the Modified Sheehan Disability Scale (MSDS). The MSDS has three 11-point items, and the participant is asked to rate, on a numerical scale, the extent to which emotional problems have disrupted her/his work, social life, and family life/home responsibilities over the last month. Each item is rated from 0, indicating &quot;not at all&quot;, to 10, indicating &quot;extremely&quot;. Scores for the items are summed for a possible score of 0 to 30.

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)- Effectiveness Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>TSQM is a 14 question questionnaire assessing satisfaction with the medication. 4 scales are generated: side effects, effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. Subjects responded to the questionnaire at Week 3, Week 6, and last observation after baseline. Optional responses are: Extremely Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Somewhat Satisfied, Satisfied, Very Satisfied, and Extremely Satisfied. From the responses, a scale score from 0 - 100 is calculated, with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction. Results from the Effectiveness scale are presented here.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10) General Productivity Score</title>
        <description>FOSQ-10 consists of 10 questions rated on a scale of 1-4 (1=extreme difficulty, 4=no difficulty), and is used to measure the impact of daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living and quality of life. A total score and 5 subscale (vigilance, general productivity, social outcome, intimacy, and activity level) scores are calculated from the responses. Worst subscale score is 1 (maximum difficulty) and the best score is 4 (no difficulty). This score represents the CHANGE from Baseline in the General Productivity subscale. Positive change scores represent improvement (possible range -3 to +3).</description>
