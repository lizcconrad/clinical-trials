    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study of TAK-700 in combination with docetaxel
      and prednisone that will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination and
      will allow estimation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in men with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
