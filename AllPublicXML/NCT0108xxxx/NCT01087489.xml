  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient comfort during and after eye injections will be compared after two numbing
      (anesthetic) protocols, an eye preparation utilizing three cotton swabs soaked in 4%
      lidocaine drops versus a preparation using 3.5% lidocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic gel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this investigation is to determine the relative comfort of an
      intravitreal injection (same day and the next day) after a preparation utilizing three cotton
      swabs soaked in 4% lidocaine versus a preparation using 3.5% lidocaine hydrochloride
      ophthalmic gel. Based on the available data, the researchers contend that a preparation based
      on viscous 3.5% ophthalmic lidocaine gel, which coats the surface and remains in contact with
      the eye longer, may provide greater anesthesia and result in greater patient comfort than the
      topical 4% lidocaine, which is part of the standard preparation routinely utilized in the
      ophthalmology department currently. Secondary outcome measure is the intraocular pressure
      rise after the injection, and the authors will generate prospective data to study whether
      softening the eye with cotton swabs prior to the injection lowers post-injection pressure
      spike.

    <description>The eye will be topically anesthetized with 0.5% proparacaine drops and 4% lidocaine drops and a 10% povidone-iodine scrub of the lids and lashes will be performed. A sterile speculum will be placed between the lids. Five percent povidone-iodine drops will then be applied over the ocular surface followed in three rounds by additional 5% povidone iodine and a sterile cotton swab soaked in sterile 4% lidocaine applied with gentle pressure to the area designated for injection in the infero-temporal quadrant.</description>

    <description>The eye will be topically anesthetized with 0.5% proparacaine drops and 5% povidone iodine will be placed over the eye. Two drops of preservative-free 3.5% lidocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic gel will be placed into inferior conjunctival sac. The patient will be asked to close the eye for 7 minutes. Next, a 10% povidone-iodine scrub of the lids and lashes will be performed. A sterile speculum will be placed between the lids. Five percent povidone-iodine drops will then be applied over the ocular surface and allowed to remain in contact with the eye for at least 2 minutes. The eye will then be rinsed with antibiotic drops.</description>
