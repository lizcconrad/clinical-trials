    <measure>Physician's global assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>T0, 3 weeks, and 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of hyperpigmentation was assessed by an independent blinded dermatologist. The results were scored on a scale from zero to six (0: total clearance (100% improvement), 1: almost total clearance (90-99% improvement), 2: distinct clearance (75-89% improvement) 3: moderate clearance (50-74% improvement) 4: mild clearance (25-49% improvement) 5: no change, 6: worsening of hyperpigmentation).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>L-value</measure>
    <time_frame>T0, 3 weeks and 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of hyperpigmentation was assessed by color measurement through reflectance spectroscopy (Microflash 200 d, Datacolor International, Lawrenceville, GA). This instrument, with an aperture of 4 mm, determines color by measuring the intensity of reflected light of particular wavelengths. In this study, the obtained L value, indicating the lightness of the measured area of skin, was used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Melanin index</measure>
    <time_frame>T0, 3 weeks and 3, and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Melanin index was measured using a spectrometer (Derma-Spectrometer, Cortex Technology ApS, Hadsund, Denmark) in order to assess changes in the amount of dermal and epidermal melanin.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's global assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks, 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to score the improvement of hyperpigmentation on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (Patient's Global Assessment, PGA) at all follow-up moments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks, 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>

    <description>In each patient, one side of the face was treated with non-ablative fractional laser in four-five sessions.
Note: this study had a split-face design. In each patient, each side of the face was randomized to receive either non-ablative fractional laser therapy or triple topical therapy.</description>

Note: this study had a split-face design. In each patient, each side of the face was randomized to receive either non-ablative fractional laser therapy or triple topical therapy.</description>
