  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, cross-over, open label study will compare the tolerability and handling of
      application of peginterferon alfa-2a [Pegasys] by autoinjector versus pre-filled syringe in
      patients with chronic hepatitis C, either on treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a for at
      least 12 weeks or treatment-naïve for peginterferon alfa-2a. Patients will be randomized to
      self-injection of 180mcg peginterferon alfa-2a once a week using either an autoinjector or a
      prefilled syringe for 3 weeks, then switch to use the other method of injection for another 3
      weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 6 weeks. Target sample size is &lt;100 patients.

    <description>The feasibility of PEG-INF administration by AI was assessed by Injection Method Observational Survey questions, based on following pre-defined questions using a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; response: 1) Did the participant exhibit any nervousness prior to the injection? 2) Did the participant exhibit any difficulty initiating the injection? 3) Did the participant appear confident performing the injection? 4) Did the participant follow the instructions for performing the injection without the need for additional instructions or guidance? 5) Did the participant experience any technical problems with the device or syringe during the injection? 6) Did the participant withdraw the device/syringe before the injection was complete? 7) Did the participant exhibit any visible pain or physical discomfort? 8) Did the participant appear to be satisfied using the device or syringe? 9) Did the participant exhibit any frustration using the syringe or device?</description>

        <title>Feasibility of Peginterferon Alfa-2a Administration by Autoinjector</title>
        <description>The feasibility of PEG-INF administration by AI was assessed by Injection Method Observational Survey questions, based on following pre-defined questions using a “Yes” or “No” response: 1) Did the participant exhibit any nervousness prior to the injection? 2) Did the participant exhibit any difficulty initiating the injection? 3) Did the participant appear confident performing the injection? 4) Did the participant follow the instructions for performing the injection without the need for additional instructions or guidance? 5) Did the participant experience any technical problems with the device or syringe during the injection? 6) Did the participant withdraw the device/syringe before the injection was complete? 7) Did the participant exhibit any visible pain or physical discomfort? 8) Did the participant appear to be satisfied using the device or syringe? 9) Did the participant exhibit any frustration using the syringe or device?</description>

        <description>A marked abnormality was defined as a test result which was outside of the marked abnormality range, and which represented a clinically relevant change from baseline of at least the designated amount.

The clinical relevant change (decrease/ increase) for hemoglobin was (15%, 15%), albumin was (20%, n.d) and total protein was (20%, 20%) respectively.</description>
