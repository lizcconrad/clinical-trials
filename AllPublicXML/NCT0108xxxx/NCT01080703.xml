    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a lower extremity strengthening program as part
      of pulmonary rehabilitation will improve quadriceps muscle strength, endurance and functional
      status as well as overall quality of life.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Lower extremity resistance training as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program will
           improve quadriceps strength, endurance and functional capacity.

        2. Lower extremity resistance training as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program will
           improve quality of life in patients awaiting lung transplant.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine if a lower extremity strengthening program as part of pulmonary
           rehabilitation is effective at increasing quadriceps strength when measured with a hand
           held dynamometer.

        2. To determine the effectiveness of a lower extremity strengthening program as part of
           pulmonary rehabilitation for improving endurance and functional capacity as measured by
           the six minute walk test.

        3. To determine if the lower extremity strengthening program as part of pulmonary
           rehabilitation improves overall quality of life as measured by the St. George's
           Respiratory Questionnaire.

        4. To provide a basic framework for a larger randomized control study evaluating if a lower
           extremity strengthening program as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program is more
           effective than a pulmonary rehabilitation program alone at improving quadriceps
           strength, endurance, and functional level.

    <description>Quadriceps Strength will be assessed at initial evaluation and subsequently every two weeks for 10 weeks. Testing will be done at 30, 60 and 90 degrees of knee flexion using hand held dynamometer. The six miute walk test is also used as a primary outcomes to assess endurance. It will be done at initial evaluation, 5 weeks and 10 weeks.</description>
