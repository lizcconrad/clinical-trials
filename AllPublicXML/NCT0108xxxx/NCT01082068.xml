  <brief_title>Study of XL147 (SAR245408) or XL765 (SAR245409) in Combination With Letrozole in Subjects With Breast Cancer</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL147 when given in
      combination with letrozole (Femara) and of XL765 when given in combination with letrozole.
      After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled to
      evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in subjects with breast
      cancer refractory to a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor that is ER+/PGR+ and HER2-.
      Letrozole is used in the treatment of different types of breast cancer, but patients can
      develop resistance.

      Upregulation of PI3K activity is one of the most common characteristics of human cancer
      cells, including breast tumor cells. Activation of PI3K results in stimulation of AKT and
      mTOR kinases, resulting in the promotion of tumor cell proliferation and survival.
      Preclinical and retrospective clinical data suggest that aberrant activation of the PI3K
      pathway may play a role in aromatase inhibitor resistance in patients with ER+, HER2- breast
      cancer. XL147 is a potent inhibitor of PI3K, and XL765 is a potent dual inhibitor of PI3K and
      mTOR; therefore either of these compounds in combination with letrozole warrants clinical
      investigation.
