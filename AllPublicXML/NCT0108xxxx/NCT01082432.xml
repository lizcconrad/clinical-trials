      Background

      One of the potentially debilitative complications of operative repair and subsequent
      immobilization is stiffness that appears secondary to inflammation and adhesions. To prevent
      such a physical impairment, active joint mobilization has shown to be efficient. However,
      adhesions sometimes remain despite the therapy. Due to the viscoelastic nature of the
      biological tissues, if a technique can enable to extend the muscle ability to impose a
      maximal steady stress on adhesions, adhesion deformation should be greater and range of
      motion deficit should be reduced. Within that context, the purpose of the present study was
      to assess the real-time effects of superimposed electrical stimulation (SES) on maximal
      voluntary muscular contraction (VOL) over time and to assess SES effects on range of motion
      recovery in thumb stiff joint.

      Methods and Findings

      The aim of the first experiment was to examine the real-time effects of tetanic SES on the
      maximal volitional level of force over repeated contractions of the triceps brachii muscle.
      To address this goal, seventeen subjects participated voluntarily in this study. Two features
      of the muscular force were assessed: The peak force (1) and the impulse (2). These two
      dependent variables were measured during 500 sec - including 50 maximal force productions of
      4 sec each- in two randomized conditions of VOL and SES. When considering the 50 trials as a
      whole, exerted force was higher in the SES than in the VOL condition for both peak force and
      impulse (P&lt;.05). Over time, peak force and impulse decreased consistently in VOL starting
      between the 20th and 30th trials whereas they were maintained in SES condition (P&lt;.05).

      The aim of the second experiment was to compare the effects of VOL and SES on the range of
      flexion recovery of the stiff metacarpophalangeal joint following operative repair of the
      ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb. To address this goal, eight patients participated
      voluntarily. Range of motion, oedema and pain were assessed before and after the two
      randomised conditions of VOL and SES.
