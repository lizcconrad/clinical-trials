      This study was terminated on 18 November 2010 following a US FDA clinical hold for the
      tanezumab diabetic peripheral neuropathy clinical study which halted dosing and enrollment of
      patients on 19 July 2010 for potential safety issues.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (high blood sugar) with HbA1c levels of ≤11% at

             randomization.

          -  Diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy pain in the legs or feet with decreased
             sensation in the feet or decreased/absent ankle jerk/ reflexes.

          -  Presence of ongoing pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy for at least 3 months.

          -  A pain score of greater than or equal to (≥) 4 for from diabetic peripheral neuropathy
             on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), a 11-point scale with 0 meaning no pain and 10
             meaning worst pain at Screening.

          -  Be willing to stop all pain medications for diabetic peripheral neuropathy except for
             the limited use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen-like (Motrin) medications
             between Screening and Baseline and not use prohibited pain medications throughout the
             duration of the study except as permitted by the study guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Painful neuropathies other than diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Other types of diabetic neuropathies.

          -  Patients with a past history of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) with signs or symptoms of
             CTS in the one year prior to Screening are not eligible for participation.

          -  Patients with fibromyalgia, regional pain caused by lumbar or cervical compression
             with radiculopathy or other moderate to severe pain.

          -  Patients with a present (current) history of sciatica are not eligible for
             participation.

          -  The presence of pain conditions that cannot be distinguished from diabetic peripheral
             neuropathy such as peripheral vascular disease.

          -  Amputations dues to diabetes.

          -  Patient with any clinically significant medical condition or laboratory abnormalities.

          -  History, diagnosis, or signs and symptoms of clinically significant neurological
             diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, head trauma, epilepsy or stroke).

          -  History, diagnosis, or signs and symptoms of clinically significant psychiatric
             diseases (such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia).
