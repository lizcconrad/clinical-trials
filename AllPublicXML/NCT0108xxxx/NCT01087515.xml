  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of Isolated
      Plasmacytoide Dendritic Cells (pDCs) and Regulatory T-cells (TREGs) isolated with clinical
      grade magnetic bead isolations techniques (MACS®) on the antigen presenting cell-induced
      proliferation of lymphocytes after allergen uptake in an in vitro cell culture system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      pDCs as well as TREGs will be co-incubated with generated allergen presenting cells,
      lymphocytes, and allergen. For in vitro experimentation immune cells will be collected from
      blood of grass mix or house dust mite sensitized atopic/asthmatic patients.

    <description>In experimental part 1 to generate preclinical data 250 ml of blood will be donated at day 1 by 10 subjects to induce allergen presenting cells (APCs).
In experimental part 2 to transfer the isolation of pDC or TREGs to a GMP (good manufacturing Practice) compliant clinical grade isolation system, leukapheresis will be performed with the blood from 5 subjects.
In experimental part 3 for potency testing of the clinical grade isolation system of pDC or TREGs, 250 ml of blood will be collected at day 1 from 3 subjects.</description>
