  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, randomized, open-label, international, multicenter trial is designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of rituximab monotherapy when given according to a dose
      intense regimen and to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ABT-263 when
      combined with dose-intense rituximab in previously untreated patients with B-cell CLL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prolymphocytic leukemia

          -  Richter's transformation to an aggressive B-cell malignancy (e.g., DLBCL)

          -  Prior radiotherapy to a lesion(s) that will be used to assess response unless that
             lesion(s) shows clear evidence of progression at baseline

          -  Major surgical procedure (excluding lymph node biopsy) or significant traumatic injury
             within 28 days prior to treatment onset or anticipation of the need for major surgery
             during the course of the study

          -  Active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics or antiviral or antifungal agents at

             (including low-dose aspirin) within 7 days of the first dose of ABT-263. Note:
             Patients receiving low-dose anticoagulation for the purpose of maintaining central
             venous catheter patency are eligible.

          -  Patients who have an inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis, including (but not
             limited to) hemophilia or immune or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or who have
             had an underlying condition that predisposes to abnormal bleeding (e.g., peptic ulcer
             disease) within 1 year prior to the first dose of ABT-263

             giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use of an
             investigational drug, might affect interpretation of the results of the study or
             render the patient at high risk from treatment complications

          -  History of anaphylaxis, allergic reaction, or hypersensitivity to sulfites (sodium
             metabisulphite is included in study drug formulation)

          -  Any contraindication to alcohol ingestion (study drug formulation includes
