  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if blood flow to the clitoris is increased by
      topically applying a cream that causes increased blood flow. This will be measured with a
      sonogram.

      On the first office visit the patient will have their baseline clitoral and uterine blood
      flow measured quantitatively by the same sonographer using the General electric Voluson 700
      unit. Clitoral blood flow will be accessed utilizing the 12 megahertz linear probe. With
      light pressure, the probe will be applied sagittally and proximal to the clitoral hood with
      an angle less than 20 degrees. Peak clitoral artery systolic and end diastolic velocity will
      be measured and resistive index values will be recorded. Then utilizing the 7.5 megahertz
      vaginal probe baseline uterine artery flow measurements will also be obtained and recorded.

      The patient will then be placed in an exam room and the same nurse practitioner will apply
      the GRAS cream or the placebo to the patients' clitoral hood with minimal manipulation. Ten
      minutes later the sonographer will repeat the two scans and record the same measurements as
      before. The patient will then come back another day to repeat the above process. Patients
      will be coded to assure that which ever cream they received the first visit they will get the
      opposite the second time. The creams will be blinded to the nurse practitioner, the patient,
      the sonographer, and the principle investigator.

      GRAS cream is arginine 20%, nicotinamide .01%, niacin.1%, in LipodermPG 50%,

    <description>The study will be placebo controlled double blind study which will require two office visits after informed consent and sensitivity testing done with the study cream on the day of recruitment.
On the first office visit the patient will have their baseline clitoral and uterine blood flow measured quantitatively by the same sonographer using the General electric Voluson 700 unit Then placebo or active cream will be applied and the pt restudied. the same process is repeated another day with the second arm cream.</description>
