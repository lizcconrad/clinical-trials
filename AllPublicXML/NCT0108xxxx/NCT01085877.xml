  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to compare the absorption of
      estradiol after a single dose of two 25 mcg estradiol vaginal tablets, produced at two
      different production sites, in postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis.
