    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, non-interventional, non-randomised, open label
      multicentric study planned to be conducted in 1000 subjects with mild to moderate primary
      hypertension in approximately 20 centres in Thailand. The purpose of this study is to examine
      the beneficial effects of combination of bisoprolol with hydrochlorothiazide available as
      Lodoz in treatment of Thai subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. The outcome of the
      study would also provide information on the optimal daily dosage schedule as well as
      adherence of Lodoz.

    <textblock>
      Essential hypertension is a heterogenous multifactorial disease affecting large number of
      population. Monotherapy treatment in hypertension is often unable to achieve the desired
      blood pressure (BP) goals and subjects even remain at significant risk for developing
      cardiovascular disease. The use of combination therapy as first line treatment for
      hypertension provides a solution to the management problems related to hypertension. Among
      combination drugs, low dose combinations are useful tools in treating large segments of
      hypertensive subjects because of their several advantages, such as simplified dosage
      regimens, improve compliance and hypertensive control, decrease dose dependent side effects
      as well as reduce costs.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Lodoz therapy when used in routine clinical practice in
           subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To evaluate the discontinuation rate of Lodoz therapy.
