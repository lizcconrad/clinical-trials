    <measure>Ratio From Baseline of the Serum Cortisol Weighted Mean (0-24 Hours) on Day -1/1 (Baseline) and Day 42</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -1/1 (Baseline) and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Serum cortisol weighted mean was determined for each participant over the time period 0-12 hours on Day -1/1 (Baseline) and Day 42. Serum cortisol weighted mean was derived by dividing the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC; defined as thearea under the concentration-time curve from time zero up to 24 hours) by the sample collection time interval. The sample collection time interval is defined as the difference between the time of the last cortisol sample and the time of the first cortisol sample. Samples were collected at the following time points: 0 (first blood draw/pre-dose); 2, 4, 9, 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, and 24 hours (relative to the &quot;0&quot; time point). Because values are on a logged scale, the ratio of the endpoint to Baseline is presented, as it is a measure of the difference from Baseline.</description>

AUC reflects the actual body exposure to drug over a specified period of time after administration of a dose. Samples were collected at the following times: 0 (immediately pre-dose inhaled study drug); post-dose at 5 minutes (min), 15 min, 30 min, and 1 hour (hr), 2 hr, 4 hr, 9 hr, 12 hr, 16 hr, 20 hr, and 24 hr.

    <description>A 24-hour urine sample was collected for the measurement of 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion at Day -1/1 (Baseline) and Day 42. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed. Because values are on a logged scale, the ratio of the endpoint to Baseline is presented, as it is a measure of the difference from Baseline.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations.

      <recruitment_details>Participants who met all the inclusion criteria entered a 7- to 14-day Run-in Period (screening visit [Visit 1]). Participants were provided with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol for relief of asthma symptoms during the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>At the end of the Run-in Period, participants who meet the randomization criteria were admitted to the clinic in the evening (Visit 2) for the Baseline collection of 24-hour serial serum cortisol samples and urine. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups in a 4:4:4:1 ratio.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Ratio From Baseline of the Serum Cortisol Weighted Mean (0–24 Hours) on Day -1/1 (Baseline) and Day 42</title>
        <description>Serum cortisol weighted mean was determined for each participant over the time period 0–12 hours on Day -1/1 (Baseline) and Day 42. Serum cortisol weighted mean was derived by dividing the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC; defined as thearea under the concentration-time curve from time zero up to 24 hours) by the sample collection time interval. The sample collection time interval is defined as the difference between the time of the last cortisol sample and the time of the first cortisol sample. Samples were collected at the following time points: 0 (first blood draw/pre-dose); 2, 4, 9, 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, and 24 hours (relative to the &quot;0&quot; time point). Because values are on a logged scale, the ratio of the endpoint to Baseline is presented, as it is a measure of the difference from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Ratio From Baseline of 0-24 Hour Urinary Free Cortisol Excretion on Day -1/1 (Baseline) and Day 42</title>
        <description>A 24-hour urine sample was collected for the measurement of 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion at Day -1/1 (Baseline) and Day 42. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed. Because values are on a logged scale, the ratio of the endpoint to Baseline is presented, as it is a measure of the difference from Baseline.</description>

AUC reflects the actual body exposure to drug over a specified period of time after administration of a dose. Samples were collected at the following times: 0 (immediately pre-dose inhaled study drug); post-dose at 5 minutes (min), 15 min, 30 min, and 1 hour (hr), 2 hr, 4 hr, 9 hr, 12 hr, 16 hr, 20 hr, and 24 hr post-dose on Day 42.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations. Refer to the General Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During the Treatment Period</title>
          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations. Refer to the General Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of eosinophils, total neutrophils, platelets, and WBC count at Baseline and Day 42/EW. For all laboratory assessments, Baseline is the most recent recorded value at Screening or prior to Day -1/1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 42/EW value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of ALT, ALP, AST, CK, and GGT at Baseline and Day 42/EW. For all laboratory assessments, Baseline is the most recent recorded value at Screening or prior to Day -1/1.
