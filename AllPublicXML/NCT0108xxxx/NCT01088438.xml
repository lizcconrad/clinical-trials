      During the project, fourth-year medical students participating in a Medicine sub-internship
      will be randomized to an intervention group or a control group; the intervention group will
      receive additional training in the application of qualitative methodology to elicit and
      incorporate contextual factors in the clinical encounter. All students will participate in an
      SP assessment consisting of four standardized patients (SPs), blinded to trial arm,
      presenting cases with and without important biomedical and contextual factors in a
      counterbalanced factorial design. Performance will be compared between trial arms; the
      investigators hypothesize better performance in the intervention arm. In addition,
      performance will be compared with United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 2
      clinical knowledge scores to determine whether contextualizing ability is independent of
      clinical knowledge, and consistency of performance across individual SP cases will be studied
      to determine the number of cases necessary to achieve sufficient reliability for the
      assessment to be used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical decision making requires two distinct skills: the ability to classify patients'
      conditions into diagnostic and management categories that permit the application of &quot;best
      evidence&quot; guidelines, and the ability to individualize or - more precisely - to contextualize
      care for patients whose circumstances and needs require variation from the standard approach
      to care. Most assessment in medical education places heavy emphasis on biomedical
      decision-making with little emphasis on how to incorporate contextual factors that may be
      essential to planning patients' care.

      The goal of this project is to demonstrate and provide validity evidence for an innovative
      standardized patient (SP) method of assessing medical students in the clinical years on their
      ability to detect and respond to individual contextual factors in a patient encounter that
      overcomes the aforementioned challenges.

        <description>Probability that the learner probes contextual red flags raised in standardized patient encounters undertaken at assessment at end of subinternship. Each learner undertakes four encounters, each of which presents a contextual red flag that may or may not be probed; in a small number of cases, the standardized patient was ill and the learner undertook fewer than four encounters as a result. Assessment of probing is made by an investigator blinded to learner's assignment to group.</description>
