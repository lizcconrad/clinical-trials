      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate two FDA approved implant designs for
      the Tornier Reverse Shoulder arthroplasty. The small difference in design is the amount of
      offset each implant has. This offset may improve clinical outcomes in the patient population.
      There have been no clinical comparative studies between these two designs in the literature
      to date. We would like to follow these patients for two years after implantation of the
      reverse shoulder and evaluate their radiographs, pain scores, and shoulder functional scores.
      this would be the first randomized prospective single blinded study of its kind.

      The combination of shoulder arthritis and rotator cuff deficiency presents quite a surgical
      challenge. The reverse prosthesis offers a treatment option for subset of patients as
      previous attempts to treat with soft tissue reconstruction or conventional arthroplasty have
      provided sub-optimal clinical results. Numerous reports in the literature have validated the
      effectiveness of the reverse design.

      Patients meeting criteria must be between the ages of 50 and 95 years of age and are a
      candidate for a reverse shoulder arthroplasty. This is includes patients with rotator cuff
      tear arthroplasty, irreparable rotator cuff tears, significant proximal humerus fractures and
      malunions, and chronic proximal humerus dislocators. A total of 40 patients will be enrolled
      and randomized to either one of two groups; 20 patients will be randomized to the Tornier
      Reversed shoulder Arthroplasty Medial offset, and 20 will receive the Lateral offset design.
      Both implants are FDA approved. The patients will be followed for 24 months and will
      follow-up will be at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months questionnaires will
      be completed at each visit, x-rays will be done at pre-op, 3 month, 6 months 12 and 24
      months.
