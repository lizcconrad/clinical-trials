  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this research project is to conduct a 5-year prospective randomized trial
      of a theory-based intervention to increase patient completion of colorectal cancer screening
      (CRCS) among patients ages 50 to 64 years old.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Identify behavioral, social, and environmental factors associated with CRCS
      in male and female patients ages 50 to 64 years old in a primary care practice in Houston,
      Texas.

      1.1. Update literature reviews of CRCS adherence. 1.2. Conduct secondary analysis of relevant
      data from other projects. 1.3. Conduct focus groups with primary care patients to determine
      their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about CRCS and to gather data to use for development
      of the educational intervention.

      Specific Aim 2: Develop a personal computer (PC)-based tailored interactive intervention
      based on the transtheoretical (stages of change) model to increase CRCS in accordance with
      American Cancer Society (ACS) CRCS guidelines.

      Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the PC-based tailored interactive intervention
      for increasing CRCS through a randomized controlled trial.

      Specific Aim 4: Analyze the relationship between a number of predictor variables and CRCS
      completion in order to develop a more complete conceptual framework for understanding
      screening adherence.

      Specific Aim 5: Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the PC-based tailored interactive
      intervention for increasing CRCS in a primary care setting.
