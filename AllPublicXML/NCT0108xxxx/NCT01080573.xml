      This 1-arm, open-label, multicentric, observational study aims to collect subject centric
      information in line with routine care. Subjects' expectations of therapy, side effect
      management and lifestyle may influence adherence to therapy. This survey aims to determine
      whether such factors and/or others affect the successful initiation and maintenance of Rebif
      therapy.

      The data collected during this study will include information on the subject's treatment
      including expectations, experience, training and support. The results of the study will be
      used to understand the impact on subjects' compliance and tailor training and support
      services to subject's need. It will also be made available to other healthcare organisations
      involved in the subjects treatment.

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system and is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young
      adults. It is characterised by multifocal, recurrent attacks of neurological symptoms and
      signs with variable recovery. Eventually the majority of subjects develop a progressive
      clinical course. It is important to carefully initiate and maintain subjects with MS on
      therapy. Information will be gathered in a structured way which will enable easier
      identification of any subgroups of subjects who may be at risk of poor compliance. These risk
      groups could possibly include groups with particular attributes such as poor information at
      the start of treatment, unrealistic expectations or a particular life style. This study will
      be conducted during the contact with the subject necessary to deliver the homecare service.
      Participants will be contacted by Bupa Home Healthcare Multiple Sclerosis subject
      coordinators by telephone to conduct specific questionnaires during the 4 stages of the
      subject's treatment i.e. pre-installation of treatment, post installation of treatment,
      monthly pre delivery of drug and at a subject's end treatment.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To collect subject centric information in line with routine care including subject's
           expectations of therapy, side effect management and lifestyle may influence adherence to
           therapy

        -  To determine whether such factors and/or others affect the successful initiation and
           maintenance of Rebif therapy
