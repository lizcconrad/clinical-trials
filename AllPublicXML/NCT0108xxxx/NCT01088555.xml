    <textblock>
      Sodium thiosulfate may be useful to prevent recurrence of calcium-containing kidney stones.
      It will be studied in people with high amounts of urine calcium.

      The investigators study is designed as a pilot study to study the effect of STS on urine
      chemistries in stone formers and normal controls. It is expected to continue for a duration
      of 1 year and will have two groups: 20 normal controls, who are healthy subjects without
      known kidney disease or nephrolithiasis, and 20 subjects with documented recurrent
      nephrolithiasis and hypercalciuria. Patients will be recruited from Dr Goldfgarb's stone
      clinic at VA Hospital and controls would be voluntary participants from NYU School of
      Medicine. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing, taking alcohol or drugs, have known CKD or
      are unable to give consent would be excluded from the study. Any diuretics or citrate
      containing drugs would be held for a period of 2 weeks during the study period to achieve
      washout of the effects of those drugs on urine chemistries. Oral STS 10mmol (10ml of 25% STS)
      BID will be administered to both groups for 7 days; four 24 hour urine collections, 2 prior
      and 2 at the end of the study, would be done with all participants. A diet diary would be
      maintained by subjects concomitantly during the study periods. The investigators then plan to
      compare the two groups in terms of urine chemistries to detect any changes in these
      parameters with thiosulfate administration. Based on prior animal experiments and human
      studies with STS the investigators anticipate that it would have a favorable effect on the
      supersaturation of Ca oxalate/phosphate and therefore its long term use would be helpful in
      preventing nephrolithiasis.
