      The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the optimal imaging parameters and assess
      the safety of LMI1195 -101 in Heart Failure subjects at Low and High Risk of cardiac events.

    <textblock>
      -  To determine the optimal imaging protocol for a single dose of LMI1195 during positron
           emission tomography (PET) for the intended study population.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of LMI1195 in patients at low risk of ventricular
           arrhythmia (&quot;low risk patients&quot;) and heart failure patients with a history of firing of
           an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) within 6 months prior to enrollment, a
           documented ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35%, and a prior diagnosis of NYHA Class II-III
           heart failure (&quot;heart failure patients&quot;) who are undergoing PET imaging.
