  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low vitamin D levels were found to be associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
      Low zinc levels are associated with an increased atherosclerotic burden. Therefore we
      hypothesized that patients with pathological stress test would have low levels of Vitamin D
      and zinc compared to patients with a normal stress test.

      Hypovitaminosis D is generally defined as 25(OH)D levels of &lt; 20ng/ml, while levels of
      21-29ng/ml indicate insufficiency and those above 30ng/ml are regarded as sufficient.

      The rational behind the observations associating vitamin D deficiency with CVD is that on the
      one hand, hypovitaminosis D was found to be associated with traditional risk factors such as
      hypertension (HTN),diabetes mellitus (dm),obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome , on
      the other hand, experimental data demonstrated that vitamin D could affect cardiac muscle
      cells directly, control parathyroid (PTH) hormone secretion, regulate the rennin-
      angiotensin- aldosterone system and the immune system, all of which could influence
      cardiovascular risk.

      Epidemiological studies further support this association, demonstrating high prevalence of
      hypovitaminosis D among U.S. adults with cardiovascular disease (74%). An association between
      low vitamin D levels and increased myocardial infarction risk as well as total mortality has
      been also observed.

      Low 25hydroxyvitamin D[ 25(OH)D] levels were also independently associated with all cause and
      CVD mortality among patients scheduled for coronary catheterization.
