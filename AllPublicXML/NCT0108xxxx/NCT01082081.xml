    <textblock>
      GlaxoSmithKline will be conducting this trial to compare analgesics efficacy of paracetamol
      1000mg vs 500mg . The post-surgical dental pain model will be used to evaluate the analgesic
      efficacy of paracetamol. Each subject will be enrolled in the study for up to six weeks. The
      duration of the entire study will be approximately 16 weeks. Each subject will have to come
      to the clinic for three visits (Screening, Treatment and Follow up visits).

    <measure>Sum of Pain Relief and Pain Intensity Differences From 0 to 6 Hours (SPRID 6 Hours)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every two hours from baseline to 6 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID:Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) and Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) at each post-dosing time-point. SPRID score ranged from -5.8 (least pain relief) to 40.3 (highest pain relief). SPID and TOTPAR were calculated as weighted sums of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) and Pain Relief Scores (PRS) at each measurement time, respectively. PID was derived by subtracting the pain severity score at a given post-dosing time-point from the baseline [pain severity score range:0-no pain, 1-mild pain, 2-moderate pain, 3-severe pain using a 4-point categorical Verbal Rating Scale (VRS)]. If the subject rated pain intensity as 2 or 3, pain was assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [0 (no pain), 100 (worst pain)]. VAS scores were converted into PID scores by subtracting them from baseline pain scores. PRS was assessed on 5-point categorical pain relief rating scale [0-no relief, 1-little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, 4-complete relief]</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Relief and Pain Intensity Differences From 0 to 6 Hours (SPRID 6 Hours)</title>
        <description>SPRID:Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) and Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) at each post-dosing time-point. SPRID score ranged from -5.8 (least pain relief) to 40.3 (highest pain relief). SPID and TOTPAR were calculated as weighted sums of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) and Pain Relief Scores (PRS) at each measurement time, respectively. PID was derived by subtracting the pain severity score at a given post-dosing time-point from the baseline [pain severity score range:0-no pain, 1-mild pain, 2-moderate pain, 3-severe pain using a 4-point categorical Verbal Rating Scale (VRS)]. If the subject rated pain intensity as 2 or 3, pain was assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [0 (no pain), 100 (worst pain)]. VAS scores were converted into PID scores by subtracting them from baseline pain scores. PRS was assessed on 5-point categorical pain relief rating scale [0-no relief, 1-little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, 4-complete relief]</description>

SPRID score ranged from -1.8 (least pain relief) to 12.3 (highest pain relief). SPID and TOTPAR were calculated as weighted sums of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) and Pain Relief Scores (PRS) at each measurement time, respectively. PID was derived by subtracting the pain severity score at a given post-dosing time-point from the baseline [pain severity score range:0-no pain, 1-mild pain, 2-moderate pain, 3-severe pain using a 4-point categorical Verbal Rating Scale (VRS)]. If the subject rated pain intensity as 2 or 3, pain was assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [0 (no pain), 100 (worst pain)]. VAS scores were converted into PID scores by subtracting them from baseline pain scores. PRS was assessed on 5-point categorical pain relief rating scale [0-no relief, 1-little relief, 2-some relief, 3-a lot of relief, 4-complete relief]</description>

        <title>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) at 2 Hours</title>
        <description>TOTPAR was calculated as sum of products of pain relief (PR) at a given time-point (t) with the time-interval from that time-point to the previous time-point (t-1). The time-intervals used were 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, 60-90, 90-120. Higher score indicated greater pain relief.
TOTPARt = ∑PR x (timet – timet-1).
PR score was assessed at each of the above time-points based on a 5-point categorical scale [0-no relief, 1-little relief, 2-meaningful relief, 3-a lot of relief, 4-complete relief].</description>

          <description>TOTPAR was calculated as sum of products of pain relief (PR) at a given time-point (t) with the time-interval from that time-point to the previous time-point (t-1). The time-intervals used were 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, 60-90, 90-120. Higher score indicated greater pain relief.
TOTPARt = ∑PR x (timet – timet-1).
PR score was assessed at each of the above time-points based on a 5-point categorical scale [0-no relief, 1-little relief, 2-meaningful relief, 3-a lot of relief, 4-complete relief].</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Scores at 2 Hours</title>
        <description>SPID was calculated as sum of products of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) at a given time-point (t) with the time-interval from that time-point to the previous time-point (t-1). The time-intervals used were 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, 60-90, 90-120. Positive and higher scores indicate greater reduction in pain.
SPIDt = ∑PID x (timet - timet-1)
Pain Intensity was assessed at baseline and at each time-point based on a 4-point categorical Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) scale: 0-no pain, 1-mild pain, 2-moderate pain, 3-severe pain.
If the subject rated pain intensity as &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;, pain was assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [0 (no pain), 100 (worst pain)]. VAS scores were converted into PID scores by subtracting them from pain scores taken at baseline.</description>

The time-intervals used were 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, 60-90, 90-120, 120-240, 240-300 and 300-360. Positive and higher scores indicate greater reduction in pain.
SPIDt = ∑PID x (timet - timet-1)
Pain Intensity was assessed at baseline and at each time-point based on a 4-point categorical Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) scale: 0-no pain, 1-mild pain, 2-moderate pain, 3-severe pain.
If the subject rated pain intensity as &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;, pain was assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [0 (no pain), 100 (worst pain)]. VAS scores were converted into PID scores by subtracting them from pain scores taken at baseline.</description>

          <title>SPID Scores at 6 Hours</title>
          <description>SPID was calculated as sum of products of Pain Intensity Differences (PID) at a given time-point (t) with the time-interval from that time-point to the previous time-point (t-1). The time-intervals used were 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, 60-90, 90-120, 120-240, 240-300 and 300-360. Positive and higher scores indicate greater reduction in pain.
