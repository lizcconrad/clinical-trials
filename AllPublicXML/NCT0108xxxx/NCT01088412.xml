    <textblock>
      GeNeSIS is an open-label, multinational, multicenter, observational study to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of Humatrope treatment.

      GeNeSIS is a modular program that includes:

        -  Core study: Evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Humatrope in the observational
           setting

        -  Genetic Analysis Sub-study: Investigating the genetic defects underlying growth hormone
           (GH) deficiency and non-GH-deficient growth disorders

        -  Growth Prediction Sub-study: Working to validate and refine specific models to
           accurately predict growth response to GH

        -  SHOX Deficiency Sub-study: Elucidating the clinical, endocrine and radiological features
           of patients with SHOX deficiency due to loss of, or mutation in the SHOX gene (including
           patients with Turner syndrome)

        -  Neoplasia Sub-study: To characterize the natural history of neoplastic disease,
           especially in relation to recurrence/progression of primary neoplasia or development of
           secondary neoplasia in children with a history of neoplasia

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients participating in GeNeSIS must be enrolled in the core study. Patients for whom
        written consent to release information is provided may enter the core study if they meet
        any of the following inclusion guidelines:

          -  Treatment with Humatrope for improvement of growth.

          -  No treatment with somatropin in patients with a history of neoplasia or in those with
             any SHOX-related disorder.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with closed epiphyses are not eligible for GeNeSIS entry. However, patients
             may remain in the study if epiphyseal closure occurs during study participation.
