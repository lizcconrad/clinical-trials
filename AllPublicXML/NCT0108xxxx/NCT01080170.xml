        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ambulatory women (aged 60-75), with a new diagnosis of nonmetastatic, hormone-receptor
             positive breast cancer, having undergone lumpectomy. They will not need chemotherapy
             and will have been prescribed but not yet started anastrazole. All will need a course
             of radiation therapy as part of usual care. Participants are instructed not to change
             their physical activity or eating habits over the period of the study.

        Comparisons are:

          -  Identical to the cases except they are hormone-receptor negative and don't need
             hormonal therapy.

          -  Healthy controls.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nicotine usage

          -  Metastatic breast cancer

          -  Need for chemotherapy

          -  AI other than anastrazole

          -  Usage of steroids (equivalent of equal then or more than 7.5 mg prednisone x 3 months)

          -  Clinically significant abnormality of thyroid function

          -  Treatment with gonadal hormone replacement therapy within last 3 years

          -  Status post unilateral/bilateral surgical oophorectomy

          -  Having experienced a medical event, which may confound study outcomes [e.g. heart
             attack, stroke, cancer (metastatic or newly diagnosed within last 5 years, except for
             non-melanoma skin cancer and breast), lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic
             inflammatory disease]

          -  Medication-dependent diabetes mellitus or hypercholesterolemia.

          -  Gastric surgery

          -  Weight loss medication (prescription or over the counter)
