  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best way to treat MBO in patients with ovarian cancer has not been studied enough by
      trials that assess how more than one treatment arm (surgical, chemotherapeutic, supportive
      care approaches) affects clinical outcomes like resolution of bowel obstruction, survival,
      and quality of life. To improve patient outcomes, we must assess which patients will do
      better with palliative surgery, chemotherapy, or best supportive care. This study will gather
      safety information, and how reasonable it is to give chemotherapy and BSC to patients with
      advanced ovarian cancer and MBO who are non-surgical candidates. This study will also look
      into the effects of chemotherapy and BSC on the quality of life and resolution of bowel
      obstruction, in hopes to perform future studies that lead to the best management of MBO.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal management of MBO in patients with ovarian cancer has not been defined by proper
      prospective randomized control trials evaluating the impact of defined multidisciplinary
      treatment arms (surgical, chemotherapeutic, supportive care approaches) on important clinical
      outcomes including resolution of bowel obstruction, survival endpoints and validated quality
      of life outcomes. In order to improve patient outcomes, we must define which patients will
      benefit from palliative surgery, which patients are appropriate candidates for chemotherapy
      and which patients will benefit most from best supportive care. This study will determine the
      safety, feasibility of chemotherapy and BSC in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
      presenting with MBO who are initially deemed non-surgical candidates and will identify the
      impact of chemotherapy and BSC on quality of life and resolution of bowel obstruction, in
      preparation for future prospective randomized studies to determine the optimal management of
      MBO.
