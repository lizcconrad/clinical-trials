  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that lowering average blood glucose decreases the risk of diabetic
      complications involving the small vessels, such as those found in the eyes, nerves and
      kidney. It is less clear however, if controlling fluctuations in blood glucose will further
      help to prevent such complications.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between extreme fluctuations in
      glucose and damage to the blood vessel lining.

      Studies have shown that glycemic variability is associated with oxidative stress which in
      turn has been correlated with endothelial damage. Further, endothelial damage has been
      identified as a critical event lending way to the vascular complications seen in many disease
      states.

      The specific aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between short-term glycemic
      variability and biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction while analyzing the influence of
      different variables and adjusting for covariates.

      Data obtained from a continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS), a device that continuously
      records interstitial glucose for a 72 hour period, is used to calculate glycemic variability.
      Serology for the determination of endothelial dysfunction biomarkers is obtained on day
      three.

      Pearson and Spearman Rank Order correlations are utilized to determine whether there are any
      significant correlations between measures of glycemic variability and biomarker levels of
      endothelial dysfunction. Multiple regression analysis would also determine if glycemic
      variability predicts elevated biomarker levels even after controlling for other variables.

      Provided the high prevalence of diabetic complications and their staggering socioeconomic
      costs, it is important to elucidate the relationship between glycemic variability and
      endothelial dysfunction.
