    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to learn more about the cause of back pain with or
      without pain shooting down one or both legs. The investigators specifically want to know if
      cells that move into injured areas of the body are present in a space in the spine (epidural
      space) of patients with back pain and with or without shooting pain. The investigators will
      collect cells when patients are being treated, then examine the cells using a microscope. The
      investigators also will shine different colors of light into the epidural space to see if
      there is a correlation between how different colors of light are reflected and the types of
      cells present.

      The objective of this study is to examine the cell population in the epidural space of
      patients with low back pain +/- radiculopathy to determine if the cell population reveals
      pathological processes sustaining the pain. Cells will be collected for microscopic
      inspection and will be examined in situ during exposure to white and UV light. The overall
      goal is to advance our knowledge about the etiology of low back pain +/- radiculopathy to
      guide mechanistic based therapy.

      The primary information sought is to determine if description of pathological processes based
      upon direct observation with percutaneously placed epiduroscopes can be confirmed by
      cytological analysis. the observations described include: 1) increased fibrosis from slight
      to complete replacement of other tissue, or obliteration of the epidural space; 2) alteration
      of color and/or appearance of epidural fat; 3) increased or decreased vascularity. The
      overall description range from acute inflammatory changes to advanced fibrosis (scarring).

      Specimens for cytological analysis will be obtained from different sites in the epidural
      space by using commercially available cytology specimen collecting brushes and/or catheters.
      These are inserted through the working channel of an epiduroscope into the lumbar epidural
      space to aid treatment.
