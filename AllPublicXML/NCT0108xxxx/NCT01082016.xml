  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep deprivation in healthy volunteers is associated with immune dysfunction. This adverse
      effect of sleep deprivation likely occurs in patients suffering from acute injury and
      critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Studies have demonstrated
      that sleep in ICU patients is highly abnormal. The global hypothesis for this proposal is
      that a strategy to promote sleep in ICU patients will increase time in rapid eye movement
      (REM) and slow wave sleep (SWS). This three phase proposal examines the feasibility of a
      sleep promotion strategy for injured and critically ill patients in the ICU.

      Phase I (Development and Training): Develop an intervention manual for sleep promotion, Sleep
      Enhancement Program (SEP), and train ICU staff.

      Phase II (Validation and Safety): Implement SEP and test for protocol fidelity and safety.

      Phase III (Efficacy): Conduct a pilot trail to determine efficacy of SEP to improve SWS in
      ICU patients.
