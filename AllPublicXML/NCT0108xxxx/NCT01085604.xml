      The purpose of this study is to determine if trunk neuromuscular control strategies are
      changed by therapeutic exercises emphasizing core stabilization.

      Hypothesis: subjects with low back pain who demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in
      function and pain will have significantly improved trunk motor control strategies.

      Hypothesis: measures of trunk control will demonstrate 'construct-validity'. This will be
      tested using a known group method demonstrating:

        -  no significant change in motor control measures within the untreated, healthy control
           group.

        -  significant changes within the low back subjects who demonstrate clinically meaningful
           improvements.

      A growing body of evidence suggests that poor neuromuscular control of the lumbopelvic region
      is an important finding in a large number of patients with recurrent and chronic low back
      pain and may play a role in recurrence of symptoms. Despite findings of altered trunk motor
      control in individuals with low back pain, the neuromuscular strategies underlying these
      alterations have not been satisfactorily characterized. The aims of this study are to(1)
      identify which neural control strategies are altered following a rehabilitation program that
      emphasizes trunk control and stability using a motor learning approach and (2) provide
      preliminary evidence of a link between hypothesized mechanism and effectiveness for programs
      designed to improve trunk control.

    <description>The 8-week core stabilization program emphasizes use of specific local stabilizing muscles (transverse abdominis[TrA], lumbar multifidus[LM]) to restore active control and stability to the trunk. This program emphasizes training using isometric co-contractions and a progression (3 stages) based upon a motor learning paradigm.
Stage 1: emphasizes neutral position of the spine and activation of the TrA and LM. Performance feedback is emphasized and monitored through observation and palpation.
Stage 2: promotes maintenance the co-contraction while performing movements of the trunk and superimposing movements of the upper and lower extremities. Trunk conditioning is also emphasized (i.e., curl ups, quadruped leg/arm lifts and side support). Feedback is gradually reduced.
Stage 3: emphasis on maintenance of the co-contraction while performing exercises on an unstable surface or during perturbation of the activity. Random practice patterns are used to enhance motor learning.</description>

        Inclusion criteria for healthy controls:

        No history of low back is defined as:

          1. no pain limiting performance of daily activities for greater than 3 days,

          2. no pain for which they sought medical or allied health intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria for individuals with a history of low back pain:

          1. duration of the current episode of low back pain less than 3 months,

          2. average pain intensity over past 2 weeks at least 3 on an 11 point (0 = no pain, 10 =
             worst pain ever) numeric pain rating scale,

          3. no medical intervention for low back pain in last 6 months,

          4. Oswestry disability score greater than 20%

          5. a physical therapy diagnosis of clinical lumbar instability based upon specific
             examination findings.

        Exclusion Criteria for both groups:

          1. permanent structural spinal deformity (e.g., scoliosis)

          2. history of spinal fracture or diagnosis of osteoporosis

          3. diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease

          4. signs of systemic illness or suspected non-mechanical LBP (i.e. spinal tumor or
             infection)

          5. previous spinal surgery

          6. frank neurological loss, i.e., weakness and sensory loss

          7. history of neurologic disease that required hospitalization,

          8. active treatment of another medical illness that would preclude participation in any
             aspect of the study or any lower extremity injury that would potentially alter trunk
             movement in standing

          9. leg length discrepancy of greater than 2.5 cm.
