  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare heart function, symptoms, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with
      Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF)before and after catheter
      ablation.

      Hypothesis: Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm by catheter ablation, without the use
      of antiarrhythmic drugs, in AF and CHF improves heart failure status.
