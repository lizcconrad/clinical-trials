      The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary
      efficacy of single escalating doses of ACRX-100 delivered via endomyocardial injection in
      adults with ischemic heart failure.

      This open label, 16 subject, Phase 1 dose-escalation study will demonstrate the initial
      safety of using ACRX-100 to treat heart failure in subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
      Safety will be tracked at each dose by documenting all adverse events (AEs), with the primary
      safety endpoint being the number of major cardiac AEs at 30 days. In each cohort (n=4 in low
      dose, n=6 each in mid and high dose), subjects will receive a single dose of ACRX-100.
      Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the impact on cardiac function via
      standard echocardiography measurements, cardiac perfusion via SPECT imaging, and improvement
      in NYHA classification.

    <description>Three cohorts (16 total subjects) will be studied. There will be no concurrent controls. The dose will be escalated by increasing the total amount of ACRX-100 delivered per subject from low dose (n=4 subjects) to middle dose (n=6 subjects) to high dose (n=6 subjects). ACRX-100 will be injected directly into the myocardium as a single dose at multiple sites through a percutaneous, left ventricular approach using a needle injection catheter.</description>
