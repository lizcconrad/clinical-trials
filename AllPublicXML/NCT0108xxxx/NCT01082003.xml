  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to determine if the use of Trental and Vitamin E
      will decrease the incidence and severity of contractures (shrinking and or hardening of
      tissue surrounding the implant) associated with breast implant reconstruction following
      radiation treatment. Another goal is to find out the impact that Trental and Vitamin E have
      on implant loss or need for surgical intervention in the setting of chest wall radiation
      after reconstruction. In addition, the investigators want to evaluate the patient's sense of
      well being and quality of life.

      This is a single center, 18-month study in which 30 women will receive Trental
      (pentoxifylline) 400 milligrams three times a day in combination with vitamin E, 400
      international units orally twice daily for six months. Subjects will begin the treatment
      regimen within four weeks after completion of radiation treatment and will remain on the
      study drugs for six months. Following completion of active treatment, all subjects will enter
      the twelve-month observational phase of the trial in which they will be evaluated for changes
      in breast tissue using the following objective tools: Bakers Grade Assessment, Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS), implant revision or loss, breast photographs, adverse event assessment and the
      Quality of Life tool (SF-12).
