  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study objective was to explore the impact of health literacy on effectiveness of an
      educational intervention describing life-style and behavior modification for patients &quot;Living
      with Coronary Artery Disease.&quot; Our hypothesis was that a VHS/DVD version of this educational
      program would be &quot;superior&quot; to printed material alone in its impact on patients' knowledge
      about coronary artery disease and important life-style changes. Furthermore, we believed this
      effect would be most notable among patients with low health literacy. We also were interested
      in the impact of the interventions on secondary outcomes including - health behaviors, health
      outcomes and patients' subjective experiences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      187 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomized to one of two educational
      interventions prior to scheduled ambulatory visit: VHS/DVD plus printed booklet; or booklet
      alone. Main measures included health literacy, CAD knowledge assessment; clinical outcomes
      and health behaviors including - blood pressure, weight, smoking status, exercise and dietary
      habits.
