      Check the pharmacodynamics of the drug octreotide acetate LAR 30 mg imported and distributed
      by Chemical Laboratory Pharmaceutical Bergamo Ltda. compared to the drug Sandostatin LAR ®
      (octreotide acetate 30 mg) manufactured by Novartis Biociências S / A, using as activity
      analysis of growth hormone (GH) and growth factor insulin-like 1 (IGF-1 ) after a single dose
      of the drug in patients with acromegaly

      Secondly, it will be observed safety (tolerability) in clinical patients by comparing the
      clinical and laboratory parameters before and after the study and the incidence of adverse
      events after a single dose
