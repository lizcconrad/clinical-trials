      The Community Youth Development Study is an experimental test of the Communities That Care
      (CTC) prevention planning system. It has been designed to find out if communities that were
      trained to use the CTC system improved public health by reducing rates of adolescent drug
      use, delinquency, violence, and risky sexual behavior when compared to communities that did
      not use this approach. The primary purpose of the current continuation study is to
      investigate whether CTC has long-term effects on substance use, antisocial behavior, and
      violence, as well as secondary effects on educational attainment, mental health, and sexual
      risk behavior in young adults at ages 21 and 23.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventing alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; delinquency; violence; and health-risking
      sexual behavior among adolescents is a national priority. While advances in prevention
      science over the past two decades have produced a growing list of tested and effective
      programs and policies for preventing these behaviors, widespread dissemination and
      high-quality implementation of these effective programs and policies in communities has not
      been achieved. The development and testing of approaches for translating prevention research
      findings into effective community prevention service systems with long-term impact is
      important to achieving reductions in the prevalence of adolescent health and behavior
      problems that are sustained into adulthood.

      The Community Youth Development Study (CYDS) is a community-randomized trial of the effects
      of Communities That Care (CTC) on community prevention systems and adolescent risk,
      protection, and behavioral health outcomes. The current continuation study is evaluating the
      long-term effects of CTC on a panel of 4,407 young adults at ages 21 and 23 who have been
      surveyed regularly since the trial started when they were in grade 5.

      CTC is a prevention planning and capacity building system for improving behavioral health
      problems among youth community-wide. CTC guides communities to implement with fidelity and
      monitor the results of effective prevention programs that address community-specific elevated
      risk factors and depressed protective factors and reduce problem behavior. The CTC system is
      hypothesized first to produce improvements in key characteristics of community prevention
      service systems, which, in turn, reduce community levels of risk, increase protective
      factors, and lower rates of youth problem behaviors.

      The CYDS communities were matched in pairs within state, on population size, racial and
      ethnic diversity, economic indicators, and crime rates. One community from each matched pair
      was assigned randomly by a coin toss to either the intervention or control condition.
      Starting in 2003, intervention communities received training, technical assistance, and
      materials and funding needed to install the CTC prevention system in years 2-5 (2004-2008),
      hire a community coordinator, and implement 2-5 tested preventive interventions. Selected
      interventions addressed local prevention priorities established by communities after
      reviewing local epidemiological data on youth risk factors, protective factors and problem
      behaviors. Control communities received no training or technical assistance from the study.
      Technical assistance and study-provided funding to intervention communities ended after 5
      years.

      The initial CYDS trial (2003-2008) evaluated the efficacy of CTC in reducing levels of risk,
      increasing levels of protection, and reducing levels of drug use and other problem behaviors
      in adolescents from Grades 5 through 9. It also tested the effects of CTC on prevention
      service system transformation (e.g., increases in a science-based approach to prevention,
      collaboration among prevention service organizations, support for prevention, community norms
      against drug use and delinquency, and use of the Social Development Strategy to guide
      interactions with youth) as reported by key community leaders and members of CTC coalitions.

      The first continuation study (2009-2013) assessed the effects of installation and
      implementation of CTC when panel youth were in Grades 10 through Age 19. During this period,
      panel youth passed through high school, the developmental period of greatest risk for
      delinquent and violent behavior, and a period of greatly increasing substance use and
      problems related to substance use. The study evaluated the long-term effects of CTC on
      adolescent and young adult risk and problem behaviors, including primary outcomes of
      substance use and abuse, delinquency, crime, and violence. It also evaluated the
      sustainability of the CTC prevention system without the study-provided funding and support
      that were offered during the implementation of CTC in the 12 intervention communities during
      the initial efficacy trial.

      The current continuation study (2013-2017) is investigating the long-term effects of CTC on
      young adult substance use and misuse, crime, violence, and incarceration 11 and 13 years
      following CTC's initial installation. Also being evaluated are a number of secondary outcomes
      salient in young adulthood, including HIV/AIDS sexual risk behavior, depression and
      suicidality, anxiety and other mental health disorders, and educational attainment. Panel
      youth have been surveyed twice during the study, at ages 21 and 23.

    <description>The Communities That Care (CTC) system provides communities training and ongoing technical assistance in a structured process for conducting prevention needs assessments using epidemiological data on levels of risk and protective factors for adolescent problem behaviors, selection of tested and effective preventive interventions shown to address community-prioritized factors, implementation of these interventions with fidelity, and evaluation of the community's progress toward its goals. The CTC system is designed to produce a plan for prevention services that is tailored to the needs of each community. CTC is installed in five phases through a manualized series of training events designed to build the capacity of communities to install and sustain the system over time.</description>

    <ipd_description>We support the goal of making datasets available to researchers in a timely manner to expedite translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. With these goals in mind, we have entered into data-sharing collaborations many times with outside researchers. To ensure that the use of these data stay within the legal and ethical constraints of the consent agreement under which they were collected, we have developed a Fair Use Agreement, available upon request, that is signed by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Oesterle, and by the collaborating researcher when agreement has been reached to share study data. As part of the Fair Use Agreement, we ask researchers to abide by the same Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) that we adhere to. We will continue to share data with other researchers who meet the terms of our Fair Use Agreement (and DSMP) and share our strong commitment to protection of the rights and privacy of study participants.</ipd_description>
