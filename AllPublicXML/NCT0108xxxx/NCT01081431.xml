      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of lenalidomide and markers for disease
      progression in the treatment of IPSS low- or intermediate-1 risk MDS with isolated del5q.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lenalidomide has been successfully used in patients with MDS in several studies. A small
      proportion of patients with MDS and del(5q) developed leukemia while treated with
      Lenalidomide. Up to now it is unknown what patients are at risk to progress while being
      treated with Lenalidomid. Therefore it is planned to examine not only the traditional
      clinical parameters like disease status and proportion of blasts, but also cytogenetic
      findings, gene expression, antiangiogenic effect, marrow fibrosis, mesenchymal stem cell as
      well as mitochondrial DNA mutation at baseline and in the course of the study performed by
      central laboratories. Moreover, long-term data are required, e.g., with regard to the
      development of AML. Therefore, it is planned to collect data from all patients with MDS and
      del 5q (isolated, blast count &lt;5%) in whom treatment with lenalidomide is the best
      therapeutic option according to the investigator's assessment in a structured fashion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          -  Must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

          -  Cytologically/histologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS with del 5q (isolated, blast
             count &lt;5%), IPSS low or intermediate-1.

          -  Transfusion dependency with at least 1 concentrates of erythrocytes within 8 weeks
             prior to first administration of study drug.

          -  Start of treatment with lenalidomide is the best therapeutic option for the patient
             according to the investigator's assessment There are - apart from individual cases
             with erythropoetin level lower than 500 U/l and allogeneic transplantation for younger
             patients - no authorized alternative treatment options. Chemotherapy with low dose
             cytosine arabinoside may result in hematologic improvement. However, concerning the
             risk-benefit-assessment this chemotherapy is more unfavorable than lenalidomide due to
             cytopenia and mutagenic effects.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must:

               -  Understand that the study medication has a teratogenic risk

               -  Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without
                  interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy
                  (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug
                  therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea. This applies unless the subject commits to
                  absolute and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are
                  effective methods of contraception*: (Implant,Levonorgestrel-releasing
                  intrauterine system (IUS)**,Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot, Tubal
                  sterilisation, Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only;
                  vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative semen analyses, Ovulation inhibitory
                  progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel))

               -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of
                  25 mIU/ml not more than 3 days before the start of study medication once the
                  subject has been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This
                  requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice complete
                  and continued abstinence.

               -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4
                  weeks after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal
                  sterilization. These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the
                  start of next treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing
                  potential who practice complete and continued abstinence

        (*) Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined
        oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of VTE
        continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral contraception.

        (**) Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly in
        patients with neutropenia due to risk of infection

          -  Male subjects must

               -  Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption
                  and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of
                  childbearing potential and has no contraception.

               -  Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of
                  study drug therapy.

          -  All subjects must

               -  Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one
                  week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused
                  study drug to the investigator
