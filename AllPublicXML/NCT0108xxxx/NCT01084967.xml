  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the pathogenesis and genetic susceptibility of obese
      subjects,providing a convincing argument for further treatment of obesity and metabolic
      syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a major worldwide challenge to public health, owing to an interaction
      between the obesogenic environment and a strong genetic contribution.Previous studies found
      that genetic factors determine 40%-70% of obese phenotype.Under such circumstances, the
      screening of obesity susceptibility gene is particularly important for society or family to
      take measures to prevent obesity.

      Recent extensive genome-wide association studies(GWASs) have identified numerous single
      nucleotide polymorphisms associated with obesity,but these loci together account for only a
      small fraction of the known heritable component.Two studies in 2010 Nature,for the first
      time, put rare copy number variation (CNV)in association with severe early-onset
      obesity.Their significance lie not only in the discovery of the pathogenic genes of severe
      early-onset obesity but,more importantly,in providing new strategies for finding out genes
      that cause complex diseases.

      Obese patients and healthy lean controls proved by a series of blood biochemical examinations
      will be enrolled in this study.The present study intends to use the techniques such as
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR,gene
      chip,construction of viral vectors,transfection,taking advantage of the established
      database,by means of serum assays and functional tests, associate copy number variation with
      obesity phenotype to explain the root cause of obesity.Meanwhile biomarkers and genetic risk
      factors will be evaluated in the study subjects.
