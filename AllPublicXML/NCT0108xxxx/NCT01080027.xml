      The rationale of this study is to assess the safety profile, efficacy and adherence to Rebif®
      New Formulation in real life settings with a multinational approach, as well as the impact of
      this improved formulation (with regards to adverse events [AEs]) to subjects' adherence.

      This international, multicentric, prospective, observational study is being conducted to
      assess the safety profile, efficacy and adherence to Rebif® New Formulation in real life
      settings in subjects with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), as well as the
      impact of this improved formulation (with regards to adverse events [AEs]) to subjects'
      adherence. Three hundred and fifty subjects from approximately 80 sites across seven
      countries will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be treated with IFN beta-1a (Rebif®
      New Formulation) in real life settings according to the clinical and paraclinical course and
      laboratory findings as routinely evaluated by the physician. Data related to AEs; subjects'
      adherence to treatment, reasons for treatment discontinuation; number and reasons of missed
      injections; and the clinical and paraclinical data on efficacy regarding relapses will be
      captured. Data will be reported prospectively throughout the duration of the study (12
      months) at two visits (at month 6 and month 12) following the initial visit; at baseline,
      data can be recorded retrospectively from the subjects' medical file. All the data will be
      evaluated descriptively.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective

        -  To assess the local tolerability of Rebif® New Formulation in real life settings with a
           multinational approach.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the safety profile, subjects' adherence to and efficacy of Rebif® New
           Formulation
