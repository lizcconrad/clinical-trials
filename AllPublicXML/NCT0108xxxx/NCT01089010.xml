    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover
      study of CK-2017357 in patients with ALS. 36 to 72 patients will be randomized to one of six
      different treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of three dosing periods; in
      each dosing period¸ patients receive a single oral dose of placebo, 250 mg of CK-2017357, or
      500 mg of CK-2017357. All six treatment sequences will enroll approximately the same number
      of patients. A washout period of at least 6 days (to a maximum of 10 days) will be employed
      between the doses for each patient. This study is designed to assess the effect of CK-2017357
      on maximal voluntary muscle strength, on the development of fatigue at maximal and
      sub-maximal voluntary muscle contraction, and on selected pulmonary function parameters. The
      plasma concentration of CK-2017357 will be measured at selected time points after each of two
      single doses of CK-2017357 in men and women. The plasma concentration versus time data
      obtained in this study may be used to develop a population PK model and estimate
      inter-subject variability of PK parameters in this target patient population, in particular
      between male and female study patients.

    <description>In this hypothesis-generating early Phase II study, multiple assessments of skeletal muscle function will be made without specifying a single primary endpoint, including:
ALS Functional Assessment
Maximum Grip Strength (bilateral)
Maximum Grip Strength Fatigability (bilateral)
Shoulder Extension Fatigue (bilateral)
Slow Vital Capacity
Maximal Voluntary Ventilation
Sniff Inspiratory Pressure
Maximum Voluntary Muscle Contraction of multiple bilateral muscle groups using Hand Held Dynamometry
Repeated Sub-Maximum Grip Strength Fatigability (bilateral)</description>
