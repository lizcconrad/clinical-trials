  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, multi-institutional, observational cohort study is to
      determine if an initial surgical approach leads to better function and quality of life than
      primary chemoradiation in a subset of patients with advanced hypopharyngeal and laryngeal
      cancers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the time of registration patients will be categorized into 2 groups based on the initial
      treatment plan as either chemoradiation-based or surgically-based (laryngectomy). Treatment
      will be assigned by the patient's physician, it will not be assigned by the study.

      Patients will be asked to complete a series of 4 questionnaires addressing swallowing
      function, generic health status, head and neck cancer-specific quality of life, and
      self-reported speech function at 3 time points (baseline, 6 months and 12 months after the
      end of treatment). The treating physician will provide basic clinical information at these
      same time points. In centers where swallowing and voice assessments are done as part of
      standard of care, data from these studies will also be provided.

      Study entry is open to all adults regardless of gender or ethnic background. Specific
      information regarding the definitive treatment (surgery or chemoradiation) will be provided
      to the patient by the treating physician as part of the routine standard of care. Any
      treatment related side effects, as well as the duration of therapy and follow-up will be
      managed by the treating physician. Participation in this study will have no effect on the
      initial treatment decisions or the course of care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Swallowing Function Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be self-reported swallowing function (M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory questionnaire - MDADI) 12 months after treatment. Analysis will compare MDADI scores of patients treated initially with laryngectomy vs. those of patients treated initially with chemoradiation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>PreTreatment, 6 Months and 12 Months After Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 Quality of Life questionnaire will be used to assess general health status. The SF-12 contains one or two items that measure each of eight domains of health: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. It yields scale scores for each of these eight health domains, and two summary measures of physical and mental health: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>PreTreatment, 6 Months and 12 Months After Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Speech analysis will focus primarily on speech intelligibilty and acceptability to both clinicians and naive listeners, and less on voice quality per se using the Voice Handicap Index. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) measures the influence of voice problems on a patient's quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>PreTreatment, 6 Months and 12 Month After Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The University of Washington Quality of Life Assessment Questionnaire will be administered. This questionnaire is specifically designed to capture head and neck cancer-specific function.</description>

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (cartilage invading-T3 and all T4) or
        hypopharynx (T2 and T3) for which curative treatment is planned. The tumor must be
        resectable with total laryngectomy alone as determined by the treating surgeon - this
        requirement is regardless of whether the surgery of chemoradiation is planned for the
        patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willingness and ability to complete self-administered follow-up questionnaires over
             the course of one year as determined by a member of the research team

          -  Voluntary written informed consent with the understanding that consent may be
             withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care

          -  Must be at least 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Require a resection that would involve more than the standard laryngectomy (total
             pharyngectomy, esophagectomy)

          -  Undergo partial laryngectomy, when open or endoscopic

          -  Have previously altered anatomy of the upper aerodigestive tract

          -  Have pre-existing dysphagia unrelated to the tumor, or neurologic disorders that could
             affect swallowing (Parkinson's, cerebrovascular accidents)

          -  Have prior malignant disease of the upper aerodigestive tract

          -  Have prior radiation therapy to the head and neck region

          -  Metastatic disease

          -  Unable to complete self-administered questionnaires written in simple English for
             cognitive, psychiatric, or other reasons that in the opinion of the enrolling
             investigator is likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study.
