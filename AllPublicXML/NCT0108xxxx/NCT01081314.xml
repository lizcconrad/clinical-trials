  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are the quintessential multi-problem
      patients, often presenting to treatment with numerous dysfunctional behaviors and comorbid
      diagnoses. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a comprehensive, cognitive-behavioral
      treatment for BPD that has been shown effective in reducing the primary problems it is
      designed to treat; namely, the frequency and severity of self-injurious and suicidal
      behavior, maintenance in treatment, and severe problems in living. However, the DBT treatment
      manual does not currently include a protocol specifying when or how to treat posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), a comorbid diagnosis that is prevalent in BPD patients and may
      maintain or exacerbate BPD criterion behaviors. Similarly, many of the existing treatment
      outcome studies for PTSD have excluded suicidal, substance abusing, and multiply diagnosed
      patients, thereby making it difficult to determine the generalizability of these approaches
      to individuals with BPD. The research proposed here is focused on the development of a
      protocol based on Prolonged Exposure therapy to treat PTSD in BPD patients that can be
      integrated into standard DBT, as well as the initial evaluation of this protocol's
      feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy. The treatment development and pilot testing process
      will occur in two phases, including measure development and standardization of the treatment
      protocol via clinical pre-testing (Phase 1); and pilot and feasibility testing of the
      intervention via a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing standard DBT + PTSD Protocol
      to standard DBT Only (Phase 2). Information gathered during the pilot RCT will be used to
      inform the design and conduct of a subsequent full-scale RCT. This research has the potential
      to significantly expand and improve upon the most empirically supported treatment currently
      available for BPD, while also demonstrating that exposure treatments for PTSD can be
      implemented safely and effectively in a BPD population.
