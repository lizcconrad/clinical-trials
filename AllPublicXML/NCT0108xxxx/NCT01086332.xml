  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate if nelfinavir works as a radiation sensitizer in
      combination with gemcitabine (a chemotherapy). We are also looking to establish the maximum
      dose of gemcitabine that is tolerated with the nelfinavir and radiation therapy, so the dose
      of gemcitabine is increased based on how previous trial participants tolerated their dose of
      gemcitabine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial utilizes gemcitabine (a chemotherapy agent commonly used for pancreatic cancer)
      and nelfinavir (an anti-retroviral agent FDA-approved for use in HIV+ patients) in addition
      to radiation therapy for treatment of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial
      seeks to determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine when administered concurrently
      with radiation therapy and 1250 mg nelfinavir twice daily.

      The gemcitabine and radiation is standard; the dose of gemcitabine does vary nationally and
      internationally as to what the 'best dose' is. Administered weekly, doses can range from 400
      mg/m2 to 1000 mg/m2. Thus, this is why the proposed clinical trial escalates the gemcitabine.

      The gemcitabine will be administered weekly during radiation therapy for a total of 6 cycles.
      After completion of radiation therapy, the subjects will be evaluated by the surgeons for
      resectability. This ends the active portion of the clinical trial; the subjects will be
      followed for long-term progression free survival and for overall survival.

      Primary endpoints for this trial are identifying the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine
      when administered concurrently with nelfinavir and radiation therapy (the phase I portion of
      this study) and the rate of resectability (typically, utilizing gemcitabine plus radiation
      therapy will convert up to 30% of patients from borderline resectable to resectable) for the
      phase II portion of the study.

      Interim analyses and stopping rules are in place if an effect size is not observed in the
      therapeutic group compared to published reports of response to standard chemoradiation for
      borderline resectable cases.

Dose of gemcitabine is increased for new subjects based on the experiences and tolerance of prior subjects. When the maximum tolerated dose is identified, a recommended phase 2 dose will be assigned and further subjects will receive that dose.</description>
