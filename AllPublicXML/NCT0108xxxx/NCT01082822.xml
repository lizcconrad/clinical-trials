      Cell sheet technique possess the properties of conserving the ECM, rich molecules and
      retaining cell vitality, and will promote the capacity of cell adhesion and proliferation.
      The stem cell based cell sheet therapy has been utilized in many fields and scored the
      satisfactory results. Periodontitis is a chronic disease which causes the destruction of the
      periodontal tissue and leads to the teeth loss in the end. The routine cell-based therapy to
      the periodontitis was confronted with many difficulties. In the investigators previous
      preclinical research, +the investigators fabricated periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC)
      pellets and cell sheet fragment and applied them in the periodontal defect area for tissue
      regeneration and periodontitis treatment. And the investigators carried out a comprehensive
      study of the PDLSC allograft. The host responses and implanted cell fates were recorded.
      After the scientific investigation of the preclinical study, the investigators designed the
      preliminary clinical trial of PDLSC cell sheet for the chronic periodontitis therapy in the
      aims to test the PDLSC fates and explore one ideal transplantation mode.

      our protocol mainly includes following steps:

        1. select periodontitis patients :all patients were given the comprehensive examination on
           the oral condition including clinical examination, radiological evaluation and the
           immune system tests

        2. select healthy donor teeth for PDLSC isolation and expansion.

        3. fabricate the cell sheet and prepare the PDLSC cell sheet pellets and cell sheet
           fragment.

        4. patients given the routine mechanical and chemical treatment for 4 weeks were randomized
           divided into 4 groups according to the visit time: i) the cell sheet fragment plus
           bio-ss transplantation; ii) the cell sheet pellets plus bioss transplantation; iii) the
           bio-ss transplantation and iv) the control.

        5. all the operations were carried out as the routine GBR procedures.

        6. the clinical, radiological examination and the changes of the immune system at the point
           of 1 day before and 4weeks, 12weeks, 24weeks and one year after the intervention were
           recorded and compared.

    <description>In the first step, the patient was periodontally treated until the inflammation was eliminated through control of bacterial biofilm and oral hygiene for about 6 months. Then the rigid fixed appliances were placed on the diseased teeth, reverse beveled open-flap surgery was performed in the buccal and palatal maxillary sides of the periodontitis-caught teeth to allow granulation tissue debridement and proper root preparation. The roots were completely scaled, and 17%EDTA was applied for 2 minutes to demineralize the root surfaces and bone wall defects, the flap was sutured.</description>
