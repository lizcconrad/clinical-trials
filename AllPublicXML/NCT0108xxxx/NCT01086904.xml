  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of an inactivated and non adjuvanted
      Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine in renal transplant recipients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      120 renal transplant recipients under triple immunosuppression will be immunized against
      influenza H1N1v.

      The primary endpoint will be the humoral immunity assessed 21 days after each injection on
      day 0 and day 21:

        -  seroprotection rate, defined as the percentage of patients with an antibody title
           against Hemaglutinin ≥ 1/40e after immunization

        -  seroconversion rate, defined as the the percentage of patients with an antibody title
           against Hemaglutinin &lt; 1/10e before immunization and ≥ 1/40e after or with a prevaccine
           title ≥1/10e increasing at least 4 fold after immunization

        -  seroconversion factor, defined as the ratio between pre and post vaccine geometrical
           means of the antibody titles.

      Secondary endpoints will be:

        -  Seroconversion rate, seroprotection rate and seroconversion factor on day 182

        -  Percentage of patients with an antibody title &gt; 1/40e on day 182 (Immune memory)

        -  Number and severity of clinical and biological adverse events

        -  Number of cases of pandemic H1N1v influenza virologically confirmed

        -  Study of associated parameters influencing the results of H1N1v vaccination in terms of
           seroprotection, seroconversion and seroconversion factor

        -  Assessment of the cellular immune response against H1N1v

        -  Assessment of the H1N1v vaccination on graft function and on humoral anti-HLA response.
