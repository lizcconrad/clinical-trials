  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The end point of catheter ablation at complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) was not
      established yet. Furthermore, incomplete CFAE ablation may have a potential to develop atrial
      tachyarrhythmias (AT). The investigators hypothesized that linear ablation extending the
      clusters of CFAE would be a better strategy than focal ablation at the individual CFAE sites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients age 18 or greater

          -  persistent atrial fibrillation

          -  candidates for AF ablation based on AF that is symptomatic and refractory to at least
             one antiarrhythmic medication

          -  at least one episode of AF must have been documented by ECG or Holter within 12 months
             of randomization in the trial

          -  continuous anticoagulation with warfarin (INR 2-3) for &gt;4 weeks prior to the ablation

          -  patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate
             in the clinical trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation

          -  patients with AF felt to be secondary to an obvious reversible cause

          -  inadequate anticoagulation as defined in the inclusion criteria

          -  left atrial thrombus on TEE prior to procedure

          -  contraindications to systemic anticoagulation with heparin or coumadin

          -  previously undergone atrial fibrillation ablation

          -  patients who are or may potentially be pregnant
