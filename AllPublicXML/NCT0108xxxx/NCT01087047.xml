  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that airway management can be difficult during pregnancy. Increased risks
      for difficult intubation in pregnant women have been often reported. Thus, pregnancy is
      regarded as a period of high anesthesiologic risk.

      Generalized weight gain is a well known factor influencing the upper airway in pregnant
      women. However, the modifications of the airway itself are less well documented.

      The acoustic reflection method is based on the analysis of the reflection of a single
      transient planar wave allowing the analysis of the longitudinal cross-sectional area profile
      of the examined cavity. It is a noninvasive and harmless method.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate by acoustic reflection method the physiological
      modifications of the upper airways during pregnancy.

      Women enrolled in the study will undergo an acoustic recording during the first, second, and
      third trimester of pregnancy, as well as two days and one month after delivery. Forty
      pregnant women will be included in this monocentric, prospective, open labelled study.

      Moreover, a single acoustic recording will be performed in 10 other pregnant women undergoing
      an MRI for obstetrical purpose. The estimated caliber of the upper airways by MRI and
      acoustic method will be compared.
