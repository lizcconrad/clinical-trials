  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, open, non-comparative study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      recombinant human luteinizing hormone (rhLH, Luveris) administered subcutaneously (s.c.) in
      follicular development during ovulation induction in 31 Chinese female subjects with
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

      The objective of this prospective, open, non-comparative study was to assess the safety and
      efficacy of rhLH (Luveris) administered subcutaneously in follicular development during
      ovulation induction in Chinese female subjects with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study
      was organized on an outpatient basis involving a single cycle of treatment. Prior to entry
      into the study, the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was confirmed by history, by
      the presence or absence of specific clinical features and by measuring serum gonadotropin
      levels. Once a subject has signed the informed consent form and after satisfying all
      eligibility criteria, the subject received a combination of daily injection of recombinant
      human follicle-stimulating hormone (rhFSH) 150 international units (IU) plus rhLH 75 IU.
      After adequate follicular response, ovulation induction was triggered by an injection of
      10,000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Luteal phase function was assessed by serum
      progesterone level determination.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Confirmed Pregnancies: Biochemical Pregnancies and Clinical Pregnancies</measure>

    <description>Biochemical pregnancy was defined as a pregnancy diagnosed only by the detection of hCG in serum or urine and that does not develop into a clinical pregnancy. Clinical pregnancy was defined as a pregnancy diagnosed by ultrasonographic visualization of one or more gestational sacs or definitive clinical signs of pregnancy. It includes ectopic pregnancy.</description>
