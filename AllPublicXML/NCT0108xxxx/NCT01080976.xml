      Abstract Diabetes behavior can be influenced by patients exploring diabetes topics that may
      lack scientific credibility. The question this study examines is whether a Google or Health
      on the Net (HON) internet search, presents websites that would incline a more or less likely
      recommendation to patients ? A preliminary trial suggests that referrers recommend websites
      based on rules that may prioritize website source over content. This study will qualitatively
      assess the rules that participants use in deciding which websites are more suitable than
      others.

      Method The investigators will inject a diabetes related search term into a HON and a Google
      search engine. The top 5 mutually exclusive websites from each search engine will be
      presented to 5 people from three groups stratified across endocrinologists, informaticians
      and PCPs. Participants will rank the websites and then identify the rules that they applied
      to reach their decision.
