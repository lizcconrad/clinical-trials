  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis vulgaris is no longer considered as a chronic inflammatory disease restricted to
      the skin. Evidence has accumulated in the past that psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory
      systemic disease. As in rheumatoid arthritis, the chronic inflammatory process plays a
      central role in the pathogenesis of associated comorbidities such as diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease. Since several years the armamentarium of psoriasis treatment has been
      broadened by the availability of TNF alpha blockers. These neutralize systemic TNF alpha
      which not only plays a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis but has also been linked
      to inflammatory pathways in diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While a few studies have
      investigated the positive effects of TNF alpha blockers on associated cardiovascular disease
      in rheumatoid arthritis patients, no research data exist on the effects of these therapeutic
      agents in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

      The present study aims at determining the effects of adalimumab, a potent and frequently
      prescribed TNF alpha blocker for the treatment of psoriasis, on different diabetic and
      cardiovascular risk factors in patients receiving this treatment as a remedy for moderate to
      severe plaque type psoriasis. The study is designed to explore whether adalimumab is capable
      to prevent or modulate psoriasis-associated comorbidities by blocking systemic inflammation.
      The effects of adalimumab will be compared with those of fumaric acids, which represent an
      established traditional systemic treatment option for moderate to severe psoriasis.

      Study hypothesis:

      Therapy with adalimumab will lead to an improvement of several parameters that reflect the
      risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis due to
      chronic inflammation. Endothelial dysfunction, as assessed by ultrasound flow mediated
      dilatation, will serve as primary outcome measure. Other risk factors such as blood lipids,
      hsCRP, IL-6, endothelial adhesion molecules, parameters of glucose metabolism and carotid
      intima-media thickness will be secondary outcomes.

      Aim:

      If adalimumab and/or fumaric acids will show a significant impact on the above mentioned
      parameters, these findings would offer a new perspective for the long term management of
      psoriatic patients and their comorbidities.

      Study design: Randomized, prospective, controlled, parallel group study

      Study population: 66 patients
