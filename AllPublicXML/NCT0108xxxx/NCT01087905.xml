  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research shows that smoking cessation is the most significant preventable health behavior
      change that a person can make to lower cancer risk. In addition, telephone quitlines are an
      effective, science-based smoking cessation treatment that is universally accessible to
      smokers in the U.S. However, little research has explored promising approaches that could
      increase quitline use, improve quit rates, and inform resource allocation for quitline
      services. The proposed study will test three promising enhancements to the standard quitline
      treatment that typically consists of counseling and, possibly 2 weeks of a NRT medication.
      These enhancements are: 1) combination nicotine replacement therapy as recommended by the
      United States Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline on Treating Tobacco Use and
      Dependence; 2) extended duration of cessation medication use; and 3) an innovative counseling
      addition - cognitive medication adherence counseling - to optimize adherence to cessation
      medication. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of each intervention will be calculated. The
      findings of the proposed research have broad potential application and relevance to state
      quitlines, quitline service providers, and other purchasers of quitline services such as
      employers and insurers. Additionally, the study findings can potentially inform other
      telephone health behavior counseling programs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a fully crossed 2x2x2 factorial design that tested the effect of two
      versus six weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), the effect of NRT monotherapy
      (nicotine patch alone) versus NRT combination therapy (nicotine patch + oral NRT), and the
      effect of cognitive medication adherence counseling (CMAC) versus no CMAC. A total of 987
      smokers seeking cessation assistance from the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) were
      randomly assigned to the eight (2x2x2) different conditions generated by the three
      experimental factors. This design provides us with sufficient power to analyze each of our
      three main effects listed above. We will also test for two- and three-way interactions, but
      do not have sufficient data to make a priori assumptions about interaction effects. Finally,
      we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for each of the three interventions to allow
      readers of this research to evaluate whether the additional costs of the interventions yield
      sufficient gains to warrant implementing them broadly.

    <time_frame>26 weeks after the target quit smoking date</time_frame>
    <description>For cost analyses, we computed the costs of intervention per caller, the cost per quit based on the 6-month ITT 7-day PPA, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER. Intervention costs included direct costs associated with registration, provision of NRT and counseling (standard and MAC), and mailing of a quit guide (all participants) and a MAC information sheet (MAC participants only). Facility space, supplies, and physician supervision time were included in the call costs; research-related costs were excluded. ICER ratio is a measure of the added cost per added quit for two treatments. ICER was computed as the cost difference between the least intensive treatment group (2 weeks of nicotine patch only) and a more intensive comparison group divided by the difference in the quit rates of the two groups being compared; e.g., the ICER for the group that received 2 weeks of nicotine patch and nicotine gum = (213-178)/(.482-.384) = $357.</description>

        <population>The study was originally powered to detect at least a 6.4% increase in the abstinence rate due to an enhanced intervention (e.g., 6 wks NRT); this effect size was based on prior quitline studies; we predicted that abstinence rates at 6 months would be approximately 12% in a standard intervention vs. 18.4% in an enhanced intervention.</population>

            <description>Participants in this intervention group received Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) consisting of the Nicotine Patch plus Nicotine Gum. This intervention is considered to be the enhanced intervention in terms of type of NRT; it will be compared to the standard NRT type intervention which is NRT Monotherapy consisting of the Nicotine Patch Only. Approximately half the total sample was randomized to the standard intervention (Nicotine Patch Only) and half to the enhanced intervention (Nicotine Patch plus Nicotine Gum).</description>

        <title>Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio for 7-Day Point Prevalence Abstinence From Smoking at 26 Weeks Post-Quit by Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) Group</title>
        <description>For cost analyses, we computed the costs of intervention per caller, the cost per quit based on the 6-month ITT 7-day PPA, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER. Intervention costs included direct costs associated with registration, provision of NRT and counseling (standard and MAC), and mailing of a quit guide (all participants) and a MAC information sheet (MAC participants only). Facility space, supplies, and physician supervision time were included in the call costs; research-related costs were excluded. ICER ratio is a measure of the added cost per added quit for two treatments. ICER was computed as the cost difference between the least intensive treatment group (2 weeks of nicotine patch only) and a more intensive comparison group divided by the difference in the quit rates of the two groups being compared; e.g., the ICER for the group that received 2 weeks of nicotine patch and nicotine gum = (213-178)/(.482-.384) = $357.</description>

            <groups_desc>In this analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is computed. ICER is a measure of the added cost per added quit for two treatments. ICER was computed as the cost difference between the least intensive treatment group (2 weeks of nicotine patch only) and a more intensive comparison group divided by the difference in the quit rates of the two groups being compared; ICER for the group that received 2 weeks of nicotine patch and nicotine gum = (213-178)/(.482-.384) = $357.</groups_desc>

      <time_frame>Information about adverse events was collected during the 6-week post-quit period of study interventions. The quitline vendor for the study, Free &amp; Clear (Seattle, WA), dispensed all study medications and addressed adverse events.</time_frame>
      <desc>This study used FDA-approved, over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) that were dispensed according to standard protocols that were in use by Free &amp; Clear at the time of the study. Free &amp; Clear was responsible for assessing and managing any AEs related to study medication as per their existing Nicotine Replacement Therapy Protocols.</desc>
