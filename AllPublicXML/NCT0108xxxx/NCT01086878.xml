  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if prophylactic cotrimoxazole makes severe anemia
      or neutropenia more common in infants exposed to maternal HIV and combination antiretroviral
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, more than 2 million children are born to HIV-infected women. The World Health
      Organization (WHO) recommends that these infants receive cotrimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis
      starting at 4-6 weeks of age until the period of infant HIV transmission risk is over, and
      the infant is known to be HIV-uninfected. There is also increasing interest in studying CTX
      prophylaxis given to all infants of HIV-infected women at the time of initiation of
      replacement feeding, regardless of infant HIV infection status, to mitigate the high risk of
      infant morbidity and mortality associated with formula feeding in the developing world.
      However, infant in utero exposure to maternal antiretroviral drugs can lead to hematologic
      toxicities in infants. It is critical to know whether infant CTX prophylaxis exacerbates the
      hematologic toxicity associated with perinatal ARV exposure. This question, with broad public
      health implications, has never been studied.

      We will study the hematologic toxicity associated with CTX prophylaxis given to infants
      exposed to maternal HAART in Botswana. We will use existing data from a large cohort that did
      not receive CTX, and enroll a smaller cohort that does receive CTX according to Botswana
      national guidelines.
