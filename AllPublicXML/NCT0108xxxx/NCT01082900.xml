  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN) is a disorder of delayed clearance of lung liquid
      and a common cause of admission of full term infants and late pre term infants (34 to 36
      weeks) to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). Both late preterm gestational age at
      delivery, and mode of delivery are considered risk factors for TTN. The investigators
      hypothesize that CPAP administered prophylactically in the Delivery Room via a T piece based
      infant resuscitator Neopuff, to neonates at increased risk for TTN, would decrease the
      incidence of TTN and thus decrease the need for hospitalization in the NICU. This is a pilot
      study to evaluate the prophylactic administration of CPAP in the Delivery Room towards
      prevention of TTN and it's effects on natriuretic peptides.The study will be conducted as a
      randomized control trial after obtaining informed consents from the parents of eligible
      infants. Infants will be randomized to receive either experimental treatment (prophylactic
      CPAP) or standardized care.
