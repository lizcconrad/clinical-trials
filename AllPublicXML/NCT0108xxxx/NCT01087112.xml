    <textblock>
      An RCT comparing mother-infant psychoanalytic treatment (MIP) with Child Health Centre care
      in cases of mother-infant relationship disturbances was performed on 80 cases in Stockholm
      2005-2008. The infants were &lt; 18 months at interview #1. At 6 months follow-ups, significant
      effects were shown in favour of MIP on maternal sensitivity (EAS), depression (EPDS), and
      relationship qualities PIR-GAS). This study will evaluate effects at a child age of 4½ years;
      to evaluate the longterm effects of MIP and CHild Health Centre care, and to better validate
      results on children who now have reached an age where they can participate more actively in
      evaluations.

      DESIGN

      The 71 dyads remaining from the MIPPS-01 study will be interviewed when the children have
      reached 4½ years, in order to evaluate the long-term intervention effects of MIP treatments
      delivered by psychoanalysts at the Infant Reception Service of the Swedish Psychoanalytic
      Society and of the usual treatments of infants and children in Sweden implying contact with
      nurses at Child Health Centres.

      INSTRUMENTS

      Mother-report questionnaires; the Ages and Stages Questionnaire:Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE;
      Squires et al., 2002), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox et al., 1987), the
      Swedish Parental Questionnaire (SPSQ; Östberg et al., 1997) and the Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997).

      Independently rated video-taped mother-child interactions: the Emotional Availability Scale
      (EAS; Biringen, 1998).

      Assessment of the general functioning of the child : Children's Global Assessment Scale
      (Shaffer et al 1983).

      Assessment of the child's cognitive functioning: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of
      Intelligence (WPPSI, Wechsler, 2005).

      Assessment of the child's social and emotional functioning: Story Stem Attachment Profile
      (SSAP, Hodges et al., 2003). Machover Draw-a-Person Test (Blomberg &amp; Cleve, 1997)

    <description>TAU involved scheduled health visitor calls at the local Child Health Centre (CHC), with paediatric checkups at 2 and 6 months of age. The health visitor is encouraged to promote attachment and to detect postnatal depressions. Mothers may be offered parental groups, infant massage or guidance promoting interaction, as well as appointments with a paediatrician or a child psychiatric psychologist. Additional treatment was initiated in 1/3 of the cases. This was registered at the end-point interview.</description>

    <description>MIP (Norman, 2001; 2004) is a psychoanalytic method adapted to the requirements of the infant as analysand in the presence of his mother. The analyst strives to recruit the baby for an emotional interchange, though this does not imply any belief that the infant understands verbal communication. The analyst addresses the baby to help him liberate emotions consolidated in symptoms such as screaming, avoiding maternal eye contact, and breast refusal. The analyst takes great care in enrolling the participant mother. This is to enhance her understanding of the baby's predicament and the nature of their relation, as well as giving her all space needed to vent her own frustration, depression and anxiety.</description>
