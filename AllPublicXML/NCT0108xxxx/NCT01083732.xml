Some values are &quot;NA&quot; because Values were below the limit of quantification. Not calculated as reliable estimation can only be performed when at least 2/3 of the data are available and thus the Geometric Mean (gMean) and Geometric Coefficient of Variation (gCV) is not calculated according to internal rules.</description>

        <description>Major: Fatal bleeding, Clinically overt bleeding associated with decrease in haemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL in 24-h-period,bleeding that was retroperitoneal,pulmonary,intracranial,or otherwise involved the central nervous system,bleeding that required surgical intervention in an operating suite. CRNM: Overt bleeding for which a blood product was administered &amp; which was not directly attributable to the patient’s underlying medical condition,bleeding that required medical or surgical intervention to restore haemostasis,other than in an operating suite. Minor: Any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that did not fulfil the criteria for either major bleeding or CRNM bleeding. For multiple dosing,all events with an onset date after the date of first dose until the end of trial treatment including 3 days after the last treatment and for single dosing,all events with an onset during the 48-h-period after study medication intake were assigned to the on-treatment period.</description>
