               -  patients had an FDG PET/CT for detection, or staging, or restaging, or therapy
                  response assessment that still showed tumor mass with high certainty, for

                    1. NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer), or

          -  Exclusion criteria for all healthy volunteers and patients:

               -  any concomitant disease (for healthy volunteers) and for patients any concurrent
                  severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable other medical disease (e.g. poorly
                  controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 12
                  months prior to planned injection of BAY86-9596, unstable and uncontrolled
                  hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe pulmonary disease) which
                  could compromise participation in the study

               -  For healthy volunteers and patients: known sensitivity to the study drug or
                  components of the preparation.

                  lesions with tumor lesions
