  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a brief culturally appropriate and
      theory-based parental communication intervention designed to improve parent-adolescent sexual
      communication and reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latino adolescents are at high risk for contracting HIV/AIDS. Few individual and even fewer
      parent interventions have been developed to address this persistent problem. Parent
      communication interventions provide an opportunity to enhance individual adolescent based
      approaches. However, there is a need for theory and culture based interventions focused on
      Latino parents. The program implemented in this study was designed for parents, to indirectly
      help reduce the health risks of their adolescents, including unintended pregnancy and STDs,
      including HIV/AIDS. The study has three aims regarding the examination of whether the
      computer based parental communication intervention is 1) associated with a greater increase
      in parents' comfort with, and quantity of communication; 2) associated with a greater
      increase in adolescents' intentions to abstain from sex and/or avoid unprotected intercourse
      and decreased self-reported intercourse and unprotected intercourse; and 3) feasible and
      acceptable to Spanish dominant Latino parents and their adolescent children.

    <description>The parental intervention consists of a 60 minute computer-based program delivered in two sessions (one per week). The DVD ROM provides information about adolescent sexual risk and HIV prevention, strategies to support sexual specific communication and parent-adolescent communication in general. The computer based education program is provided in Spanish.</description>
