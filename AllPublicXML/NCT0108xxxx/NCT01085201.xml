  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to
      change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape. People who
      have SCD have a different type of protein that carries oxygen in their blood (hemoglobin)
      then people without SCD. This different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change
      into a crescent shape under certain conditions. Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because
      they often get stuck in blood vessels blocking the flow of blood, and cause inflammation and
      injury to the important areas in the body. Lexiscan is drug that may prevent this
      inflammation and injury caused by the sickle shaped cells. This drug is approved by the FDA
      to be used as a fast infusion during a heart stress test in people who are unable to exercise
      enough to put stress on their heart by making it beat faster. Lexiscan has never been studied
      in patients with SCD and has never been given as a long infusion.

      -  In this research study we are looking for the highest dose of Lexiscan that can be given
           safely to patients with SCD. There are 4 stages to this study. Each stage will look for
           the highest dose that can be given safely in the following situations: Stage 1: Lexiscan
           will be given through a 12 hours infusion to adults with SCD who are not having a pain
           crisis. Stage 2: Lexiscan will be given through a 24 hour infusion to adults with SCD
           who are not having a pain crisis. Stage 2b: Lexiscan will be given through a 48 hour
           infusion to adults with SCD who are not having a pain crisis. Stage 3: Lexiscan will be
           given through a 24 hour infusion to adults with SCD who are having a pain crisis. Stage
           4: Lexiscan will be given through a 24 hour infusion to children with SCD who are having
           a pain crisis. Stages 1-3 are now complete and closed to accrual. The study is now open
           to children ages 10-17 with SCD pain crisis (stage 4) only.

        -  When participants sign the consent form, they will be told what stage they will join.

        -  Participants in Stages 1, 2, and 2b will be given an infusion of the study drug at the
           time when they do not have a pain crisis. The infusion for Stage 1 participants will be
           12 hours long, followed by a 6-hour observation period. The infusion for Stage 2 will be
           24 hours long, followed by a 6-hour observation period. The infusion for Stage 2b will
           be 48 hours long, followed by a 6-hour observation period.

        -  Participants in Stages 3 and 4 will be given one infusion of the study drug when they
           are admitted to the hospital for a pain crisis. The infusion will be 24 hours long,
           followed by a 6-hour observation period. During the infusion, they will receive standard
           treatment for their pain crisis.

        -  Before the infusion the following procedures will be performed: Pulmonary function test
           (optional, Stage 1 only), blood test and vital signs.

        -  During the infusion the following procedures will be performed: heart rate and amount of
           oxygen in the blood will be monitored continuously, blood tests and blood pressure.

        -  During the observation period immediately following the infusion the following
           procedures will be performed: heart rate and amount of oxygen in the blood will be
           monitored continuously, blood tests, blood pressure and Pulmonary Function test
           (optional, Stage 1 only).

    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicities as a Measure of Whether Infusional Lexiscan is Safe in Individuals With SCD.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 to 54 hours plus 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Per protocol, Lexiscan was considered &quot;safe&quot; if well tolerated based on number of DLTs reported. Stage 1 of the study was a 3+3 dose escalation study. Three doses were tested: 0.24 mcg/kg/hr (dose level 0), 0.6 mcg/kg/hr (dose level 1), and 1.44 mcg/kg/hr (dose level 2). Dose escalation continued until 6 participants were treated at the maximum planned dose (dose level 2). We studied a total of 15 patients in Stage 1. In Stages 2 and 3, if at least 2/3 participants tolerated the dose, an additional 3 participants were studied. We studied 6 participants in each of stages 2 and 3. In stage 2b, Lexiscan was studied for a longer (48 hr) duration in 3 participants. In stage 4, Lexiscan was studied in 3 pediatric participants.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Activated iNKT Cells and/or Activation Markers on iNKT Cells in Individuals With SCD.</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-drug to 54 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of activated iNKT cells after receiving a 24-hour infusion of Lexiscan was compared to pre-drug. iNKT cell activation was evaluated using antibodies targeting the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (phospho-NF-kB p65). Measures are given as percentage of change in phospho-NF-kB p65 activation in iNKT cells compared to pre-drug after a 24-hour infusion. iNKT cell activation in Stages 1, 2b, and 4 was not analyzed (see analysis population description).</description>

    <measure>Pain Levels During a Vaso-occlusive Event in Children and Adults With SCD.</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-drug to 54 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was measured using a standardized pain scale. The scale is a 10-cm visual analogue scale (10 cm-long line printed on white paper), where 0 is no pain and 10 is maximum pain. Participants were asked to indicate their pain level by marking on the line prior to each blood draw.</description>

        <title>Dose Limiting Toxicities as a Measure of Whether Infusional Lexiscan is Safe in Individuals With SCD.</title>
        <description>Per protocol, Lexiscan was considered &quot;safe&quot; if well tolerated based on number of DLTs reported. Stage 1 of the study was a 3+3 dose escalation study. Three doses were tested: 0.24 mcg/kg/hr (dose level 0), 0.6 mcg/kg/hr (dose level 1), and 1.44 mcg/kg/hr (dose level 2). Dose escalation continued until 6 participants were treated at the maximum planned dose (dose level 2). We studied a total of 15 patients in Stage 1. In Stages 2 and 3, if at least 2/3 participants tolerated the dose, an additional 3 participants were studied. We studied 6 participants in each of stages 2 and 3. In stage 2b, Lexiscan was studied for a longer (48 hr) duration in 3 participants. In stage 4, Lexiscan was studied in 3 pediatric participants.</description>

        <description>Percentage of activated iNKT cells after receiving a 24-hour infusion of Lexiscan was compared to pre-drug. iNKT cell activation was evaluated using antibodies targeting the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (phospho-NF-kB p65). Measures are given as percentage of change in phospho-NF-kB p65 activation in iNKT cells compared to pre-drug after a 24-hour infusion. iNKT cell activation in Stages 1, 2b, and 4 was not analyzed (see analysis population description).</description>
        <time_frame>pre-drug to 54 hours</time_frame>
        <population>The number of subjects was determined per protocol. Stage 1 was excluded as the goal was to determine the optimal markers for iNKT cells. Only 4 subjects were analyzed in Stage 2 because 24-hour samples were not obtained for 2 subjects. Stages 2b and 4 were not completely analyzed because these stages were completed early after studying 3 subjects.</population>
