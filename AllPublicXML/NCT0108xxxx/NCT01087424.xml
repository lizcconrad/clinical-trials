        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with histologically proven CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (WHO
             classification). DLBCL with some small cell infiltration in bone marrow or lymph node
             may be included.

          -  Aged over 80 years.

          -  Ann Arbor stage I bulky, II, III or IV

          -  Age-adjusted International Prognostic Index equal to 0, 1, 2 and 3.

          -  Patient non previously treated.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2.

          -  With a minimum life expectancy of 3 months.

          -  Negative HIV, HBV and HCV serologies test ≤ 4 weeks (except after vaccination).

          -  Having previously signed a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other histological type of lymphoma.

          -  Any history of treated or non-treated indolent lymphoma.

          -  Central nervous system or meningeal involvement by lymphoma.

          -  Contra-indication to any drug contained in the chemotherapy regimens.

          -  Any serious active disease (according to the investigator's decision).

          -  Poor renal function (creatinin level&gt;150µmol/l), poor hepatic function (total
             bilirubin level&gt;30mmol/l, transaminases&gt;2.5 maximum normal level) unless these
             abnormalities are related to the lymphoma.

          -  Poor bone marrow reserve as defined by neutrophils &lt;1.5 G/l or platelets &lt;100 G/l,
             unless related to bone marrow infiltration.

          -  Any history of cancer during the last 5 years with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             tumors or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before planned first cycle of
             chemotherapy and during the study.

          -  Adult patient under tutelage.
