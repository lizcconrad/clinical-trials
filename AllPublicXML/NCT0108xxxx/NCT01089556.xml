  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of a combination treatment of duloxetine +
      pregabalin compared with the maximal dose of each drug in monotherapy, in patients with
      diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) who have not responded to the standard
      recommended dose of either drug. It will provide an answer to a common clinical question,
      namely, is it better to increase the dose of the current monotherapy or to combine both
      treatments early on, in patients who do not respond to standard doses of duloxetine or
      pregabalin.

             mellitus. Pain must begin in the feet, with relatively symmetrical onset. Daily pain
             should be present for more than 3 months [assessed by questioning patient]).

          -  Score of at least 4 on the 24-hour average pain severity score on an 11-point Likert
             scale [on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Modified Short Form] at screening and at
             randomization.

          -  Patient is currently not receiving treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain
             (DPNP) or was receiving treatment for DPNP, with a drug other than pregabalin or
             duloxetine, and completed the required washout

          -  Patient has never received treatment with duloxetine or pregabalin. (However, a short
             course of less than 15 days of treatment, at any time previously, will be allowed.)

          -  Stable glycemic control, as assessed by a physician investigator, and hemoglobin A1c

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to duloxetine or pregabalin or any of the inactive
             ingredients or have any contraindication for the use of duloxetine or pregabalin.

          -  Have uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma.

          -  Have received treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within 14 days prior
             to randomization, or have a potential need to use a MAOI during the study or within 5
             days after discontinuation of study drug.

          -  Have received fluoxetine within 30 days prior to randomization.

          -  Have acute liver injury (such as hepatitis) or severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C).

          <title>Mean Change From Week 8 to Week 16 Endpoint on the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The NPSI is a 12-item self-administered questionnaire to assess 5 different dimensions of neuropathic pain: superficial spontaneous burning pain, deep spontaneous pressing pain, paroxysmal pain, evoked pains, and paresthesias/dysesthesias. A total score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher score indicates a greater intensity of pain. Mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) Mean and 95% Confidence Interval (CI). LS Mean values are controlled for treatment, site, baseline value, visit, treatment*visit, baseline*visit and treatment in Study Period II.</description>

          <description>A 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and for depression. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale are considered to be a significant case of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7 represent 'normal.' Mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was used to calculate Least Squares (LS) Mean and 95% Confidence Interval (CI). LS Mean values are controlled for treatment, site, baseline value, visit, treatment*visit, baseline*visit and treatment in Study Period II.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug, and had Week 8 and at least one HADS measurements during Weeks 9-16 (Study Period III).</population>
