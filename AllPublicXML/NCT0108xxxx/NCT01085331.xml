    <textblock>
      The research trial is testing the experimental treatment pimasertib (MSC1936369B) in
      combination with FOLFIRI, as second-line treatment in metastatic K Ras mutated colorectal
      cancer subjects. The study will be run in two parts:

      Part 1, or Safety Run-in Part: Will determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pimasertib combined with FOLFIRI as second-line treatment in subjects
      with metastatic K Ras mutated colorectal cancer.

      Part 2 or Phase 2 Randomised Part: Will assess the anti-tumor activity of pimasertib combined
      with FOLFIRI compared to FOLFIRI with placebo as second-line treatment in metastatic K Ras
      mutated colorectal cancer subjects.

      Phase I which Is an open label dose escalation &quot;3+3&quot; cohort, non-randomized, safety Phase II
      which is a double blind randomized safety/efficacy

        <description>An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <description>BOR was defined based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.0 (RECIST V1.0) as following: Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the targeted lesions. CR and PR had to be documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks (28 days). Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease (PD) being demonstrated during the first 4 weeks. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions compared to the smallest SLD since the study treatment started.</description>

          <title>Part 2 or Phase 2 Randomized Part: Best Overall Response</title>
          <description>BOR was defined based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.0 (RECIST V1.0) as following: Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the targeted lesions. CR and PR had to be documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks (28 days). Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease (PD) being demonstrated during the first 4 weeks. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions compared to the smallest SLD since the study treatment started.</description>
          <population>Part 2 or Phase 2 Randomized Part of the trial was not conducted. Hence, Best overall response was not evaluated.</population>
