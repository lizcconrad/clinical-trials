      To primary efficacy variable is to assess the presence or absence of excessive blood loss
      during and after surgery.

      The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:

        1. A subjective overall assessment by the investigator of FACTOR X in the control of
           bleeding during surgery.

        2. The incidence of bleeding episodes during treatment with FACTOR X while the subject is
           at risk of post-operative bleeding, including location and duration.

        3. Incremental recovery of FX:C and FX:Ag after the pre-surgery bolus infusion.

        4. Assessment of FX:C and FX:Ag levels on each day post-surgery.

        5. Assessment of the cumulative weight-adjusted doses of FACTOR X as measured by FX:C
           (IU/kg body weight) administered to each subject to maintain haemostasis.

        6. Assessment of the cumulative doses of FACTOR X as measured by FX:C (IU) administered to
           each subject to maintain haemostasis.

        7. Amount of weight-adjusted FACTOR X as measured by FX:C (IU/kg body weight) administered
           daily (day of surgery and each post-operative day) to maintain haemostasis.

    <measure>Clinical Estimation of Volume of Blood Loss During Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood loss is measured during and after surgery, the overall assessment is made after the last dose of FACTOR X.</time_frame>
    <description>As soon as possible after wound closure, the investigator estimated the volume of blood loss during surgery and made a clinical assessment against the volume of blood loss typically expected in a normal patient (i.e. one without a bleeding disorder and undergoing the same surgical procedure). The assessment may have been supported by a swab and pad count.
The clinical assessment was rated as follows:
Blood loss less than expected
Blood loss as expected
Blood loss more than expected
Blood loss excessive (defined as more than twice the pre defined amount that would be expected in a normal patient for this type of surgery)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Post Operative Bleeding Episodes (See Table Below)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of surgery till end of study</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding was assessed at least once each day by the investigator, more frequently if indicated by the severity of the operation or the subject's response. This included all bleeding episodes from the end of the surgical procedure until the subject was no longer at risk of bleeding due to surgery</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Haemoglobin From Pre-surgery Till End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hrs pre-operatively till end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's haemoglobin was measured pre operatively, within 2 hours post operatively and at the End of Treatment Assessment. Changes in the subject's haemoglobin from pre to post operatively and from post operatively to the End of Treatment Assessment were assessed, taking into account the volume of fluid infused into the subject during the intervening periods, any blood transfusions in the intervening periods, the subject's haematocrit at the same time points and the subject's pre dose serum ferritin</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Degree of Bleeding Control Rated as Excellent.</measure>
    <time_frame>During and till end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators made an overall assessment of FACTOR X in controlling bleeding at the End of Treatment Assessment. The degree of bleeding control was rated as excellent, good, poor or unassessable, in accordance with the following criteria listed below:
Excellent -Parameters were similar to those in subjects without a bleeding disorder.
Good -Parameters were inferior to those in subjects without a bleeding disorder, but no other factor X containing agents were required to restore haemostasis.
Poor - Blood loss was excessive (defined as more than twice the pre defined amount that would be expected in a subject without a bleeding disorder for this type of surgery) and/or Haemostasis was not achieved and/or Additional factor X containing agents were required to restore haemostasis.
Unassessable -Efficacy was not possible to assess, or Additional factor X containing agents (excluding blood transfusions) were required before efficacy of FACTOR X could be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incremental Recovery After Bolus Dose of FACTOR X</measure>
    <time_frame>incremental recovery was assessed at approximately 30 minutes after the pre surgery bolus</time_frame>
    <description>Incremental Recovery of FX:C after the Pre surgery Bolus Infusion The factor X increment is calculated by subtracting the pre-infusion factor X level from the post-dose value.
Incremental recovery is calculated by FX increment (IU/dL)/ FX dose (IU/kg)</description>

        <title>Clinical Estimation of Volume of Blood Loss During Surgery</title>
        <description>As soon as possible after wound closure, the investigator estimated the volume of blood loss during surgery and made a clinical assessment against the volume of blood loss typically expected in a normal patient (i.e. one without a bleeding disorder and undergoing the same surgical procedure). The assessment may have been supported by a swab and pad count.
The clinical assessment was rated as follows:
Blood loss less than expected
Blood loss as expected
Blood loss more than expected
Blood loss excessive (defined as more than twice the pre defined amount that would be expected in a normal patient for this type of surgery)</description>
        <time_frame>Blood loss is measured during and after surgery, the overall assessment is made after the last dose of FACTOR X.</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population will be defined as all surgical procedures in which subjects were treated with at least one dose of FACTOR X and have undergone surgery.</population>

FACTOR X: Presurgery loading dose- The FX level of 70%-90% should be achieved.This will be calculated based on the patients weight on day of surgery and the required rise. Initial dose should not exceed 60IU/kg.
Post surgery- FX trough levels of 50% should be achieved.
Intravenous infusion of factor X is given at a suggested rate of 10mL/min but not exceeding more than 20mL/min.</description>

Excellent -Parameters were similar to those in subjects without a bleeding disorder.
Good -Parameters were inferior to those in subjects without a bleeding disorder, but no other factor X containing agents were required to restore haemostasis.
Poor - Blood loss was excessive (defined as more than twice the pre defined amount that would be expected in a subject without a bleeding disorder for this type of surgery) and/or Haemostasis was not achieved and/or Additional factor X containing agents were required to restore haemostasis.
Unassessable -Efficacy was not possible to assess, or Additional factor X containing agents (excluding blood transfusions) were required before efficacy of FACTOR X could be assessed.</description>

FACTOR X: Presurgery loading dose- The FX level of 70%-90% should be achieved.This will be calculated based on the patients weight on day of surgery and the required rise. Initial dose should not exceed 60IU/kg.
Post surgery- FX trough levels of 50% should be achieved.
Intravenous infusion of factor X is given at a suggested rate of 10mL/min but not exceeding more than 20mL/min.</description>
