  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The team's ultimate goal is to improve health care quality and effectiveness and support
      patient-centered care. In this project, we, the investigators, will test whether providing
      patients with guideline based-recommendations regarding tobacco use, physical activity and
      mental and physical health-related quality of life (patient reported measures: PRMs) using
      health information technology increases doctor-patient discussions regarding these topics and
      results in improvements in PRMs. We will randomize physicians in a single general internal
      medicine practice. Patients seeing intervention physicians will receive guideline-based
      recommendations regarding PRMs, those seeing control physicians will not. We will compare
      differences in doctor-patient discussions regarding PRMs between the intervention and control
      groups. The successful completion of this project will provide evidence the effectiveness of
      involving patients in their care through the use guideline-based feedback.
