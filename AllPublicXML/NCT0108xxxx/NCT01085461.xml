      This will be a cross-sectional study enrolling 200 outpatients/inpatients with treatment
      resistant partial epilepsy for at least two years, receiving 1-3 AEDS.

      The study will consist of one or two visits, each lasting 1-2 hours. All subjects will
      complete Visit 1. Twenty five percent of the subjects will return for Visit 2. The study will
      assess the prevalence of depression and suicidal thoughts and the feasibility of using the
      proposed psychiatric rating scales in future epilepsy clinical trials. This study will also
      provide an estimate of the proportion of patients with epilepsy (PWE) who may be ineligible
      for future trials.

      In light of the recent issues regarding antiepileptic drugs and suicidality, The Epilepsy
      Study Consortium is proposing a pilot study. Several scales to assess suicidality and screen
      for depression and anxiety disorders will be administered to a group of epilepsy patients
      with characteristics similar to patients who are usually enrolled in epilepsy clinical
      trials. The study will assess the prevalence of depression, suicidal thoughts, and behavior
      and the feasibility of using the proposed psychiatric rating scales in future epilepsy
      clinical trials. This study will also provide an estimate of the proportion of patients with
      epilepsy who may be ineligible for future trials because they have had active suicidal
      thoughts in the last 6 months, suicidal behavior in the last 2 years or a current major
      depressive episode.
