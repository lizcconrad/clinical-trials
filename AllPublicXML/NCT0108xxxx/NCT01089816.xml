      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the MSDÂ® Influenza Test
      in detecting influenza A and influenza B in subjects presenting with influenza-like-illness
      (ILI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective study to evaluate the performance of the MSD Influenza
      Test for the detection and differentiation of influenza A (including A/H1, A/H3, and A/H5
      subtypes) and influenza B. Nasal swabs from subjects presenting at the clinical care facility
      with ILI will be collected and tested on the MSD Influenza Test. Results from the Test will
      be compared to results obtained from viral culture performed on a second nasal swab at a
      reference laboratory.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who had prior nasal wash/aspirate or nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate specimens
