    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the potential effects of estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women with
      fibromyalgia, the investigators used quantitative sensory tests before and after eight weeks
      of estrogen treatment as compared with placebo treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a condition that preferentially affects women. Sex hormones, and in
      particular estrogens, have been shown to affect pain processing and pain sensitivity, and
      estrogen deficit has been considered a potential promoting factor for fibromyalgia. However,
      the effects of estrogen treatment in patients suffering from fibromyalgia have not been
      studied. Twenty-nine postmenopausal women were randomized to either eight weeks of treatment
      with transdermal 17β-estradiol (50 ug daily) or placebo according to a double-blind protocol.
      A self-estimation of pain, a set of quantitative sensory tests measuring thresholds to
      temperature, thermal pain, cold pain and pressure pain, and a cold pressor test were
      performed at three occasions: before treatment, after eight weeks of treatment, and twenty
      weeks after cessation of treatment.
