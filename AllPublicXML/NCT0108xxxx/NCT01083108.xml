      Background:

        -  Bariatric surgery is the most effective way to achieve significant, long-term weight
           loss. It has also been shown to be an effective therapy for obese individuals with type
           2 diabetes: more than 70 percent of patients no longer need medications for diabetes
           after surgery. This resolution of diabetes is predominately caused by marked weight loss
           resulting in improved insulin sensitivity. However, the beneficial effects of bariatric
           surgery on type 2 diabetes cannot be accounted for entirely by weight loss, because many
           bariatric surgery patients have resolution of diabetes within 1 week following bariatric
           surgery, even before they lose a clinically significant amount of weight.

        -  One possible reason for the rapid resolution of diabetes after bariatric surgery .is
           that during the first week after surgery, patients can eat very little (about 300
           Calories per day). It is well known that reducing calories to this level improves
           diabetes. Another possibility is that changes in the flow of food through the intestines
           may improve diabetes. Evidence for this comes from the observation that patients after
           gastric bypass have better glucose levels than those who have gastric banding.
           Researchers are interested in determining how much of the improvement in diabetes in the
           first week after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) surgery is due to restricting
           calories, and how much is due to other factors, such as bypassing the upper part of the
           small intestine.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the change in total body insulin sensitivity after RYGBP compared to
           caloric restriction without surgery.

        -  To study possible reasons for improvements in diabetes after RYGBP.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 to 60 years of age who have a body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 and have
      type 2 diabetes.

      Design:

      - This is not a randomized study, and patients will not receive bariatric surgery as part of
      this study.

      Two groups of patients will be studied: those scheduled for RYGBP surgery and those not
      undergoing surgery.

        -  RYGBP Surgery Participants:

        -  Up to 3 weeks before surgery, participants will spend 2 nights and days at the
           Vanderbilt University Clinical Research Center or the NIH Clinical Center for testing to
           learn about how their bodies handle sugar and use energy. During the 5 days prior to
           these tests, participants will be asked to not take diabetes medications, and will check
           blood sugar at least twice a day.

        -  From 8 days before surgery, participants will begin an 800 Calorie per day liquid diet
           to prepare for surgery.

        -  After surgery and discharge, participants will be readmitted to the Clinical Research
           Center at Vanderbilt or NIH for further tests and diet monitoring. Diabetes medications
           may be adjusted or stopped altogether based on the results of the tests.

        -  Non-surgery Participants:

        -  Participants will spend 2 nights and days in the NIH Clinical Center for testing to
           learn about how their bodies handle sugar and use energy. During the 5 days prior to
           these tests, participants will be asked to not take diabetes medications, and will check
           blood sugar at least twice a day.

        -  After the tests, participants will begin an 800 Calorie per day liquid diet for 8 days.

        -  After 8 days, participants will be readmitted to the Clinical Center at NIH for 1 week
           of further tests and a 300 Calorie per day diet. Diabetes medications may be adjusted or
           stopped altogether based on the results of the tests.

      Background

      Presently it is unknown whether the rapid normalization of glucose metabolism in obese
      patients with type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery (before major weight loss occurs) is
      primarily due to acute postoperative caloric restriction or due to changes in intestinal
      effects on insulin secretion and sensitivity. We speculate that bypassing the stomach and
      proximal small intestine affects glucose metabolism beyond simple caloric restriction, and
      that the mechanisms are related to changes in hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity, changes
      in vagal afferent signals, and changes in incretins and other gut hormones.

      Aim

      To compare the effects of pure caloric restriction with caloric restriction early after
      bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, RYGBP) in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to
      investigate the mechanisms that explain the observed difference in glucose metabolism

      Methods

      In patients with type 2 diabetes we will study the short-term changes in glucose metabolism,
      insulin sensitivity and gut hormone levels using a parallel group design. The non-surgical
      group will be studied before and after receiving a hypocaloric diet for 6 days mimicking the
      typical postoperative diet. The surgical group will be studied before and 6 days after
      bariatric surgery. The primary outcome will be the change in total body insulin sensitivity
      attributable to caloric restriction alone versus caloric restriction after RYGBP.
      Non-surgical subjects studied at NIH may enter an optional long-term weight loss phase.
