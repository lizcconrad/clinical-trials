    <textblock>
      TVI-Brain-1 is an experimental treatment that takes advantage of the fact that your body can
      produce immune cells, called 'killer' white blood cells that have the ability to kill large
      numbers of the cancer cells that are present in your body. TVI-Brain-1 is designed to
      generate large numbers of those 'killer' white blood cells and to deliver those cells into
      your body so that they can kill your cancer cells.

      TVI-Brain-1 involves several steps. First, the patient's cancer will be surgically removed to
      provide cells for the vaccine. Second, the patient will be vaccinated twice with those cells
      and GM-CSF. Third, the patient's blood will be filtered for white cells which will then be
      cultured and stimulated to reach a higher (killer) activity level. Fourth, the activated
      white blood cells will be infused into the patient's bloodstream so that they will be able to
      attack the cancer. Finally, the entire process starting with vaccination will be repeated,
      for a total of two rounds of therapy.

    <description>To determine the relative toxicity (safety) of vaccinating recurrent grade IV glioma patients four times with live, attenuated cancer cells combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Toxicity will be assessed following delivery of each treatment component.</description>

    <measure>Immunogenicity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The potency of the modified vaccination regimen will be assessed by measuring immune responses following each vaccination. The study is designed to determine whether vaccinating recurrent grade IV glioma subjects four times with attenuated cancer cells stimulates more powerful immune responses than vaccinating subjects twice. Clinical effects also will be measured to determine whether the treatment causes the cancer to regress.</description>
