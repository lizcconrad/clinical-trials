    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age

          2. Patients who are male or non-pregnant female (females of child bearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment into the study)

          3. Patient has signed an Ethics Committee approved Informed Consent Form

          4. Patient is considered by the treating physician to be a candidate for elective open
             surgical repair of the AAA (i.e., category I, II, or III per American Society of
             Anesthesiology (ASA) classification; refer to Appendix III: ASA Classification
             System). ASA category IV patients may be enrolled provided their life expectancy is
             greater than 1 year.

          5. Patient has an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that meets at least one of the
             following:

               1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt;5.0 cm in diameter,

               2. Aneurysm that has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6 months,

               3. Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds 1.5 times the transverse dimension of an
                  adjacent normal aortic segment.

          6. Patient has a patent iliac or femoral arteries that allow endovascular access with the
             TriVascular Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System.

          7. Patient has a suitable non-aneurysmal proximal aortic neck length of ≥ 7 mm inferior
             to the most distal renal artery ostium.

          8. Patient has a suitable non-aneurysmal distal iliac artery length (seal zone) of ≥ 10
             mm. The resultant repair should preserve patency in at least one hypogastric artery.

          9. Patient has a suitable non-aneurysmal proximal aortic neck luminal diameter between 16
             and 30 mm.

         10. Patient has a suitable non-aneurysmal distal iliac luminal diameter between 8 and 20
             mm.

         11. Patient meets the following anatomic criteria: the distance from the most distal renal
             artery to most superior internal iliac artery measurement is at least 13 cm.

         12. Patient has juxtarenal aortic neck angulation ≤ 60º if proximal neck is ≥ 10 mm and ≤
             45 if proximal neck is &lt;10 mm.

         13. Patient must be able and willing to comply with all required follow-up exams.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a dissecting aneurysm.

          2. Patient has an acutely ruptured aneurysm.

          3. Patient has an acute vascular injury.

          4. Patient has need for emergent surgery.

          5. Patient has a known thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.

          6. Patient has a mycotic aneurysm or has an active systemic infection..

          7. Patient has unstable angina (defined as angina with a progressive increase in
             symptoms, new onset at rest or nocturnal angina, or onset of prolonged angina)

          8. Patient has had a myocardial infarction (MI) and/or stroke (CVA) within the past 6
             months.

          9. Patient has a major surgical or interventional procedure planned ≤ 30 days of the AAA
             repair.

         10. Patient has history of connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan's or Ehler's-Danlos
             syndrome).

         11. Patient has history of bleeding disorders or refuses blood transfusions.

         12. Patient has dialysis dependent renal failure or baseline serum creatinine level &gt;2.0
             mg/dl.

         13. Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulation or
             contrast media that is not amenable to pre-treatment.

         14. Patient has a known allergy or intolerance to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),
             PEG-based polymers, fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) or nitinol.

         15. Patient has a body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta

         16. Patient has a limited life expectancy of less than 1 year

         17. Patient is currently participating in an investigational device or drug clinical
             trial.

         18. Patient has other medical, social or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, preclude them from receiving the pre-treatment, required treatment,
             and post-treatment procedures and evaluations.
