  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for women with locally advanced cervical
      cancer. The available data support a 30 to 50% reduction in the risk of death from cervical
      cancer for women with locally advanced disease undergoing radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy compared to RT alone. Despite the fact that this is currently
      the best treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, 5-year overall survival is still only
      52%.

      The fully human, agonist monoclonal antibody mapatumumab binds to the Tumor necrosis
      factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand Receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1, DR4) and induces cytotoxicity
      in multiple tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo. In multiple phase I and phase II studies,
      mapatumumab appeared to be safe both as single agent and in combination with chemotherapy,
      including cisplatin.

      In cervical cancer cell lines, mapatumumab induced apoptosis in 51% of the cells. Mapatumumab
      in combination with irradiation increased apoptosis to 83%.

      In this phase 1b/2 study, the investigators will evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of mapatumumab in combination with cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with
      locally advanced cervical cancer.

    <description>Radiotherapy: a total dose of 45 Gy will be given in fractions of 1.8 Gy, five fractions per week (days 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40), by external beam irradiation by photon beam of at least 6 MV. After completing the five weeks of external beam irradiation, evaluation will take place to determine whether the boost can be given by brachytherapy. If brachytherapy is not feasible, the boost will be given by external beam irradiation to a total dose of 70.2 Gy in fractions of 1.8 Gy.</description>
