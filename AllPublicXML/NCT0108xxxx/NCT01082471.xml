      To compare the incidence and severity of nausea in the study treatment groups, during the
      18-hour period starting 6 hours after titration to pain relief; following confirmation of the
      assumption of non-inferiority between the two groups of pain relief over the 24 hour
      post-operative period. Pain relief and nausea will be determined by measuring the areas under
      the curves of pain intensity and nausea verbal rating scale scores.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients undergoing any of the following elective surgical procedures
             that, in the Investigator's opinion, would have required the use of post-operative
             patient controlled analgesia for a minimum of 24 hours:

          -  Abdominal hysterectomy with the exception of laparoscopic procedures.

          -  Bowel / gastrointestinal (GI) surgery

          -  Major urological surgery

          -  Aged ≥ 18 years

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades I to III

          -  If female, the patient had to be post-menopausal (last menstruation &gt; 1 year
             previously), or surgically sterile (e.g. full hysterectomy or tubal ligation). If
             neither of these was the case, she had to use adequate contraception (i.e. hormonal
             contraceptive, intrauterine device (IUD), or a double barrier method) and to have a
             negative urine pregnancy test during the 24-hours prior to surgery.

          -  Provide written informed consent to participate in the trial prior to surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient was pregnant or lactating.

          -  Had a known sensitivity to morphine or other opiates, or a medical condition such that
             opiates were contraindicated.

          -  Had a known sensitivity to paracetamol, or a medical condition such that paracetamol
             was contraindicated.

          -  Had received any investigational drug within the 90 days prior to the start of the
             study, or was scheduled to receive one during the study period.

          -  Had been involved in any previous M6G study.

          -  Had a documented history or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse within the year
             prior to screening.

          -  Had clinically significant findings on pre-treatment evaluations (e.g. laboratory
             results, electrocardiograms, medical history, physical examination) that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, should have excluded them from the study.

          -  Had a concurrent disorder that resulted in excessive pain that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, would have interfered with the pain assessments during the study (e.g.severe
             rheumatoid arthritis, muscle dystrophy or neuropathic pain).

          -  Had a blood clotting disorder or other blood dyscrasias.

          -  Had requested the use of epidural or intrathecal anaesthesia techniques.

          -  Required the use of a local anaesthetic block and/or infiltration of wound sites.

          -  Required the concomitant use of opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             drugs(NSAIDs) during the study due to an existing concurrent condition.

          -  Had a history of Left Ventricular Failure or compromised cardiovascular function,
             defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) level 3.

          -  Had a history of severe renal impairment or a creatinine level &gt; 3 times the upper
             limit of normal.

          -  Was having surgery that would have prevented the use of oral or rectal paracetamol(iv
             administration of paracetamol was not allowed).

          -  Was expected to require prolonged ventilation after surgery.

          -  Was opioid tolerant or had a history of chronic opioid use.

          -  Had cognitive impairment that would, in the Investigator's opinion, have precluded
             participation or compliance with protocol defined procedures (i.e. use of PCA).
