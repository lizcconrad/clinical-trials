      Rationale:

      In march 2009 the Dutch Health Council advised to introduce general infant hepatitis B (HBV)
      vaccination in the Dutch national immunization program (NIP) {Gezondheidsraad 2009 #16914}.
      To reach the anticipated health benefits earlier, a catch-up vaccination in pre-adolescents
      should complement the program, for girls preferably combined with human papillomavirus (HPV)
      vaccination at the age of 12 years. Although the rationale is clear, particular aspects of
      combining HPV and HBV vaccination deserve further attention, especially as it has been shown
      that combining HPV and HBV vaccination results in reduced HBV immunogenicity/seroresponses
      {Wheeler, Bautista, et al. 2008 #17284}{Pedersen 2009 #16684}. The reason for this
      interference is unknown, but might be due to concomitant use of different antigens and/or
      adjuvants, possibly skewing immunity in opposite directions. Despite proven immunostimulatory
      effects, the use of (new) adjuvants has raised safety concern among the general public as
      well {Israeli, Agmon-Levin, et al. 2009 #16924}.

      Objective, Study design and Study population:

      In view of the observations and concerns mentioned above, further investigation into
      interference of HPV and HBV vaccination and adjuvant use is justified. In this context RIVM
      propose to study single vs simultaneous HBV and HPV vaccination in 11-12-year-old girls while
      monitoring antigen-related and antigen-unrelated immunological parameters. The anticipated
      results will elucidate the extent of interference between simultaneous HPV and HBV
      vaccination in the target group, and guide the choice for a HBV vaccine and schedule when the
      HBV catch-up program is indeed introduced. Furthermore, specific immunological trends post
      single and combined HPV and HBV vaccination will be elucidated, increasing the investigators
      comprehension of adjuvant use.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to recent strategic policy developments in the national vaccination program it is uncertain
    preadolescent girls will receive the HBV vaccin.
