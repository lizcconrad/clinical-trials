    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of medical personnel in their ability
      to predict the likelihood of non-intensive care (ICU), ward patients to clinically
      deteriorate (defined as a cardiac arrest, unplanned ICU transfer, or unexpected death)via the
      use of a clinical judgement-based tool designed for this study, Patient Acuity Rating (PAR),
      to predict short-term clinical deterioration. We will compare the ability of this tool to
      predict clinical deterioration compared to accepted physiology-based tools and tools
      combining judgment and physiology as well as other markers of deterioration such as physician
      order changes. We will compare the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of these
      combined models to the predictive models including only physiology or clinical judgment. We
      will assess the correlation between specific physician orders and patient deterioration to
      determine whether specific clinical activities, such as emergently obtained radiology exams,
      predict impending deterioration. We hypothesize that PAR will be a useful tool for predicting
      clinical deterioration across the institution and that it will have a higher average accuracy
      for predicting clinical deterioration in non-ICU inpatients within 24 hours than the
      physiology-based tools alone. We further hypothesize that a combined metric which includes
      both the PAR and the individual physiologic components that comprise physiologic tools will
      not significantly improve prediction over the PAR alone. We further propose to use PAR to
      prospectively risk stratify patients for preemptive evaluation by the Rapid Response Team. We
      hypothesize that intervening on high risk patients by preemptively activating the hospital's
      Rapid Response Team (to assess and treat patients as needed) will decrease cardiac arrest
      rates and mortality.

    <description>Non-ICU ward inpatients will be randomized on admission to an RRT surveillance group or standard of care. Daily risk prediction scores will be collected for all non-ICU inpatients. Those with high scores, who have been randomized to the surveillance arm, will be included on a list of patients, updated daily, that the Rapid Response Team will receive, with instructions to evaluate and intervene, if required, without waiting for formal activation by the usual channels. Outcomes for these patients will be compared to those with comparable risk scores who were randomized to the control group.</description>
