  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Green tea consumption could lower the risk of type II diabetes, as suggested by
      epidemiological studies. There is also evidence from intervention studies that green tea can
      decrease blood glucose levels and contribute to weight loss.

      The aim with this study is therefore to examine the postprandial effects of green tea on
      glycemic index, insulin levels and satiety in healthy individuals after the consumption of a
      meal.

      The study was conducted on 14 healthy volunteers, with a crossover design. Participants were
      randomized to either green tea or water. This was consumed together with a breakfast
      consisting of white bread. Blood samples were drawn at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.
      Participants completed two different satiety scores at the same time intervals.
