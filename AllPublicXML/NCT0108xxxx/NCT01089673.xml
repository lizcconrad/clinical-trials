    <textblock>
      A retrospective molecular diagnostic review on wound care outcomes between two time periods.
      The time periods include June, July, August of 2008 and June, July, August of 2009. The
      retrospective review would analyze the days of healing during those two timeframes, upon the
      introduction of molecular diagnostic testing.
