    <textblock>
      During the last years, the investigators were the witness to the increase of a old emerging
      pest due to bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) in the world. Insecticides resistances apparitions
      and internationals transports increases seem to be the reasons of the pest. Cimex lectularius
      as vector of parasites, bacteria or virus was often suggested although not much observation
      are recently investigated in France. This study intends to examine the vectorial ability and
      the direct pathogenicity of Cimex lectularius.
