      Primary outcome measure:

        -  Analyze the efficacy (in order to evaluate the response) of Bortezomib/Dexamethasone
           treatment

      Secondary outcome measures:

        -  Study the speed of response and the response rate (M component in serum and urine
           protein) after each bortezomib/dexamethasone cycle

        -  Compare the efficacy of the bortezomib/dexamethasone therapy against the therapy without
           bortezomib

        -  Reversibility of renal failure

        -  Predictive value in the light chain determination for response and reversibility of
           renal failure

        -  Early morbidity (&lt; 2 months)

        -  Progression-free survival

        -  Overall survival

      The safety outcome consists in:

        -  Determining the safety and tolerance of VELCADE/Dexamethasone, according to the toxicity
           criteria of clinical and laboratory events

      60 patients, 18 years or older, diagnosed with newly symptomatic multiple myeloma (standard
      diagnosis criteria) and renal failure, previously untreated with chemotherapy, will be
      included.

      It is an multi centric, national and open study designed in order to determine efficacy of
      the combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients with renal
      failure.

      The trial consists of two parts: pre-treatment and treatment. Pre- treatment phase: include
      the enrolment visit in order to determine that the patient is eligible to participate in a
      study. The patient will be given the Informed Consent Form in order to participate in the
      study, and detailed information about the treatment, its benefits and risks.

      Treatment phase: include the treatment which consist of, at the most, 12 cycles of Velcade
      and Dexamethasone (induction and extension). During these periods, patients will come to the
      centre for the study visits to be evaluated, the days they will receive Velcade® of each
      cycle.

      Once the clinical trial has finished, patients will be monitored during short and long-term
      periods where progression free survival and overall survival will be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must, according with investigator criteria, be able to comply with all the
             protocol requirements

          -  The patient or legal representative must sign voluntarily the informed consent before
             the performance of any study related procedure, not part of usual medical care, with
             the knowledge that can leave the study the moment he/she wants, without prejudice to
             later medical care

          -  18 years and older

                  urine light-chain excretion of ≥ 200 mg/24 hours
