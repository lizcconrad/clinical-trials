  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      (how the drug is absorbed in the body, how it is distributed within the body and it is
      removed from the body over time) of single doses of JNJ-39758979 in healthy Japanese
      volunteers and multiple doses of JNJ-39758979 in healthy Japanese and Caucasian volunteers.

      This study will assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of JNJ-39758979 or placebo (which
      looks like the drug being studied but has no active ingredients) in healthy volunteers. This
      study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by
      chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor volunteer knows the identity of the assigned
      drug) study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single doses of
      JNJ-39758979 and placebo in 36 healthy Japanese male volunteers. Part 2 is a randomized,
      double-blind study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple
      doses of JNJ-39758979 and placebo in 24 healthy Japanese males and 24 healthy Caucasian
      males. For Part 1, the participation period is a maximum of 56 days, including a screening
      visit, a 7-day in-clinic period and two follow-up visits. For Part 2, the participation
      period is a maximum of 202 days, including a screening visit, a 17-day in-clinic period and
      two follow-up visits. For both parts of the study, safety evaluations, which will include ECG
      (a cardiac function test), vital signs and monitoring of side-effects will be performed.
      Additionally, blood and urine samples will be collected for evaluation. Part 1: volunteers
      will receive a single oral (by mouth) dose of JNJ-39758979 (50, 100, 300, or 600mg) or
      placebo; Part 2: volunteers will receive an oral dose of JNJ-39758979 (300 mg) or placebo
      once a day for 14 days.
