    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, non-interventional post-marketing surveillance study is to
      obtain data on safety and efficacy of Mirena in treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding
      (Menorrhagia) under daily-life treatment conditions.For each patient, an initial visit and
      one to three follow-up visits after about 3, 6 and 12 months will be documented by the
      treating physician on the case report form. Observations include the patient's demographic
      parameters (date of birth, height, weight, race and smoking habits), previous contraceptives
      and menorrhagia treatment, gynaecological history, baseline menstruation, result of
      insertion, concomitant medications and diseases as well as menorrhagia symptoms. Overall
      treatment success will be evaluated at the end of treatment including number of weeks until
      improvement and reduction of menstrual bleeding with respect to duration and severity, and
      patient's satisfaction.

      The &quot;MiCo - Mirena or conventional medical treatment for menorrhagia&quot; study consist of two
      parts, MiCo Asia-Pacific and MiCo MA0901 (Rest of World).

      Data from both parts will be analysed in separate pools as well as in a global pool. The
      trial alias are IMPACT Nos. 14697 (NCT00864136), 14536.
