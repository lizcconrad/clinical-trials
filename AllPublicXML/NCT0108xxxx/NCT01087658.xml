      Primary Objective:

      To assess the benefit of glutamine when added to calcium-magnesium on the occurrence of grade
      2, 3 and 4 peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) related to oxaliplatin with the National
      Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI-CTCAE) scale taking into
      account the time from start of oxaliplatin at which the first event occurred.

      Secondary Objective:

      To determine cumulative dose of oxaliplatin and time when the first occurrence of grade 2, 3
      or 4 PSN.

      To determine the incidence of dose-reductions, dose-delays and discontinuations of
      oxaliplatin due to PSN grade 3 or 4.

      To assess effects of glutamine when added to calcium-magnesium on patients-reported outcomes
      using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity 12
      items questionnaire (FACT/GOG NTX-12) subscale.

      To evaluate the incidence of diarrhea. To determine Progression Free Survival (PFS) in
      metastatic patients.
