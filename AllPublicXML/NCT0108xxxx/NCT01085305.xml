  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a type of parent-based intervention,
      Parent-Child Interaction Therapy will lower symptoms of behavior problems in young children
      more than treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behaviour problems, i.e. symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder
      (CD) are among the prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and one of the leading causes
      of help-seeking for mental health problems in children. There are several efficacious
      treatments for such problems in young children. However, most of these require that parents
      meet in groups. This is not always feasible. It is therefore a need to develop treatments
      that can deal with parents and families individually. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)
      is such an individually based treatment. Efficacy studies indicate symptom reduction greater
      that in treatment as usual (TAU). However, there is a need to study its effectiveness in
      ordinary clinical practise. This trial will study its effect in ordinary psychiatric clinics
      in the middle of Norway and compare it to the regular treatment (TAU) provided to young
      children with behavior problems in these clinics.

    <description>Parents will be trained in interaction with their children in ways which foster non-hostility and cooperation in their children. By means of an ear-plug they will receive instruction on how to play and set limits for their child from their therapist who watches the interaction through a one-way mirror. Treatment is given until the parent masters these skill, which commonly takes 15-20 session of 1 hour.</description>
