      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of hospitalization with acute liver
      failure among patients with type 2 diabetes who are new users of Saxagliptin and those who
      are new users of other oral antidiabetic drugs.

        This study will be carried out using databases containing administrative claims data
        (HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and Medicare in the U.S.) and electronic
        medical records (General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and The Health Improvement
        Network (THIN) in the UK). The US population includes patients from health plans in the
        northeast, southeastern, mid-Atlantic, central, mid-western, and western regions (HIRD) as
        well as US citizens 65 years of age and older (Medicare). The UK population includes
        patients seeking medical care from general practitioners (GPRD and THIN)
