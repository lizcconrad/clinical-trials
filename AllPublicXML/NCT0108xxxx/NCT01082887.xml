    <description>After verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and after obtaining informed consent from the patients, a tumor sample will be taken for sterile production of TIL. Patients will receive intra-tumoral injections of Ad-INFg every 15 days from J-15 to M2, then every month from M3 to M11 or until disease progression. The Ad-INFg will be administered by intra-tumoral injection at a dose of 5x1010 vp (viral particles) per lesion. A maximum of 6 lesions will be treated simultaneously. They will also receive two infusion of TIL at M0 (Cycle 1) and M1 (Cycle 2) by intravenous infusion lasting 30 to 65 minutes followed by subcutaneous injections of IL2 from J1 to J5 and from J8 to J12 of each cycle.An evaluation of injected and not injected tumoral lesions including photographs will be realised at the pre-inclusion visit, J-15, M0 and every month until M12.</description>
