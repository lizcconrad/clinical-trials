  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to learn about work productivity after treatment of a migraine headache with
      your usual migraine medication as compared to your work productivity after treatment with
      Treximet.

      During this research subjects will take Treximet to treat 3 workday migraine attacks. For a
      second part of the research subjects will take their usual prescribed medication for 3
      workday migraine attacks. The subjects will complete questionnaires after treating each
      migraine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A subject who is identified for study participation will participate in the screening and
      enrollment visit which determines the migraine treatment arm to which the subject will be
      randomized first. The subject will have a physical exam, vital signs recorded, health and
      medication questions asked, questionnaires completed and a headache diary explained and
      dispensed to the subject. If the subject is randomized to the Treximet treatment arm during
      the first part of the study, Treximet will be dispensed for use in treating workday
      migraines.

      The subject will call the study coordinator after treating a workday migraine and will report
      information about the migraine to the coordinator. When the subject has treated and reported
      on 3 migraines, the interim visit will be scheduled. The subject will bring the study diary
      and Treximet containers (if this was the arm the subject completed)to this visit. The subject
      will be asked about adverse events and medication changes as well as confirmation and review
      of the completed questionnaires and diaries from the prior weeks of study participation. The
      subject will be given new diaries and questionnaires (and Treximet to use if usual prescribed
      triptan was the treatment in the first arm) and repeat the activities to treat 3 more workday
      migraines.

      When the subject has notified the study coordinator about treating the 3rd workday migraine
      in this part of the study, the subject will be scheduled for the final study visit. The
      subject will bring the completed migraine diaries, completed questionnaires (and Treximet
      bottles if used during this arm) to the study visit. The subject will have the diaries and
      questionnaires reviewed, be asked about adverse events and medication changes and complete
      the final study questionnaires at this visit.

    <intervention_model_description>This was a randomized, open-label, 6-attack (3-attacks per arm) crossover design in which subjects were randomized to threat their first 3 workplace migraines with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium or with their usual triptan monotherapy before treating their subsequent 3 workplace migraines with the opposite medication.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was lost productivity (workplace productivity + non-workplace activity time) as measured by a variant of the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale (WPAI) at 6 months. The primary efficacy dataset included the 37 patients that completed both phases of the study and uses the last observed headache. The unit of analysis is hours lost. The higher the score the greater impact on productivity. The range depends on the length of the attack, but in the sample among all observed attacks, lost work productivity ranged from 0-10.5 hours, while lost non-workplace activity time ranged from 0 to 8.95 hours. The total lost productivity is the sum of lost work productivity and lost non-workplace activity time.</description>

    <description>The Migraine-ACT is a 4-item scale with yes/no responses. A score of 3 or more is considered favorable. The primary efficacy dataset included the 37 patients that completed both phases of the study and uses the last observed headache. The Migraine-ACT is reported as a binary measure (3 or more positive responses). The outcome presented included the percentage with a score of 3 or more, and the Odds ratio comparing the two treatments.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome measure was lost productivity (workplace productivity + non-workplace activity time) as measured by a variant of the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale (WPAI) at 6 months. The primary efficacy dataset included the 37 patients that completed both phases of the study and uses the last observed headache. The unit of analysis is hours lost. The higher the score the greater impact on productivity. The range depends on the length of the attack, but in the sample among all observed attacks, lost work productivity ranged from 0-10.5 hours, while lost non-workplace activity time ranged from 0 to 8.95 hours. The total lost productivity is the sum of lost work productivity and lost non-workplace activity time.</description>

          <title>Favorable Response on Migraine-ACT</title>
          <description>The Migraine-ACT is a 4-item scale with yes/no responses. A score of 3 or more is considered favorable. The primary efficacy dataset included the 37 patients that completed both phases of the study and uses the last observed headache. The Migraine-ACT is reported as a binary measure (3 or more positive responses). The outcome presented included the percentage with a score of 3 or more, and the Odds ratio comparing the two treatments.</description>

      <desc>Adverse events were noted from the date of the first study visit until the end of study visit was completed, grouped by the treatment medication in use. There were no serious AEs. 45 patients entered the Triptan arm and 45 patients entered the Treximet arm. 12 patients failed to report AE status and were considered to be free from AEs in the calculations below.</desc>

          <description>Subjects will be randomized to either of two arms at enrollment in this study. They may start with their usual prescribed triptan or Treximet, depending on the randomization schedule. To account for the correlation from patients acting as their own controls in this crossover design, a standard deviation of the difference equal to 2.5 is assumed.
