  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omacor®/Lovaza® is an effective, and very safe mix of PO-3A, and the drug is currently
      approved by the Federal authorities for the drug management of post-infarction patients with
      high blood triglycerides. Given the growing length of CAD progression, it is pertinent that
      many more patients will yield extra benefit from Lovaza® on top of aggressive antiplatelet
      regimens and statin due to severity of their vascular disease. Therefore, mild antiplatelet
      properties of PO-3A will be a highly desirable and attractive commodity of this medication.

      The investigators believe that Omacor®/Lovaza® is ideally positioned for the chronic
      management of CAD as a safe, efficient, and &quot;gentle&quot; agent with no harmful interactions with
      statins or aspirin.

      The investigators hypothesize that addition of Omacor may add mild antiplatelet protection
      for CAD patients.

      The study objectives are:

        -  To assess the ex vivo effects of Omacor® on platelet function in patients with coronary
           artery disease (CAD).

        -  To compare ex vivo platelet-related effects after 7 and 14 days of therapy with Omacor
           and statin combination versus statin alone in patients with chronic stable coronary
           heart disease.

        -  To establish the relation of changes in platelet activity (if any) with the lipid
           profile to prove an additional benefit of Omacor® on top of statin and aspirin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In terms of incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and economic costs, coronary artery disease
      represents a number 1 public health concern. Omacor®/Lovaza® is an effective, and very safe
      mix of PO-3A, and the drug is currently approved by the Federal authorities for the drug
      management of post-infarction patients with high blood triglycerides. Despite significant
      progress in the prevention and treatment of vascular disease in the Western World in the past
      two decades, national statistics indicate that the incidence and prevalence of heart disease
      has been increasing steadily. Given the growing length of CAD progression, it is pertinent
      that many more patients will yield extra benefit from Lovaza® on top of aggressive
      antiplatelet regimens and statin due to severity of their vascular disease. Therefore, mild
      antiplatelet properties of PO-3A will be a highly desirable and attractive commodity of this
      medication.

      We believe that Omacor®/Lovaza® is ideally positioned for the chronic management of CAD as a
      safe, efficient, and &quot;gentle&quot; agent with no harmful interactions with statins or aspirin.
      Also considering low clinical incidence of aspirin-induced interactions with other classes of
      drugs, Lovaza® may fit nicely into a standard cocktail for diabetes, hypertension,
      depression, arrhythmias, and heart failure management of CAD patients, which will expand the
      drug utilization. However, platelet-related effects of Lovaza® on top of aspirin and statin
      in patients with stable coronary disease are not known, but may be important due to the high
      incidence of aspirin resistance and heavy burden of thrombin activation in such patients. We
      have a large pool of patients with documented CAD (300-350/annum), and we will be able to
      enroll relatively large amount of quality patients fast.

        Serial assessments of platelet characteristics from 10 patients in each of the 3 study
        groups at 2 time points for the total of 60 platelet samples. First, patients with stable
        coronary disease will be identified, telephone interviews will be conducted, and screening
        visits scheduled to those who qualify. We expect to triage 50 patients who then will be
        examined, and biochemistry markers tested. Patients will be allocated to one of three
        treatment arms based on randomization. Enrollment will continue until all 3 cells will be
        filled (n=10 each).
