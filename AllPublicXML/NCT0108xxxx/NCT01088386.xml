      The goal of the Zyprexa Relprevv Patient Care Program is to mitigate the risk of negative
      outcomes associated with Zyprexa Relprevv post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS)
      by:

        1. Ensuring Zyprexa Relprevv is prescribed only by certified prescribers, dispensed only by
           certified dispensers, and dispensed for use only in certified healthcare facilities with
           ready access to emergency response services, and dispensed for use only with
           documentation of safe use conditions;

        2. Informing health care providers and patients about the risks and the need for continuous
           observation of patients for at least 3 hours in certified healthcare facilities; and

        3. Establishing long-term safety and safe use of Zyprexa Relprevv through periodic
           monitoring for the risk of PDSS events and by enrolling all patients who receive Zyprexa
           Relprevv in the Zyprexa Relprevv Patient Care Program registry.
