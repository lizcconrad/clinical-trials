  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) at or before the age of 50 experience more distress
      and poorer quality of life than women diagnosed later in life. Although adequate spousal
      support is a protective factor for women with BC, spouses are often unprepared to handle the
      myriad practical and emotional demands posed by the illness. Furthermore, despite the growing
      number of recommendations for couple interventions in relation to BC, traditional counselling
      approaches may fail to meet the needs of young couples who have unique concerns and tight
      constraints on their time. The proposed project addresses the void in the psycho-social
      support available to young couples via an innovative, online psychoeducational intervention
      tailored specifically to their needs.

      Couplelinks.ca is a custom-designed website offering a professionally facilitated,
      couple-centred intervention that entails informational, experiential, and interactive
      components. Six Dyadic Learning Modules (DLM) form the core of the program and are undertaken
      on a weekly basis.

      A funded pilot study examining the feasibility and benefit of Couplelinks.ca utilized a
      non-randomized, pre-post test design to assess the process and outcomes of the intervention.
      Qualitative feedback also informed the evaluation. Preliminary findings were promising and
      provided justification for further evaluation of the program's effectiveness.

      The current study is the next logical step: a larger-scale Phase III study to determine
      whether this BC-specific, relationship-enhancement program leads to improved relationship and
      psychological outcomes for young couples affected by BC. It is a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) comparing level of distress and dyadic adjustment in couples who have participated in
      the Couplelinks.ca educational program to those who have not participated and were instead
      put on a wait-list for participation.
