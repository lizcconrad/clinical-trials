  <brief_title>This Study Will Investigate How Food and Age Effect the Way the Body Handles the AZD5069 Drug Given as a Oral Dose</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase I, Two-part Study to Investigate the Effects of Food on the PK, Safety and Tolerability of a Single Oral Dose of AZD5069 (120 mg) in Healthy Adult Volunteers (Part A) and to Compare the PK of AZD5069 in Adult and Elderly Healthy Volunteers (Part B)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD5069 is a new drug being tested for the possible treatment of people with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      This is not the first time that AZD5069 will be administered to humans in clinical trials. We
      are conducting this study to determine whether AZD5069 is safe and well tolerated by healthy
      males and females in fed and fasted states. We will compare the way the body handles this
      drug in the fed and fasted states, in subjects in the age group of 18 to 65 years. We will
      compare the way the body handles this drug between the age groups of 18 to 65 years and above
      65 years. We will also be studying how quickly AZD5069 is absorbed into and cleared by the
      body.
