      Nationwide cluster-randomised trial of extending the NHS breast screening age range in
      England

  <detailed_description>

      In 1988, the national Breast Screening Programme (BSP) began offering women aged 50-64 years
      triennial mammographic screening and full national coverage was achieved by the mid-1990s.

      In 2003, the age range for triennial screening was extended from 50-64 to 50-70 years;
      proposals from committees in the Department of Health to randomise this age extension and
      thereby to obtain reliable information on both the risks and benefits of additional screening
      at ages 65-70 were not adopted.

      Currently, 80 breast screening units cover all of England, each responsible for a defined
      area, and each year they invite about 2.8 million women aged 50-70, with 2.0 million
      accepting. The BSP sets standards for the screening units and monitors performance through
      its national quality assurance network.

      In 2007, the Prime Minister announced plans for eventual extension to the range 47-73 years.
      This offered another opportunity to obtain reliable evidence about the effects of extending
      the age range of triennial screening. Hence, a trial of this age extension has begun, in
      which only half are offered extra screening, with the effects monitored through routinely
      collected NHS statistics.

      Following a 2009-10 pilot study of the acceptability of cluster-randomisation of additional
      screening at ages 47-49 and 71-73 in 5 breast screening units, the AgeX trial extended
      recruitment to about five-sixths of the breast screening clinics in England, and this
      cluster-randomisation continues.

      In 2011, the Government deferred the earliest possible date when screening would be extended
      to all women aged 47-73. Later, Public Health England (PHE, which is responsible for
      government screening programmes) stated that final decisions about extension of the age range
      would await the emergence of reliable evidence of its effects. The AgeX trial will eventually
      provide this.

      In 2012, an independent panel set up by the Department of Health and the charity Cancer
      Research UK reported &quot;The UK breast screening programmes [at ages 50-70] confer significant
      benefit and should continue…. The impact of breast screening outside the ages 50-69 years is
      very uncertain. The Panel supports the principle of the ongoing trial in the UK [AgeX] for
      randomising women under age 50 and above age 70 to be invited for breast screening&quot;.

      Meanwhile, as female life expectancy is increasing, interest has grown in the possible
      advantages of continuing to screen women not just in their early 70s but throughout their
      70s. The advantages and the disadvantages of continuing triennial screening after age 70
      would be seen more clearly in a trial of 2 or 3 additional invitations (covering ages 71-76
      or 71-79) than in a trial of just one.

      In 2013 the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer in Older Women (APPG) said &quot;Women
      are not routinely invited for breast screening past the age of 70 … the current 'age
      extension trial' [of screening past age 70] … should be extended past 73 to 76, and, if
      appropriate … further extended&quot;. In a separate report in 2015 the APPG reiterated this
      conclusion.

      Although AgeX began as a trial of additional screening at ages 47-49 and at ages 71-73, it
      has therefore become a trial in which the older women allocated additional screening can,
      where resources are available, continue be invited triennially at ages 71-76 or at ages
      71-79, thereby assessing the effects of continuing triennial screening for several years
      after age 70.
