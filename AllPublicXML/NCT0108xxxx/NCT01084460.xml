    <textblock>
      Gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) less than 2 cm are usually followed up
      conservatively. However, little is known about the natural course of small GISTs. The goal of
      this study was to evaluate the clinical course of the small EUS-suspected gastric GISTs and
      to determine the size predicting subsequent progression with increased malignant potential.

        This was a retrospective study. We reviewed 256 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of
        suspected gastric GISTs by EUS, from January 1997 to December 2008 at the National Taiwan
        University Hospital, Yuan's General Hospital and En Chu Kong Hospital.
