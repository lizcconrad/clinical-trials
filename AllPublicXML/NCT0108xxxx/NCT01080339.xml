      Substudy examining cardiovascular and metabolic risk factor change in children at high risk
      for future atherosclerosis who are enrolled in a pilot intervention using novel gaming and
      exercise activities to increase physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is increasingly common and is predictive of adult type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent pediatric studies suggest exercise reduces
      cardiometabolic risk factors. Despite evidence of its benefits, exercise training prescribed
      by pediatricians is traditionally vague, developmentally inappropriate, and/or fraught with
      psychological, financial and practical barriers. There has been recent interest in the use of
      interactive technologies, also termed &quot;exer-gaming&quot; as a way to translate known positive
      benefits of exercise into increased physical activity in youth. Initial adult studies
      demonstrate benefits, yet there are few studies of exer-gaming involving children at
      increased CVD risk. This project involves a partnership between Children's Hospital Boston
      and the GoKids Boston Youth Fitness Research and Training Center at UMass Boston, featuring
      an interdisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians from pediatric cardiology,
      prevention, nursing, exercise physiology, and behavior change. Participants are eligible for
      this substudy based on enrollment in a pilot project evaluating the effects of a
      state-of-the-art exercise training facility incorporating the latest technology-based
      exercise games (&quot;exer-games&quot;) in Boston Public School elementary children. Effects on CVD
      risk factor levels including lipids, blood pressure, body composition vascular reactivity,
      insulin resistance pre and post intervention will be compared to an Advice-Only condition and
      correlated with activity level. Eligible participants will be identified as part of the
      baseline measurements of that study and will be offered the chance to participate in the CHB
      Sub-Study, a two visit observational design.
