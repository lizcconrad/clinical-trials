    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to use an investigational urine assay to estimate the
      proportion of pneumonia in adults 50 years or older in different areas throughout the US that
      is caused by certain types of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (also called
      pneumococcus).
