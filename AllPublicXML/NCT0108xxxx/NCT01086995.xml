  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if variability in heart and breathing rates can be
      used to predict successful weaning. We are collecting data to determine whether or not subtle
      differences in heart rate and respiratory function will help physicians to decide if a
      patient is ready to be weaned.

      In this prospective observational pilot study, mechanically ventilated patients weaning or
      near extubation (i.e. within 1-5 days) were selected to undergo continuous heart rate (EKG
      waveform at 500 Hz) and respiratory rate (expired CO2 waveform at 100 Hz) recording. The data
      was collected as per standard practice by the bedside monitor (Phillips Intelivue MP70). A
      portable CPU with TrendfaceTM software was used to download the data for variability
      analysis. All decisions on timing of SBTs and extubation were left to the discretion of the
      treating team who were unaware of the variability results. SBT's were repeated daily from
      trial onset until extubation patient permitting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have been requiring mechanical ventilation for &gt;48 hours.

          -  At least partial reversal of the condition precipitating invasive ventilation.

          -  Stabilization of &quot;other&quot; organ system failures (i.e. no worsening).

          -  The patient is able to tolerate pressure support ventilation ≤14 cm H2O (SpO2 ≥ 90%
             with FiO2 ≤ 40% and PEEP ≤ 10 cm H2O)

          -  The patient is hemodynamically stable (off vasopressors or on low levels of
             vasopressors).

          -  Stable neurological status (no deterioration in the last 24 hors, intact respiratory
             drive and ICP &lt; 20).

          -  The patient has intact airway reflexes (adequate cough with suctioning and a gag
             reflex).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to skin adhesives or a contraindication to placing electrocardiogram adhesives
             (e.g. severe psoriasis).

          -  Do not reintubate order documented on chart or anticipated withdrawal of life support.

          -  Tracheostomy

          -  Known or suspected severe myopathy or neuropathy (i.e. myasthenia gravis,
             Guillain-Barré syndrome) or quadriplegia.

          -  Severe heart failure or Grade IV left ventricular function.

          -  Prior extubation during ICU stay.
