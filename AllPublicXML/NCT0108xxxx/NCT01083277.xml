  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure requiring support with mechanical ventilation occurs with an
      incidence of 77-100 per 100,000 person-years and accounts for half of all patients admitted
      to the intensive care unit. Major causes of acute respiratory failure include pneumonia,
      asthma, emphysema, and acute lung injury. These causes of acute respiratory failure may
      result in partial lung collapse (atelectasis), and airway narrowing (bronchoconstriction)that
      result in decreased oxygen levels requiring support with the ventilator. The prolonged
      inactivity in the supine position associated with mechanical ventilation can further result
      in atelectasis requiring increased oxygen supplementation through the ventilator.

      The current standard of care in acute respiratory failure is a strategy of mechanical
      ventilation using a single lung volume delivered repeatedly. However, the current standard
      mechanical ventilation strategy is not consistent with the variability in respiration of
      healthy humans and has been shown to contribute to increased lung injury in some studies. The
      mortality associated with acute respiratory failure is high, 30-40%. Thus, improvements in
      mechanical ventilation strategies that improve oxygen levels and potentially decrease further
      lung injury delivered by the ventilator are warranted.

      Recent studies by BU Professor Bela Suki and others in humans and animals with acute lung
      injury, bronchoconstriction, and atelectasis have shown that varying the lung volumes
      delivered by a ventilator significantly decreases biomarkers of lung injury, improves lung
      mechanics, and increases oxygenation when compared to identical mean volumes of conventional,
      monotonous low lung volume ventilation.

      Therefore, we propose a first-in-human, Phase I study to evaluate the safety of this novel
      mode of ventilation, Variable Ventilation, during acute respiratory failure
