    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study is to prove the non-inferiority
      of UFT maintenance therapy to BCG maintenance therapy for preventing recurrences of
      superficial bladder cancer.

      Patients who have undergone transurethral resection of a superficial bladder tumor (TUR-Bt)
      and BCG induction therapy are eligible for enrollment in this study. In principle, BCG
      induction therapy consists of the successive weekly intravesical administration of 81 mg of
      BCG-Connaught strain or 80 mg of BCG-Japan strain for 6 weeks after the completion of TUR-Bt.

      The patients will be randomly assigned to a BCG maintenance therapy arm or a UFT maintenance
      therapy arm. The patients in the BCG maintenance therapy arm will be treated with 3
      successive weekly intravesical administrations of BCG at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after the
      start of BCG induction therapy. The dosage of BCG used for BCG maintenance therapy will be
      the same as that used for BCG induction therapy. Patients in the UFT maintenance therapy arm
      will be treated with the oral administration of 400 mg of UFT everyday for three years after
      the end of BCG induction therapy.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the three-year relapse-free survival rate.
