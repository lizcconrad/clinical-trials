    <textblock>
      This randomized study evaluates the effect of a multi-focused, psychosocial 6-day residential
      rehabilitation course at a Danish rehabilitation centre for cancer survivors. The
      investigators hypothesize that individuals in the intervention group will experience better
      psychosocial well-being and more adaptive health behaviour changes as compared to individuals
      in the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, the number of cancer survivors is increasing. In the Danish population of 5.4
      million people, more than 300 000 are cancer survivors. Given the range of physical,
      psychological and social late effects of cancer and its primary treatment many survivors need
      tailored rehabilitation interventions. This randomized study evaluates the effect of a
      multi-focused, psychosocial 6-day residential rehabilitation course at the Dallund
      Rehabilitation Centre in Denmark. We hypothesize that individuals in the intervention group
      will experience better psychosocial well-being and more adaptive health behaviour changes as
      compared to individuals in the control group.

    <description>Groups of 20 cancer survivors participated in a 6-day multi-focused, psychosocial intervention at the Dallund rehabilitation centre. The overall aim was to strengthen each individual's physical, psychological and social functioning. Sharing experiences with other cancer patients and experiencing peer-support was a central issue. The retreat combined lectures, discussions and patient group work on themes such as the treatment of cancer, psychological reactions, spirituality, sexuality and lifestyle. Participants were involved in physical activities, and the daily menu represented a healthy diet. The course was conducted by a multi-disciplinary team. Each participant produced a personal, specific 'action plan', which was intended to serve as a 'booster' after returning to daily life.</description>
