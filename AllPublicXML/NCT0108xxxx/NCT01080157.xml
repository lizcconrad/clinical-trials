  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the SCOUT DS in
      measuring the concentration of substances (advanced glycation endproducts) in the skin. These
      substances have been found to be in higher concentrations in people with diabetes and high
      blood sugar. The SCOUT DS is being developed to help doctors measure these substances in skin
      and possibly help doctors diagnose diabetes.

      The trial will be a prospective, multi-center, paired data, cohort screening trial. Up to 960
      subjects will complete the study to determine the relative accuracy of SCOUT DS compared to
      the FPG and HbA1c tests in screening for abnormal glucose tolerance. All methods will be
      compared to the 2 hour value of the OGTT. An algorithm utilizes skin optical modeling as well
      as the spectral and blood assay data accumulated from the initial phase of the study to
      produce a risk score for abnormal glucose tolerance. This algorithm and the calculation of
      the score will be integrated into the SCOUT DS for prospective testing. The design requires
      three patient visits to the clinical site and up to a total of seven measurements on the
      SCOUT device.

        Volunteers age 18 and above, of either sex and of any ethnic background, will be recruited
        at up to 12 clinical sites. All subjects will be at risk for diabetes based on the American
        Diabetes Association Standard of Care Guidelines. Those in the 18-44 age group will have an
        additional risk factor, and the addition of the waist circumference and hypertension
        thresholds from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III
        Guidelines for metablolic syndrome
