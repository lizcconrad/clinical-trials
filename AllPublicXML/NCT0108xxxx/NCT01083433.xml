  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out ways to help pre-teens and teens and their
      families to improve diabetes control and to help with the burden of diabetes management.
      Specifically, the study aims to find out if coming to diabetes clinic more frequently and for
      a longer period of time helps adolescents with diabetes, and if adolescents who wear a
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for 3-5 days a month will have better diabetes control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Good glycemic control is critical in preventing chronic complications of type 1 diabetes.
      However, achieving good glycemic control remains elusive for many adolescents. This study
      evaluates two clinic-based approaches for improving glycemic control in adolescents with
      poorly controlled type 1 diabetes - an intensive diabetes support and education program alone
      and the same intensive diabetes support and education program together with continuous
      glucose monitoring - in comparison with standard diabetes care.

    <measure>Glycemic Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and then every month for four months</time_frame>
    <description>Serum hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) will be measured in all groups at the baseline visit and visit 4. Rapid HbA1c using capillary blood will be measured at every visit. Blood glucose meter average will be obtained at every visit. Emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and emergency phone calls for hyperglycemia and ketonuria will be tracked.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin dose changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every month for four months</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin doses in units per kilogram per day will be calculated at each visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Episodes of Hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;70 mg/dL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every month for four months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose meter downloads will be used to tabulate the number of episodes of blood glucoses &lt; 70 mg/dL. At each visit patients will be asked to recall any episodes of severe hypoglycemia that occurred since the last visit. Data from the continuous glucose monitors will be used to evaluate the percent of time that patients are below 70 mg/dL and the number of glucose excursions below 70 mg/dL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glycemic Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemic variability will be evaluated from data from continuous glucose monitor downloads.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to prescribed diabetes regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every month for four months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be measured using the Diabetes Self Management Profile, the Self Care Inventory, average number of blood glucose tests the patient completes per day, the amount of time the patient wears the continuous glucose monitor, number of missed insulin injections, insulin usage, and clinic attendance.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in this group will include all procedures as listed for group 2 (intensive diabetes clinic) in addition to wearing a continuous glucose monitor for 3-5 days each month. Patients will also have an additional 30 minutes with a psychology graduate student dedicated to adherence with the CGM.</description>

  <intervention>

    <intervention_name>Diabetes related psychological counseling and education</intervention_name>
    <description>The psychology intervention is based in part on an intervention to maintain parental support for diabetes care in adolescence which was developed by Anderson and colleagues (1999). The first session will include education to parents and children regarding the importance of sharing responsibility for treatment related tasks. The second session will include a discussion of the treatment sharing plan developed at the first visit and problems that may have occurred will be discussed. The third session will include a discussion of planning for possible future problems. Visits 1, 2, and 3 will include 30 minutes of diabetes education.</description>
