    <textblock>
      Context: The French Alzheimer plan 2008-2012 includes the implementation of &quot;disease
      managers&quot; or social workers, from the onset of the disease, for every patient with a
      diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or associated disorder. However, previous trials evaluating
      the efficacy of a systematic intervention for each case from the onset of the disease,
      including non complex cases, have shown little evidence.

      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a social worker to prevent behavioural problem for
      patient with a new diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or associated disorder.

      Design and setting: Multicentric cluster randomized control trial. Patients from several
      memory consultations and specialists (neurologist, psychiatrist or geriatrician) in France
      are included.

      Intervention: In addition to usual care, patients in the intervention group have systematic
      home visits from a social worker and regular follow-ups by phone over a one-year period. This
      social worker informs the patient and caregiver, evaluates the needs, gives advices to
      prevent complications and is a link between the patient and the memory consultation or the
      specialist. Patient in the control group have absolutely no intervention and are followed-up
      as usually. In order to not modify the usual care, they have no information on their
      participation in this trial before the one-year evaluation.

      Main outcome measure: NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI) administrated at one year, which
      evaluates frequency, severity and repercussion of several behavioural problems. Secondary
      outcomes included disability, cognition, depression, health, quality of life,
      institutionalization, and resource use.
