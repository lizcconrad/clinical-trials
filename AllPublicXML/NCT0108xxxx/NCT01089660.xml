  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to describe the immunogenicity of a pandemic A/H1N1 influenza vaccine
      in healthy adults given a lower vaccine dose and in a similar group given a full dose of the
      vaccine.

      The primary objective is to describe describe the immune response of the inactivated,
      split-virion swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza vaccine without adjuvant.

    <textblock>
      All participants will receive a single dose of study vaccine and will also be monitored for
      serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest occurring from Days 0 to 21 and
      at 6 months post-vaccination.
