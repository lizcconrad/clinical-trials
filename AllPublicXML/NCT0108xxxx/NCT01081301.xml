      Family caregivers of terminally ill persons describe hope as inner strength that will help
      them continue caregiving. Our research team has developed and pilot tested a Living with Hope
      Program (LWHP) for caregivers of family members with advanced cancer, with the goal of
      fostering hope and improving quality of life (www.usask.ca/nursing /research/livingwithhope).
      The caregivers involved in our pilot test found the LWHP easy to use and we found some
      evidence to suggest that the program may have increased their hope and improved their quality
      of life. We would like to further develop and test the LWHP by finding out more about how and
      how long it might work. We believe it will improve the quality of life of active and bereaved
      older rural women of persons with advanced cancer and may decrease the number of
      prescriptions and doctor visits over one year. Since rural women caring for persons with
      advanced cancer seem to have the least hope, we want to focus on them first before including
      other caregivers in our research. Two hundred rural women caring for a person with advanced
      cancer will be asked to take part in this study. Their feelings of control, loss and grief,
      quality of life and hope will be measured over a year. The numbers of time they visit their
      physician and how many prescriptions they have over the year will also be collected. This
      study will contribute to the refinement of a Living with Hope Program that may improve
      quality of life and personal health of older rural women caring for their spouse with
      advanced cancer and those who subsequently become bereaved.

      1. Background: The research team has developed and pilot tested a Living with Hope Program
           (LWHP) for caregivers of family members with advanced cancer. The LWHP includes viewing
           an award winning Living with Hope video followed by writing a daily journal for two
           weeks. The pilot test findings suggested that the LWHP is an acceptable and feasible
           intervention for use by family caregivers. Although the LWHP shows promise in
           potentially increasing hope and quality of life, further testing and development is
           needed. Questions remain as to: a) what are the mechanisms through which the LWHP
           affects outcomes and b) how long it is effective?

        2. Purpose: The overall purpose of this time series mixed method study is the further
           development and testing of the LWHP by:

             1. Determining the mechanisms of the LWHP by testing the LWHP conceptual model in
                which self-efficacy and loss and grief are hypothesized intervening variables for
                changes in hope, and subsequently quality of life among rural women caring for
                persons with advanced cancer. In the LWHP model we hypothesize that administration
                of the LWHP will improve self-efficacy and decrease feelings of loss and grief.
                This will lead to a positive influence on the proximal outcome of hope and the
                distal outcome of quality of life.

             2. Exploring the longitudinal effects of the LWHP on hope, quality of life and health
                services utilization among older rural women caring for spouses with advanced
                cancer. We want to determine if the LWHP has benefits beyond what was found in the
                pilot. The team will compare baseline scores of hope and quality of life to scores
                after the LWHP over time and health services utilization (one year prospective
                number of physician visits and prescriptions compared to the year before the LWHP).
                This study is unique, as it will follow caregivers over a one-year period. As
                approximately 50% of these caregivers will become bereaved one month after study
                enrolment; rather than dropping these caregivers from the study, the team felt that
                retaining these subjects would add to the understanding of hope, quality of life
                and health care utilization among caregivers by continuing to follow them through
                bereavement. Thus, patterns of hope, quality of life and health care services
                utilization will be delineated over time for active and bereaved caregivers.

        3. Research Plan: Using a time-series embedded mixed method design, baseline measures were
           collected from 122 rural women caring for a person who has advanced cancer. Data
           collection began January 2009 in 4 sites: Saskatoon Cancer Agency, Alan Blair Cancer
           Agency, Sunrise Health Region and Regina/Qu'Appelle Health Region. Data collection in
           Alberta started July 2010 through Alberta Health Services Community Cancer Clinics, and
           in September 2010 through a mail out through the Alberta Cancer Registry. In January
           2011 subjects were enrolled through a mail out through the Saskatchewan Cancer Registry.
           Subjects who consented to participate in the full study received the LWHP. Subjects were
           then post tested on the variables at 1 and 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months. Journal entries
           were copied and transcribed.

        4. Data Analysis: Path Analysis will be used to test the model post LWHP at 1 and 2 weeks.
           Two-factor ANCOVA will determine patterns over time and Cortazzi's narrative analysis
           will be used to analyze the subjects journals completed as part of the LWHP.

        5. Significance: This study will contribute to the refinement of the Living with Hope
           Program that may improve quality of life and personal health of older rural women caring
           for their spouse with advanced cancer and those who subsequently become bereaved. The
           findings will also increase our understanding of the factors influencing hope, quality
           of life and health in a vulnerable, understudied population that is increasing in
           numbers with the aging of Canada's population. Family care giving is what sustains
           patients at the end of life, and with changing demographics and diminishing resources
           there is a potential that every Canadian will be an informal caregiver at some time.
           Effective psychosocial supportive interventions, such as the LWHP are critical for their
           support and well-being.

    <measure>Herth Hope Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1week, 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Herth Hope Index is a 12 item (1-4 point) Likert scale that delineates three sub-scales of hope: a) temporality and future, b) positive readiness and expectancy, and c) interconnectedness. These three subscales are consistent with descriptions of hope by caregivers in the preliminary work completed by the research team. The subscales also include measures of relationships and spirituality that are considered factors that influence hope. Summative scores range from 12-48, with a higher score denoting greater hope.</description>

    <measure>SF12 Mental Health</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 and 2 wks, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF12 was developed to be a shorter yet valid alternative to the SF 36 as a measure of quality of life. The SF12 measures 7 concepts: Physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general healthy vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health. It produces a physical component summary score (PCS), and a mental health component summary score (MCS). Scores range from 0 (poor health) to 100 (perfect health).</description>

    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Score (GSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1week, 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 10 items with responses from 1-4. The higher the Scores on the General Self Efficacy Scale (which has a range from 10 - 40), indicate higher participant feelings of self-efficacy. The General Self Efficacy Scale was chosen as a measure for this study because it has been found to be a reliable and valid measure in many populations.</description>

    <measure>Non-Death Revised Grief Experience Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1week, 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Non-Death Revised Grief Experience Inventory measures grief that is not associated with the death of a person. It is a 22-item scale measuring four domains (existential concerns, depression, tension and guilt, and physical distress) of the grief experience. Responses are scored on a 6-point scale, ranging from slight disagreement to strong agreement, with higher total score indicating more grief and loss. The Non-Death Revised Grief Experience Inventory has a minimum score of 22 and a maximum score of 132.</description>

          <title>Herth Hope Index</title>
          <description>The Herth Hope Index provides a summative hope score and scores for three sub-scales of hope: a) temporality and future, b) positive readiness and expectancy, and c) interconnectedness. It is a 12 item likert response scale (1-4) with summative scores ranging from 12-48, with a higher score denoting greater hope. It has reported reliability (test-retest r=0. 91, p&lt;0. 05) and validity (concurrent validity, r=0. 84, p&lt;.0 05; criterion, r=. 92, p&lt; 0.05; divergent, r=-.73, p&lt;0. 05).</description>

          <title>General Self-Efficacy Scale</title>
          <description>This likert type scale has 10 items which produces a total perceived general self-efficacy score. Responses are made on a 4 point scale. Scores range from 10 to a maximum score of 40; the higher scores the higher participant feelings of self-efficacy. The GSES has been found to be a reliable and valid measure in many populations and countries and has been used in a study of hope and family caregivers of women with breast cancer. Reliability ranges from r=0.76 to r=0.90 and criterion related reliability was r=0.80, p&lt;0.05.</description>

          <description>The SF-12v2 was developed as a shorter yet valid alternative to the SF 36 as a measure of quality of life. The SF-12v2 produces a physical health component summary score (PCS), and a mental health component summary score (MCS), but not a total summary score. Scores range from 0 (poor health) to 100 (perfect health). The SF-12v2 physical summary and mental health summary scores correlate very highly (r=0.95 and 0.96 respectively) with the SF-36 and have reported test-retest reliability of r=0.89 and 0.76 respectively.</description>

          <title>Non-Death Revised Grief Experience Inventory</title>
          <description>The NDRGEI is a 22-item scale measuring four domains of the grief experience for people who are not bereaved (item examples are in brackets): 1) existential concerns (e.g. “I feel lost and helpless”), 2) depression (e.g. “I cry easily”), 3) guilt (e.g. “I have feelings of guilt”), and 4) distress (e.g. “My arms and legs feel very heavy”). Responses are scored on a 6-point scale, ranging from slight disagreement to strong agreement, with a higher total score indicating more grief and loss. The Non-Death Revised Grief Experience Inventory has a minimum score of 22 and a maximum score of 132.</description>

        <description>The Herth Hope Index is a 12 item (1-4 point) Likert scale that delineates three sub-scales of hope: a) temporality and future, b) positive readiness and expectancy, and c) interconnectedness. These three subscales are consistent with descriptions of hope by caregivers in the preliminary work completed by the research team. The subscales also include measures of relationships and spirituality that are considered factors that influence hope. Summative scores range from 12-48, with a higher score denoting greater hope.</description>

        <description>The Non-Death Revised Grief Experience Inventory measures grief that is not associated with the death of a person. It is a 22-item scale measuring four domains (existential concerns, depression, tension and guilt, and physical distress) of the grief experience. Responses are scored on a 6-point scale, ranging from slight disagreement to strong agreement, with higher total score indicating more grief and loss. The Non-Death Revised Grief Experience Inventory has a minimum score of 22 and a maximum score of 132.</description>
