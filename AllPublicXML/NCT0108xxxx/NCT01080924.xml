        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • 18 - 70 years

               -  for the healthy cohort:

                    -  FEV1 &gt; 80 % pred, FEV1/FVC ≥ 70 % pred., no history of allergies or asthma

                    -  nonsmokers, with a history of less than 1 packyear having been nonsmokers
                       for at least the last five years

               -  for the COPD cohort: COPD GOLD I to IV according to current guidelines (2)

               -  for the asthma cohort: history of asthma GINA I to IV according to current
                  guidelines (3)

               -  BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2

               -  Able and willing to give written informed consent

               -  Available to complete all study measurements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • medical conditions which prohibit the use of salbutamol

               -  recent exacerbation of COPD or asthma or lower respiratory tract infection (four
                  weeks previous to informed consent visit)

               -  past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the
                  outcome of the study. These diseases include, but are not limited to,
                  cardiovascular disease, malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological
                  disease, neurological disease, psychiatric disease, endocrine disease or
                  pulmonary disease (including but not confined to asthma, tuberculosis,
                  bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis)

               -  history of drug or alcohol abuse which would interfere with the subject's proper
                  completion of the protocol assignment

               -  risk of non-compliance with study procedures

               -  suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and
                  study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the
                  study.
