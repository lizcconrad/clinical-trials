At the end of first treatment cycle, participants who were positive for P. aeruginosa entered the open label (OL) phase of the study and received TOBI for 28 days bid. Participants who were negative for P. aeruginosa at the end of first treatment cycle and agreed to participate in the cross-over treatment period received placebo for 28 days bid (second treatment cycle).</description>
