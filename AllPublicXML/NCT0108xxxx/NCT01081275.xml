  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different kinds of physical therapy to improve use of the hands
      in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). One treatment will be Constraint-Induced
      Movement therapy (CI therapy), the other will be a set of Complementary and Alternative
      Medicine (CAM) treatments (yoga, relaxation exercises, aquatherapy, massage). The study will
      determine which of the two forms of treatment is more successful for improving hand use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) frequently causes reduced use of one of the hands, and as a result,
      much of daily living activities are conducted only by the other hand, leaving the person
      effective one-handed. Nonetheless, reduced hand use can be improved for extended amounts of
      time with specific forms of physical therapy, as long as persons with MS have the ability to
      perform the training tasks.

      This study will randomize persons with MS who have relatively reduced use of one of the hands
      to either CI therapy or CAM treatments. Treatment in either program will be for 2 consecutive
      weeks, 3.5 hours per day (Monday-Friday), under the direct supervision of a specially trained
      therapist. Before starting, participants will also undergo comprehensive medical and physical
      exam screening and brain MRI scan. The same evaluations will be performed after treatment to
      learn whether any of these have changed as a result of treatment.
