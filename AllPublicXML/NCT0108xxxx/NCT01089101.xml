    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of selumetinib and how well
      it works in treating or re-treating young patients with low grade glioma that has come back
      (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Selumetinib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommend a Phase II dose of AZD6244
      (selumetinib) in children with recurrent or refractory low-grade glioma. (Phase I, completed
      as of April 29, 2013) II. To describe the toxicity profile and define the dose limiting
      toxicity of AZD6244 in children with recurrent or refractory low-grade glioma. (Phase I) III.
      To study the safety of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended a Phase II dose (RP2D)
      of AZD6244 as determined based on safety data from children &gt;= 12 years of age in children &lt;
      12 years of age; if the MTD/RP2D of the older children is too toxic for the younger children,
      we will de-escalate to one dose level below and study the safety of that dose in the younger
      age cohort. (Phase I) IV. To assess the sustained response rate of AZD6244 administered at 25
      mg/m^2/dose twice daily (BID), in a single arm Phase II setting in patients assigned to
      strata based on neurofibromatosis (NF)-1 status and presence or absence of v-raf murine
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) aberrations, specifically BRAF V600E mutations and/or
      BRAF KIAA1549 fusion identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH), respectively. (Phase II) V. To estimate the sustained response rate and
      prolonged disease stabilization rate (defined as lack of disease progression for &gt;= 12
      courses) associated with AZD6244 in patients with recurrent and/or progressive low-grade
      gliomas who previously received treatment on PBTC-029 or PBTC-029B for a minimum of 12
      courses, with at least stable disease or patients who had a sustained response but remained
      on treatment &lt; 12 courses. (Re-treatment Study)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the inter- and intra-patient variability in AZD6244 pharmacokinetics
      administered on this schedule and to assess the influence of patient specific covariates
      (including concomitant drug therapy) on AZD6244 pharmacokinetics. (Phase I) II. To evaluate
      the feasibility of collecting pre-trial tumor samples and the feasibility of using in situ
      hybridization assay to identify BRAF aberrations in available tumor specimens. (Phase I) III.
      To determine if pre-trial tumor samples show the biochemical signature that indicates
      activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. (Phase I) IV. To describe
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the tumors before and after treatment and
      to explore the diffusion changes in the tumors before and after treatment to determine if
      there is an early diffusion indicator of response. (Phase I) V. Within the constraints of a
      Phase I trial, to document antitumor activity of treatment with AZD6244, as measured by
      objective responses and progression-free survival (PFS). (Phase I) VI. To explore the
      pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in AZD6244 metabolizing enzymes and transporters and relate
      these polymorphisms to AZD6244 pharmacokinetics. (Phase I) VII. To estimate the PFS
      distributions associated with AZD6244 treatment separately in patients assigned to the six
      strata as well as for various other subsets e.g. histology and tumor grade across strata.
      (Phase II) VIII. To explore correlations between BRAF aberrations and treatment response and
      PFS in patients for whom relevant biology data are available. (Phase II) IX. To assess MAPK
      aberrations by a combination of whole-exome and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing. (Phase II)
      X. To characterize the inter- and intra-patient variability in AZD6244 pharmacokinetics
      administered on this schedule at the MTD/RP2D. (Phase II) XI. To determine progression-free
      survival following re-treatment with AZD6244 for progressive, recurrent low-grade gliomas and
      to evaluate the impact of variables such as previous response, interval treatment regimens,
      BRAF status and previous dose of AZD6244. (Re-treatment Study) XII. To evaluate the toxicity
      profile of re-treatment with AZD6244 and correlate with toxicities seen during initial
      treatment. (Re-treatment Study) XIII. To evaluate the toxicity profile of re-treatment with
      AZD6244 beyond 2 years for those patients who continue to show benefit from the drug, i.e. at
      least stable disease (SD). (Re-treatment Study)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study (completed as of April 29, 2013) followed by
      a phase II study.

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who experience a sustained objective response from selumetinib on the phase I or
      phase II portions of the trial, and who have completed 2 years of treatment and stopped study
      drug may be enrolled on the re-treatment study after progression/recurrence. Patients in the
      re-treatment study may continue treatment indefinitely in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicities.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             patients who will enroll on strata 1, 2 and 5

               -  Stratum 1: patients with non NF-1 associated progressive, recurrent or refractory
                  pilocytic astrocytoma with pre-trial tumor material available and with a BRAF
                  aberration i.e. BRAFV^600E mutation and/or BRAF KIAA1549 fusion as determined by
                  IHC and FISH, respectively; patients with optic pathway glioma are excluded

               -  Stratum 2: patients with non NF-1 associated progressive, recurrent or refractory

                  for BRAF analyses who cannot be classified into stratum 1, 2 or 5 due to
                  inadequate tissue quality, assay failure, etc

                    -  Clarification: Stratum 4 was specifically designed for patients with
                       hypothalamic/optic pathway gliomas; the intent is that if there is any optic
                       chiasm invasion regardless of where the tumor is originating from (chiasm
                       vs. hypothalamus vs. other location), the patient should be enrolled on
                       Stratum 4, regardless of whether the tumor has been biopsied or not;
                       obviously, there are some tumors that include part of the hypothalamus and
                       clearly do NOT include the chiasm at all; in these situations, and if the
                       tumor is a biopsy proven pilocytic astrocytoma, these patients should be
                       enrolled on Stratum 1 or 2 (depending upon BRAF status)

             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately; please note that the AZD6244 manufacturer recommends that adequate
             contraception for male patients should be used for 16 weeks post-last dose due to
             sperm life cycle

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             according to institutional guidelines

          -  Patients must have recurrence or progression of their low-grade glioma after coming
             off treatment with AZD6244 on PBTC-029 or PBTC-029B, with or without having received
             additional anti-tumor therapy following discontinuation of AZD6244; the progression
             must be unequivocal and sufficient to warrant re-treatment in the opinion of the
             investigator; progression will be defined as either progressive disease (PD) that
             meets the study definitions of progressive disease by MRI or vision deterioration
             thought to be related to tumor in patients with optic pathway tumors

          -  Patients must have received treatment on PBTC-029 or PBTC-029B for a minimum of 12
             courses with at least stable disease, or had a sustained response (partial response
             [PR]/ complete response [CR]) but remained on treatment &lt; 12 courses

          -  Patients must have bi-dimensionally measureable disease defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least two planes

                  registration

               -  Other investigational agents (not fitting into one of the above specified
                  categories): patients must have received their last dose of any other
                  investigational agent greater than 28 days prior to enrollment

               -  Radiation: Patients must have:

                    -  Had their last fraction of local irradiation to the primary tumor &gt;= 12
                       months prior to registration; investigators are reminded to review
                       potentially eligible cases to avoid confusion with pseudo-progression;

                    -  Had their last fraction of craniospinal irradiation (&gt; 24Gy) &gt; 3 months
                       prior to registration

               -  Corticosteroids: Patients who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or
                  decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to registration

               -  Growth factors: Patients must be off all colony-forming growth factor(s) for at
                  least 1 week prior to registration (filgrastim, sargramostim, erythropoietin) and

             likely interfere with the study procedures or results

          -  Patients who are receiving any other anticancer or investigational agents

          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures

          -  Prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib (previous
             treatment with sorafenib is allowed)

          -  Patients with other factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic
             events (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome)
             that meets New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or above

          -  Required use of a concomitant medication that can prolong the QT interval

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to AZD6244
