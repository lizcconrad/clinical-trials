      This study is an inpatient trial to determine the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the
      WRSS1 candidate vaccine in healthy Thai adult volunteers. This study is designed as 2 parts.

        -  Part 1 is a blinded, placebo-controlled inpatient trial in a total of 20 volunteers (14
           vaccinees and 6 controls) to determine the safety and immunogenicity. Volunteers will be
           vaccinated with a single oral dose of 104 colony forming unit (cfu) of WRSS1 or placebo
           given with bicarbonate buffer.

        -  Part 2 will be started approximately 60 days after WRSS1 vaccination. This part is an
           inpatient phase II efficacy trial involving a challenge with the S.sonnei 53G of 10
           vaccinees from the first part and 10 naïve controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 20-40 years old; male or female;

          2. General good health as determined by a screening evaluation no greater than 30 days
             before admission;

          3. Normal bowel habits (grade 1-2 stools - no more than one to two stools per day with at
             least one stool per 2 days;

          4. Sexually active females willing to use birth control (birth control pills, injection
             hormonal contraceptive, implant hormonal contraceptive, hormonal patch, IUD,

             gastrointestinal functions from the oral vaccine or challenge strain may lead to
