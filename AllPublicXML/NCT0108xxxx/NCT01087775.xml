      The investigators hypothesis are as follows:

      H1a: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform cognitive training (CT) will demonstrate greater
      objective improvements on standard (untrained) neurocognitive measures, with the largest
      gains in verbal memory, learning and sustained attention.

      H1b: Objective cognitive improvements in CT participants will be sustained at three months
      post-intervention, suggesting persistence of neuroplasticity-based cognitive training
      benefits.

      H2a: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will report greater improvements in cognitive
      function.

      H2b: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will demonstrate improved social and
      occupational functioning and quality of life.

      H2c: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will demonstrate greater improvements in
      community reintegration.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An experienced clinical interviewer with Master's-level training will conduct first-
             and second-level screening to determine study eligibility for enrollment in the
             randomized controlled trial.

          -  The First-Level Eligibility Screen will be conducted by phone and will apply the
             following inclusion criteria in an effort to recruit a homogeneous sample:

               1. Confirmed OEF and/or OIF military service

               2. Male veterans, ages 18 to 40 years with 12 to 16 years of education

               3. History of a prior positive PTSD screen or diagnosis either by SFVAMC study
                  referral or self-report'

               4. Able and willing to travel to SFVAMC

               5. Able and willing to perform daily home-based computer exercises for three months.

          -  The Second Level Eligibility Determination will occur in-person at the SFVAMC of
             potential participants who have met first-level screening eligibility criteria.
             Second-level eligibility screening will require signed informed consent (see below)
             before the second-level screening is conducted. During the second-level eligibility
             screen, consenting participants will be administered:

               1. The Clinician-Administered PTSD screen (CAPS) and the Mini International
                  Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 29 to assess for Diagnostic and Statistical
                  Manual (DSM)-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders

               2. The VA TBI second-level screen [TBI event history and Neurobehavioral Symptom
                  Inventory (NSI) for cognitive symptoms].30

          -  To be eligible for enrollment in the randomized controlled, veterans at second-level
             screening must:

               1. Meet threshold criteria for current full or sub-syndromal PTSD by DSM-IV criteria
                  31

               2. Report â‰¥ 1 moderate or severe cognitive symptom(s) on the NSI that interfere(s)
                  with daily function including moderate to severe poor concentration,
                  forgetfulness, difficulty making decisions and slowed thinking.

          -  Because PTSD is a highly comorbid condition, eligible participants may have other
             comorbid stable neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression or a history of a
             mild traumatic brain injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The following exclusion criteria will apply to first-level screening:

               1. Poor English comprehension and fluency

               2. Unstable medical condition, injury or disability, including moderate to severe
                  TBI (by self-report) and hearing impairment

               3. Current (or past 60 day) evidence-based PTSD or cognitive remediation therapy; in
                  contrast, stable supportive therapy for PTSD and/or other mental disorders, such
                  as group therapy or on stable psychoactive medication (&gt; 30 days) will be
                  acceptable.

          -  The following exclusion criteria will apply to second-level screening:

               1. Drug and alcohol dependence and other unstable serious mental illness (e.g.
                  psychosis) (assessed using the MINI)
