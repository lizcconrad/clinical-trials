  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the rapid development of significant drug resistance to both chloroquine and
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (the first line therapy in Tanzania from 2001 -2006), artemether-
      lumefantrine (Coartem or AL) was adopted as first line therapy in Tanzania in 2006. Now that
      this drug has been widely used for some time, the investigators propose to conduct an
      antimalarial efficacy trial to monitor the effectiveness of this therapy, to determine if
      this drug remains efficacious, or if significant resistance has emerged, in which case a new
      antimalarial strategy will need to be contemplated. The investigators hypothesize that the
      efficacy of Artemether-lumefantrine remains high, and that the other artemisinin combination
      therapies will be equally efficacious.

      Children 6-59 months of age with symptomatic malaria will be randomly assigned to be treated
      with either artemether + lumefantrine (Coartem) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      (Duo-Cotecxin or Artekin). Clinical, parasitologic, and hematologic parameters will be
      monitored over a 42-day follow-up period and will be used to evaluate drug efficacy.
