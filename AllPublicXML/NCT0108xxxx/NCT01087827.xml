  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to see how blood pressures taken at different sites,
      specifically the forearm, upper arm and heart vessels, are different. The second purpose is
      to see if body structures such as vessel size and depth, size of the arm, and amount of
      tissue in the arm influence differences in blood pressures taken at these sites. The third
      purpose is to develop a mathematical model of the waves generated by the arm arteries
      (brachial and radial) to predict differences in forearm and upper arm blood pressures. The
      results of the study may be used to design more accurate non-invasive blood pressure monitors
      for the forearm site.

    <textblock>
      Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement is required to provide appropriate healthcare.
      Inaccurate BPs may lead to under and/or over-treatment of health conditions and medical
      diseases such as hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) measurement using automatic, non-invasive
      oscillometric monitors is common in clinics, physicians'offices and hospital settings. The
      brachial (upper arm) site is the gold standard for non-invasive BPs. However, in some
      situations, this site is inaccessible due to injury, surgery, dialysis shunts, intravenous
      devices, and lymphedema. When the upper arm is difficult to access or the available BP cuffs
      do not fit an individual's arm, the forearm site is often the preferable alternative. The
      increased incidence of obesity nationally also contributes to the heightened use of forearm
      BPs. Questions remain concerning the accuracy of forearm non-invasive BP measurements.
      Although most researchers report that upper arm and forearm readings are not interchangeable,
      size of differences vary for individuals and factors influencing differences in readings have
      not been thoroughly investigated.
