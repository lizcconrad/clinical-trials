  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antipsychotic medicines are used routinely in people with severe mental illness or learning
      disability. Antipsychotics often induce hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin level) and in
      almost all women, and some men, this causes hypogonadism (impaired ovarian or testicular
      function)often with osteoporosis, partly explaining psychiatric patients' high fracture risk.
      Reducing prolactin by changing antipsychotic or adding a dopamine agonist often worsens
      psychosis. Adding aripiprazole to current antipsychotic normalizes prolactin in adult
      schizophrenic patients, without serious side effects. We thus plan a study of add-on
      aripiprazole in people with antipsychotic induced hyperprolactinemia.

      Our main hypothesis is that aripiprazole will normalize or reduce prolactin sufficiently to
      restore normal ovarian and testicular function. Our secondary hypothesis is that restoration
      of normal ovarian and testicular function will improve bone mineral density in patients in
      whom this was reduced at the time of entry into the study.

    <description>Prolactin and sex hormones will be measured on addition of aripiprazole to current antipsychotic treatment. Aripiprazole will be started at 5 mg and uptitrated in a treat-to-target fashion by 5 mg at monthly intervals until prolactin has normalized or decreased sufficiently to restore menses in the women and a normal testosterone in the men. Maximum aripiprazole dose will be 30 mg.</description>

    <description>Bone mineral density will be measured at baseline in patients aged 20 years or older with a presumed duration of hypogonadism of minimum one year. The measurement will be repeated in those with a low bone mineral density at baseline after two years aripiprazole treatment</description>
