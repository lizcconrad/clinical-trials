  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center, Phase II trial to evaluate the progression
      free survival in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with a
      hedgehog inhibitor (GDC-0449) in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and
      nab-Paclitaxel).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of new small molecules with capacity of blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway
      provides a novel therapeutic approach in pancreatic adenocarcinoma treating the primary
      tumor, stroma, systemic metastases and pancreatic cancer stem cells by hedgehog pathway
      inhibition. This phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) in
      patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We hypothesize that
      the combination of cytotoxic agents (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) with the Hedgehog
      inhibitor GDC-0449 may increase PFS.

      This study includes correlative studies to attempt to understand the stem cell biology and
      mechanism for any observed clinical benefits with the use of Hedgehog inhibitor GDC-0449.
      These include changes in the hedgehog pathway and changes in pancreatic cancer stem cell
      markers with pre and post treatment biopsies. The safety of GDC-0449 when combined with
      chemotherapy gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel will also be assessed by evaluating adverse event
      rate.

      Following the determination of eligibility patients will receive the following treatment:

        1. One cycle of Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and nab-Paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15
           (28 days cycle) then

        2. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and nab-Paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days
           cycle in combination with oral GDC-0449 150 mg daily

      Patients may continue on treatment regimen until they experience progressive disease or
      unacceptable toxicity, require palliative radiotherapy, withdraw consent or the physician
      feels it is not longer in their best interest to continue on treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas. Patients with islet cells tumors are excluded. Biopsy within 14 days of
             starting treatment.

          2. Patient has measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20 mm with
             conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          3. Patient has NOT received previous radiotherapy, surgery or chemotherapy or
             investigational drug therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. If the patient
             received radiotherapy, chemotherapy or investigational therapy in the adjuvant setting
             it should be completed 3 weeks prior to enrollment. If a patient received gemcitabine
             in the adjuvant setting, tumor recurrence must have occurred at least six months after
             completing the last dose of gemcitabine

          4. Age &gt;18 years.

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 1 month.

             requiring IV antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure not controlled with
             medication, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded

          8. Patient has undergone a major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (i.e. surgery
             done to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ) within four weeks
             prior to Day 1 of treatment on this study.

          9. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of
             the results of the study or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications
