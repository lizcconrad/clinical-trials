      Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now the treatment of choice for malaria in
      non-pregnant individuals living in areas with established chloroquine resistance; they have
      been shown to be both safe and highly efficacious. There is rapidly increasing experience
      with artemisinin derivatives in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, with over 1,000 well
      documented cases with no reported serious adverse effects to mother or fetus (WHO Malaria
      Treatment Guidelines, 2006). Many countries in Latin America have abandoned the previous 1st
      line regimen of Quinine-Clindamycin for treatment of malaria in pregnancy, a complex and
      poorly tolerated regimen with low adherence, in favor of ACTs, despite limited safety and
      pharmacokinetic data on the use of these compounds in pregnant women. Lack of pharmacokinetic
      data may lead to underdosing of pregnant women, with subsequent reduced efficacy and
      increased potential for development of resistance.

      One ACT regimen, Artesunate-Mefloquine, has been developed as a fixed-dose combination
      (Farmanguinhos Artesunato + Mefloquina), as part of an international collaborative research
      effort led by Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), and manufactured by
      Farmanguinhos, laboratory of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Initial clinical trials
      suggest that it is very well tolerated and efficacious in both pregnant and non-pregnant
      individuals. The convenient dosing afforded by a fixed drug combination make this a very
      promising candidate for treatment of pregnant women with malaria. Preliminary pharmacokinetic
      data from mefloquine monotherapy and prophylaxis suggest that the peak concentration of
      mefloquine is lowered in pregnant women. Prior to wide-spread adoption of the
      Artesunate-Mefloquine combination, further studies on safety, efficacy, and dose optimization
      are imperative. We propose to compare the pharmacokinetics of the fixed combination of
      mefloquine-artesunate (MA) for treatment of P.falciparum in 28 pregnant women in the second
      and third trimesters to the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in 28 matched non-pregnant
      P.falciparum infected women. This will allow us to determine whether the standard adult dose
      is sufficient for pregnant women.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cases: Pregnant women, age ≥18 years, in 2nd or 3rd trimester (gestational age ≥12
             weeks determined by LMP and confirmed by fundal height measurement) Controls:
             Non-pregnant women ≥18 years old (negative urine pregnancy test)

          2. Presence of P. falciparum ≤ 50,000 parasites/microliter

          3. Fever (≥37.5C) or history of fever in preceding 48 hours

          4. Willing to sign or thumb print informed consent
