    <textblock>
      This single-arm, multi-center, Post-Marketing Surveillance study of Kaletra
      (lopinavir/ritonavir) was conducted in accordance with the approved Korean product labeling
      in participants 2 years of age and older with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
      infection.

    <textblock>
      Participants were observed for up to 48 weeks following the first dose of Kaletra. A
      follow-up visit took place 1-2 weeks after treatment initiation, and subsequent visits
      occurred at the discretion of the investigators, typically occurring every 3 months.
      Clinical/immunological/virological/laboratory status, Kaletra-containing regimen/concomitant
      medication information, and adverse event information were obtained at follow-up visits.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Viral Load</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24 &amp; 48</time_frame>
    <description>This variable, change from baseline in viral load, was not included in the final protocol. Therefore, these data were not calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) Cell Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Weeks 24 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were obtained from participants at baseline, 24, and 48 weeks after the start of Kaletra treatment and analyzed for CD4 cell counts. Change in CD4 cell counts in the main surveillance population was calculated by subtracting the value at baseline from the value at 24 weeks. Change in CD4 cell counts in the long-term surveillance population was calculated by subtracting the value at baseline from the value at 48 weeks.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were obtained from participants at initiation of Kaletra treatment and at follow up visits through weeks 24 and 48 and analyzed for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) RNA levels. Treatment failure was defined as HIV RNA level &gt; 400 copies/mL at week 24 and HIV RNA level &gt; 50 copies/mL at week 48.</description>
