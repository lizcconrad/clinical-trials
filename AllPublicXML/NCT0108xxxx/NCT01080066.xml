    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, non-interventional, multicenter, post-marketing
      surveillance study to mainly collect safety information from subjects with locally advanced
      and recurrent/metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck (SCCHN) treated with
      cetuximab based on the locally approved label.

    <textblock>
      Cetuximab is an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that enhances the effects of
      some common chemotherapy agents and radiotherapy and demonstrates minimal overlapping
      toxicities with these approaches. This prospective, observational, non-interventional and
      multi-centric post marketing surveillance study is being conducted to collect safety
      information from subjects with locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic SCCHN treated with
      cetuximab based on the locally approved label. Study plans to enroll 200 to 300 subjects, who
      are eligible for cetuximab treatment according to the indication in the approved label of
      cetuximab by Taiwan Health Authority. Data related to subjects' demographics, relevant tumor
      history, and laboratory information (hematology, biochemistry) will be captured and analyzed
      descriptively.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

      • To obtain safety information on the use of cetuximab in subjects with SCCHN according to
      the regulatory approved label and in a regular clinical setting

      Secondary objectives:

      • To gather clinical efficacy information of the treatment
