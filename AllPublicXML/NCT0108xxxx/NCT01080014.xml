      relationship with EDSS scores in subjects with MS in Argentina.

      This observational, open-label study is being conducted to correlate change in EDSS score
      with the change in MSFC scores at the end of a 2-year follow-up period for subjects with MS
      in Argentina. Measurement of disability is an indispensable parameter in assessing the
      efficacy of experimental therapeutic agents in MS as well as in trying to determine possible
      individual evolution of the disease. Clinical scales are being used as primary or secondary
      outcome measures for recording disease progression in clinical trials. Kurtzke's EDSS is
      still used as a gold standard for measuring impairment and disability in MS. The MSFC is an
      examination-based quantitative scoring of neurological impairment. This study aims to
      establish a correlation between the usefulness of both scales.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the change in MSFC score with change in EDSS scores at end of 2 year
           follow-up period for subjects with MS in Argentina

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the cross-sectional correlations in MSFC score at baseline and at 24 months
           with EDSS score at baseline and at 24 months

        -  To describe the MSFC score for MS phenotype in this population

        -  To evaluate the predictive validity of MSFC score of a subsequent EDSS change in a
           subgroup of MS patients in Argentina
