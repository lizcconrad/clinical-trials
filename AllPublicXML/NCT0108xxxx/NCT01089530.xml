      Objectives:

        -  To study the possible effects of an intensive lifestyle change program on, the plasma
           fibrinogen levels in patients with no cardiovascular disease, with a high fibrinogen and
           normal cholesterol levels, and moderate Cardiovascular Risk (CVR).

        -  To analyse whether or not the effect on fibrinogen is independent of the effect on
           lipids.

      Methods: Controlled, randomised clinical trial in 13 Basic Health Areas (BHA) in L'Hospitalet
      de Llobregat (Barcelona) and Barcelona city. Of the 436 patients between 35 and 75 years with
      no cardiovascular disease, with a high plasma fibrinogen (&gt; 300 mg/dl) and a plasma
      cholesterol &lt; 250 mg/dl, 218 received a more frequent and intensive intervention, consisting
      of advice on lifestyle changes and treatment. The follow up frequency of the intervention
      group was every two months. The other 218 patients continued with their usual care in the
      BHAs. Fibrinogen, plasma cholesterol and other clinical biochemistry parameters were
      assessed.
