             and histological, or endoscopic and radiological criteria [endoscopy not older than 12
             months or if older, then clinical signs (e.g., pain localisation, pain intensity,
             blood in stool) and behaviour (according to Montreal classification) should be
             unchanged compared to former episodes],

          -  Localisation of CD either in terminal ileum, coecum, ascending colon, or ileocolitis,

          -  Active phase of disease (200 &lt; CDAI &lt; 400),

             adequate birth control for study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known Crohn's lesions in the upper GI-tract (up to and including the jejunum) or
             rectum with present symptoms,

          -  Bowel surgery within the last 3 months,

          -  Immediate surgery required (e.g., major stenosis, serious bleeding, peritonitis,
             ileus),

          -  Clinical signs of stricturing disease,

          -  Subileus within the last 6 months (subileus with inflammatory hint allowed),

          -  Parenteral or tube feeding,

          -  Active peptic ulcer disease, local intestinal infection, or known established
             cataract,

             careful medical monitoring is not ensured,

          -  Abnormal hepatic function (ALT or ALP &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal [ULN]), liver
             cirrhosis, or portal hypertension,

          -  Abnormal renal function (Cystatin C &gt; ULN),

          -  Any severe concomitant cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, or psychiatric disorder,

          -  History of cancer in the last five years (except for non-metastatic cancers, e.g.,
             basalioma),

             tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine within the last 3 months; in case of
             treatment with azathioprine or 6 MP the drugs have to be used for maintenance of
             remission only and dosage has to be unchanged within the last 3 months before baseline
             visit and during the study,

          -  Treatment with ketoconazole or other CYP3A inhibitors within the last month before
             baseline visit,

          -  Treatment with anti-TNF-alpha therapy within 3 months before baseline visit,

          -  Conventional steroids (iv, po, rectal) within 2 weeks before baseline visit,

          -  &gt; 6 mg/d budesonide po within 2 weeks before baseline visit,

          -  Steroids for inhalation within 2 weeks before baseline visit,

          -  Patients known to be steroid-refractory,

          -  Treatment of study disease with oral antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole or
             ciprofloxacin) within the last 2 weeks,

          -  Application of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 2 weeks before
             baseline visit except ≤ 350 mg/d or short-term acetylsalicylic acid (paracetamol is

          -  Known intolerance/hypersensitivity to study drug,

          -  Existing or intended pregnancy or breast-feeding,

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last 30 days, simultaneous
