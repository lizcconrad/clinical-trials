  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, single-placebo, active-controlled, dose ranging parallel
      group design with 3 arms. Two dose regimens of CB-183,315 dosed twice daily will be compared
      with the active comparator oral vancomycin (125 milligrams (mg ) four times daily).
      Participants with diarrhea at risk for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) [for example,
      received prior or concomitant antibiotic(s)] will be identified and tested for C. difficile
      toxin in stool using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) per the
      usual standard of care. Eligible participants will be consented, undergo baseline
      evaluations, and will be randomized in a blinded fashion to one of 3 treatment arms.

      Participants will be randomized to receive either 125 mg CB-183,315 twice daily alternating
      with placebo tablets twice daily, 250 mg CB-183,315 twice daily alternating with placebo
      tablets twice daily or 125 mg oral vancomycin four times dailyover a period of 10 days in a
      1:1:1 fashion.

    <description>The number of participants with investigator assessed clinical response of failure or unable to evaluate is presented. Clinical response was determined by the participant's condition on the second day following the last dose of study medication, unless considered a treatment failure.

    <description>The number of participants with a recurrence of CDI is presented along with the number of participants without a recurrence and who were unable to be evaluated. Participants with a favorable outcome at the EOT (cure) were evaluated for recurrence of CDI. Only subjects deemed a cure at EOT were assessed for recurrence. This is the denominator used for all percentages. If diarrheal symptoms returned, participants were asked to indicate the number of unformed bowel movements (UBM) they had and have an additional C. difficile toxin test. The information to assess recurrence in participants who were deemed a cure at EOT was collected at any time during the 4-week Follow-up Period (FUP).</description>

        <description>The number of participants with a recurrence of CDI is presented along with the number of participants without a recurrence and who were unable to be evaluated. Participants with a favorable outcome at the EOT (cure) were evaluated for recurrence of CDI. Only subjects deemed a cure at EOT were assessed for recurrence. This is the denominator used for all percentages. If diarrheal symptoms returned, participants were asked to indicate the number of unformed bowel movements (UBM) they had and have an additional C. difficile toxin test. The information to assess recurrence in participants who were deemed a cure at EOT was collected at any time during the 4-week Follow-up Period (FUP).</description>
