      Cross sectional survey based on ISAAC protocol to characterize the symptoms of asthma and
      rhinitis and measure their frequency and its prevalence among secondary schools students (age
      15 to 18 years, boys and girls) in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia in period from 1st of April 2010
      to 31st of May 2010.

      The ISAAC protocol stated that the study population should consist of at least 3,000 students
      aged 15-18 years- in this case, enrolled in at least 40 randomly selected schools.

      The 15-18 year age group was chosen because it is the age most adolescents go to school
      regularly, making data collection easier. Once requested by the research team, the education
      authority will provide a list of all secondary schools in Riyadh city and the number of
      students by school and their grades.

      There are 400 secondary schools for boys and 400 school for girls (total number of boys and
      girls students 50,000).

      A two stage stratified random sample of 4000 students will be selected out of secondary
      schools for boys and girls , Their ages range from 16 to 18 years.
