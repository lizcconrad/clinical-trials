    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of OTO-104 in subjects with unilateral
      Meniere's disease. The effectiveness of OTO-104 to reduce the symptoms of Meniere's disease
      will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meniere's disease is a debilitating disorder of the inner ear which includes symptoms such as
      vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and aural fullness. Meniere's disease may result from an
      imbalance of fluid in the inner ear. Several studies have shown that corticosteroids may help
      manage this imbalance yet the effect does not last very long. OTO-104 is a longer lasting
      corticosteroid which could provide significant benefit to patients with Meniere's disease.
