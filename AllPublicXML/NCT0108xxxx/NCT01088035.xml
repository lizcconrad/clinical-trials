  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study evaluating the feasibility of concurrent carboplatin given with
      focal radiation therapy in children age 12 months to &lt; 21 years with newly diagnosed
      localized ependymoma who have no or minimal residual disease post-operatively (&lt; 0.5 cm). The
      hypothesis is that utilizing carboplatin as a radiosensitizer is feasible and tolerable and
      may improve event-free survival (EFS) and minimize local recurrences as compared to historic
      controls. Following a neurosurgical resection and staging, patients who meet the eligibility
      criteria will receive standard fractionated radiation therapy at doses of 54 to 59.4 Gy to
      the primary site depending upon age. All patients will receive 35 mg/m²/day of carboplatin
      prior to each fraction of radiotherapy. Although significant neutropenia is not anticipated,
      G-CSF will be administered per study guidelines during radiation if neutropenia occurs. All
      patients will be followed for toxicity, response (resolution of residual disease) and
      event-free survival (EFS). Patients' tumor sample, blood and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) will
      also be prospectively evaluated to quantify the level of Survivin, a known inhibitor of
      apoptosis, via immunohistochemistry, Western Blot Analysis (in tumor tissue) and ELISA (in
      blood and CSF). The feasibility of obtaining these levels prospectively and in real time will
      be evaluated.

    <description>Tolerability and toxicity will be measured by documenting the toxicities associated with this treatment using the current CTCAE version 4.0. The feasibility of this therapy will be measured by observing the ability to finish therapy without delays and the ability to receive daily carboplatin and radiation in the time alloted by the study (within 4 hours) on a daily basis. Delays in therapy will be documented in an effort to define both tolerability and feasibility.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be enrolled before treatment begins.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 12 months and &lt; 22 years of age at the time of diagnosis.

          -  The target tumors are primary brain non-metastatic (M0) ependymomas tumors. Patients
             must have histologic verification of an ependymoma at diagnosis. Patients with the
             following world health organization (WHO) diagnoses will be eligible for this
             study:Ependymoma (Subtypes: cellular, papillary, clear cell and tanycytic) and
             Anaplastic Ependymoma

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks.

          -  Newly diagnosed ependymoma and must not have had any prior chemotherapy or
             radiotherapy.

          -  All patients must have:

               -  A pre-operative MRI scan of the brain with and without contrast. NOTE: CT scans
                  are NOT sufficient for study eligibility since radiation therapy planning and
                  responses will be based on MRI scans only.

               -  Post-operative head MRI scan with and without contrast (preferably within 72
                  hours post-operatively).

               -  Spinal MRI (T-1 weighted imaging with and without gadolinium) is required within
                  28 days of surgery if done post-operatively and within 14 days of surgery if done
                  pre-operatively. For posterior fossa tumors, pre-operative MRI scans are
                  preferred because surgically induced inflammation/blood can be difficult to
                  distinguish from tumor.

               -  Lumbar CSF cytology examination obtained between 7 and 31 days following surgery.

               -  Adequate bone marrow function, defined as:

               -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500/μL

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL (transfusion independent)

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 gm/dl (may receive RBC transfusions)

               -  Adequate renal function defined as:

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal based on the patient's
                  age, or creatinine clearance greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² corrected for age and
                  body surface area.

               -  Adequate liver function defined as:

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x the institutional normal

               -  SGOT (AST) or SGPT (ALT) &lt;2.5 x institutional normals.

          -  Patients must begin chemoradiotherapy within 56 days of definitive surgery.

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent

          -  Patients must provide assent as per local IRB guidelines (if applicable).

          -  Patients and/or their families must consent to the mandatory biology studies,
             including serum Survivin levels, CSF Survivin levels, paraffin-embedded tissue and
             fresh-frozen tissue when available.

          -  Karnofsky/Lansky scoring greater than 50.

          -  Corticosteroid supportive care is permissible at the clinician's discretion prior to
             and during chemo-radiotherapy.

          -  Anti-seizure medication support is permitted as necessary and at the treating
             physician's discretion.

        Exclusion:

          -  Prior chemotherapy or prior radiotherapy

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or patients (male or female) not
             employing adequate contraception. Acceptable means of birth control include IUD, oral
             contraceptive, subdermal implant, a condom with a contraceptive sponge or suppository
             or abstinence.

          -  Patients who are unable to undergo MR imaging

          -  Patients with evidence of metastatic disease on spine MRI or CSF sampling

          -  Patients with post-operative residual tumor &gt; 0.5 cm, unless a repeat surgery is
             performed making the residual tumor less than 1.5 cm². Note: Timing for enrollment and
             initiation of therapy will begin after second surgery if a repeat surgery is
             performed.
