          -  Patients must have venous access sufficient to allow blood sampling and be compliant
             with blood draws as per the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical
             trial involving an investigational drug or device, or off-label use of a drug or
             device, or are concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not
             to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.

          -  Have pain symptoms related to traumatic injury, past surgery, structural bone or joint
             disease (such as osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendonitis), or regional pain syndrome that
