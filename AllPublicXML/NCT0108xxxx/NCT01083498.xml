      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of ablative fractional laser is
      effective in the treatment of Becker's nevus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Becker's nevus (BN) is an uncommon pigment disorder of the epidermis characterized by
      increased pigmentation, a slightly elevated, verrucous surface of the affected skin and
      sometimes hyperpigmentation. No effective treatment is available. Several laser modalities
      have been applied in the treatment of Becker's nevus in uncontrolled studies with varying
      results. Recently, fractional laser therapy was suggested as treatment option for Becker's
      nevus. In fractional laser therapy, microscopic columns of skin are coagulated or ablated,
      leaving the surrounding tissue intact, which enhances healing of the treated skin. In this
      study, the efficacy and safety of ablative fractional laser therapy was assessed in the
      treatment of Becker's nevus.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician's global assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>T0, 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of hyperpigmentation was assessed by an independent blinded dermatologist. The results were scored on a scale from zero to six (0: total clearance (100% improvement), 1: almost total clearance (90-99% improvement), 2: distinct clearance (75-89% improvement) 3: moderate clearance (50-74% improvement) 4: mild clearance (25-49% improvement) 5: no change, 6: worsening of hyperpigmentation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>L-value</measure>
    <time_frame>T0, 3 and six months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of hyperpigmentation was assessed by color measurement through reflectance spectroscopy (Microflash 200 d, Datacolor International, Lawrenceville, GA). This instrument, with an aperture of 4 mm, determines color by measuring the intensity of reflected light of particular wavelengths. In this study, the obtained L value, reflecting the lightness of the measured area of skin, was used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Melanin index</measure>
    <time_frame>T0, 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Melanin index was measured using a spectrometer (Derma-Spectrometer, Cortex Technology ApS, Hadsund, Denmark) in order to assess changes in the amount of dermal and epidermal melanin.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's global assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to score the improvement of hyperpigmentation on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (Patient's Global Assessment, PGA) at all follow-up moments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Histopathologic assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate for microscopic and ultrastructural treatment induced changes, 2 mm punch biopsies were taken from all patients at three months follow-up. Biopsies were taken from the optical centre of both treated and control site. All biopsy specimens were split for processing for light microscopy. .... was assessed by an independent blinded pathologist.</description>

    <description>In each patient, a square test region of 5-10 cm2 was treated with ablative fractional laser in three sessions in combination with intermittent topical bleaching with triple topical therapy (hydroquinone 5%, tretinoin 0.05%, triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream) to prevent laser-induced postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.
Note: this study had a split-lesion design. In each patient, two test regions were randomized to receive either ablative fractional laser therapy or no treatment.</description>
