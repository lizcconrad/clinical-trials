      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing or
      by stopping them from spreading. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving ixabepilone together with vorinostat may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and
      best dose of vorinostat when given together with ixabepilone in treating patients with breast
      cancer that has spread to another place in the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of vorinostat with
      ixabepilone.

      II. To determine the best schedule for delivery of this drug combination. III. To recommend a
      phase II dose of vorinostat in combination with ixabepilone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate and/or clinical benefit rate. II. To assess the
      toxicity profile.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collecting circulating tumor cells pre and post-treatment to study its deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) somatic mutation and methylation assay after the introduction of histone
      deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors and ixabepilone.

      II. To determine whether administration of vorinostat with ixabepilone will alter the
      pharmacokinetics of vorinostat.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I (Cohort A): Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14 and ixabepilone
      intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 2. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II (Cohort B): Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21.
      Patients also receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

          -  The effects of vorinostat and ixabepilone on the developing human fetus at the
             recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days of registration; should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately and the patient will be withdrawn
             from the study

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential is willing to use 2 adequate barrier methods
             of contraception to prevent pregnancy or agrees to abstain from heterosexual activity
