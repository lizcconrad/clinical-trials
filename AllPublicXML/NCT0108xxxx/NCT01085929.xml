  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of skin and soft tissue infections has increased dramatically over the last
      decade, in part due to increased prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). Incision and drainage (I&amp;D) is considered the primary
      intervention, however some clinicians prefer ultrasound guided needle aspiration (US Asp).
      The investigators performed a randomized trial comparing US Asp to I&amp;D for uncomplicated skin
      and soft tissue abscesses, with a subgroup analysis of patients with CA-MRSA.
