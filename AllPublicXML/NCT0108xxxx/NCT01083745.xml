  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of infertility in the majority of patients with poor response to ovarian
      stimulation remains unknown. This study will investigate the role of immune cells (T cells, B
      cells, dendritic cells and NK cells), that constitute the immune system which normally fights
      infection and cancer. We, the investigators, have found that specialized NK cells that help
      with new blood vessel formation, are found in the fluid surrounding the egg during IVF, only
      in patients with good response to ovarian stimulation. We now wish to expand our studies and
      correlate our findings to ovarian blood flow , as measured by 3D ultrasound and to the
      presence of other cells in the immune system.
