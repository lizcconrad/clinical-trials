    <textblock>
      EMD Serono decided to terminate enrollment based on a review of the available clinical data
      and low probability of completing the trial based on the observed recruitment rate. Subjects
      already enrolled in the study continued participation in the study, consistent with the
      protocol, to study completion.

      The goal of this research study is to investigate for the first time the safety and
      tolerability of a new drug (AS703569), called an aurora kinase inhibitor, being tested to
      treat blood cancers in patients with different blood cancers. The research study will also
      assess how the body breaks down AS703569 and what changes occur in the blood after oral doses
      of AS703569. It will also look to see if there is any improvement in your blood cancer. The
      use of AS703569 in this study is experimental.
