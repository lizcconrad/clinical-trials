      Conventional intestinal manometry is the current gold standard for the evaluation of
      intestinal motility, and identifies patterns of intestinal dysmotility. However intestinal
      manometry involves intestinal intubation with consequent discomfort for the patients, and
      requires considerable technical expertise and knowledge for interpretation of the data.
      Hence, to date this method has limited indications and is restricted to very few referral
      centers around the world.

      A novel method for evaluation of intestinal motility has been developed based on endoluminal
      image analysis using the endoscopic PillCam capsule, In contrast to manometry, this technique
      is minimally invasive, the technical aspects are simple, and the analysis is fully automated
      by a computer program.

      The technique has been validated in a group of patients with intestinal dysmotility and
      healthy subjects, and has demonstrated over 90% sensitivity and specificity.

      This technique needs now to be validated in a large multinational population, to further
      develop a robust discrimination algorithm for widespread diagnostic application. Furthermore,
      whereas manometry only recognizes neuropathic, myopathic and obstructive motor patterns,
      endoluminal image analysis may identify different categories of patients depending on the
      clinical presentation and the etiologic factors involved.

      This study is designed to provide evidence that the algorithm, using images created by
      PillCam SB2 capsules, is at least as good as small bowel manometry in diagnosing severe
      dysmotility.

      Conventional intestinal manometry is the current gold standard for the evaluation of
      intestinal motility1,2,3,11, and identifies patterns of intestinal dysmotility4,8,9. However
      intestinal manometry involves intestinal intubation with consequent discomfort for the
      patients. Furthermore, it requires considerable technical expertise and knowledge for
      interpretation of the data. Hence, to date this method has limited indications and is
      restricted to very few referral centers around the world6,7,10,13.

      Vall d'Hebron Hospital, in collaboration with CVC (Barcelona, Spain) have recently developed
      a minimally invasive method for evaluation of intestinal motility based on endoluminal image
      analysis using the endoscopic PillCam capsule. In contrast to manometry, this technique is
      minimally invasive, the technical aspects are simple, and the analysis is performed fully
      automated by a computer program. Both the technical procedure of the test and the endoluminal
      image analysis program has been developed by a multidisciplinary medical-engineering team in
      the Autonomous University of Barcelona over the past 5 years. The technique has been
      validated in a group of patients with intestinal dysmotility and healthy subjects, and has
      demonstrated over 90% sensitivity and specificity.

      In brief, the technique works as follows. In each study a series of features are analyzed:
      contractile patterns (contractions evaluated as a diaphragmatic occlusion of the lumen and by
      the presence of a radial wrinkle pattern), non contractile patterns (wall and tunnel
      patterns), luminal content (turbid pattern), endoluminal motion, and capsule displacement.

      The program is based on an automated learning method (machine learning technique). Data from
      patients and healthy subjects are used as a training set. Based on these data, the program
      develops the function that best discriminates both groups. The performance of the system has
      been validated using the leave-one-out method that uses all but one as training set and
      evaluates the left-out example.

      This technique needs now to be validated in a large multinational population. Using this
      expanded pool of studies as a learning set, a robust discrimination algorithm will be
      developed, that can be made available for widespread diagnostic application. Furthermore,
      whereas manometry only recognizes neuropathic, myopathic5,12 and obstructive motor patterns,
      endoluminal image analysis may identify different categories of patients depending on the
      clinical presentation and the etiologic factors involved.

      This study is designed to provide evidence that the algorithm, using images created by
      PillCam SB2 capsules, is at least as good as small bowel manometry in diagnosing severe
      dysmotility.

        symptoms with inability to maintain normal body weight: abdominal symptoms (such as nausea,
        abdominal distension, discomfort or pain) produce inability to maintain a normal body
        weight as defined by unintentional weight loss of at least 10% of original body weight
        before onset of symptoms or a BMI &lt; 18.5, while on a normal diet (without oral dietary
        supplements, enteral or parenteral feeding).

        These should be chronic symptoms lasting at least 6 months.

             GI tract.

          -  Known history of small bowel organic disease such as Crohn's Disease or Celiac.

          -  Patient suffers from any condition, such as swallowing problems or having an implanted

          -  During the period between small bowel manometry and Capsule endoscopy, the patient has
             undergone any abdominal surgical procedures other than appendectomy, cholecystectomy,
             abdominal wall hernia repair or catheter placing for enteral feeding.

          -  Manometry was performed before any other allowed GI procedure.

          -  Patient is pregnant.

          -  Known abuse of alcohol or illicit substances.

          -  Patient presently presenting with an acute life threatening condition.

          -  Participating in another clinical study within 30 days.
