      The eyelid warming device is designed to relieve the symptoms of dysfunction of the glands in
      the eyelids.

      Prospective, non comparative, open, monocentre study.

      The objectives are:

        -  To verify and establish the temperature of the eyelids and cornea for each eye before
           and after 10 minutes device application

        -  To evaluate the ocular surface, NIBUT and IOP before and after device application

        -  To determine the acceptability of healthy volunteers on the practical use of this device

      The subjects will attend 2 visits.
