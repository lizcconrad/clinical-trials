  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients included in this observational study will be drawn from a research database
      containing claims and enrollment data for members of a large, geographically diverse US
      health plan. The objective of this study is to estimate the rate of serious infections,
      tuberculosis, malignancies, and other outcomes in psoriasis patients treated with
      ustekinumab, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologics, non-anti-TNF biologics, or systemic
      non-biological treatments.

      The participants included in this study will be drawn from the Ingenix Normative Health
      Informatics Database, a proprietary research database containing claims and enrollment data
      dating back to 1993 for members of a large, geographically diverse US health plan. This study
      will include cohorts of participants who have claims consistent with a diagnosis of psoriasis
      and who initiate ustekinumab, anti-TNF biologics, non-anti-TNF biologics, or systemic
      non-biological treatments. Participants will be identified by claims bearing codes for
      dispensed drugs, procedures or diagnoses and followed after the launch of ustekinumab for up
      to 8 years. A sample of enrolled health plan members without claims evidence of diagnosis or
      treatment of psoriasis will also be selected. The claims database will be used to estimate
      the incidence of the primary outcomes of serious infections, tuberculosis (TB) and non-TB
      mycobacterial infections, malignancies such as lymphoma, and other selected outcomes.
      Potential cases of the study outcome identified through claims may be confirmed through
      medical record review. No study agents will be administered in this study. All patients will
      receive standard-of-care treatment as prescribed by their physician.
