      This is a randomized controlled pilot study investigating signals involved in drug resistance
      to chemotherapy.

      Patient will be randomized to undergo observation or to receive Everolimus after completion

             cancer;

          -  Tumor of 3 cm or greater at time of diagnosis

          -  Measurable primary tumor after neoadjuvant treatment before randomization

          -  No prior chemotherapy for breast cancer;

          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 or Karnofsky performace status ≥ 70%

          -  Adequate liver/renal function

          -  Able to swallow whole tablets.

          -  Able to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male patient

          -  Prior history of other malignancy within 5 years of study entry, aside from
             contralateral breast carcinoma, appropriately treated cervical carcinoma in situ, or
             adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  Distant metastasis, including skin involvement beyond the breast area

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator, excess risk
             associated with study participation or study drug administration, or which, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
             study
