  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse is associated with a variety of clinical diseases, but studies on prevalence of
      different somatic diseases among alcohol abusers are lacking. Studies on populations in an
      out-day patients' clinic are also lacking.

      The investigators aim to study somatic health standard in an out-day patients' clinic
      population of alcohol abusers, with regard to prevalence of different kinds of somatic
      diseases, and how the interaction of somatic and psychiatric treatment can influence on
      patients quality of life. Clinical examination including blood samples and echocardiographic
      examinations in all participants, other additional examinations (as x-ray, CT or MRI if
      indicated by clinical findings).

      Retrospective methods will be used to study former somatic disease, cross-section design to
      study present somatic disease and prospective design to study quality of life, psychiatric
      and somatic health after combination of psychiatric and somatic examinations and treatment.
