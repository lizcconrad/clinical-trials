    <textblock>
      Within a randomized controlled design the effects of a brief early psychological intervention
      (child, parents) after road traffic accidents or burns shall be examined in a sample of 120
      children and adolescents (aged 2 to 16 years). During the first seven days after the accident
      a screening for the risk of developing a posttraumatic stress disorder is conducted to divide
      the participants into a &quot;high risk&quot; and a &quot;low risk&quot; group. Participants with a low risk are
      excluded from the intervention study but reassessed six months after their accident to
      validate the screening instrument. After a baseline assessment within 14 days after the
      accident participants of the high risk group are randomly assigned to an intervention group
      (n = 60) or a control group (n = 60). The latter receive standard medical care. Children of
      the intervention group are provided with a brief age appropriate two-session intervention
      that includes a detailed reconstruction of the accident, psychoeducation and discussion of
      helpful coping strategies. Both the control and the intervention group are reassessed by
      blind raters at 3 and 6 months after the accident. Assessment of outcome includes measures of
      posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, behavior, and health-related quality of
      life.
