  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The South Asian Community, people with origins in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives,
      Nepal, Sri Lanka, or Bhutan, are more likely to get diabetes, get diabetes at younger ages,
      and do worse health-wise once they have diabetes than the general population. This study will
      test the feasibility and community acceptability of a culturally appropriate lifestyle
      intervention for the prevention of diabetes in the South Asian community. The outcomes of
      this project could be used to plan larger interventions to prevent diabetes in South Asians,
      a rapidly growing segment of the US population.

    <description>The intervention will be based on the Diabetes Prevention Program but tailored to the needs of the community based on feedback gathered in focus groups. Classes will be group-based and will use a variety of teaching techniques and group-based work to teach participants about behavior change, diet, and physical activity. Participant will be required to attend one group exercise class per week based on traditional Indian dances and other culturally appropriate activities. In order to reach their weekly exercise goal of 150 minutes or more per week, participants will also be able to attend an additional group exercise class, an organized group walk, do a culturally-tailored work out video created by the study staff, and/or exercise on their own.</description>
