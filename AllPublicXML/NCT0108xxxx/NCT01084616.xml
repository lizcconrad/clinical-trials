      It is known that vaginal bacteria have an impact upon the health status of the host, in some
      cases protecting against infection and in other cases causing infection, depending on the
      bacterial types present. This study will compare the composition of vaginal bacteria to
      symptoms of vaginal dryness in order to try and identify if certain bacteria might cause some
      of the problems associated with vaginal dryness among post-menopausal women.
