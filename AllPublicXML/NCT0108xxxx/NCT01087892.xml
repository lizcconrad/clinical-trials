  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics are currently required to treat patients in hospital when they have an infection,
      but these antibiotics can cause side effects such as diarrhoea and in some patients a serious
      form of gut infection with an organism called Clostridium difficile. This organism can
      produce toxins in the gut causing a severe form of diarrhoea associated with a lot of ill
      health, and in some circumstances can be fatal. Some studies have shown that yogurts' or
      Probiotics' (special drinks with a defined concentration of useful bacteria) taken by
      patients can have a beneficial effect in reducing the diarrhoea associated with antibiotics
      use. The aim of the present study is to find out whether the use of one of these Probiotics
      in hospitalised patients taking antibiotics will result in less diarrhoea, less Clostridium
      difficile infection, as well as cost saving. The study will also analyze the effects of
      probiotics on quality of life and length of hospital stay.

      As part of this study, we will look at both microbiological and immunological markers, in
      addition to analyzing the overall cost implications by analysis of health economics.
