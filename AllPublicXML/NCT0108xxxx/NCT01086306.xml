      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of hospitalizations for infections
      among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are new initiators of Saxagliptin and those
      who are new initiators of Oral Anti-Diabetic Drug (OADs) in classes other than DPP4
      inhibitors; and to compare the incidence of hospitalizations with infections associated with
      T-lymphocyte dysfunction (i.e., herpes zoster, tuberculosis, or non-tuberculous mycobacterial
      infections [evaluated as a composite outcome]) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      who are new initiators of Saxagliptin and those who are new initiators of OADs in classes
      other than DPP4 inhibitors.

        This study will be carried out using databases containing administrative claims data
        [HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD) and Medicare in the U.S.] and electronic
        medical records [General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and The Health Improvement
        Network (THIN) in the UK]. The US population includes patients from health plans in the
        northeast, southeastern, mid-Atlantic, central, mid-western, and western regions (HIRD) as
        well as US citizens 65 years of age and older (Medicare). The UK population includes
        patients seeking medical care from general practitioners (GPRD and THIN)
