  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date the standard non-surgical treatment strategy for treating un-ruptured intracranial
      aneurysms is the use of either coils or self-expandable stents. This post-market clinical
      investigation compares the efficacy of using the CE-marked, commercially available SILK
      Artery Reconstruction Device against commercially available intracranial coils in the
      endovascular treatment (occlusion) of intracranial aneurysms.

      To date the standard non-surgical treatment strategy for treating un-ruptured intracranial
      aneurysms is the use of either coils or self-expandable stents. The flow diverter stent
      concept is based upon the hemodynamic exclusion of the aneurysm sac, without coils being
      eventually placed within the sac. The primary objective of this post-market clinical
      investigation is to demonstrate that when using the CE-marked, commercially available SILK
      Artery Reconstruction Device in the indication for which it is approved, notably for the
      treatment (occlusion) of intracranial aneurysms, the anatomical results are superior compared
      to standard treatment with commercially available intracranial coils (used with eventual
      balloon remodeling and/or stents when necessary). It is a prospective, randomized, unblinded,
      multi-center post-market clinical investigation. The patient population comprises a maximum
      of 160 subjects with at least one documented untreated, unruptured intracranial aneurysm
      suitable for occlusion with an intracranial device. Subject enrollment will require a maximum
      of 18 months. Enrolled subjects will be followed for 12 months after treatment.

    <description>The primary objective is to demonstrate that when using the SILK Artery Reconstruction Device in the indication for which it is approved, notably for the treatment (occlusion) of intracranial aneurysms, the anatomical results are superior compared to standard treatment with commercially available intracranial coils. Therefore, angiographic assessment will measure efficacy by determining the percentage of subjects in each of the two arms experiencing complete occlusion of the aneurysm at 12 months post-procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated as follows:
Peri-procedural ischemic and hemorrhagic adverse events
Peri-procedural technical complications
Death from any cause
Neurological deterioration
Cranial nerve deficit
General adverse events
In addition, Subject Quality of Life (QOL) will be measured at baseline and at 12 months post-procedure using the EuroQol questionnaire.</description>
