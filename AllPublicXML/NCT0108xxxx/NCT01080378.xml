  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to investigate in depth the impact of birth weight on
      the nature of metabolic physiology, body composition and epigenetic differences of the
      different phenotypes of overweight and obese individuals who are otherwise overtly healthy.
      We also aim to determine the efficacy of a weight loss intervention on the above mentioned
      metabolic parameters in these individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an exponential rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity in Singapore
      coincident with rapid nutritional and socioeconomic transition. Differing birth weights, even
      in the normal ranges, predisposes individuals to the risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity. We
      aim to examine the causal pathways, developmental contribution and effects of a weight loss
      intervention to this differential by evaluating the hypothesis that genomic, birth weight,
      developmental, lifestyle and environmental factors contribute to the variation in phenotype
      observed in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome.

      Although there are many large studies that examined the effect of birth weight on the
      expression of obesity and the metabolic syndrome phenotype, most of these studies usually
      lack in-depth physiological and epigenetic/genomic studies due to their large sample sizes.
      We therefore aim to explore such detailed aspects of physiological and epigenetic/genomic
      profiles on smaller but statistically powered samples, focusing on evaluating body
      composition, nutritional and metabolic phenotype in relationship to epigenetic/genetic
      markers and developmental history. In addition, we examine the effects of a weight loss
      intervention on these parameters. This will assist in weighing the importance of
      developmental and genetic pathways in contributing to individual risk and the response and
      efficacy to an intervention.

    <description>Participants will be enrolled into a 16 weeks weight loss programme that consists of (a) dietary interventions and (b) structured exercise sessions and (c) physical activity to achieve 7 - 10% decrease (more than 8 kg) in initial body weight in 16 weeks. They will be subjected to a caloric deficit of 40% of the subject's energy expenditure or 1000kcal, which ever it is higher. (allowance given for dietary control and physical activity).</description>
