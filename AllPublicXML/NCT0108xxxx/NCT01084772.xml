  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess outcomes following TKA, utilizing two surgical
      techniques. Patients will be randomized to one of two arms: TKA with standard instrumentation
      and TKA with VISIONAIRE™ patient-matched cutting blocks. Data will be collected at
      preoperative, operative/discharge, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years after TKA. The secondary
      objective of this study is to compare the safety, quality of life, and economic outcomes of
      TKA when these two techniques are utilized. This study does not involve treatment or
      investigational products, as all components are FDA cleared and are commercially available.

      This is a prospective study comparing VISIONAIRE™ to standard TKA instrumentation. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TKA using VISIONAIRE™ when
      compared with standard instrumentation, including device survival, improvement in function
      and implant alignment after TKA. This study will also document any device-related, surgical
      complications and/or adverse radiographic observations.

      In contrast with the control group clinical outcomes following TKA completed with VISIONAIRE™
      have yet to be assessed. The current investigation will determine if there is any difference
      in TKA outcomes when VISIONAIRE™ patient matched technology is utilized versus standard
      instrumentation. All patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in this
      protocol will be asked to participate in the study. If the patient consents to participate,
      they will be enrolled in the study and randomized to one of the two study arms. Patients
      requiring TKA will be implanted with Legion, Genesis II or Journey BCS (Smith &amp; Nephew) total
      knee implant systems. Standard instrumentation will be used to assist the surgeon in placing
      the implant in the control group. In the VISIONAIRE™ group, standard instrumentation will not
      be used in the surgery. Patients randomized to the VISIONAIRE™ arm will have an MRI
      preoperatively that will be used to create the customized cutting blocks. All patients will
      have an x-ray at each postoperative interval.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria.

          1. Patient diagnosed with degenerative arthritis of the knee requiring a unilateral
             primary TKA.

          2. Patient is of legal age to consent and is skeletally mature.

          3. Patient is willing to sign and date an ethics-approved consent form.

          4. Patient is willing to be available for two-year follow-up postoperatively

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients must not meet any of the exclusion criteria.

          1. Patient is known to have poor bone stock making a TKA unjustifiable.
