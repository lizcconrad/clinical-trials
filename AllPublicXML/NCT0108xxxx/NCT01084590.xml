  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pediatric primary care setting is a relatively untapped resource for addressing obesity
      prevention. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a relatively low cost
      pediatric primary-care based obesity prevention intervention. The intervention will consist
      of brief pediatrician counseling as well as phone coaching for parents with overweight
      children who are between the ages of five and nine. We propose to enroll and randomize 425
      parent-child dyads with children who have a measured body mass index (BMI) the 75th and 95th
      percentile. They will be randomized one of into two groups, the (a) Healthy Eating/Physical
      Activity Intervention, or the (b) General Healthy/Safety/Injury Prevention Contact Control
      Intervention. Both groups will receive brief pediatrician counseling regarding their child's
      current BMI percentile status and recommendations for home environmental changes to achieve a
      healthy weight gain trajectory and to improve home safety and reduce injury risk. This will
      be paired with a 12 month home-based program delivered via phone by health behavior
      specialists to help parents make environmental changes specific to their group assignment.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a relatively low cost pediatric
      primary-care based intervention that integrates brief pediatric counseling and a home-based
      phone program to prevent unhealthy weight gain in overweight children ages five-nine.
      Parent-child dyads will be recruited for the Healthy Homes/Healthy Kids Study via a
      multi-step process including use of electronic medical record data to identify children,
      pediatrician approval, and outreach via letters and phone calls. Four hundred and twenty five
      parent-child dyads from pediatric primary care will be recruited to participate and be
      randomized to one of two interventions:

      Healthy Eating/Physical Activity Home-based Intervention: This intervention arm will include
      brief pediatrician counseling regarding the child's current BMI percentile status,
      recommendations for home environmental changes to achieve a healthy weight gain trajectory,
      and home safety and injury risk reduction environmental recommendations paired with a 12
      month home-based program delivered via phone by a masters-level health behavior specialist to
      promote implementation of the obesity prevention home environmental strategies.

      Safety/Injury Prevention Home-based Contact Control Intervention: This intervention arm will
      include the same brief counseling from the pediatrician paired with a 12 month home-based
      program delivered via phone by a masters-level health behavior specialist to promote
      implementation of the safety and injury prevention home environmental strategies.

    <description>Children at risk for obesity (defined as having a BMI%ile between the 75th and 85th%ile) whose parent participates in the Healthy Eating/Physical Activity Intervention will have a significantly lower BMI percentile at 12 and 24 month-follow up when compared to children whose parents participated in the Safety/Injury Prevention Intervention.</description>
