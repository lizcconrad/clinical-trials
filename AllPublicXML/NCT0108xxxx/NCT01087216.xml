    <textblock>
      The treatment of vitiligo remains disappointing especially in some localization such as bony
      prominences and extremities. The association of UVB and topical steroids has been proven to
      be synergistic but the results are still insufficient in those difficult to treat areas.
      Promising results have been shown with the combination of laser assisted dermabrasion,
      topical 5FU and UVB. The investigators hypothesize that the dermabrasion of vitiligo skin
      followed by topical steroids should potentialized the effect of UVB and be superior to
      topical steroids and UVB without dermabrasion.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of laser assisted dermabrasion
      combined to topical steroids and UVB phototherapy in difficult to treat areas.

      Patients with symmetrical non segmental vitiligo will be included in this prospective
      randomized monocentrer study. The investigators calculated the number of patients needed at
      25. The side that will receive the dermabrasion will be centrally randomized and the opposite
      side will serve as control. Then on both side class 3 topical steroids will be applied daily
      3 weeks on 4 for 12 weeks. UVB phototherapy will be performed twice weekly also for 12 weeks.

      The evaluation will be performed by two independent physician blinded to the treatment of
      standardized photos before and 1 month after the end of the treatment. The criteria of
      success will be at least 75% of repigmentation.
