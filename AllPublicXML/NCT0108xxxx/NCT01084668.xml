  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this post-marketing observational study (PMOS) was to obtain further data on
      long-term safety, efficacy, and quality of life outcomes for adalimumab in routine clinical
      use in participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis after unsustainable
      clinical response to other biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (BDMARDs). There
      are few data so far showing the effects of switching from other BDMARDs to adalimumab in
      patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. This study was designed to
      evaluate the long-term effectiveness of adalimumab in participants with moderate to severe
      chronic plaque psoriasis using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) in participants
      previously treated with efalizumab, infliximab, or etanercept and who either never achieved
      satisfactory response, achieved satisfactory response initially but lost it over time, or
      discontinued treatment due to intolerance/side effect(s) or other reasons, for example after
      regular stop of etanercept.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a non-interventional PMOS conducted in a prospective, single-country, multicenter
      format to assess the quality of life of psoriasis patients taking adalimumab as prescribed by
      their physician in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regard
      to dose, population, and indication. The prescription of adalimumab was clearly separated
      from the decision to include the participant in this study. No procedures other than standard
      of care were to have been performed. Visits were non-interventional and timing of participant
      appointments was left to each physician. After therapy initiation, visits occurred over 12
      months usually close to Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 for a total of 6 visits (Visits 1 through
      6 including Screening). Because participant visits were left to the physician, participant
      failure to meet the suggested visit weeks did not constitute a breach of the protocol.

    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion visit (Week 0), Week 4, Week 36, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is based on assessment of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling), and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (best outcome) to 72 (worst outcome).</description>

    <measure>Reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Score of at Least 75% (PASI75)</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion visit (Week 0) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>PASI75 is the number of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 52 (final visit). PASI score is based on assessment of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling), and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (best outcome) to 72 (worst outcome).</description>

    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion visit (Week 0), Week 4, Week 36, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much, a lot, a little, or not at all. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst).</description>

    <measure>Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion visit (Week 0), Week 4, Week 36, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The nails are graded for nail matrix psoriasis and nail bed psoriasis. The sum of these two scores is the total score for that nail. Per nail, the NAPSI score ranges from 0 (no nail psoriasis) to 4 (most severe nail psoriasis).</description>

    <description>Tolerability and safety were assessed by collecting adverse events during the course of the study up to 70 days following the last dose of physician-prescribed adalimumab. The number of participants experiencing a serious or non-serious adverse event is summarized. See the Reported Adverse Event section for details.</description>
