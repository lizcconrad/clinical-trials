    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to survey female cancer patients' awareness of and preference
      for methods to improve sexual health. This information will help to improve our understanding
      of the needs and preferences for sexual health strategies and interventions of our female
      patients.

      The findings of this survey will also be used to develop feasible sexual health resources for
      our patients and enhance the success of grant proposals to support future sexual health
      interventions at MSKCC.
