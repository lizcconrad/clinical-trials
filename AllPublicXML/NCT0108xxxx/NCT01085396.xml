    <textblock>
      This study is designed to collect information about melanoma using a research probe, a device
      placed only on the skin. This study will investigate whether using the probe to examine skin
      lesions could improve the accuracy of identification pre-cancerous melanoma lesions or to
      predict the risk melanoma in the skin of subjects. Ultimately, we would see this technique
      used routinely as a non-invasive device during subjects' skin examination to aid
      dermatologists to identify pre-cancerous (melanoma) lesions without taking tissue samples of
      the skin. Alternatively, this technique would, in the future, also be used to screen patients
      at risk for melanoma.

      A pigmented lesion is removed as part of the subjects routine care when it is felt to be
      suspicious for severe atypica or early malignancy, and sometimes because the patient desires
      removal of lesions for cosmetic reasons, or because the lesion is irritated or located in a
      zone of traum.

      For this research study, samples of the tumor tissue from these clinical care biopsies will
      be studied.

      Researchers will look at markers and search for additional characteristics that may help them
      better understand Melanoma. This will be optional to subjects. If subjects do not agree to
      have their tissue kept for future research purposes they can still participate in the rest of
      this study.
