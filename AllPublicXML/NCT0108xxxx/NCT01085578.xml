      Evaluation of Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of CG400549 in Healthy
      Volunteers

    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, 2-part study consisting of a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled,single ascending dose (SAD) part (in 2 alternating panels) and a
      1-sequence food effect (FE) part. In the SAD part, 2 cohorts of 6 healthy male subjects each
      received a single oral dose of CG400549 or placebo in 3 periods, randomized such that each
      subject received active treatment twice and placebo once (in each period, 4 subjects received
      active drug and 2 received placebo). In the FE part, 1 cohort of 6 healthy male subjects
      received a single oral dose of CG400549 in the fasted state in Period 1 and a single oral
      dose of CG400549 in the fed state in Period 2.
