  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if a new approach to repair perforated ulcers in the stomach
      (holes in the stomach) or the first part of the intestine is possible. Traditionally, either
      open operations (large single incision) or laparoscopic operations (multiple small
      camera-guided incisions) have been used to repair perforated ulcers. Over the last ten years,
      some surgeons have used endoscopic equipment to assist them with performing the procedure. It
      is unknown if perforated ulcer repair can be done using an endoscope as the main instrument
      (a flexible tube with a video camera inserted into the stomach through your esophagus) to
      &quot;patch&quot; or plug the perforation. We will patch the perforation using a standard method which
      uses tissue from outside the stomach. A laparoscopic camera will also be used to assist our
      view. This study is intended to be a feasibility study to demonstrate the endoscopic
      technique can be safely performed

      Hypothesis: The primary outcome is successful completion of the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perforation is the most dangerous complication of gastroduodenal ulcer disease. It accounts
      for more than 70% of deaths associated with peptic ulcer disease. In addition to age and
      concomitant disease, intervention related complications are statistically significant
      predictors of death after hospital stay. Age, time to presentation and comorbidities are not
      factors that can be influenced. If it would be possible to reduce the impact of procedure
      related complications or the &quot;second hit&quot;, that may lead to decreased morbidity and
      mortality.

      This will be a pilot clinical study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of endoscopic
      translumenal omental patch closure. Patients with the clinical diagnosis of a perforated
      viscus who are scheduled to undergo surgical exploration will be recruited. Endoscopic
      translumenal omental patch will be attempted first if the patient has no contraindication.
      Should this prove unsuccessful, the surgical team will proceed with conversion to
      laparoscopic or open standard surgical therapy as indicated.

          <title>Endoscopic Translumenal Omental Patch</title>
          <description>Patients with the clinical diagnosis of a perforated viscus who are scheduled to undergo surgical exploration will be recruited. The endoscope will be gently advanced through the ulcer. Irrigation with saline will proceed. Then a viable mobile piece of omentum will be identified and pulled into the ulcer. After the omentum is located in the stomach, clips will be used to fix the Endoscopic Translumenal Omental Patch in place.
