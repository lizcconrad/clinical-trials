    <textblock>
      Using health behavior theories and theories related to the effects of persuasive messages
      (i.e., inoculation theory), we plan to: 1. Systematically test the effects of brief
      persuasive message interventions on receipt of the first dose of HPV vaccine; and 2. evaluate
      the effects of the interventions on followup with subsequent doses of vaccine (using reminder
      notices with persuasive message content). One set of interventions will involve a comparison
      of a 1 sided message, which only emphasizes the positive aspects of a recommended behavior,
      with a 2 sided message, which presents negative aspects of the behavior followed by positive
      counterarguments. A second set of interventions will involve a test of a social compliance
      (foot-in-the-door technique, in which half of the parent participants will be asked to
      respond to a high compliance request (i.e., a request likely to generate high compliance,
      such as, &quot;Do you want to protect your daughter from cancer? or for male children, &quot;Do you
      want to protect your son from genital warts?&quot;before subsequently being asked about actually
      having their adolescents vaccinated. The other half of the parents will not receive a high
      compliance request. Parents of 11-14 year old adolescents will be randomized to the two sets
      of interventions, resulting in a 2 X 2 design: message sidedness (1 sided; 2 sided) and
      social compliance request (yes; no). The specific aims of this proposal are to evaluate the
      1) efficacy of 2 sided vs. 1 sided messages on rates of HPV vaccination; 2) the efficacy of a
      social compliance intervention on rates of HPV vaccination; and 3) potential moderators and
      mediators of message effect on vaccine acceptance.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study will employ a randomized, full factorial experimental design to examine
      the effects of brief message interventions on parents' acceptance of the first dose of HPV
      vaccine for their adolescents aged 11-14 years, as well as follow through with subsequent
      doses. Specifically, the study will employ a 2 x 2 experimental design, in which participants
      will be assigned randomly to one of two different message sidedness conditions (1 sided vs. 2
      sided) and two social compliance conditions (high compliance request [HCR] vs. noHCR). The
      interventions will be administered by a bilingual research assistant who will read, verbatim,
      scripts provided to them. Computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) will be used to gather
      demographic and background information as well as parental health beliefs regarding
      preexisting worries about HPV vaccine leading to safety concerns (moderator variable) prior
      to administration of the interventions. After the interventions, additional health beliefs
      will be assessed (mediators).

        1. A greater proportion of girls as compared to boys will receive a first dose of vaccine.

        2. Among both girls and boys who receive a first dose of Gardasil™, no differences in
           completion rates will be detected.

        3. The social compliance intervention to be more effective with parents of girls as
           compared to parents of boys. This prediction of a differential effect is based on the
           fact that cervical cancer will be seen as a more serious and less stigmatizing condition
           than genital warts.

      In summary, the implementation of this protocol will allow us to systematically examine the
      use of two different interventions on parents of both boys and girls. Thus, parents (n=800)
      of 11-14 year old girls and boys will be randomized to the two sets of interventions,
      resulting in a 2 X 2 design: message sidedness (1-sided; 2-sided) and HCR (yes; no).
