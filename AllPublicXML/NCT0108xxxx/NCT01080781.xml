      -  Background : Ephrin-B1 is part of the large Eph/Ephrin system which is involved in
           cell-cell comunication. The role of Ephrin-B1 has scarcely been studied in adulthood.
           Our team has shown that this protein is expressed in normal heart in mice and humans. In
           mice with deletion of the gene encoding Ephrin-B1, we have shown progressive development
           of dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by dramatic disorganization of cardiac tissue
           architecture and decreased heart rate variability.

        -  Purpose: Ephrin-B1 protein was recently identified in human heart but its putative role
           remains unknown. In knockout mice, deletion of efn gene is associated with abnormalities
           in cardiac architecture linked to defects in cell-cell tight junctions. From a
           functional point of view, mice develop a dilated cardiomyopathy and exhibit decreased
           heart rate variability in the frequency domain. The purpose of this study is to assess
           if Ephrin-B1 expression is regulated in human heart and if expression level correlates
           with heart rate variability.

        -  Abstract: Thirty patients suffering from cardiac disease needing surgery will be
           included and separated in two groups according to pressure levels in right auricle /and
           or pulmonary artery. Ephrin-B1 expression will be assessed in right appendages at both
           the transcriptional (quantitative PCR) and protein (Western blot) levels. Furthermore,
           the putative relationship between Ephrin-B1 expression and heart rate variability (24
           hours ECG recordings) will be investigated.

      -  Outcomes

        -  Primary: Expression level of gene encoding Ephrin B1 (quantitative PCR normalized
           against GAPDH gene expression) on human right appendage biopsies

        -  Secondary: a/ Expression level of Ephrin B1 protein on human right appendage using
           Western blot and b/ Heart rate variability in both time and spectral domains

        -  Study design: Exploratory, monocentric , prospective and comparative. Two groups of 15
           patients each, age and sex matched, with or without elevated pressures in right auricles
           or pulmonary arteries will be included.

        -  Eligibility criteria:

             -  Inclusion criteria: patients needing cardiac surgery and who had both right
                catheterism and 24 hours ECG recording before inclusion; stable medications for at
                least 4 weeks; age &gt; 18 years.

             -  Exclusion criteria: Patient with pace-maker or atrial fibrillation

        -  Number of subjects: 30 patients in two groups of 15 patients each.

        -  Statistical analysis: Qualitative and quantitative variables will be compared using
           McNemar test and t test respectively. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered as
           significant.
