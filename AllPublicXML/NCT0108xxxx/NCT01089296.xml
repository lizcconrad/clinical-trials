  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic randomized controlled study. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the
      practice and effect of customised physiotherapy on preterm infants`motor development when the
      intervention is performed over a period of three weeks while the infant resides in the
      neonatal intensive care unit. The study will also attempt to analyze the parents` experiences
      in being actively involved in education and practice of the intervention designed to promote
      the child`s motor development, and the effects on the parent-child relationship in the short
      and long term.The children are followed up until a corrected age of two years. This study
      consists of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial and a qualitative study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants born preterm with an gestational age below 32 weeks have an increased risk of
      developing different grades and types of abnormalities, among them delayed motor development,
      co-ordination difficulties and cerebral palsy. The prevalence of serious developmental
      abnormalities increases the lower the gestational age and birth weight. The reported
      incidence of mild developmental abnormalities is 15-20 % in children with a gestational age
      &lt;28 weeks or with a birth weight under 1000 g, 10-20 % in children with a gestational age of
      28-31 weeks or a birth weight between 1000-1500 g and only 5 % in children born at term. The
      incidence of cerebral palsy is 10-20% amongst children in the first group, 5-10% in the
      second group and only 0,1 % in children born at term.With such a high risk of developing
      motor abnormalities for infants born preterm together with limited evidence-based knowledge
      of early physiotherapy approaches that facilitate motor development, it is essential that
      more research is done in this area to ensure that physiotherapy if used, is in the right
      manner to prevent and reduce such difficulties.

    <description>The intervention involves handling the infant and changing its position. It focuses on improving symmetry, muscle balance and movement in infants. The parent who is with the infant during the admission period will carry out the daily intervention after being taught by the physiotherapist.</description>

    <description>Main elements in the intervention are postural support and facilitating techniques. The intervention will be carried out twice a day over a three-week period if the infant`s condition allows it. The length of each treatment session will be adjusted dependent on the infant`s response and condition. Maximum treatment time is 10 minutes.</description>
