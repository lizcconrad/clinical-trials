      RATIONALE: Giving autologous lymphocytes that have been treated in the laboratory with
      antibodies may stimulate the immune system to kill tumor cells. Aldesleukin may stimulate the
      lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, may increase the
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving laboratory-treated
      autologous lymphocytes together with aldesleukin and GM-CSF may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of laboratory-treated
      autologous lymphocytes when given together with aldesleukin and GM-CSF in treating patients
      with recurrent, refractory, or metastatic advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of EGFRBi-armed autologous activated T-cells
      (ATC) when administered in combination with low-dose aldesleukin and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in
      patients with recurrent, refractory, or extensive (metastatic) advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

      Assess clinical outcome based on tumor responses, overall survival, and progression-free
      survival.

      Monitor changes in sera concentrations of the tumor-associated biomarkers respective of the
      primary neoplasm (i.e. carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA); prostate specific antigen (PSA);
      Her2/neu (HER2); etc.) in association with EGFRBi-armed ATC administration throughout the
      study and at time points thereafter.

      Monitor patient sera for human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).

      Evaluate immune response, which may reflect immune augmentation in response to EGFRBi-armed
      ATC infusions, in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples as well as purified immune
      cell populations.

      Investigate proliferation in response to ex vivo stimulation with tumor-specific antigens,
      sera cytokine profiles (Th1 vs Th2), cytotoxicity of patient PBMC, and interferon gamma
      ELISPOTS as a surrogate marker for assessing generation of EGFR-specific cytotoxic
      T-lymphocytes (CTL).

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are collected by 1 or 2 leukaphereses for
      the generation of activated T cells (ATCs). The PBMCs are activated with OKT3 (anti-CD3) and
      expanded in aldesleukin for up to 14 days. The ATCs are then armed with EGFRBi.

      Patients receive EGFRBi-armed autologous ATCs IV over 30-60 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks
      (a total of 8 infusions) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients also receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) once daily and sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) SC twice weekly beginning 3 days before the first ATC infusion and continuing for 1
      week after the last ATC infusion.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

      NOTE: For the purpose of determining safety and maximum tolerated dose of EGFRBi-armed ATC,
      patients enrolled at each dose level from this study will be combined with patients enrolled
      at each dose level in RWH 349-32 (NCT00569296): A phase I study of Anti-CD3 x Cetuximab-Armed
      Activated T Cells, Low Dose IL-2, and GM-CSF for EGFR-Positive, Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung
      Cancer (NSCLC) to count toward each dose level cohort. A total of three patients enrolled
      form either of the two trials will be treated at each dose level, but at least one NSCLC
      patient representative from protocol 349-32 will be enrolled and evaluated at each dose
      level.
