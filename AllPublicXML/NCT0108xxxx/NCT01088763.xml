    <textblock>
      This phase I/II clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gamma-secretase
      inhibitor RO4929097 and to see how well it works in treating young patients with relapsed or
      refractory solid tumors, CNS tumors, lymphoma, or T-cell leukemia. Gamma-secretase inhibitor
      RO4929097 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend a phase II dose of
      gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 administered orally to children with relapsed or
      refractory solid tumors or lymphoma on two schedules: once daily orally on a 3-day on/4-day
      off weekly schedule (schedule A) or once daily for 5 consecutive days weekly schedule
      (schedule B).

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of this drug administered on these schedules to
      children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, lymphoma, or T-cell leukemia.

      III. To estimate the MTD and recommended phase II dose of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097
      administered with dexamethasone.

      IV. To define and describe the toxicities of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 administered
      with dexamethasone.

      V. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in children
      with refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in
      children with solid or CNS tumors and lymphoma within the confines of a phase I study.

      II. To obtain initial efficacy data on the antitumor activity of gamma-secretase inhibitor
      RO4929097 when combined with dexamethasone in children with relapsed-refractory T-cell
      leukemia (T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]).

      III. To study the effect of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 on Hes1 (hairy/enhancer of
      split) and other components of the Notch signaling pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells and/or T-ALL blasts. (exploratory) IV. To examine archival tumor samples for expression
      of JAGGED1, JAGGED2, cleaved NOTCH1, and HES1, and HES5 by IHC and for amplification of
      NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 using FISH analysis. (exploratory) V. To preliminarily assess changes
      following treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 using FDG PET imaging.
      (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor
      RO4929097 followed by a phase II study. Patients are enrolled sequentially to group A or B.

      GROUP A: Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3,
      8-10, 15-17, and 22-24. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B: Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-5,
      8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may also receive concurrent oral
      dexamethasone twice daily on the days of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 administration.

      Once the MTD or recommended phase II dose of RO4929097 plus dexamethasone in children with
      solid tumors, including CNS tumors, or lymphoma has been identified, this dose is used for
      patients with relapsed-refractory T-ALL (phase 2 portion of the study) to evaluate RO4929097
      in combination with dexamethasone using one of the studied schedules. Blood, plasma, bone
      marrow, and tumor tissue samples may be collected at baseline and periodically during the
      first course for correlative lab and tumor studies, including pharmacokinetics.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 30 days.

      *NOTE: This trial was intended to be Phase I/II, but the trial never continued to the Phase
      II portion.
