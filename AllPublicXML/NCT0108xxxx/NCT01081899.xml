  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the LCP-I Program in improving
      the quality of end-of-life care provided to cancer patients who die on hospital medical wards
      as compared to standard healthcare practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The availability of an effective quality improvement program for the care of dying patients
      in hospitals is particularly relevant to the healthcare scenario. The LCP-I Program has
      provided enough evidence to justify a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness.

      Although the core objective of the LCP-I is improving the quality of end of life care for
      dying patients, the Program targets the healthcare professionals working on the hospital
      ward. The only feasible method of assessing the effectiveness of this Program is by
      performing a cluster trial, where hospital wards are randomized to receive (or not to
      receive) the implementation of the LCP-I Program.

      Pairs of eligible medical wards from different hospitals will be randomized to receive the
      experimental intervention (the LCP-I Program) or no intervention at all for the duration of
      the study.

      The LCP-I Program will be implemented in the experimental ward by the PCU. The LCP-I Program
      has a duration of 6 months from the beginning of the intensive training. No intervention will
      be implemented in the control ward until the end of the evaluation.

      Quality of end-of-life care will be evaluated for each pair of randomized wards for all
      eligible cancer deaths occurring in the six months after the conclusion of the LCP-I Program
      in the experimental ward.
