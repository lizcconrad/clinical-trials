          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine/product
             dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone &gt;= 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent.
             Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Concurrent or planned participation in another clinical study, at any time during the
             study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational
             or a non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Immunosuppression resulting from haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, AIDS or
             symptomatic HIV infection.

          -  Previous vaccination against HZ (either a registered product or an investigational
             product through participation in a HZ vaccine study).

          -  History of HZ.

          -  History of any allergic disease or reaction likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Receipt of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding
             the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.

          -  Receipt of any other immunisations within one month before the first study vaccination
             (2 weeks in the case of inactivated influenza vaccines or other non-replicating
             immunisation products [e.g., tetanus and reduced dose diphtheria toxoid (dT) vaccine,
             pneumococcal vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine]), or scheduled within
             30 days after study vaccination.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

          -  Fever is defined as temperature &gt;= 37.5°C (99.5°F) on axillary setting;

          -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
             infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.
