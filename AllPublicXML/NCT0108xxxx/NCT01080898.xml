  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determination of the sensitivity and specificity of different combinations of imaging
      techniques (spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fundus photography and fluorescein
      angiography) used for the diagnosis of choroidal neovessels complicating age -related macular
      degeneration. This information will help to determine the choice of the most suitable
      combination for the above diagnosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following combinations will be studied: spectral domain optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) + fundus photography; fluorescein angiography + fundus photography and the combination
      of all three techniques (OCT+ fundus photography + fluorescein angiography).The sensitivity
      and specificity of the latter combination will be assessed by comparison with the results for
      this combination reported by several readers. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of
      the different combinations will also be studied.
