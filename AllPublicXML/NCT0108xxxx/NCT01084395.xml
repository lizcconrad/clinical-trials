  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad objective of this project is to test the efficacy of a theory-based HIV
      risk-reduction intervention, which includes both an adolescent component and parental
      component, designed to reduce the adolescents' risk of sexually transmitted HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sexually transmitted HIV infection among adolescents is a growing and significant problem in
      Mexico. Given the high mortality rate associated with AIDS, the lack of available treatment,
      and the social stigma associated with the disease, prevention is the key to reducing the
      threat of AIDS among this important subgroup in Mexico. The study has four specific aims
      including 1) to determine whether the HIV risk-reduction intervention causes a greater
      increase in adolescents' intentions to abstain from intercourse and/or avoid unprotected
      intercourse at post-intervention and decreased self-reported intercourse and unprotected
      intercourse at 3, 6, 12, and 48 month follow-ups, compared with the general health promotion
      control intervention; 2) to determine whether the effects of the intervention are moderated
      by individual, microsystem, and macrosystem variables; 3) to identify theory-based variables
      that mediate effects of the HIV intervention on adolescents' self-reported behavior; and 4)
      to determine whether the HIV risk-reduction intervention causes a greater increase in
      parents' comfort with, and quantity of communication (general and HIV specific) with
      adolescents at post-intervention, 3, 6, 12, and 48 month follow-up compared with the general
      health promotion control intervention.

    <description>Adolescents are randomly assigned to the HIV risk-reduction intervention condition. Adolescents receive a theory-based intervention designed to reduce HIV risk-associated behavior. The intervention consists of six 50-minute modules implemented over the course of two days. The intervention is highly interactive and includes games, videos, discussion, and role-plays.</description>

    <description>Adolescents are randomly assigned to the Health Promotion control condition. Adolescents receive an intervention aimed at significant health problems affecting Mexicans that are related, not to sexual behavior, but to other behaviors. These health problems include heart disease, certain cancers, and diabetes. Adolescents are taught that these health problems can be prevented by changing personal behaviors, primarily exercise, diet, cigarette smoking, and alcohol and drug use.</description>

    <description>Parents are randomly assigned to the Health Promotion control condition. Parents receive an intervention aimed at significant health problems affecting Mexicans that are related, not to sexual behavior, but to other behaviors. These health problems include heart disease, certain cancers, and diabetes. Parents will be taught that these health problems can be prevented by changing personal behaviors, primarily exercise, diet, cigarette smoking, and alcohol and drug use. The intervention also provides content that emphasizes the importance of families.</description>
