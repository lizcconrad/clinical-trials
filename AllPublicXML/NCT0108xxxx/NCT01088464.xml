    <textblock>
      This study is to establish the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of IMC-11F8,
      administered either: (1) in a 3-week cycle; or (2) in a 2-week cycle to Japanese participants
      with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to standard therapy or for whom no standard
      therapy is available.

    <textblock>
      This single center, open-label, single-arm, Phase 1 study will enroll 18 participants at a
      maximum. The actual size will vary depending on the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed
      and the resultant sizes of the cohorts. Participants will receive IMC-11F8 administered
      intravenously, once every 2 weeks or on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 6 weeks (1 cycle). All
      infusions can be administered within ± 1 day of the scheduled administration date. After 1
      cycle of treatment, participants who have an objective response or stable disease may
      continue to receive IMC-11F8 at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or other
      withdrawal criteria are met.

      A minimum of 3 participants will be enrolled in each cohort. Dose escalation in successive
      cohorts will occur once all participants complete 1 cycle of therapy.

      Participants will be enrolled sequentially into each cohort. A completed participant will be
      either a participant who completes the initial 6-week treatment period (Cycle 1) or a
      participant who discontinues therapy for an IMC-11F8-related toxicity during Cycle 1.
      Participants who do not complete the first 6 weeks of treatment for reasons other than an
      IMC-11F8-related toxicity will be replaced. Toxicity data for each cohort will be reviewed
      prior to dose escalation. Upon completion of all required safety evaluations during the
      initial 6 weeks, the next cohort of new participants will be treated at the next higher dose
      level using a dose escalation scheme.

    <description>Data presented are the number of participants who experienced 1 or more TEAEs or SAEs regardless of causality. An adverse event was considered as TEAE if it occurred any time after the administration of the first dose of study drug or up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or if it occurred prior to the first dose and worsened while on treatment. A summary of SAEs and other non-SAEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>PK: Steady-State Volume of Distribution (Vss) of Necitumumab After Single Dose</title>
        <description>Vss is that amount of plasma in which the study drug needs to be dissolved to attain a steady state drug concentration. Vss was not analyzed for participants in Cohorts 1 and 3 as Vss is derived from AUC (0-∞). AUC(0-∞) was calculated only for participants in Cohort 2 as the percentage of AUC extrapolated beyond tlast was greater than 30% for the remaining participants.</description>
