  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Craving is one of the most prominent reasons for relapse after smoking cessation. Mainly
      pharmacological aids (NRT, bupropion, varenicline) try to counter this condition. This
      project aims to evaluate the effect of stress-management and a short breathing technique,
      reinforced by means of visualisation , on the experience of craving in smokers who are
      prepared to stay abstinent for at least 3 hours before the start of the intervention. It is
      expected that this strategy can provide supplementary gains in craving control.
