  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that canakinumab given upon acute gout flares
      relieves the signs and symptoms and prevents recurrence of gout flares in patients with
      frequent flares of gout for whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/ or
      colchicine are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective. The efficacy of canakinumab
      was compared to the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide.

      The purpose of the first 12 week extension study was to collect additional safety,
      tolerability and efficacy data in patients who have completed the core study CACZ885H2357.

      The purpose of the second one year open-label extension study was to confirm the long-term
      safety and tolerability of canakinumab in patients who had completed the first extension
      study.

    <description>Participants received 1 intramuscular (im) injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg and 1 subcutaneous (sc) injection of placebo to canakinumab on Day 1. Participants could receive a re-dose of study drug on demand upon the occurrence of new flares, but re-dosing could not occur until 14 days had elapsed after the previous dose. Participants completing the 12 week core study could continue to be treated in a 12 week extension study for any new gout flare on demand with the same treatment as assigned in the core study.
In the second extension study participants were to switch to open-label on demand treatment with canakinumab 150 mg sc upon new flare for 1 year. Triamcinolone acetonide was not to be administered in the second extension study.</description>

        <title>Time to First New Flare: Survival Analysis During the 12 Weeks of Study</title>
        <description>Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first new flare and confidence intervals were determined. For patients with event, time to event = (date of event - date of first dose of study drug + 1). Patients met definition of new flare if they had: •Flare in joint, not a previously affected joint (at baseline or during study) •Flare in joint previously affected (at baseline or during study) after previous flare in joint has resolved completely. Patients did not meet criterion of having new gout flare if: • Increasing/renewed gout pain in an affected joint before flare has resolved completely.</description>

          <title>Time to First New Flare: Survival Analysis During the 12 Weeks of Study</title>
          <description>Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first new flare and confidence intervals were determined. For patients with event, time to event = (date of event - date of first dose of study drug + 1). Patients met definition of new flare if they had: •Flare in joint, not a previously affected joint (at baseline or during study) •Flare in joint previously affected (at baseline or during study) after previous flare in joint has resolved completely. Patients did not meet criterion of having new gout flare if: • Increasing/renewed gout pain in an affected joint before flare has resolved completely.</description>

        <description>SF-36 measures impact of disease on overall quality of life (QoL). 36-item survey has 8 subscales that can be aggregated into physical and mental component summary scores. Scores are standardized with the use of norm-based methods based on assessment of the general U.S. population free of chronic conditions. Scores range from 1-100 with a mean=50 and a standard deviation=10. A higher score indicates less impact on QoL. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used with treatment group and baseline SF-36 physical function subscore as covariates.</description>

        <title>Time to the First New Gout Flare During 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of the time to first new flare and confidence intervals were determined. Participants met the definition of a new flare if they had:
Flare in joint, not a previously affected joint (at baseline or during study)
Flare in joint previously affected (at baseline or during study) after previous flare in joint has resolved completely.
Participants did not meet the criterion of having a new gout flare if they had increasing/renewed gout pain in an affected joint before the flare had resolved completely.</description>

        <title>Time to First Intake of Rescue Medication</title>
        <description>Participants who had difficulty in tolerating their pain were allowed to take rescue medication after the 6-hour post-dose pain assessments as follows:
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) 500 mg and/ or codeine 30 mg as required. A maximum of 1 g/dose or 3 g/day of acetaminophen and 30 mg/ dose or 180 mg/day of codeine was allowed.
If they had insufficient pain relief, participants were allowed to take a maximum of 30 mg of oral prednisolone as required per day for 2 days followed by up to 20 mg of prednisolone as required subsequent days within 7 days of a gout flare.
Use of these treatments during the first 7 days of a gout flare was recorded as rescue medication.
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to first intake of rescue medication, in hours, and the confidence interval were determined for the flare experienced at study entry (Baseline flare) and the last new flare (last post-baseline flare) that occurred up until the end of the first extension period (24 weeks).</description>

If they had insufficient pain relief, patients were allowed to take a maximum of 30 mg of oral prednisolone as required per day for 2 days followed by up to 20 mg of prednisolone as required subsequent days within 7 days of a gout flare.</description>
          <population>For the Baseline flare the population analyzed consisted of the Full Analysis Set (FAS). For the last post-baseline flare the population analyzed consisted of patients re-treated for at least one new flare.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Patients With Maximum Severity of New Gout Flares as Severe or Extreme</title>
          <description>For each new flare, participants scored the maximum amount of acute gout pain in the most affected joint since the onset of the new flare and the time they were re-dosed on a 5 point Likert scale as None, Mild, Moderate, Severe or Extreme. The percentage of participants with a maximum new flare severity of severe or extreme is reported for the first post-baseline flare that occurred during the 12-week core study and for the last post-baseline flare that occurred up until the end of the first extension period.</description>
          <population>The number of participants analyzed (indicated by 'N') for the first new post-baseline flare includes patients who were re-treated for a new flare during the 12-week core study. For the last post-baseline flare the population analyzed includes patients re-treated for at least one new flare during the first 24 weeks.</population>

        <description>Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first new flare and confidence intervals were determined. For patients with event, time to event = (date of event - date of first dose of study drug + 1).
Patients met definition of new flare if they had:
Flare in joint, not a previously affected joint (at baseline or during study)
Flare in joint previously affected (at baseline or during study) after previous flare in joint has resolved completely.
Patients did not meet criterion of having new gout flare if:
