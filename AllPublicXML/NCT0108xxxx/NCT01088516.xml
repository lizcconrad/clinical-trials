  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic options to prevent vertical transmission of HIV remain limited. Combination
      antiretroviral therapy in the form of HAART (Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy) is
      generally recommended in the developed world, both for its ability to reduce maternal viral
      load, and thus the likelihood of transmission, as well as for its prevention of drug
      resistance mutations, which might otherwise reduce future options for therapy in the mother,
      infant, or both. Exclusive formula-feeding is also recommended in the developed world (where
      clean water sources &amp; adequate hygiene is reliably available) to prevent HIV transmission
      through breastmilk, however, this is not yet a feasible option in many developing world
      settings due to economic, infrastructure, social and infant-health reasons.

      The investigators propose use of a HAART regimen during pregnancy and breastfeeding that is
      based upon the recently released Aluvia tablets (tablet form of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR or LOP;
      established capsule form is known as Kaletra) to improve maternal virological control and
      thus mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT).

      Hypothesis: Maternal use of HAART containing Zidovudine, 3TC and Aluvia (Lopinavir/Ritonavir)
      can prevent antepartum, and intrapartum transmission of HIV, as well as allow exclusive and
      then subsequent complementary feeding to be carried out with minimum risk to the mother and
      infant.

        -  Study regimen: ZDV/3TC (combivir) + 2 Aluvia Tabs all PO BID to start at 14-30 weeks
           gestational age (GA) and continue through labor and as long as the mother breastfeeds

        -  Peripartum single dose Nevirapine (sdNVP) (Note: Mothers will also be receiving ZDV as
           part of the study regimen) to mother and sdNVP + 5 days postpartum ZDV to the infant
           will be given as per current Zambian practice

        -  Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) x 6 months then complementary foods to be added, with aim
           for a gradual wean of breastfeeding by infant age of 12-13 months. In case of inability
           to wean by 13 months, however, drug will be continued until the mother has achieved a
           complete wean.

        -  Follow-up period: Mother &amp; child will be followed to an infant age of 24 months, as per
           schedule-of-visits (approx every 3 months)

      Major outcome measure: infant survival and negative dbs (dried blood spot) PCR 3 months post
      weaning.
