  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effect on 24-hour blood glucose patterns,
      HbA1c, and weight management when adding insulin glargine, or exenatide, or a combination of
      insulin glargine and exenatide to metformin.

      The primary objective of this study was to characterize the diurnal glucose patterns produced
      by insulin glargine alone, exenatide (GLP-1 agonist) alone and the combination of insulin
      glargine and exenatide in subjects taking stable dose of metformin and to evaluate their
      efficacy in terms of improvement in glucose exposure, variability, stability, incidence of
      hypoglycemia and weight management.

      An ancillary study was approved as part of this study. The purpose of the ancillary study was
      to use CGM to characterize the glycemic response to a fixed breakfast meal consumed by study
      participants receiving different medications.

Change from baseline was calculated as mean absolute hourly rate of change in median curve at baseline minus rate at final visit (32 weeks). Mean absolute hourly rate of change in the smoothed median curve is calculated as delta subscript MC = (|p subscript 50 zero - p subscript 50 23|+Sum superscript 23 subscript i = 1| p subscript 50i - p subscript 50 i-1| over T.
i = hour of day p subscript 50i = smoothed 50th percentile value for ith hour of day T = total # of non-missing hourly smoothed percentiles</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glucose Exposure (Area Under the Diurnal Median Curve or AUC)</title>
        <description>Employ Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) with Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) analysis to characterize the diurnal patterns produced by oral medications (metformin) used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Employ CGM to measure the effect of exenatide, insulin glargine and exenatide plus insulin glargine in terms of underlying physiological defects and alter medications in a manner that improves- i. Glucose exposure (area under the diurnal median curve) Change from baseline was calculated as area under the diurnal median curve at baseline minus AUC value at final visit (32 weeks).
AUC is calculated using modified rectangle method AUC = sum of superscript 23, subscript i=0 P subscript 50i I = hour of day P subscript 50i = smoother 50th percentile value for ith hour of day</description>

Employ CGM with AGP analysis to determine if there is an incremental benefit for subjects who do not reach target to add exenatide to insulin glargine or insulin glargine to exenatide in patients taking metformin.
