  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary choices are leading to a weight gain epidemic and
      increasing the risk for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The strong
      relationship between insulin resistance and NAFLD suggests that adding Vitamin D TO insulin
      sensitizing therapies such as Galvus (vitagliptin) might be beneficial in the prevention or
      improvement in NAFLD. Considering the close relationship between NAFLD and T2DM and lipid
      metabolism, we assume that adding vitamin D to Galvus, may be effective for NAFLD by
      improving lipid metabolism and by improving type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

      Sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary choices are leading to a weight gain epidemic and
      increasing the risk for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The strong
      relationship between insulin resistance and NAFLD suggests that adding vitamin D to insulin
      sensitizing therapies such as Galvus (vitagliptin) might be beneficial in the prevention or
      improvement in NAFLD. Considering the close relationship between NAFLD and T2DM and lipid
      metabolism, we assume that adding vitamin D to Galvus may be effective for NAFLD by improving
      lipid metabolism and by improving T2DM. Methods: 60 patients with NAFLD (Diagnosed by
      Ultrasound, increase ALT level and hepatomegaly) will be enrolled, and divided into 2 arms
      Galvus plus Vitamin D vs. Galvus alone. Biochemistry, hepatic triglycerides, histology, m RNA
      gene expression of collagen, MTP, SREP-1, PPAR-alpha, and LDLR will be measured. 2 separate
      liver biopsies will be performed at screening and 6 months from baseline. Expected results:
      Long-term combination therapy with vitagliptin and Vitamin D significantly reduced steatosis,
      inflammation and fibrosis in the liver compared with long-term monotherapy. We expect also
      that the combination therapy also significantly increased the expression of microsomal
      triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-α1
      (PPAR-α1) in the liver, compared with monotherapy, which may have lead to the improvement in
      lipid metabolic disorder . Conclusion: Combination therapy of vitagliptin and vitamin D, for
      24 weeks improve the histopathology findings in NAFLD.
