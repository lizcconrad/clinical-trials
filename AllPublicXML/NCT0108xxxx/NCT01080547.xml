      A new notion&quot;Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment&quot; for colorectal cancer is thought with
      several benefits such as shorter hospitalization stay and less costs. This randomized study
      aims to compare the differences between conventional and Fast Track Multi-Discipline
      Treatment for colorectal cancer in hospitalization day, complications, costs and quality of
      life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic Surgery, Fast Track Treatment and XELOX Chemotherapy have been introduced in the
      treatment of colorectal cancer. All of these procedures are contributed to reduce the
      hospitalization stay. However, the most economical mode for combination of these procedures
      is still unclear. This is a randomized controlled study, a new notion&quot;Fast Track
      Multi-Discipline Treatment&quot; is proposed, which is the combination of the Laparoscopic
      Surgery, Fast track perioperative treatment during perioperative period and XELOX
      Chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to compare the Fast Track Multi-Discipline
      Treatment with the conventional treatment(Open Surgery with conventional treatment during
      perioperative period and mFolfox6 chemotherapy) for colorectal cancer on several aspects like
      the average hospitalization day, complications, costs and quality of life.The focus of the
      study will be to investigate whether the Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment reduces
      hospital stay with similar complications compared with conventional perioperative treatment.
      Moreover, the trial will clarify whether laparoscopic surgery is essential for Fast Track
      Multi-Discipline Treatment.
