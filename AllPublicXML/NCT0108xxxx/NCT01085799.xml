  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To efficiently control soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris, Trichuris, and hookworm), WHO,
      PAHO, and others recommend the inclusion of an education strategy in school-based deworming
      programs. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy on the rate of STH re-infection and
      on education indicators, such as absenteeism, remains to be fully understood. The proposed
      research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a post-deworming education intervention
      targeted to Grade 5 school children enrolled in Belén's schools using a cluster-randomized
      trial design. Results will be used to inform school-based deworming programs in Peru and
      other similar endemic areas in Latin America and, indeed, around the world.
