    <textblock>
      Acute chest syndrome is a severe sickle cell disease complication in children requiring blood
      transfusion therapy to prevent acute respiratory failure and death. Nitric oxide is a potent
      vasodilator that could reverse pulmonary vascular occlusion and restore normal oxygenation.
      The randomized trial will test that hypothesis.

      Acute chest syndrome is a severe sickle cell disease complication in children requiring blood
      transfusion therapy to prevent acute respiratory failure and death. Nitric oxide is a potent
      vasodilator that could reverse pulmonary vascular occlusion and restore normal oxygenation.
      The randomized trial will test that hypothesis in a prospective randomized double-blind
      placebo controlled study. 50 children in two years will be included: 25 in each arm.
