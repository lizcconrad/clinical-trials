  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: It is well known that distinctly abnormal blood potassium values can cause serious
      complications such as cardiac arrhythmias. Although potassium regulation is generally
      considered important, hardly any research has been done about potassium regulation in
      intensive care patients. The investigators hypothesize that different potassium
      target-values, within the as normal accepted range, may have different effects in critically
      ill patients.

      Study design: A prospective trial comparing two different potassium target-values. Potassium
      will be tightly regulated with the already fully operational GRIP-II computer program.

      Study population: 1200 adult patients admitted at the thoracic intensive care unit of the
      University Medical Center Groningen.

      Intervention: Comparison between two variations of standard therapy: potassium target-value
      of 4.0 mmol/L versus 4.5 mmol/L.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the incidence of atrial fibrillation
      or atrial flutter from ICU-admission to hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints are serum
      levels of potassium and the other main electrolytes, renal function and renal potassium
      excretion, the relation with insulin and glucose, the cumulative fluid balance, (ICU) length
      of stay and mortality.
