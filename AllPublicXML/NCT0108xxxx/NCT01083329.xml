  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our working hypothesis postulates that lipolysis is a determinant of inflammation in adipose
      tissue (AT). Inhibition of lipolysis, e.g. using the oldest normolipidemic drug, nicotinic
      acid, has proved valuable to combat the metabolic syndrome. Our proposal will determine
      whether part of the beneficial effects of this antilipolytic compound is due to a diminution
      of AT inflammation.

      To this aim, the effect of nicotinic acid or placebo will be studied in male obese subjects
      with or without a training program which goal is to enhance lipolysis.

    <textblock>
      24 male obese insulin resistant subjects will receive nicotinic acid or placebo for 16 weeks.
      The last 8 weeks, the subjects will follow a training program calculated to optimize use of
      lipid. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance will be assessed using, respectively,
      fasting-based estimates of insulin sensitivity (plasma and muscle) and oral glucose tolerance
      test. Plasma parameters of adipokines and, inflammatory and metabolic parameters will be
      determined. As an index of AT inflammation, the percentage and the phenotype of macrophages
      will be determined using flow cytometry of cells of the stromavascular fraction of
      subcutaneous AT. Macrophage infiltration will be investigated by light microscopy. The
      characterization of the inflammatory profile of AT will be completed by measurements of the
      expression of genes that are either specific markers of human AT macrophages or inflammatory
      and anti-inflammatory adipokines. This combination of approaches has never been carried out
      during a pharmacological intervention in humans. The following points will be addressed:

        -  determine the influence of lipolysis on AT inflammation, specifically on macrophage
           activation and adipokine production.

        -  examine the causal relationship between adipocyte FA metabolism, AT inflammation and
           insulin sensitivity.

        -  establish whether the beneficial effect of antilipolytic drugs may be attributable at
           least in part to a decrease in AT inflammation.
