  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body temperature measurement is one of the standard vital sign measurements in newborn babies
      in order assess their health status. Temperatures are taken on a regular basis throughout the
      newborn's stay on the well-baby floor. A temperature that is elevated above the normal range
      for age or depressed below the normal range for age may be a sign of illness in a newborn.
      There are many methods that may be used to record this temperature. Traditionally, axillary
      (under the arm) and rectal (in the rectum) sites have been used. Recently, a new method of
      temperature measurement has become available. Temporal artery thermometers are a non-invasive
      method to measure the baby's temperature by means of a light that is shone on the forehead
      that can read your baby's temperature quickly. It is not clear whether this method is
      accurate in the newborn period.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of temporal artery temperature
      measurement. This will be achieved by observing the axillary measurement, rectal temperature
      measurement, and temporal artery temperature measurement taken at approximately the same time
      in each infant. These measurements will be compared to each other to determine if temporal
      artery thermometry is as reliable a measurement as rectal and / or axillary temperature
      measurements.

      We plan to compare

      Hypothesis: Temporal artery thermometry of the immediate newborn infant is an accurate
      measurement of temperature in this age group.
