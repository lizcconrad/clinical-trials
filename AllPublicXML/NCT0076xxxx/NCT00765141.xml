  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this protocol is to salvage human-related material that is normally destined
      for destruction, so it can be used in infection-related scientific studies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical material can be studied in order to better understand the molecular, cellular,
      or ecological components of the infected or potentially infected tissue or device. These
      studies may be able to provide important insights into the keys of chronic infections,
      complex infections, medical biofilms, pathogen ecology, and healing.
