      The purpose of the study is to develop methods to evaluate the eating behavior of
      adolescents, including overweight, normal weight, and candidates for adolescent bariatric
      surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the eating behavior, meal-related perceptions and
      meal-related hormones in overweight adolescents, normal weight adolescents and overweight
      adolescents who are undergoing bariatric surgery. Subjects will be asked to consume a
      single-item breakfast meal of a fixed amount (Ensure) and a multiple-item meal from a
      luncheon buffet. During the single-item meal, subjects will fill out questionnaires assessing
      subjective responses to the meal (e.g. hunger, fullness, pleasantness) and blood samples will
      be taken before, during, and after the meal to assess hormonal responses to the meal. The
      multiple-item meal will permit an assessment of total caloric consumption, food and
      macronutrient choice and rate of eating. Overweight adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery
      will be asked to do the meal studies 1 to 3 months before and 3 to 6 months after their
      surgery. Some bariatric surgery patients will only be studied after their after their
      surgery.

      The data gathered from these pilot subjects will be used to further develop and refine our
      future studies on assessing eating behavior in overweight adolescents.

      10 cc (2 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn during the screening assessment to screen for
      medical illness.

      60 cc (12 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn from an indwelling IV catheter during the
      single-item meal to assay for meal-related hormones (ghrelin, leptin,cholecystokinin,
      insulin, peptideY). Bariatric surgery participants may have an additional 20 cc of blood
      taken to measure glucose responses to the meal.
