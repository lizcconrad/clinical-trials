      RATIONALE: Collecting feedback from patients with prostate cancer may help doctors develop
      better symptom management educational materials for patients.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is evaluating symptom management educational materials for
      patients with prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To collect formative evaluation data about a new educational intervention using focus
           groups of patients with prostate cancer.

        -  To use the focus group data in the master's research paper of a Baylor College of
           Medicine physician-assistant student who is documenting the process of organizing and
           conducting the focus groups, enumerating areas where the new materials are deemed
           problematic, and identifying themes in the comments made by the focus group
           participants.

      OUTLINE: Study participants are assigned to 1 of 3 focus groups according to educational
      level and ethnicity (i.e., lower educational-level African-American men primarily from the
      Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MEDVAMC); lower educational-level
      Caucasian men from MEDVAMC, Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), or the community; or higher
      educational-level Caucasian men primarily from BCM or the community).

      Participants review written patient educational-intervention materials on prostate cancer and
      provide feedback to the investigator on the content and acceptability of these materials
      during a 1Â½-2-hour focus group discussion. Feedback data are used to revise the intervention
      materials so that they are appropriate to the target population.
