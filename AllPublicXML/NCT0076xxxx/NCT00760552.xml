    <textblock>
      The long-range goal of this research is to advance understanding of long-term blood pressure
      (BP) control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). The work builds on our
      experience in implementing new models of care in Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA settings,
      including three National Institute of Health (NIH) studies of pharmacist-based HTN
      management. The long-term effectiveness of such models, especially in veterans, is unknown.
      Thus, the primary goal of this study is to evaluate how to sustain long-term BP control in
      veterans with HTN following a 6-month intensive pharmacist intervention.

      This study will enroll veterans with uncontrolled HTN into a 6-month intensive
      pharmacist-based intervention. Following this initial intervention, participants will be
      randomized to continued intervention or a one-time patient and provider education
      intervention. BP will be compared in the two groups over a 2-year follow-up period. The
      intervention to control and sustain BP will follow VA guidelines and include: 1)
      comprehensive medication assessment by the pharmacist; 2) an explicit plan to intensify
      treatment if indicated; 3) strategies to improve adherence; and 4) follow-up pharmacist
      visits to sustain BP control. The intervention is based on models identified in a recent
      Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report as being the most potent strategies
      to improve BP. The study will benefit from a strong research team with expertise in guideline
      development, implementation science, quality measurement, and behavioral science. The study
      will also provide important information on the degree to which BP control deteriorates after
      patients are referred back to usual care. The specific aims and related hypotheses of the
      study are to:

      Aim 1:Compare BP control in patients randomized to long-term continuation of the pharmacist
      intervention or to a less intense one-time patient and provider education intervention.

      Hypothesis 1a: Patients randomized to the continued pharmacist intervention will have higher
      rates of BP control 24 months after randomization.

      Hypothesis 1b: Patients randomized to the continued pharmacist intervention will have lower
      mean BP 24 months after randomization.

      Aim 2: Compare antihypertensive medication intensification in patients randomized to the
      continued pharmacist intervention or the less intense intervention.

      Hypothesis 2: A higher proportion of patients who continued the pharmacist intervention will
      have medication intensification over the 24-month follow-up.

      Aim 3: Compare medication adherence in the two intervention groups. Hypothesis 3a: Medication
      adherence will be higher in patients randomized to the continued pharmacist intervention
      group during the 24 month follow-up period.

      Hypothesis 3b: Improvements in medication adherence will be associated with improvements in
      BP during each study interval.

      We are proposing a 4-year trial to determine if long-term blood pressure (BP) control after a
      pharmacist intervention requires continuation of the intervention or if a less intense
      strategy is equally efficacious. The intervention builds on the Chronic Care Model, recent
      Veteran Affairs (VA) trials, and our pharmacist interventions. This research has convincingly
      shown that collaborative interventions can improve BP control over 6-9 months. However, no
      randomized study has evaluated strategies to sustain the effect of such interventions.

      The study will enroll 300 patients with uncontrolled HTN at the Iowa City Veteran Affairs
      Medical Center (VAMC) and an affiliated community based outpatient clinic (CBOC). All
      patients will receive a pharmacist intervention for 6 months that will follow VA HTN
      guidelines. Patients completing the intervention will then be randomized to continuation of
      the high intensity intervention or to a one-time patient and provider education intervention
      that was recently shown to be effective. The high intensity (HI) intervention will intensify
      medication regimens when BP deteriorates, sustain adherence, and improve monitoring to reduce
      adverse drug reactions. The low intensity (LI) intervention will involve usual care by
      patients primary care provider (PCPs) and a one-time education intervention including a
      letter emphasizing the importance of medication adherence and behavioral strategies to
      improve BP control (e.g., low-salt diets, exercise). PCPs of low intensity patients will also
      receive a computerized alert with treatment recommendations and links to BP guidelines.

      The primary endpoint-BP-will be assessed using standard measurements at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30
      months post enrollment (24 months after randomization). The 24-month evaluation phase will
      determine if BP control can be sustained or improved with a continued high intensity
      intervention, relative to a low intensity intervention (Aim 1). All medication changes will
      be assessed to compare rates of medication intensification over the follow-up period (Aim 2).
      Finally, validated self-report adherence questionnaires will be used to compare medication
      adherence in the two groups and determine relationships between BP control and medication
      adherence (Aim 3).

    <description>High Intensity patients will be seen by the pharmacist at 3-6 month intervals, depending upon if patient is at goal BP. During these visits, the pharmacist will: 1) review barriers to BP control; 2) assess progress toward overcoming such barriers; 3) determine adherence; and 4) assess potential side effects. If the BP is at goal, the patient will be given encouragement and told to continue the regimen. If the BP is not at goal, the pharmacist will develop a new treatment strategy. If the treatment changes were in the plan negotiated with the physician, the PCP will simply be informed. If new changes are recommended, the pharmacist will develop a new treatment plan and review it with the PCP.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive the initial 6-month pharmacist intervention. The intervention: 1) co-management of HTN by pharmacists can improve BP control; and 2) active follow-up is needed to reinforce progress and proactively identify and resolve problems. The intervention will include structured visits at baseline 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after baseline and telephone calls at 2 weeks and between the visits. At baseline, the pharmacist will review the computerized patient record system (CPRS) medical record and perform a structured interview, including: a detailed medication history of all prescription and non-prescription therapies; an assessment of patient knowledge of all meds, the purpose of each med, medication dosages and timing, and potential side effects; potential contraindications to specific medications; and expectations for future dosage changes and of the need for future monitoring potential barriers to BP control.</description>

High Intensity Intervention: High Intensity patients will be seen by the pharmacist at 3-6 month intervals, depending upon if patient is at goal BP. During these visits, the pharmacist will: 1) review barriers to BP control; 2) assess progress toward overcoming such barriers; 3) determine adherence; and 4) assess potential side effects. If the BP is at goal, the patient will be given encouragement and told to continue the regimen. If the BP is not at goal, the pharmacist will develop a new treatment strategy. If the treatment changes were in the plan negotiated with the physician, the PCP will simply be informed. If new changes are recommended, the pharmacist will develop a new treatment plan and review it with the PCP.</description>
