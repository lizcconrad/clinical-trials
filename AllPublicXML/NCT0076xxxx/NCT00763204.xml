  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate dose-response relationship, antipsoriatic
      efficacy and safety of different concentrations of topical formulations with AN2728 in
      subjects with psoriasis vulgaris.

    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in 12 male subjects with stable psoriatic plaques. The study
      preparations and the comparator will be tested observer-blind. Treatments will be randomly
      assigned to the test fields. All subjects will receive all treatments, with intraindividual
      comparison of the treatments.

      Altogether six test fields will be examined per subject (four active AN2728 creams of
      different concentrations: 2 %, 1 %, 0.3 %, 0.03 %, the active ingredient-free vehicle, and a
      marketed corticoid preparation). The test fields will be treated occlusively over a study
      period of 12 days. Topical application of approximately 200 uL of each assigned intervention
      is administered per treatment, for a total of 10 treatments over a 12-day treatment period.

          -  subjects with psoriasis vulgaris in a chronic stable phase and stable plaques with an
             area sufficient for five treatment fields

          -  the physical examination must be without disease findings unless the investigator
             considers an abnormality to be irrelevant to the outcome of the study

          -  written informed consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects with psoriasis guttata or pustular psoriasis

          -  subjects who require systemically acting medications for the treatment of psoriasis,
             which might counter or influence the study objectives, e.g. corticosteroids,
             cytostatics

          -  local treatment with antipsoriatics (like vitamin D, dithranol, glucocorticosteroids;
             except for salicyclic acid in vaseline) in the 4 weeks preceding and during the study;
             and any antipsoriatic treatment on the plaques (including corticosteroids, except for
             salicyclic acid) in the 8 weeks preceding and during the study.

          -  systemic treatment with antipsoriatics in the three months preceding and during the
             study

          -  treatment with systemic or locally acting medications which might counter or influence
             the study aim (e.g. MAO inhibitors, anti-epileptic drugs, anti-psychotic drugs) or
             medications which are known to provoke or aggravate psoriasis, e.g. Beta-blocker,
             antimalarial drugs and lithium drugs within two weeks before the beginning of the
             study and during the study.

          -  known allergic reactions to the active ingredients or other components of the study
             preparations or comparators

          -  blood pressure and heart rate outside the following allowed ranges: systolic blood
             pressure 80-160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 60 - 100 mm Hg, heart rate 40-120
             beats/min

          -  evidence of drug abuse

          -  UV-therapy within 4 weeks before beginning and during the study

          -  participation in another clinical trial involving pharmaceutical products in the 4
             weeks preceding and during the study

          -  in the opinion of the investigator or physician performing the initial examination the
             patient should not participate in the study, e.g. due to probable noncompliance or
             inability to understand the study and give adequately informed consent

          -  subject is institutionalized because of legal or regulatory order
