  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore how pregabalin works in patients with fibromyalgia by
      evaluating brain imaging signals. To find out whether fMRI (functional magnetic resonance
      imaging) is an efficient way to show whether new pain medications are effective in treating
      fibromyalgia.

    <description>BOLD fMRI imaging modality to assess brain activation signals across the whole brain in defined Region of Interest (ROI) brain regions in response to blunt pressure pain; acquired during resting state (no evoked pain) and during evoked pain (thumb pressure device with non-painful pressure, 2 kilograms [kg] pressure/equal stimulus conditions, and high pain pressure/up to 10 kg). Estimated as magnitude (percent change) of the betas representing brain signal activation associated with pressure induced pain.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 8, Day 37), Post-dose (Period 1/Day 22, Period 2/Day 51)</time_frame>
    <description>Resting state brain activity assessed for correlation of brain seed region (pIns, anIns) to ROI connectivity at baseline (pre-dose) and post-dose (pre minus post) measured using z-score (mean of 0, standard deviation [SD] of 1); range approximately -3 to +3. Positive (+) z-scores reflect greater connectivity (+correlation between seed region and ROI). Negative (-) z-scores reflect -connectivity (anti-correlation between seed region and ROI). ROIs include PCC and IPL from within the default mode network (DMN). DMN is a constellation of regions in which connectivity is augmented in fibromyalgia.</description>

    <measure>Sphygmomanometry Evoked Allodynia in Relation to the Blood Pressure (BP) Value at Which Allodynia Was Evoked</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 58</time_frame>
    <description>BP cuff evoked allodynia assessed based on participant response to the following question &quot;When I take your blood pressure, tell me if the cuff's pressure is painful&quot;. A standard BP cuff was inflated at approximately 10 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) per second up to 180 mm Hg or to point when participant experienced pain; performed 3 times on each arm whether or not pain was reported. If no pain elicited at 180 mm Hg, it was recorded that no sphygmomanometry-evoked allodynia occurred. If pain was reported, value (in mm Hg) at which pain first occured was recorded for each of the assessments.</description>

Pregabalin, then placebo: Pregabalin 75 mg PO BID Period 1/Day 9 to 11; 150 mg BID Day 12 to 16; 200 mg BID Day 17 to 19; 225 mg BID Day 20 to 22 followed by taper Day 23 to 29 and an 8-day placebo washout period. Then, placebo matching study treatment in a similar pattern was administered beginning Period 2/Day 38 and included dose escalation through Day 51 followed by placebo taper Day 52 to 58.
Or placebo, then Pregabalin: Placebo matching study treatment was administered in a similar fashion to Pregabalin treatment beginning Period 1/Day 9 and included dose escalation, taper and an 8-day placebo washout period. Then, Pregabalin 75 mg BID Period 2/Day 38 to 40; 150 mg BID Day 41 to 45; 200 mg BID Day 46 to 48; 225 mg BID Day 49 to 51 followed by placebo taper Day 52 to 58.</description>

        <description>BOLD fMRI imaging modality to assess brain activation signals across the whole brain in defined Region of Interest (ROI) brain regions in response to blunt pressure pain; acquired during resting state (no evoked pain) and during evoked pain (thumb pressure device with non-painful pressure, 2 kilograms [kg] pressure/equal stimulus conditions, and high pain pressure/up to 10 kg). Estimated as magnitude (percent change) of the betas representing brain signal activation associated with pressure induced pain. Any observation with a studentized residual &gt;3 or &lt;-3 was considered an outlier.</description>

        <title>Resting State Brain Activity (Connectivity Analysis) Assessed by Temporal Correlations in Low Frequency fMRI BOLD Signals Across Pain Processing Regions</title>
        <description>Resting state brain activity assessed for correlation of brain seed region (pIns, anIns) to ROI connectivity at baseline (pre-dose) and post-dose (pre minus post) measured using z-score (mean of 0, standard deviation [SD] of 1); range approximately -3 to +3. Positive (+) z-scores reflect greater connectivity (+correlation between seed region and ROI). Negative (-) z-scores reflect -connectivity (anti-correlation between seed region and ROI). ROIs include PCC and IPL from within the default mode network (DMN). DMN is a constellation of regions in which connectivity is augmented in fibromyalgia.</description>

        <title>Daily Pain Diary Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Item From the Modified Brief Pain Inventory (mBPI) for Assessment of Clinical Pain: 3 Day Average Pain Score Including Outliers</title>
        <description>The daily pain diary consisted of the mBPI item regarding participant-rated average of pain over the past 24 hours. Scored on an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). The 3 day average pain score was defined as the mean daily pain NRS value for the last 3 days prior to fMRI scanning visit. Baseline and Post-dose data for Period 1 and Period 2 summarized as LS Mean. Any observation with a studentized residual &gt;3 or &lt;-3 was considered an outlier.</description>

          <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): Depression Total Score Including Outliers</title>
          <description>A participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assessed state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assessed state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicated greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. Any observation with a studentized residual &gt;3 or &lt;-3 was considered an outlier.</description>
