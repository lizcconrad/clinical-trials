      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To use prior data from an existing registry (Quality of Life Survey Registry for Persons
           With Cancer and Family Caregivers protocol CASE-8Z05) and to expand upon these data by
           adding measures that capture the particularly salient concepts of the patient/caregiver
           dyadic relationship and posttraumatic growth.

        -  To identify rates and psychosocial correlates of posttraumatic growth among older adult
           cancer patient/spouse or partner dyads.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their caregivers complete three questionnaires that will take
      approximately 20 minutes either by mail or telephone. The questionnaires comprise of
      demographic and psychosocial correlates of posttraumatic growth including age, ethnicity,
      socioeconomic status, education, anxiety, relationship quality, coping style, social support,
      and cultural beliefs about caring for elders.
