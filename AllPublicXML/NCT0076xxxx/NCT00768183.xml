  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the single-dose relative bioavailability of
      Alpharma Branded Products Division Inc. (KADIAN) 100 mg morphine sulfate extended-release
      capsules when dosed with alcohol under fasting and fed conditions compared to water.

      In addition, the pharmacokinetics of an immediate release solution following a 20 mg dose was
      assessed for informational purposes and for possible modeling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male volunteers, 21 to 40 years of age.

          -  Subjects were non-smokers for at least 3 months or light smokers (less than 10

          -  Subjects with a history of moderate consumption of at least 7-21 units of alcohol per
             week or the alcohol equivalent (12 oz beer = 5 oz of 80-proof distilled spirits = 1
             unit).

          -  Weighing at least 70 kg and within 20% of their ideal weights (table of &quot;Desirable
             Weights of Adults&quot;, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1983).

          -  Medically healthy subjects with no clinically significant abnormalities in their
             laboratory profile and ECGs, as deemed by the Principal Investigator.

          -  Voluntarily consented to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
             hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, or

             to morphine or other opioids; hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to
             naltrexone, naloxone, or other opioids antagonists.

          -  History of no alcohol intake (alcohol-naive) or less than moderate alcohol intake.

          -  Subject with a history of alcohol intake exceeding the equivalence of 21 units/week or
             exceeding the average of 3 drinks per day.

          -  Subjects who had a surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) which
             would interfere with absorption of the study drug.

          -  Subjects who received hepatic enzyme inducing drugs (e.g. Nizoral, Tagamet) within the
             previous three months.

          -  Subjects whose QTc interval was &gt;450 msec at screening and prior to dosing.

          -  Subjects whose sitting blood pressure was less than 110/45 mm Hg at screening or
             100/45 mm Hg before dosing.

          -  Subjects who had been on a special diet (for whatever reason) during the 28 days prior
             to the first dose and throughout the study.

          -  Subjects who had made any significant donation or loss of blood within 56 days.

          -  Subjects who had made a plasma donation within 7 days prior to the study.

          -  Subjects with hemoglobin less than 12.0 g/dL.

          -  Subjects who had participated in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to the
             first dose.

          -  Subjects who had a positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol.

          -  Subjects who had a positive test for, or had been treated for hepatitis B, hepatitis C
             or HIV.
