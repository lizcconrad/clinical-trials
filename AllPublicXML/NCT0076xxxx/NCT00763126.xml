  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unclear the effect of a spouse's presence on the partureint's and the spouse's stress
      level during the performance of epidural analgesia during labor.

      Couples will be randomized to two groups: one group where the spouse is present during the
      performance of epidural analgesia and the second where the spouse is not present.

      Before and after epidural anlgesia, both the spouse and parturient will be have their blood
      pressure and pulse checked. In addition, both will have their salivary amylase measured.

      Salivary amylase is an enzyme whic has been foud to correlate directly with stress levels. To
      check this enzyme, a sample of saliva is given.
