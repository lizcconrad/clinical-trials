      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To determine the safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IPI-926

        -  To examine the pharmacokinetic parameters of IPI-926 and its characterized major
           metabolite(s)

        -  To recommend a dose and schedule of IPI-926 for subsequent studies

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor for which no standard therapy
             proven to provide clinical benefit is available.

          2. ≥18 years of age

          3. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2.

          6. Voluntarily sign an informed consent form

          7. Women of child-bearing potential (WCBP), defined as a sexually mature woman who has
             not undergone a hysterectomy or tubal ligation of who has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test prior to treatment. All WCBP, all sexually active male patients, and
             all partners of patients must agree to use adequate methods of birth control
             throughout the study.

          8. Recovery to &lt;/= Grade 1 or baseline of any toxicities due to prior treatments,
             excluding alopecia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with following therapies as indicated:

               -  Any chemotherapy (other than nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), radiation therapy,
                  surgery, hormonal therapy, or investigational therapy within 4 weeks of the start
                  of IPI-926 administration. Patients with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone
                  therapy.

               -  Any tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.g. erlotinib, imatinib) within 2 weeks of the
                  start of IPI-926 administration

               -  Nitrosoureas o or mitomycin C within 6 weeks of the start of IPI-926
                  administration.

          2. Inadequate hematologic function - neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,500 cells/mm3, platelet
             count &lt;100,000/mm3, or hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g/dL (may be increased to this level with
             transfusion as long as there is no evidence of active bleeding).

          3. Inadequate hepatic function - aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); &gt;5 x ULN if attributable to

          7. Concurrent treatment with any agent known to prolong the QTc interval.

          8. Prior surgery affecting drug absorption or any gastrointestinal dysfunction that could
             alter drug absorption (e.g. gastric bypass, Whipple procedure, gastrectomy).

          9. History of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia
             requiring medication or mechanical control within the last 6 months.

             requiring anticoagulation or who meet any of the following criteria are excluded:

               -  have been on a stable dose of anticoagulation for &lt;1 month

               -  have had a Grade 2, 3 or 4 hemorrhage in the last 30 days

               -  experiencing continued symptoms from venous thromboembolic event (e.g. continued
                  dyspnea or oxygen requirement) *Past venous thromboembolic event but do not meet
                  any of the above three criteria are eligible for participation.

         11. History of a seizure within the last 10 years or seizure disorder requiring
             anti-epileptic medications.

         12. Concurrent treatment with medications known to lower the seizure threshold.

         13. Concurrent administration of the medications or foods which are known to inhibit or
             induce CYP3A activity to a clinically relevant degree.

         14. Presence of active infection or systemic use of antibiotics within 72 hours of
             treatment.

         15. Significant co-morbid condition or disease which in the judgment of the Investigator
             would place the patient at undue risk or interfere with the study.

         16. Known immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity.

         17. Pregnant or lactating women.
