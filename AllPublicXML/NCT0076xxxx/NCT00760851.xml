      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of probiotics (popularly referred
      to as 'live active culture' or 'good bacteria') in preventing illnesses and consequent
      absences from school/daycare centers of children two to four years old that attend daycare at
      least 3 days per week. Two yogurt drinks will be administered, one containing a specific
      strain of probiotic, Bb-12. It is hypothesized that children receiving the Bb-12 drink will
      experience fewer illnesses and absences from daycare.

      In this study, participants will be asked to:

        1. Give their child 4 oz. of the test yogurt each day for 90 days

        2. Keep a daily diary of their child's health

        3. Collect 3 stool samples from their child at the start, middle, and end of the study

        4. Speak with research personnel on a bi-weekly basis regarding their child's health

        5. Ensure that their child to consume any yogurts or probiotic-containing products for 110
           days of the study
