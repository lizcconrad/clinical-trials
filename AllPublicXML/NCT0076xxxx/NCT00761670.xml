      Primary objectives

        -  To compare neurocognitive effects of amisulpride with those of risperidone in patients
           with chronic schizophrenia, as assessed by the general cognitive index, a measure of
           overall cognitive functioning in schizophrenia

      Secondary objectives

        -  Secondary analyses will be conducted to determine how the two atypical agents'
           neurocognitive effects compare with regard to their profile of therapeutic action (based
           on individual cognitive domain scores in seven cognitive domains, including speed of
           processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning and memory, visual
           learning and memory, reasoning and problem solving and social cognition);

        -  Investigate whether amisulpride elicits more improvement on negative symptoms compared
           to risperidone treatment, as measured by the total score on the Scale of the Assessment
           of Negative Symptoms (SANS) 8 and by the Negative Symptom Subscale of the Positive and
           Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS);

        -  Assess whether amisulpride improves overall functioning and individual domains of
           psychotic symptoms compared to risperidone as measured by the Clinical Global Impression
           (CGI), and the total and positive and general psychopathology subscale scores of PANSS
           and by the individual domains of SANS, respectively;

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of amisulpride and risperidone based on the study
           completion rates, and frequency of abnormal laboratory values, prolactin serum
           concentrations and on the Simpson Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS) 10 and
           the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS).
