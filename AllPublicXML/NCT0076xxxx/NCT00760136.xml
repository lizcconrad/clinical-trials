      Background Previous studies have a great discrepancy concerning the effects of quadriceps
      contraction on patellar lateral displacement and tilt in patients with patellofemoral pain
      syndrome. This discrepancy may be caused by lack of information regarding to classifications
      of patellofemoral alignment under quadriceps relaxed. We hypothesized quadriceps contraction
      has different effects on each type of patellofemoral malalignment.

      Methods The investigators expect to recruit 150 subjects with patellofemoral pain syndrome to
      participate in this study. All patients underwent computed tomography imaging of symptomatic
      knees, with and without quadriceps muscle contraction in 0°, 15° and 30° of knee flexion.
      Patellar lateral condyle index and patellar tilt angles of Sasaki and modified Fulkerson were
      measured to investigate the effect of quadriceps contraction on patellar repositioning.
