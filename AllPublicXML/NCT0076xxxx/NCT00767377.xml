    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of
      epirubicin, oxaliplatin and 5-day continuous infusional 5-fluorouracil (EOF5 regimen) in
      patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (A/MGC). Since Mar 2011, two
      addition second endpoints was added to the trial, one was to compare the consistence of two
      types of PET Scan evaluation with routine CT Scan evaluation, the other was to search for
      predictor factors of clinical results ( ORR,PFS and OS) with Pharmacogenomics methods. This
      modification was approved by the Ethic Committee of Fudan University Cancer Hospital, and the
      approval number was IRB50-15-1101A.

      ECF regimen is considered as a reference regimen for gastric cancer in Europe. Now, no
      regimen has been proved to be more effective while less toxicity than ECF regimen.
      Oxaliplatin has demonstrated synergy with 5-FU in vitro, in vivo, and in the clinical setting
      in advanced colorectal cancer. It presents a better toxicity profile than cisplatin. Recently
      some studies used combination regimens of oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and continuous infusion
      5-FU for about 44 hours (e.g FOLFOX4 ) to treat A/MGC, and yielded good response rates and
      median overall survival times while resulting in lower rates of grade 3-4 adverse events.
      Therefore, it is logical to modify ECF regimen with oxaliplatin replacing cisplatin and a
      short-term FU infusion replacing 21-day FU infusion. Our objective is to evaluate whether the
      EOF5 regimen is less toxicity while is comparable effective as ECF regimen.
