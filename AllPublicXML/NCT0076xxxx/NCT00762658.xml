      To investigate dose-response relationship, antipsoriatic efficacy and safety of different
      concentrations of topical formulations of AN2728 in patients with psoriasis vulgaris
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in 12 male subjects with stable psoriatic plaques. The study
      preparations and the comparators will be tested observer-blind. Treatments will be randomly
      assigned to the test fields. All subjects will receive all treatments, with intraindividual
      comparison of the treatments.

      Altogether six test fields will be examined per subject (three active AN2728 ointments of
      different concentrations: 5 %, 2 % and 0.5 %, the active ingredient-free vehicle, a marketed
      corticoid preparation and a marketed topical immunomodulator). The test fields will be
      treated occlusively over a study period of 12 days. A topical application of approximately
      200 uL of each assigned intervention will be administered per treatment, for a total of 10
      treatments over a 12-day treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  male subjects aged 18 years or older;

             area sufficient for six treatment fields;

          -  the physical examination must be without disease findings unless the investigator
             considers an abnormality to be irrelevant to the outcome of the study;

          -  written informed consent obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects who require systemically acting medications for the treatment of psoriasis,
             which might counter or influence the study objectives, e.g. corticosteroids,
             cytostatics;

          -  local treatment with antipsoriatics (except for salicylic acid in vaseline) in the 4
             weeks preceding and during the study (corticosteroids 8 weeks);

          -  systemic treatment with antipsoriatics in the three months preceding and during the
             study;

          -  treatment with systemic or locally acting medications which might counter or influence
             the study aim (e.g. glucocorticosteroids, MAO inhibitors, anti-epileptic drugs,
             anti-psychotic drugs) or medications which are known to provoke or aggravate
             psoriasis, e.g. β-blocker, antimalarial drugs within two weeks before the beginning of
             the study and during the study;

          -  known allergic reactions to the active ingredients or other components of the study
             preparations or comparators;

          -  evidence of drug abuse;

          -  UV-therapy within four weeks before beginning and during the study;

          -  symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may influence the outcome of the
             study in the four weeks before and during the study;

          -  participation in another clinical trial involving pharmaceutical products in the four
             weeks preceding and during the study;

          -  in the opinion of the investigator or physician performing the initial examination the
             patient should not participate in the study, e.g. due to probable noncompliance or
             inability to understand the study and give adequately informed consent.

          -  subject is institutionalized because of legal or regulatory order.
