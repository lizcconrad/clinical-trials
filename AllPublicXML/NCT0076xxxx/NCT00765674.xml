    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0.5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff. Means of the 3 measurements were calculated. A negative change indicates lowered BP.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving Blood Pressure Control at the End of the Study (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure control was defined as a msSBP/msDBP &lt; 140/90 mmHg at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff.

    <measure>Change in Mean 24-hour Ambulatory Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed in a subset of patients twice during the study, once at baseline and again at Week 8. The ABPM device was placed on the non-dominant arm between 7:00 and 10:00 am and verification readings obtained. If they were successful, the investigator initiated the 24 hour reading and instructed the patient regarding ABPM procedures. On the next day, the ABPM device was removed if it had been worn for a minimum of 24 hours. The ABPM data were downloaded and evaluated on site.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8)</title>
        <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0.5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff. Means of the 3 measurements were calculated. A negative change indicates lowered BP.</description>

          <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0.5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff. Means of the 3 measurements were calculated. A negative change indicates lowered BP.</description>
