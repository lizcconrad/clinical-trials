  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to compare ocular movements abnormalities between males
      with pre-mutation on FRM1 gene (symptomatic or asymptomatic on the motor plan and/or on the
      cognitive plan), males without the pre-mutation and males with multi-systematized atrophy, in
      order to identify the neuronal structures implicated in this pathology.

    <textblock>
      Patient will be followed at the Nantes hospital during half a day for :

        -  examination of ocular movements

        -  performing Neuro-psychological test (MATTIS)

        -  performing tests with scales of motricity (UPDRS, CRST, ICARS).
