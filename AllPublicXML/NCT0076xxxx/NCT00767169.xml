  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental implants (screws for fastening false teeth) have been coated with bisphosphonates
      (drugs that slow down removal of bone). Patients get one such screw and one without coating,
      by a surgeon who does not know which is which. The screws are compared by measuring how well
      fixed they are by a vibration measuring technique, and x-rays. The hypothesis is that the
      bisphosphonates will improve fixation.
