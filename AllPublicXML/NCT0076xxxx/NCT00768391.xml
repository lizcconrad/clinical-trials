      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of the anti-PDGFRα monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 in patients with advanced solid tumors who no
      longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.

             recurrent solid tumor or lymphoma unresponsive to standard therapy or for which there
             is no standard therapy available.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of ≤ 2 at study
             entry.

          3. Able to provide written informed consent.

          4. Age 18 years or older.

          5. Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months.

          6. Adequate hematologic function, as defined by: an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3;
             a platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3

          7. Adequate hepatic function, as defined by: a total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x the upper
             limit of normal (ULN); aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT)
             levels ≤ 2.5 x the ULN or ≤ 5 x the ULN if known liver metastases

          8. Adequate renal function, as defined by serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 x the ULN.

          9. Uses effective contraception (per the institutional standard), if procreative
             potential exists.

         10. Adequate recovery from recent surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

             patients receiving warfarin, the international normalized ratio [INR] should be &lt;
             1.5). A patient requiring heparin is excluded.

          9. Undergoes chronic daily treatment with aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory medications known to inhibit platelet function (cyclooxygenase-2
             [COX-2] inhibitors are permitted).

         10. Has a history or clinical evidence of a deep venous or arterial thrombosis (including
             pulmonary embolism) 6 months prior to the first dose of study medication.

         11. Has proteinuria ≥ 2+ by routine urinalysis

         12. Pregnancy (confirmed by serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin) or lactating
