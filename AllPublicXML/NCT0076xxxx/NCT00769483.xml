      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: Determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-0646 in combination with
           gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus erlotinib and recommended phase II dose.

        -  Phase II:

             -  Assess progression-free survival (PFS) with a) gemcitabine plus MK-0646 b)
                gemcitabine plus erlotinib plus MK-0646 and c) gemcitabine plus erlotinib.

             -  Explore IGF1 tissue level as a predictive biomarker for MK-0646 therapy in phase II
                expansion cohort.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assess overall response rate (ORR), treatment toxicity, and overall survival (OS) with
           the addition of MK-0646 to gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus erlotinib.

        -  Correlate PFS and OS with IGF-1, IGFBP-3 levels and the expression of p-IRS, IGF-1R, EMT
           biomarkers, Akt, Erk, mTOR, and PI13k in tumor cells.

        -  To assess the incidence of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the IgF1R pathway related
           genes (IGF1, IGF1R, IRS1 and IRS2). These genotypes will be correlated with the clinical
           endpoints of this study, including OS, ORR and PFS.

      Phase I

      The Study Drugs:

      MK-0646 is designed to block proteins that are thought to cause cancer cells to grow and
      spread. This drug may help slow the growth of tumors.

      Gemcitabine is designed to disrupt the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells
      to die.

      Erlotinib hydrochloride is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface
      of many tumor cells that may control the growth and survival of cancer cells. This may stop
      cancer cells from growing.

      Study Drug Dose Level and Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a group
      (Arm A or Arm B) based on when you joined the study, how many participants have been enrolled
      before you, and on the safety data that is available at that time.

        -  If you are in Arm A, you will receive MK-0646 and gemcitabine.

        -  If you are in Arm B, you will receive MK-0646, gemcitabine, and erlotinib hydrochloride.

      There are 2 dose levels of MK-0646 in each arm. There will be 3-6 participants enrolled in
      each dose level in each arm. Enrollment will begin in Arm A. Arm B will use the same 2 dose
      levels as Arm A. If the first dose level of Arm A is found to be tolerable, at least 3
      patients will be enrolled in Arm B, Level 1, and then at least 3 patients will be enrolled in
      Arm A, Level 2. If Arm B, Level 1 and Arm A, Level 2 can be safely given, the last group of
      3-6 patients will be enrolled in Arm B, Level 2. The first group of participants in each arm
      will receive the lower dose level. The next group in each arm will receive a higher dose than
      the first group, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

      The dose of gemcitabine and/or erlotinib hydrochloride will be the same for every group.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are in Arm A, on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day study cycle, you will receive
      gemcitabine through a needle into your vein over about 1 1/2 hours. On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
      of each cycle, you will receive MK-0646 by vein over 1 hour.

      If you are in Arm B, you will take erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth once a day (in the
      morning) every day. You should take it with about 1 cup (8 oz.) of water 1 hour before or 2
      hours after eating. On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive gemcitabine by vein
      over about 1 1/2 hours. On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, you will receive MK-0646 by
      vein over 1 hour.

      Depending upon how well you tolerate gemcitabine, your doctor may decide that you should
      receive gemcitabine on Days 1 and 15 instead of Days 1, 8, and 15.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, AJCC
             stage IV

          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             =/&gt;20 mm with conventional techniques or as =/&gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. See Section
             11 for the evaluation of measurable disease. Measurable disease must be present
             outside a previous radiation field or if inside, it must be a new lesion.

          3. At least 6 months must have elapsed after completion of adjuvant therapy (if
             applicable).

          4. Age =/&gt;18 years.

          5. ECOG Performance Status 0-1 (Karnofsky =/&gt;60%).

          6. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: 1) leukocytes
             =/&gt;3,000 cells/mm^3; 2) absolute neutrophil count =/&gt;1,500 cells/mm^3; 4) platelets
             =/&gt;100,000 cells/mm^3; 5) total bilirubin &lt;1.5mg/dl; 6) AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =/&lt;2.5 X
             institutional upper limit of normal for patients without liver metastasis, =/&lt; 5X
             institutional upper limit of normal for patients with liver metastasis; 7) creatinine
             - within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance =/&gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for
             patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          7. Fasting blood glucose =/&lt;160 mg/dl, prior to study enrollment. (For higher values,
             blood glucose may be controlled by dietary intervention, oral hypoglycemics and/ or
             insulin prior to enrollment).

          8. Women of child-bearing potential (defined as not post-menopausal for 12 months or no
             previous surgical sterilization) and fertile men must agree to use adequate
             contraception for the duration of study participation. Acceptable contraception is
             defined as double-barrier methods (any double combination of: IUD, male or female
             condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap). Acceptable
             contraception must be used for 90 days after last dose of study drugs.

          9. (Continuation of inclusion criteria # 8) Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Signed informed consent form must be obtained prior to initiation of study evaluations
             and/or activities.

         11. INR &lt;1.5 (or =/&lt;3 if on anticoagulation therapy)

         12. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial.

         13. In phase II expansion cohort, which is primarily for predictive biomarker correlation,
             patients enrolled will be those with pre-existing core biopsies of primary tumor or
             metastatic site or must be willing to undergo a biopsy for correlative studies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy for metastatic disease

          2. Prior exposure to IGF-1R inhibitors.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to the agents used in the study.

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          6. Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in infants secondary to treatment of the mother the
             study agents. If a pregnancy test (serum or urine) is positive, patient will be
             excluded.

          7. Patients who are known to be HIV-positive are ineligible because these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          8. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or any other cancer from
             which the patient has been disease-free for two years.

          9. Patients must not be currently enrolled in a therapeutic study for pancreatic cancer.
