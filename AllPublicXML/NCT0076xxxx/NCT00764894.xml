        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have knee joint disease related to one or more of the following

               -  osteoarthritis

               -  post-traumatic arthritis

               -  inflammatory tissue disorders

               -  arthritis secondary to other diseases

               -  Avascular necrosis of the femoral condyles;

          -  Skeletal maturity

          -  Less than 70 on the Knee Society Score (rating score)

          -  Sufficient bone stock, as judged by radiographs, to support primary knee implant

          -  Sufficient collateral ligaments to support the device, as judged by physician during
             stability testing (varus/valgus and flexion/extension) and less than 45 degree
             varus/valgus deformity and/or 90 degree flexion contracture

          -  Patient is likely to be available for evaluation for the duration of the study

          -  Able and willing to sign the informed consent and follow study procedures

          -  Patient is not pregnant

          -  No infection present

          -  No known materials sensitivity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Skeletal immaturity

          -  Greater than or equal to 70 on preoperative Knee Society Score (Rating Score)

          -  Post-patellectomy

          -  Insufficient bone quality which may affect implant stability

          -  Insufficient collateral ligaments, as judged by the physician. Greater than 45 degree
             varus/valgus deformity and/or 90 degree flexion contracture.

          -  Neurological conditions that might hinder patient's ability to follow study procedures
             (i.e., any that restrict physical activities such as Parkinson's Disease, Multiple
             Sclerosis, previous stroke which affects lower extremity)

          -  Mental conditions that may interfere with ability to give an informed consent or
             willingness to fulfill the study requirements (i.e., severe mental retardation such
             that the patient cannot understand the informed consent process, global dementia,
             prior strokes that interfere with the patient's cognitive abilities, senile dementia,
             and Alzheimer's Disease)

          -  Prisoners

          -  Conditions that place excessive demand on the implant (i.e. Charcot's joints, muscle
             deficiencies, refusal to modify postoperative physical activities, skeletal
             immaturity)

          -  Patient is pregnant

          -  Infection present

          -  Materials sensitivity
