  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic heart failure (DHF), which affects older individuals and women at a
      disproportionate rate, is a condition that can lead to shortness of breath and fluid build-up
      in the lungs. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the medication sildenafil at
      improving exercise ability and health outcomes in people with DHF.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DHF is a condition in which one of the chambers of the heart, the left ventricle, loses its
      ability to relax completely because the muscle has become too stiff. When this occurs, the
      heart is unable to properly fill with blood, which can lead to decreased blood circulation.
      People with DHF may experience shortness of breath and pulmonary congestion, which is an
      abnormal build-up of fluid in the lungs. Current treatment for DHF includes
      guidelines/recommendations to lower blood pressure, stop smoking, and lose weight, but there
      are no medications available to specifically treat DHF. Sildenafil, commonly known as Revatio
      or Viagra, is a medication that increases the supply of blood to the lungs and reduces the
      workload of the heart. Preliminary studies have shown that sildenafil may be beneficial at
      improving heart and lung function in people with DHF, but more research is needed to confirm
      these findings. The purpose of this study is to determine if sildenafil can improve exercise
      ability and health outcomes in people with DHF.

      This 24-week study will enroll people with DHF. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either sildenafil or placebo three times a day for 24 weeks. Participants will attend
      study visits at baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 12, 13, and 24. At most study visits, the following
      procedures will occur: physical exam, medical history review, questionnaires, blood
      collection, 6-minute walk test to measure endurance, and an exercise test. At baseline and
      Week 24, participants will also undergo an electrocardiogram, which will measure the
      electrical activity of the heart, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure
      and an echocardiogram, which will both obtain pictures of the heart. At Weeks 3, 8, 16, and
      20, study researchers will call participants to collect health information.

    <description>Participants ranked sequentially with ranking stratified in one of three tiers based on:
Death (lowest tier) The person with the shortest time from randomization to death is given the lowest rank within the tier.
Hospitalizations due to cardiovascular or renal causes (middle tier) For patients alive, the ranking within this tier is based on time to hospitalization from randomization date. The person with the first cardiovascular or renal cause hospitalization will be given the lowest rank within the tier.
Change in Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) from baseline (highest tier)
The use of three tiers within the ranking reflects the greater adverse impact of death or cardiovascular hospitalization on clinical status without an arbitrary assignment as to the relative value of these events in relation to changes in quality of life. Rank order: 1-189 (higher values are better)</description>

Patients respond to 21 items using a six-point response scale (0-5). The total summary score can range from 0-105 with a lower score reflecting better heart failure related QOL. Two sub-scale scores reflect physical (8 items) and emotional (5 items) impairment.

        <description>Participants ranked sequentially with ranking stratified in one of three tiers based on:
Death (lowest tier) The person with the shortest time from randomization to death is given the lowest rank within the tier.
Hospitalizations due to cardiovascular or renal causes (middle tier) For patients alive, the ranking within this tier is based on time to hospitalization from randomization date. The person with the first cardiovascular or renal cause hospitalization will be given the lowest rank within the tier.
Change in Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) from baseline (highest tier)
The use of three tiers within the ranking reflects the greater adverse impact of death or cardiovascular hospitalization on clinical status without an arbitrary assignment as to the relative value of these events in relation to changes in quality of life. Rank order: 1-189 (higher values are better)</description>

        <title>Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ)</title>
        <description>The MLWHFQ is a self-administered, disease-specific measure of health related quality of life (QOL) that assesses patients perceptions of the influence of heart failure on physical, socioeconomic and psychological aspects of life. Patients respond to 21 items using a six-point response scale (0-5). The total summary score can range from 0-105 with a lower score reflecting better heart failure related QOL. Two sub-scale scores reflect physical (8 items) and emotional (5 items) impairment.
Total score: 0 – 105 Physical subscore: 0 – 40 Emotional subscore: 0 – 25</description>

          <title>Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ)</title>
          <description>The MLWHFQ is a self-administered, disease-specific measure of health related quality of life (QOL) that assesses patients perceptions of the influence of heart failure on physical, socioeconomic and psychological aspects of life. Patients respond to 21 items using a six-point response scale (0-5). The total summary score can range from 0-105 with a lower score reflecting better heart failure related QOL. Two sub-scale scores reflect physical (8 items) and emotional (5 items) impairment.
