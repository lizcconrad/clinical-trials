  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits of anulus fibrosus repair utilizing
      Xclose™ compared to a discectomy without anulus fibrosus repair.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discectomy surgery is intended to remove the impinging fragment on the nerve root thus
      alleviating the pain and providing the nerve with a better healing environment. Discectomy
      procedures entail removing a bony portion of the vertebral body to access the posterior side
      of the disc space, and then removing the impinging fragment from the disc. The fragment being
      removed can either be contained within the wall of the anulus, which requires incision into
      the anulus to remove it, or it could be extruded through an anular fissure. In the absence of
      a safe and easy method to close or seal the defect in the anulus following a discectomy
      procedure, surgeons are left with no alternative but to leave the anulus in this compromised
      state which is largely the current practice. This rent in the soft tissue of the anulus
      fibrosus can lead to postoperative problems if the remaining nuclear tissue in the disc
      pushes through the anular defect or incision causing recurrent or persistent pain.

      Initial studies involved the placement of sutures to seal the anular defect. This work
      strongly suggested that microsurgical anular reconstruction can reduce recurrent herniations
      and re-operations, post discectomy. Unfortunately, this technique is not easy to perform and
      may pose an increased risk to the patient.

      This study utilizes the Xclose™ Tissue Repair System to re-approximate the compromised tissue
      of the anulus fibrosus in appropriately randomized patients in an effort to quantify the
      benefits of anular repair for discectomy patients.
