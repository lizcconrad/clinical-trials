      To characterize the pharmacokinetics of phenylephrine in two pediatric populations: children,
      ages 2 to &lt;12 years, and adolescents, ages 12 to &lt;18 years.

    <textblock>
      This study has an open-label, single-dose classical pharmacokinetic design with no comparator
      treatment or group. At least twenty-four (24) children, ages 2 to &lt;12 years, and twelve (12)
      adolescents, ages 12 to &lt;18 years, with nasal symptoms due to hay fever or other upper
      respiratory allergies will complete the study. To ensure that younger children are
      represented, at least 35% (8) of the 24 children enrolled will range from 2 to &lt;6 years of
      age.

             of 24 pounds will be eligible to participate. In addition, each subject will be &gt; 5th
             percentile and &lt; 95th percentile for weight based on age and gender.

          -  Subjects will have a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 5th percentile and less than or equal to
             the 90th percentile for age and gender.

          -  Subjects who have a history of allergic rhinitis and who are experiencing nasal
             symptoms associated with hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies will be
             included.
