  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter, dual-strata study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of IV romidepsin given in combination with IV bortezomib for multiple
      myeloma (MM) patients with refractory or relapsed disease. Patients will be enrolled into one
      of two strata, bortezomib-resistant or bortezomib non-resistant.

            <description>Romidepsin was given as an infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Bortezomib was administered twice a week for two consecutive weeks (Days 1, 4, 8 and 11) followed by a 17-day rest period.
Patients were treated to a maximum response plus two additional cycles or a maximum of eight cycles.</description>
