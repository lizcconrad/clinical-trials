  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether biomarkers assessed in blood samples can be used to detect individuals
      at risk for developing blood clots or worsening of their underlying disease. The ultimate
      goal of the study is to identify key biomarkers derived from blood that are most
      characteristic and informative of individuals who will go on to develop a clotting
      complication.
