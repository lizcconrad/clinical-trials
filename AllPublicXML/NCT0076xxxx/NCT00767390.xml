    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this clinical investigation is to observe the changes in relative conductivity
      between the six ACL patches over time. In addition, the clinical investigation will evaluate
      the impact of prolonged placement of the ACL patches on subjects' skin on the chest and back.
      During the study the adhesiveness properties of the patches will be evaluated.
