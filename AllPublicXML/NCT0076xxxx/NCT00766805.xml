  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Both endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and propranolol are valuable methods for
      secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Addition of ISMN to propranolol improves the
      efficacy of drug therapy. It is hypothesized that a combination of EVL and portal pressure
      reducing drugs should significantly be better than EVL alone.

      Patients and Methods: Patients with history of variceal bleed were randomized to EVL plus
      drugs (propranolol and ISMN) or EVL alone. EVL was repeated every 3-4 weeks until variceal
      eradication. Propranolol dose was adjusted to reduce the resting heart rate to 55 bpm. Dose
      of ISMN was 40 mg/d. Primary end points were rebleed or death. Secondary end points included
      complications of portal hypertension and the development of serious adverse effects to
      therapy.

    <description>Treatment was started with propranolol at a dose of 40 mg twice a day. The heart rate and blood pressure were checked after 12 to 24 hours. The dose of propranolol was increased at increments of 20 to 40 mg per day until the patient achieved a heart rate of 55 bpm, or a maximum dose of 320 mg/day was achieved.ISMN was added at a dose of 10 mg twice a day. The dose was escalated at increments of 10-20 mg/day till a maximum dose of 40 mg/day was reached.</description>
