  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a decision aid (written information booklet designed
      to facilitate informed decision making) to help people aged 55-64 years, with low levels of
      education and literacy, make an informed choice about bowel cancer screening, using faecal
      occult blood testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several countries have recently implemented national bowel cancer screening programs. To
      ensure equal access to screening, consumer information is needed to suit adults ranging in
      literacy level. Decision aids (DAs) are tools which have been developed to assist patients
      and consumers make informed health decisions and encourage active participation in health
      care decisions. Their use in a wide range of clinical settings has increased dramatically.
      However, most DAs are highly dependent upon high levels of literacy and numeracy, and few
      have been developed for low literacy populations.

      This primary aims of this study are to assess the impact of the decision aid on (1) the
      proportion of adults who make an informed choice about bowel cancer screening (using faecal
      occult blood test) and, (2) the level of involvement in screening decisions among adults with
      lower levels of education and literacy.

      There are three secondary aims of the study. First, to measure the effect of the decision
      support tool on decisional conflict, decision satisfaction, anxiety, and bowel cancer worry.
      Second, to identify participant's screening interest, intentions and behavior. Thirdly, we
      will explore participant's reactions towards the information materials they receive and
      whether the doctor influenced their screening decision.
