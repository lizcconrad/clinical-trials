  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore how cultural differences influence genetics research in developing
      countries. Human genetics research is becoming more common in developing countries. However,
      when research is conducted with people living in developing countries, there is a chance that
      culture differences can lead to misunderstandings between investigators and participants,
      resulting in ineffective research. This study will explore challenges facing investigators
      conducting genetics research in developing countries and opportunities to improve this kind
      of research.

      Scientists who have conducted genetics research in a developing country may be eligible to
      participate in this study. Participants are interviewed by telephone. The interview, which
      lasts about an hour, includes questions about the researchers decision to conduct the study
      they have done, the times they noticed that culture played a role in the research and the
      times that were more challenging and less challenging.

      The interviews are recorded, transcribed and analyzed for themes related to cultural
      congruence and specific challenges and opportunities with regard to cultural congruence.

      The objective of the proposed study is to describe cultural congruence, including diversity,
      awareness, sensitivity, and competence in people conducting human genetics research in
      developing countries, as well as to explore challenges and opportunities to improve cultural
      congruence. Human genetics research is becoming more common in developing countries, as
      researchers take advantage of differences in environment and population diversity. However,
      when research is conducted with individuals living in developing countries, there is a chance
      that culture will lead to misunderstandings between investigators and participants and
      consequently ineffective research. The proposed study uses a cross-sectional semi-structured
      qualitative interview design. Thirty to forty-five participants will be recruited.
      Participants will be researchers with experience in conducting genetics research in
      developing countries, who will have had direct contact with the participants in their
      research studies. These researchers will be recruited from professional organizations,
      through identification of lead authors in literature searches, and through snowball
      recruitment. Interviews will be conducted by telephone, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed
      for themes related to cultural congruence and specific challenges and opportunities with
      regard to cultural congruence.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Participants will include genetics researchers who have had direct contact with
             participants in human genetic research in developing countries. A researcher may be
             defined as any project staff, faculty, or investigator involved in carrying out a
             genetics research protocol in a developing country. Project staff are included as
             potential participants so that whoever has most contact with genetic research
             participants is able to participate in the proposed study.

          -  Researchers will be able to decide whether the country that they are working in is
             defined as a developing country, as opposed to dictating a fixed list of countries
             that qualify. This will be assessed by participant report during the screening
             process.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Researchers who do research in developing countries but do not have direct contact
             with human participants.

          -  Participants who are non-English-speaking or under the age of 18.
