          -  Women with urinary stress incontinence defined as follow

          -  Involuntary loss of urine during increased abdominal pressure. In case of mix urinary
             incontinence (i.e., stress urinary incontinence associated to urge urinary
             incontinence) the discomfort related to stress incontinence as evaluated on a 0 (no
             discomfort) to 100 (maximum discomfort) visual analogic scale is higher for stress
             incontinence than for urge incontinence symptoms.

          -  closure pressure between 10 and 60 cm H2O

          -  the discomfort related to stress incontinence as evaluated on a 0 (no discomfort) to
             100 (maximum discomfort) visual analogical scale is higher than 40/100

          -  Patients never treated with transvaginal electrical stimulation

          -  Vaginal muscle strength less than 3/5 on the muscular testing

          -  Positive Pad test (&gt;2 g of leakage measure by pad test with standardised bladder
             volume)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient refusing to sign the consent form

          -  patient unable to understand or follow the protocol

          -  inadequate cognitive ability

          -  patient participating in another research protocol within the 3 previous months

          -  pregnancy

          -  women with no contraception

          -  pacemaker

          -  history of recent (&lt; 1 year) transvaginal electrical stimulation treatment at home

          -  urinary incontinence other than stress incontinence

          -  neurological disease

          -  permanent metrorrhagia

          -  ongoing urinary tract infections

          -  vaginal prolapse &gt; 2

          -  untreated atrophic vaginitis

          -  history of surgical treatment for urinary stress incontinence or genital prolapse

          -  recent pelvic surgery (&lt;6 months)

          -  anatomic defect that preclude the use of the device

          -  genitourinary cancer or colic cancer

          -  patient already treated for urinary stress incontinence

          -  Recent oestrogen treatment (less than 3 weeks)
