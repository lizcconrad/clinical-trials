      The CopiOs Bone Void Filler (BVF) is a synthetic bone graft material consisting of calcium
      phosphate dehydrate within lyophilized type I bovine collagen that has been formed into pads
      of various sizes for surgical implantation. Pre-clinical animal studies suggest that the bone
      healing strength of CopiOs to be equivalent to autograft.

      Purpose of the study is to evaluate the in-vivo use of CopiOs bone void filler in a single
      site trial, providing pre and post-operative evaluations of subjects undergoing spinal fusion
      with autogenous bone graft, in whom the CopiOs has been used as a bone void filler in the
      post-harvest iliac crest.

          -  Patient is pregnant.

          -  Patient has a severe degenerative bone disease.

          -  Patient has systemic conditions which would affect bone or wound healing.

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to follow postoperative instructions or cooperate in a
             follow-up program.

          -  Patient is suffering from mental illness, alcohol abuse or drug abuse.
