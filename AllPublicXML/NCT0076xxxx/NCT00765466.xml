      This is an open label, Phase II, multi-center study designed to evaluate the effect of AVR118
      when administered to patients with systemic symptoms related to recurrent or metastatic
      cancers who may or may not be undergoing anti-cancer treatment. During the initial, induction
      treatment phase of the study, AVR118, 4.0 mL, will be given subcutaneously each day for 28
      days. Patients who respond to the trial period dosing will be eligible to continue on AVR118
      if they and their physicians believe it would be beneficial, and if no safety concerns are
      raised.
