  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test that LY450139, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, will reduce the rate of newly synthesize
      Amyloid Beta by determining the amount of newly synthesized 13C6 leucine-labeled Amyloid Beta
      in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid from LY450139 treated subjects compared with placebo treated
      subjects.
