      This is a nonrandomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination
      treatment of Nilotinib and RAD001 in the treatment of c-kit + AML. Patients refractory to
      standard chemotherapy or not eligible to standard chemotherapy can be included. Patients will
      be treated with 400 mg Nilotinib bid (total daily dose 800 mg). RAD001 will be added after a
      treatment duration of 1 week in a dosage of 2,5 mg/day. Treatment duration will be 25 weeks.

             stem cell transplant less than 2 months previously.

          4. Impaired cardiac function, including any one of the following:

               -  LVEF &lt; 45% or below the institutional lower limit of the normal range (whichever
