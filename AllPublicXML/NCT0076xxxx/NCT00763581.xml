      This study will attempt to increase understanding of why bipolar disorder patients do or do
      not take their medications by conducting in-depth interviews with them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disruptive manic and depressive episodes prevent bipolar disorder (BPD) sufferers from living
      healthy, functional lives. Relapse rates for BPD are high, between 70% and 90%, with
      approximately half of those relapses occurring in the first 2 years after remission. High
      rates of relapse and no substantial improvements in illness outcomes for many patients
      despite advances in drug treatment may be related to a common problem: medication
      nonadherence. Nine in 10 individuals with BPD have seriously considered medication
      withdrawal, and one third of individuals with BDP do not take 30% or more of their prescribed
      medications. The researchers in this study will identify BPD patients who do not take their
      medications as prescribed and conduct interviews with them. By obtaining an understanding of
      subjective reasons for medication nonadherence, this study will pave the way for better
      interventions to ensure BDP patients take the medications that will help them.

      Participation in this study will consist of a single visit, lasting between 1.5 and 3 hours.
      All participants will have a history of medication nonadherence. Participants will be asked
      to fill out questionnaires and undergo a structured interview with a researcher. The
      interview will be audio recorded. The questionnaires and interview will assess BPD symptoms,
      attitudes toward medications, and to what extent patients are taking their medications.
      Researchers will also measure the number of pills used in participants' prescriptions by
      counting how many pills are left in each prescription bottle.

        Twenty adults (10 men and 10 women) receiving standard outpatient mental health treatment
        at Connections, a community mental health clinic (CMHC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BPD) Type I or Type II, as determined by a
             standardized diagnostic interview, the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview
             (MINI)

          -  Demonstrated history of poor medication adherence, as determined by self-report or
             clinician report. In this study, self-reported treatment nonadherence will be
             identified with the Tablet Routines Questionnaire (TRQ). Poorly adherent individuals
             will be defined as those who miss 30% or more of medication within either the past
             week or past month (those missing 30% or more within past week will be considered to
             be non-adherent over the past month). Clinician-assessed nonadherence will be
             identified via a clinician version of the TRQ to identify nonadherence of 30% or more
             over the past 30 days.

          -  BPD of at least 2 years' duration

          -  Treatment with medication to stabilize mood for at least 6 months

          -  A Clinical Global Impression (CGI-BP) overall bipolar illness score of 4 or higher

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable or unwilling to participate in psychiatric interviews, as based on the clinical
             opinion of the investigator or the treating clinician

          -  High risk of suicide, as seen in factors such as active suicidal ideation, recent
             suicide attempt, or current suicidal intent or plan

          -  Inability to speak English

          -  Receiving treatment involuntarily
