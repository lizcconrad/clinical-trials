    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of novel treating agents or agents used
      for compassionate rescue, subjects and their wounds will be analyzed retrospectively and
      their non-identifiable information will be compiled in the form of case studies. Subjects who
      demonstrated characteristics of interest (e.g. healing) as determined by the PI will be
      chosen for case studies.

      All wounds at the Southwest Regional Wound Care Center (WCC) are managed using anti-biofilm
      strategies. When determining the therapeutic course for a patient and his full thickness
      wound, all management agents that are available are considered for use; and the clinician
      uses his judgment to determine the most appropriate tools to use that will give the patient
      the most likely chance of success. Some of the agents that are used are novel, and it is
      appropriate to demonstrate to others the potential usefulness of these agents
