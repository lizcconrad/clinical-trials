  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who are not
      tolerating or not responding well to stimulant therapy will be included in this study. Two
      different strategies for transition from Stimulant to Atomoxetine will be used: Slow (10
      weeks) and fast (2 weeks). Changes in ADHD symptoms and tolerability of medication will be
      compared between the two different switching approaches.

      Study B4Z-EW-LYFJ is a phase IV multicentre, open label, controlled study in approximately
      120 patients with ADHD from 6 years to 16 years of age. After the screening period, patients
      will be randomized (centrally in a 1:1 ratio) either to a transition period of 10 weeks (slow
      switching arm) or to a transition period of 2 weeks (fast switching arm). After completion of
      the 10 week open phase patients will be treated for a further 4 weeks with atomoxetine.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) Parent Version: Investigator Administered and Scored - Total Score at Week 10 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the 18 symptoms contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Individual item scores range from 0 (none/never or rarely) to 3 (severe/very often). Total scores range from 0 to 54. Higher score indicates greater severity of disease. Least squares means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GIPD scale is a 5-item rating of ADHD-related difficulties (overall difficulties perceived in the morning, during school, during homework, in the evening, and over the entire day and night). For each item, difficulties during the past week are rated on a 7-point scale (1 = normal, not difficult at all; 7 = extremely difficult) and the mean of the 5 items is reported. Least square means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI- S is a single-item clinician rating of the severity of the participant's ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician's total experience of ADHD participants. Severity is rated on a seven-point scale (1 = normal, not ill at all; 7 = among the most extremely ill patients). Least square means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Child Health and Illness Profile Child Edition-Parent Report Form (CHIP-CE-PRF) - Domain Scores at Week 10 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CHIP-CE-PRF consists of 76 items. The majority of items assess frequency of activities or feelings using a five-point response format. Standard scores (t-value) were established, with all domains and subdomains having a mean score of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. Standard scores are expressed in SD units. T-score=[(Score- Mean for the reference population [Ref Pop])*10/SD for the Ref Pop]+50. Higher scores mean better quality of life. Least square means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</description>

        <description>The GIPD scale is a 5-item rating of ADHD-related difficulties (overall difficulties perceived in the morning, during school, during homework, in the evening, and over the entire day and night). For each item, difficulties during the past week are rated on a 7-point scale (1 = normal, not difficult at all; 7 = extremely difficult) and the mean of the 5 items is reported. Least square means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Intention to treat (ITT) population includes all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, that is, they have a non-missing dose for atomoxetine study treatment.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Child Health and Illness Profile Child Edition-Parent Report Form (CHIP-CE-PRF) - Domain Scores at Week 10 Endpoint</title>
        <description>CHIP-CE-PRF consists of 76 items. The majority of items assess frequency of activities or feelings using a five-point response format. Standard scores (t-value) were established, with all domains and subdomains having a mean score of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. Standard scores are expressed in SD units. T-score=[(Score– Mean for the reference population [Ref Pop])*10/SD for the Ref Pop]+50. Higher scores mean better quality of life. Least square means are adjusted for baseline, site, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction.</description>
