      RATIONALE: Gathering information from older patients with newly diagnosed cancer may help
      doctors learn more about the risks of functional decline.

      PURPOSE: This studying is looking at the physical and mental health of older patients with
      newly diagnosed cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To create a Geriatric-Oncology database of patients 65 years of age and older with newly
           diagnosed cancer who have been identified as being at increased risk of functional
           decline and mortality within a year.

        -  To enhance the Geriatric-Oncology Database by linking it to the Central Medicare
           Services (CMS) Database and the Ohio Death Files.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo a 1-hour comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline and periodically
      during the study as part of routine care. The assessments include the Lawton's nine-item
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL); the Katz's Activity of Daily Living (ADL);
      the Timed Up and Go Test; the Karnofsky Physician-Rated Performance Rating Scale (KPS); the
      number of falls in the past 6 months; the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA); the Body Mass
      Index; the percent of unintentional weight loss in the past 6 months; the Medical Outcomes
      Study (MOS) Social Support Subscale (emotional/information and tangible subscales); the MOS
      Social Activity Limitations Measures; the Charlson Comorbidity Index; the Cumulative Index
      Rating Scale Geriatrics (CIRS-G); the ACE-27; the Folstein's Mini-Mental State Examination
      (MMSE); the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); the Functional Pain Scale; and a list of
      medications.

      Data will be obtained from patients medical records at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 3
      years. At completion of 1 and 3 years of follow up, the Geriatric-Oncology Database will be
      linked to the Central Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Database and the Ohio Death Files.
