      Detailed activity:

        -  Family members and caregivers of carrier residents will be screened for ESBL and MRSA.
           Screening will be performed by obtaining nares and perirectal cultures. Nares cultures
           will be obtained by ward staff or research personnel who are experienced in performing
           this activity: a moisture swab will be applied gently to the distal part of both nares.
           Perirectal cultures, will be taken by swab, who will be applied to the perirectal area,
           either by staff as mentioned above, or will be given to the participants to perform by
           himself (with explanation on how to perform it).

        -  The Family and Caregiver Screening Form will be filled out; results of screening will be
           added to the forms. This data will be stored after removal of all Family members'
           identifiers for further analysis.

        -  In order to allow follow up, a list linking between the Family members' study number and
           his identifying details will be kept separately in the rehabilitation center. This list
           will not be transferred elsewhere.
