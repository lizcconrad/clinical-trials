      Effect of moderate alcohol consumption in form of red wine, beer and ethanol solution and
      corresponding de-alcoholised beverages on immune measures.

        -  In healthy middle aged men and women

        -  In a randomized controlled cross-over trial

        -  Two intervention periods over 3 weeks

      Alcohol consumption and mortality from all causes are associated in a U-shaped manner. That
      means that individuals who regularly consume moderate amounts of alcohol (~1 to 2 drinks/day
      at maximum) on average live longer than abstainers or heavy drinkers. This is primarily
      through a reduced risk for fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease events (CHD) such as
      myocardial infarction. In the last 10 to 15 years compelling evidence has bolstered the
      hypothesis that atherosclerosis is at least in part an inflammatory disease. It is also
      known, that alcohol influences the immune system. These facts make an impact of alcohol on
      the various stages of atherosclerosis via anti-inflammatory effects a reasonable assumption.

      To test the effect of moderate amounts of different types of alcoholic beverages on markers
      of inflammation with high predictive potential for atherothrombotic complications of
      atherosclerosis will be examined in a cross-over short-term interventional trial. Six groups,
      each comprising 12 healthy individuals aged 22-56 will be included. After two weeks of
      abstinence from alcoholic beverages two cross-over interventional phases (each lasting 3
      weeks) with red wine, beer, de-alcoholised red wine and beer of the same brand, ethanol, or
      water will follow. The interventions will be followed by a wash-out period of 2 weeks.
      Several inflammatory markers and in-vitro migration of freshly isolated monocytes will be
      determined before and after intervention.
