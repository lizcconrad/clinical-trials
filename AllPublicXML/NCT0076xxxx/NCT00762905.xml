  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and utility of LiquiBand Laparoscopic™ in relation to
      a currently approved active control product (High Viscosity DermaBond). Specifically, the
      study is powered to demonstrate that LiquiBand Laparoscopic™ is not inferior to DermaBond in
      the rates of infection, dehiscence, cosmesis and apposition of the skin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-masked multi-center clinical trial.
      Patients requiring laparoscopic surgery will be enrolled and randomized to receive either
      LiquiBand Laparoscopic™ or DermaBond High Viscosity for incision closure. No other closure
      methods will be allowed. All eligible laparoscopic incisions per patient will be enrolled.
      Patients will be followed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-procedure to assess wound
      characteristics, wound infection, wound dehiscence and at 3 months for cosmesis. The study
      will be double-masked in that both the wound evaluator and patient will be masked to the
      randomized study treatment assignment.

    <description>LiquiBand Laparoscopic™ is a sterile, liquid adhesive made up of a blend of n-butyl and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate intended for soft tissue approximation of skin wounds. It is packaged in a sterile, single-use, nylon applicator with internal glass ampoule containing 0.8g of adhesive and sealed in a PETG/Tyvek blister pack. LiquiBand Laparoscopic™ is intended to be applied topically to pre-apposed wound edges. The tissue adhesive sets rapidly (5 - 10 seconds) to hold the wound closed. Following wound closure the product is designed to apply a broad coverage of adhesive to act as a liquid dressing to protect the wound.</description>

    <description>High viscosity DermaBond Topical Skin Adhesive is a sterile, liquid topical skin adhesive containing a monomeric (2-octyl cyanoacrylate) formulation and the colorant D &amp; C Violet #2. It is provided in a single use applicator packaged in a blister pouch. The applicator is comprised of a crushable glass ampule contained within a plastic vial with attached applicator tip. As applied to skin, the liquid is syrup-like in viscosity and polymerizes within minutes.</description>
