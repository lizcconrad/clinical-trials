      This is an open-label, randomized, parallel-group clinical study. The primary objective is to
      assess the difference in response rate between mometasone furoate cream 0.1% (once daily) vs
      fluticasone propionate cream 0.05% (twice daily) by the end of Day 4 and Day 8 in the
      management of Indian patients with localized psoriasis.
