  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quetiapine, a second generation antipsychotic, has shown beneficial activity on fibromyalgia
      symptomatology, administered as add-on treatment, in a sample of 35 patients. The purpose of
      the present study is to compare, in a controlled setting, the efficacy and the tolerability
      of quetiapine extended release with amitriptyline in the treatment of patients with
      fibromyalgia
