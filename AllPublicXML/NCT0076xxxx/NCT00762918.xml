  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is common in cystic fibrosis. Vitamin D deficiency frequently persists
      despite aggressive treatment with ergocalciferol, a vitamin D preparation also known as
      vitamin D2. Cholecalciferol, a vitamin D preparation also known as vitamin D3,may work better
      to increase vitamin D levels.

      Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium from the diet and bone health. Vitamin D
      more recently has been found to play a role in regulating the normal inflammatory process.
      Since cystic fibrosis is a state of excessive inflammation, vitamin D may be playing a role
      in cystic fibrosis.

      We hypothesize: cholecalciferol will work better to increase vitamin D levels in patients
      iwth cystic fibrosis and that it will have an effect on markers of inflammation.

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and persists despite relatively high
      doses of ergocalciferol, vitamin D2. Replacement has traditionally been focused upon
      maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and bone health. However, non-classic roles
      of vitamin D have become increasingly recognized and the contribution of vitamin D deficiency
      to non-bone disorders has become apparent. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with
      increased risk of a variety of cancers, autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and
      multiple sclerosis, Type 2 diabetes, tuberculosis, and myopathy. The connection between
      vitamin D and these disease states likely reflects vitamin D's role as a transcriptional
      regulator: it participates in cell cycle regulation and in the innate immune system mediates
      cathelicidin production following activation of toll-like receptors.One hallmark of CF is
      pulmonary hyper-inflammation with recurrent infections. Additionally, malnutrition and
      decreased lean muscle mass threaten pulmonary function in CF. While vitamin D and its
      relation to bone has been explored in CF, the role of vitamin D in inflammation, lean body
      mass and strength, and pulmonary muscle strength has not been investigated. Moreover, vitamin
      D replacement has traditionally been with ergocalciferol, vitamin D2. Vitamin D3,
      cholecalciferol, has a longer half-life and is considered more potent. Thus, cholecalciferol
      treatment of children and young adults with CF and vitamin D deficiency may be useful for
      attaining normal vitamin D status and for exploring the impact of vitamin D upon lean body
      mass, pulmonary muscle strength, and inflammation.
