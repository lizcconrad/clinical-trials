  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study. Part I is an observational study. Part II is a randomized clinical
      trial to see how well medical nutrition therapy works compared with standard care in treating
      patients with lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, or stage III or stage IV prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part II of the study, patients are stratified according to tumor type (pancreatic vs lung
      vs prostate). Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (Medical nutrition therapy): intervention with a registered dietitian or nutrition
           professional. MNT is a cyclical process which includes nutrition assessment,
           intervention, follow-up, and reassessment. Patients will receive a total of three (3)
           visits with the dietitian over a six-week period with follow-up during weeks 2-3 and
           weeks 6-9 based on their treatment schedule.

        -  Arm II (standard care): Standard nutritional care includes the National Cancer
           Institute's booklet &quot;Eating Hints for cancer patients: before, during &amp; after
           treatment&quot;.

      In both arms, patients' weight, fat free mass, and Patient Generated Subjective Global
      Assessment Score (PG-SGA) score will be assessed before, during, and after the intervention.
      The PG-SGA includes a patient report of symptoms and a healthcare professional assessment of
      medical, metabolic, and physical parameters.
