  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a safe and effective technique to take sample for lower
      respiratory tract cultures easy to perform in conditions of acute respiratory failure and
      spontaneous ventilation for patients admitted in intensive care unit for acute infectious
      pneumonia and non intubated. The investigators perform sample collection with a mini
      bronchoalveolar lavage catheter introduced by nasotracheal way through a suction catheter.
      The purpose of the study is to assess the microbiological diagnostic capacity of this new
      technique.

    <textblock>
      At the moment we lack an effective and safe technique to obtain lower respiratory tract
      cultures for patient with mild serious infectious pneumonia admitted in intensive care unit
      and non intubated. Invasive procedure may worsen respiratory distress and non invasive
      procedure such expectorated sputum culture is not enough effective. The purpose of the study
      is to assess the microbiological diagnosis capacity of a new technique for taking samples
      from the lower respiratory tract: mini bronchoalveolar lavage performed by naso tracheal way
      through a suction catheter.Each consecutive patient admitted in intensive care unit for a
      community acquired or nosocomial pneumonia and not requiring intubation and mechanical
      ventilation will be included. Written informed consent by patient himself will be required.
      For each patient, after the introduction of a suction catheter, an endotracheal aspiration
      will be performed. Then, the mini bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed through the
      suction catheter with a specific catheter.The whole time of the procedure is about ten
      minutes.Expectorated sputum will also be ordered for each patient.This study is a pilot and
      prospective study.

    <description>For each patient included an endotracheal aspiration and a mini bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed. After local anaesthesia, a suction catheter will be introduced in trachea by nasotracheal way. An endotracheal aspirate will be performed. Then, the mini bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed with the specific catheter introduced through the suction catheter. Expectorated sputum will also be ordered. This procedure will be performed once at the admission patient in intensive care unit.</description>
