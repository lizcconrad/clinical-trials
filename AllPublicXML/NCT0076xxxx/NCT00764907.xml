      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. A donor stem cell transplant may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving combination chemotherapy before the transplant helps stop
      the growth of cancer cells and stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's
      stem cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in
      treating young patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different risk-adjusted combination
      chemotherapy regimens in treating young patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To test in a randomized way the type and intensity of reintensification therapy for
           pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in each risk group: standard-risk
           (SR), intermediate-risk (IR), and high-risk (HR) group.

        -  To compare two shorter elements of reintensification (protocol III x 2 courses) to one
           (protocol II x 1 course) in terms of effectiveness when cumulative dose of most drugs
           are the same in both regimen in patients in the standard-risk group.

        -  To determine if the increased risk of failure in patients in the intermediate-risk group
           can be curtailed by a third reintensification element (protocol III x 3 courses vs
           protocol II x 1 course).

        -  To determine if the three reintensification elements (protocol III x 3 courses) achieve
           the same or better results in high-risk group patients, as compared with current applied
           HR approach in Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster Group (BFM) or Italian Association of Pediatric
           Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP).

      OUTLINE: This is a partially randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according
      to risk group (standard risk [SR] vs intermediate risk [IR] vs high risk [HR]). Patients are
      randomized in reinduction part of the treatment.

        -  Induction therapy:

             -  Protocol I' (SR B-cell precursor [BCP] ALL ): Patients receive methotrexate
                intrathecally (IT) on days 1, 12, and 33 (and possibly on days 18 and 27);

                except that they also receive daunorubicin hydrochloride on days 22 and 29.

      Approximately 2 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients proceed to
      consolidation therapy.

        -  Consolidation: Patients who have achieved complete cytomorphologic remission proceed to
           protocol mM or protocol M. Patients in HR group proceed to 3-block consolidation
           regimen.

                51.

             -  Protocol M (T-cell ALL) (SR or IR): Patients receive mercaptopurine, methotrexate
                IT, and leucovorin calcium as in protocol mM, and they also receive high-dose (HD)
                methotrexate IV over 24 hours on days 8, 22, 36, and 50.

             -  3-block consolidation regimen (HR): Patients receive 3 regimen blocks with 2 weeks
                between blocks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

                  -  Block HR-1': Patients receive dexamethasone orally or IV 3 times daily on days
                     1-5; vincristine sulfate IV on days 1-6; HD methotrexate IV over 24 hours on
                     day 1; leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hours, beginning 42 hours after the start
                     of HD methotrexate, for 3 doses; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, every 12
                     hours, on days 2-4; HD cytarabine IV over 3 hours, every 12 hours, on day 5 (2

                  -  Block HR-2': Patients receive dexamethasone, HD methotrexate, leucovorin
                     calcium, and asparaginase as in block HR-1'. Patients receive TIT once on day
                     1 (CNS-negative patients) or twice on days 1 and 5 (CNS-positive patients).
                     Patients also receive vindesine IV on days 1 and 6; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour,
                     every 12 hours, on days 2-4; and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours

                     days 1 and 2; and etoposide IV over 1 hour, every 12 hours, on days 3-5.

      Approximately 2 weeks after completion of consolidation therapy, patients proceed to
      reinduction therapy.

        -  Reinduction (randomized): Patients in continuous complete remission proceed to protocol
           II or III. Patients from SR and IR group are randomized to arms I and II; patients from
           HR group are randomized to arms II and III.

             -  Arm I (protocol II x 1 course) (SR-1 or IR-1): Patients receive dexamethasone
                orally or IV on days 1-21 followed by a taper; vincristine sulfate IV and
                doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, and 29; asparaginase IV
                over 1 hour on days 8, 11, 15, and 18; and methotrexate IT on days 1 and 18.

                IR-2, or HR-1): Patients receive dexamethasone orally or IV three times daily on
                days 1-14 followed by a taper; vincristine sulfate IV and doxorubicin hydrochloride
                IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8; and asparaginase IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8,
                and 11. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 15; oral
                thioguanine once daily on days 15-28; cytarabine IV continuously on days 17-20 and
                24-27; and methotrexate IT on days 17 and 21 (and day 1 if there is initial CNS
                involvement). Approximately 1 week after completion of protocol III (course 1),
                patients receive IMT for 10 weeks (SR group) or 4 weeks (IR and HR groups) as
                described below. Approximately 1 week after completion of IMT, patients receive
                protocol III as above (course 2). Approximately 1 week after completion of protocol
                III (course 2), patients in IR and HR group receive IMT for another 4 weeks
                followed by another course of protocol III (course 3) 1 week later.

                  -  IMT: Patients receive oral methotrexate once weekly and oral mercaptopurine
                     daily.

             -  Arm III (HR-2): Patients receive 1 of the following regimens according to local
                practices:

                  -  Regimen HR-2A: Patients receive protocol II as in arm I, rest 1 week and
                     receive IMT for 4 weeks. Approximately 1 week later, patients receive another
                     course of protocol II.

                  -  Regimen HR-2B: Patients receive treatment as in 3-block consolidation regimen
                     with 3 weeks between each block. Approximately 3 weeks later, patients receive
                     protocol II as in arm I.

             -  Cranial radiotherapy (CRT) during reinduction: CNS positive patients (CNS status 3)
                receive CRT after completion of protocol II (SR, IR, HR-2B) or during the first
                1.5-2.5 weeks of IMT (SR, IR, HR-2A). SR and IR patients with T-cell ALL and HR
                patients receive prophylactic CRT at these same time periods.

      Beginning 2 weeks after completion of reinduction (some patients in HR group also undergo
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as described below), patients proceed to maintenance
      therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy (MT): Patients receive oral mercaptopurine once daily and
           methotrexate IV once weekly. Each patient subgroup (except HR patients undergoing
           transplantation) receives MT for a period that brings the total weeks of treatment to
           104 weeks, as follows:

             -  SR: Patients receive MT for 74 weeks (SR-1) or 61 weeks (SR-2).

             -  IR: Patients receive MT for 74 weeks (IR-1) or 57 weeks (IR-2).

             -  HR: Patients receive MT for 58 weeks (HR-1), 62 weeks (HR-2A), or 63 weeks (HR-2B).

      Patients with BCP-ALL and in group SR-1 or IR-1 also receive methotrexate IT once in weeks 4,
      8, 12, and 16 of MT. Patients with BCP-ALL and in group SR-2 receive methotrexate IT in weeks
      4 and 8 of MT.

        -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT): Some patients in HR group may undergo ASCT
           (usually bone marrow, but may be peripheral blood or umbilical cord stem cells), (at the
           time of reinduction therapy) beginning 3-4 weeks after the completion of second protocol
           III (HR-1), the first protocol II (HR-2A), or completion of the 3-block consolidation
           regimen (HR-2B).

             -  Under 2 years old: Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -5,
                etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3
                and -2, and then undergo ASCT on day 0.

             -  At least 2 years old: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days
                -6 to -4 and receive etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -3, and then undergo ASCT on
                day 0. Fractionated local radiotherapy, if required, is administered on days -14 to
                -7.
