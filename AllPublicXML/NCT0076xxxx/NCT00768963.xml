  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ranibizumab
      given via subconjunctival injection in patients undergoing pterygium surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a secondary objective, this study also aims to establish the tissue concentration of
      ranibizumab when delivered via subconjunctival injection in patients undergoing pterygium
      excision and to determine the effects of ranibizumab on conjunctival healing, corneal
      epithelial healing, and wound dehiscence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be eligible if the following criteria are met:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patient related considerations: All patients of both genders will be considered for
             enrollment.

          -  Disease related considerations:

               -  Patients with pterygia will be considered for enrollment if the pterygium meets
                  standard pterygium excision criteria including encroachment into the visual axis

               -  severe induced astigmatism

               -  foreign body sensation unresponsive to medical therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test)

          -  Women seeking to become pregnant

          -  Lactating women

          -  Prior enrollment in the study

          -  Prior glaucoma surgery in the region of the pterygium

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated

          -  Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial
