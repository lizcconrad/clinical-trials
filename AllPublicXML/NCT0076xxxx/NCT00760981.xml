        Inclusion Criteria:A. Subject has cGVHD requiring systemic therapy occurring &gt;100 days
        after hematopoietic cell transplant diagnosed with at least one diagnostic feature from
        Appendix A.

        B. Subject has active cGVHD with either:

          1. Persistent steroid dependence defined as the inability to taper steroid treatment to
             less than 0.25 mg/kg/d prednisone or its equivalent for at least 3 months

          2. Progression of cGVHD signs and symptoms on steroid therapy equivalent to prednisone
             0.5 mg/kg/d for at least 1 month.

        C. Subject has at least one of the following manifestations with which to follow
        progression of disease or response to imatinib:

          1. Skin changes (rash, sclerosis, fasciitis, or ulceration)

          2. Abnormal eye wetness &lt;= 5 mm as measured by Schirmer's test

          3. Oral mucosal changes (erythema, lichenoid changes, ulcers, or mucoceles)

          4. Thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;150,000/uL).

          5. Abnormal liver function testing (alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin &gt;
             ULN).

          6. Bronchiolitis obliterans (diagnosed by a &gt; 5% annual decline in FEV1 with the lowest
             post-transplant FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.8 and an appropriate CT scan or lung biopsy, see Appendix
             A for details)

        D. Subject may have previously any received immunosuppressive therapies for cGVHD.
        Continuing treatment with steroids and any one or none of the following is allowed:
        cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or extracorporeal
        photopheresis.

        E. Subject has been on a fixed dose of steroids or a fixed dose of steroids and one other
        immunosuppressant (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or
        extracorporeal photopheresis) for &gt;= 30 days before starting imatinib.

        F. Subject has a life expectancy &gt;= 6 months.

        G. Subject has the ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent
        document.

        H. Subject has a Karnofsky performance status^3 50% (Appendix B).

        I. Subject is Â³ 18 years of age.

        J. If a female with reproductive potential (defined as having at least 1 menstrual period
        in the past 12 months), the subject must have a negative pregnancy test performed &lt;= 7 days
        before starting study drug.

        K. If a female with reproductive potential, the subject agrees to use contraception for the
        duration of the trial.

        L. Subject has a total bilirubin &lt; 1.5X ULN.

        M. Subject has an aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and
        alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5X ULN.

        N. Subject has an absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500/uL (growth factor supplementation is
        allowed).

        O. Subject has a hematocrit &gt; 26% (transfusion support is allowed).

        P. Subject has a platelet count &gt; 20,000/uL.

        Exclusion Criteria:A. Subject has received another investigational agent &lt;= 30 days before
        starting the study drug.

        B. Subject has an on-going, intercurrent illness such as an infection not responsive to
        antibiotics, antiviral medicines, or antifungal medicines.

        C. Subject has progressive malignant disease.

        D. Subject has a secondary malignancy that has not been effectively treated within the past
        5 years (except localized basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma).

        E. Subject has imatinib intolerance or allergy.

        F. Subject is breast-feeding.

        G. Subject is not willing to comply with treatment or response evaluation.

        H. Subject has received an allogeneic cell product (including DLI or hematopoietic cell
        boost) &lt;= 100 days before starting study drug.

        I. The subject's steroid and/or immunosuppressant dose has changed &lt;= 30 days before
        starting study drug.
