  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in
      comparison to placebo, as an add-on treatment to pioglitazone with or without metformin, over
      a period of 24 weeks of treatment, followed by an extension.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to pioglitazone on
      glycemic control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction (absolute change) at
      Week 24.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to pioglitazone on
      the percentage of patients reaching HbA1c less than 7 percent (%) and less than or equal to
      6.5%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, beta-cell function (assessed by homeostatic
      model assessment of beta-cell function [HOMA-beta]), and on fasting plasma insulin (FPI), to
      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-lixisenatide antibody
      development.

      Patients who complete the 24-week main double-blind treatment would undergo a variable
      double-blind extension treatment, which ends for all patients at approximately the schedule
      date of Week 76 visit (Visit 25) for the last randomized patients.

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change = HbA1c value at Week 24 minus HbA1c value at baseline. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug, on or before Visit 12 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 12 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <description>The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Beta-cell Function Assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment for Beta-cell Function (HOMA-beta) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Beta cell function was assessed by HOMA-beta. HOMA-beta (% of normal beta cells function) = (20 multiplied by fasting plasma insulin [micro unit per milliliter]) divided by (fasting plasma glucose [mmol/L] minus 3.5). Change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 24 value. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to 1 day after the last dose of study drug, on or before Visit 12 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 12 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Requiring Rescue Therapy During Main 24-Week Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Routine fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after week 12) values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication. If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after week 12) were performed. Threshold values - from baseline to Week 8: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;270 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (15.0 mmol/L), from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 24: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8.5%. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <time_frame>First dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose administration, for up to 132 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 150 centers in 13 countries between September 29, 2008 and June 29, 2011. The overall duration of treatment was at least 76 weeks (24 weeks main double-blind treatment; variable double-blind extension treatment).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 906 patients were screened of which 422 (46.6%) were screen failures; main reason for screen failure was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values being out of the defined protocol range (greater than or equal to 7% and less than or equal to 10%). A total of 484 patients were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Beta-cell Function Assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment for Beta-cell Function (HOMA-beta) at Week 24</title>
          <description>Beta cell function was assessed by HOMA-beta. HOMA-beta (% of normal beta cells function) = (20 multiplied by fasting plasma insulin [micro unit per milliliter]) divided by (fasting plasma glucose [mmol/L] minus 3.5). Change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 24 value. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to 1 day after the last dose of study drug, on or before Visit 12 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 12 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

        <description>Routine fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after week 12) values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication.

Threshold values - from baseline to Week 8: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;270 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (15.0 mmol/L), from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 24: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8.5%.
