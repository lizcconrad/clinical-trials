  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to study if the administration of medications to increase the secretion of hormones
      from the intestines can improve glycemic control, reduce insulin use and promote β-cell
      regeneration/expansion in subjects with type 1 diabetes following islet transplantation who
      are back using small doses of insulin because of early graft dysfunction. We believe that the
      results will enable us to understand whether these drugs could be useful in islet transplant
      recipients, particularly if glycemic control deteriorates.

      This is a single centre non-randomized pilot study. Subjects will be recruited from the
      current cohort of islet transplant recipients at the University of Alberta.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether the combination of sitagliptin and
      pantoprazole can restore insulin independence in previously insulin independent islet
      transplant recipients experiencing early graft dysfunction. The study will also evaluate the
      safety of the combination drug therapy.

    <measure>The Primary Endpoint Will be Insulin Independence After 6 Months of Therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin independence was defined as no insulin use for at least one week, HbA1c &lt; 6.0%, fasting plasma glucose &lt; 7.0 mmol/l, fasting or stimulated c-peptide ≥ 0.5 ng/ml. In addition capillary blood glucose levels could not be &gt;7.8 mmol/l (fasting) or &gt; 10 mmol/l (post-prandial) on more than three occasions in the preceding week. Mean daily insulin use was calculated from the three days prior to study visits. Blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed using the iPro device and Carelink software (Medtronic, Mississauga, ON, CA).</description>

    <description>An intravenous Arginine stimulation test (AST) [Ryan:2002cg] was performed at baseline, 6, and 9 months to assess Graft function. The Arginine is a proxy for insulin secretory reserve (Robertson:2004br)(Rickels:2007cg) and correlates with islet mass in the context of islet allo-transplant (Ryan:2002cg), auto-transplant (Teuscher:1998eu) and hemipancreatectomy (Seaquist:1992iv). An increase in Arginine (AIRarg) would have suggested an increase in beta cell mass.</description>

Blood samples were collected in p700 vacutainers (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) containing a Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) protease inhibitor cocktail to measure total and active GLP-1 in duplicate using a commercially available ELISA (kit manufacturer) and expressed as the ratio of active:total GLP-1.</description>

        <description>An intravenous Arginine stimulation test (AST) [Ryan:2002cg] was performed at baseline, 6, and 9 months to assess Graft function. The Arginine is a proxy for insulin secretory reserve (Robertson:2004br)(Rickels:2007cg) and correlates with islet mass in the context of islet allo-transplant (Ryan:2002cg), auto-transplant (Teuscher:1998eu) and hemipancreatectomy (Seaquist:1992iv). An increase in Arginine (AIRarg) would have suggested an increase in beta cell mass.</description>
