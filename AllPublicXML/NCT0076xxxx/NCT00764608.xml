    <textblock>
      Numerous organisms live on and in healthy human skin. This study seeks to survey the
      diversity of this complex ecosystem by collecting samples from approximately 1000 individuals
      in order to determine the type of organisms living on their skin.

      Subjects age 18 and above may be included in the study. It is the goal of the study to survey
      multiple skin locations of humans at multiple time points. The subjects' samples will be
      analyzed using DNA methods in order to identify the types of microbes present on the swabs.
      Other substances such as proteins, RNA, and other metabolites may also be analyzed. DNA or
      other molecular components of the sample will be extracted. Alternately, microbes in the
      sample can be cultured directly. The samples will be explored using molecular analyses. The
      backbone of the analyses will be shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 16S rDNA amplicon
      sequencing. The results of these analyses will be used to identify and describe the
      microbiome of the skin.
