  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder and treatment
      response to pharmacological interventions has been modest for these patients. Chronic
      elevated anxiety and associated psychophysiological parameters including increased heart rate
      and alterations in skin conductance are key symptoms of chronic PTSD. Selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are considered treatment of first choice for these patients,
      however a substantial portion of patients treated with SRIs do not respond sufficiently.
      Therefore, there is a need to establish novel and effective treatment strategies for these
      patients. Recently, duloxetine has received considerable attention since it was shown in
      multiple controlled trials to be an effective treatment for people with major depressive
      disorder (MDD), a condition which is often co-morbid with PTSD. In chronic PTSD, the
      psychophysiological responses at baseline and in response to treatment with duloxetine have
      been inadequately studied and may provide novel insight into antidepressant and anxiolytic
      mechanisms of this compound.

      Primary Aim 1: Evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of duloxetine in patients
      with chronic PTSD.

      Secondary Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of duloxetine on fear conditioned psychophysiological
      responses (including startle eyeblink, skin conductance, and cardiovascular inter-beat
      interval) at baseline and after 8 weeks of naturalistic treatment in chronic PTSD patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with PTSD (age range 18-65 years) as determined by the Structured Clinical
             Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
             Edition, non-patient version (First et al., 1996)

          -  Willingness to participate in a naturalistic treatment study using duloxetine and in
             two fear conditioning tests, one at baseline and one at the end of the 8 weeks
             treatment study. We will include PTSD subjects on medications (possible medications
             include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and neuroleptics) who have no or only
             partial treatment response or PTSD patients who are untreated. Treatment will be
             switched to duloxetine and the previous antidepressant medication will be
             discontinued.

          -  PTSD subjects will have a minimum score of 50 on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale
             (CAPS; Blake et al, 1995).

          -  Participants will be enrolled until the number of 20 subjects who complete the study
             is reached.

          -  All subjects are required to be in a medically stable condition as determined by a
             thorough physical examination, including ECG, blood work and urine analysis.

          -  No vulnerable subjects will be recruited for this study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  comorbid diagnosis of bipolar illness, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders or
             presence of psychotic symptoms

          -  acute or chronic suicidality

          -  acute or chronic unstable medical conditions (including severely impaired hepatic
             function as indicated with abnormal PT and PTT, abnormal CBC, and liver enzymes more
             than 50% above the upper normal range, not well controlled blood pressure)

          -  current diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence

          -  unsuccessful treatment history with duloxetine, known hypersensitivity to duloxetine
             or any of its inactive ingredients

          -  administration of any investigational drug up to 90 days before entry into the study

          -  intake of monoamino oxides inhibitors up to 90 days before entry into the study or
             during the study

          -  subjects with a positive screen for drugs of abuse

          -  no startle or skin conductance response, or excessively high startle response to the
             startle probe (100 dB acoustic stimuli) during the pretest

          -  patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma

          -  Pregnant as indicated by urine pregnancy test or unwillingness to prevent conception
             during the course of the study.
