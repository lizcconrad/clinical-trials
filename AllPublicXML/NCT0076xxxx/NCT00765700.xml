      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of ketoprofen 10%
      cream compared to placebo as a three-times-per-day topical application in improving the
      patient assessment of pain when used to treat mild to moderate acute soft tissue injury of
      the upper and lower extremities over a 7-day period.
