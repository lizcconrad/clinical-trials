      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from healthy participants receiving
      antioxidant nutritional supplements may help doctors identify changes in biomarkers related
      to oxidative stress.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a nutritional supplement capsule containing
      curcumin, green tea extract, Polygonum cuspidatum extract, and soybean extract works in
      healthy participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the effect of a specific combination nutritional capsule containing curcumin,
           green tea extract, Polygonum cuspidatum extract, and soybean extract on a specific
           biomarker of relevance to oxidative stress (NF-κB).

        -  To estimate the mean change in blood lymphocyte NF-κB level before and after 2 weeks of
           consumption of the nutritional agent under study.

      OUTLINE: Participants receive oral curcumin/green tea extract/Polygonum cuspidatum
      extract/soybean extract capsule twice daily for 2 weeks. Participants are asked to keep a
      pill diary to track compliance.

      Blood and urine samples are collected from participants at baseline and after completion of
      study. Lymphocytes and serum from the blood samples are isolated and analyzed for NF-κB
      biomarker levels. Urine samples are also tested for oxidative stress marker levels. Samples
      are analyzed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).

    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The target accrual goal is 15 subjects. It is hoped that of those 15, at least 10 will be intervention compliant, and provide both planned blood samples. NF-kB levels will be measured using a supershift assay, which tests the specificity and level of NF-kB in the sample by measuring the optical density of a scan. With 10 patients, the mean difference in blood lymphocyte NF-kB level could be estimated to within 0.44 standard 7 deviations, with 80% confidence. That is reasonable precision and confidence level for a small pilot study, and should provide sufficiently precise estimates for use in planning a subsequent study.</description>
