    <textblock>
      AEG35156 has shown early evidence of activity in patients with advanced indolent B-cell
      lymphomas in Phase 1 trials and merits further evaluation in this disease. This trial is
      designed to determine the recommended dose of AEG35156 in patients with relapsed or
      refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and indolent B-cell lymphomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apoptotic induction in cancer cells is a sought after therapeutic goal. Most successful
      anticancer agents activate apoptosis pathways in the cancers they treat. Apoptotic pathways
      in cells appear to converge on a single family of enzymes, the caspases, which are proteases
      that dismantle the cell in an orderly, non-inflammatory fashion, resulting in cell death. The
      X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP) is the only known cellular inhibitor of caspases, its
      over expression thereby blocking the principal means of apoptosis. A wide range of evidence
      indicates that cellular overexpression of members of the IAP family is a fundamental means by
      which many cancer cells evade death, even in the presence of strong extrinsic (death
      receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) apoptotic cues. The inhibition of
      cellular XIAP activity, specifically in cancer cells under stress and primed for apoptosis by
      chemotherapeutic agents, is viewed as a powerful means of tipping the balance towards cell
      death. In particular, XIAP has been shown to be overexpressed in lymphoma. AEG35156 is a
      second generation antisense which targets XIAP mRNA to lower XIAP levels and the apoptotic
      threshold of cancer cells, enhancing their sensitivity to intrinsic death and chemotherapy.
      AEG35156 has shown early evidence of activity in patients with advanced indolent B-cell
      lymphomas in Phase 1 trials and merits further evaluation in this disease.
