      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of SCH 900435 (Org 25935, MK-8435) on
      heavy drinking, safety and tolerability of SCH 900435 in participants with alcohol
      dependence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Heavy Drinking Days</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of heavy drinking days was defined as days with ≥5 standard drinks for men and ≥4 standard drinks for women assessed by Alcohol Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) method. The Alcohol TLFB is a drinking assessment method that obtains estimates of daily drinking by means of an interview between investigator and participant. The TLFB assesses recent drinking behavior. On the TLFB, clients retrospectively estimate their daily alcohol consumption in standard drinks over a time period prior to the interview, and thus the measure provides quantitative estimates of alcohol use.
A drink is standardized to an equivalent to 25-30 cL of beer or wine coolers (5% alcohol), 12-15 cL of table wine (11-14% alcohol) and 4-6 cL of hard liquor/spirits (35-40% alcohol).
Percentage was calculated based on number of heavy drinking days divided by total number of days in the given 2-week interval.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Drinks Per Drinking Day</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of drinking was defined as drinks per drinking day (TLFB). Drinking day is a day on which an alcoholic drink is consumed, with 'day' being defined as the period between waking up and going to sleep; the end of a day may have crossed the time point of midnight.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Relapses Into Heavy Drinking</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An alcohol relapse was defined as either a daily alcohol intake of 5 or more drinks for males and 4 or more drinks for females or an overall consumption of 14 drinks or more per week during at least 4 weeks (TLFB).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Lapses Into Any Drinking</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An alcohol lapse was defined as any episode of alcohol consumption not classified as a relapse (TLFB).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Relapse Into Drinking</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to relapse was defined as the time to first relapse into heavy drinking (TLFB). A Hazard Ratio (SCH 900435/Placebo) of &lt;1 means that SCH 900435 has a lower risk of relapsing as compared to Placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Abstinent Days</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of abstinent days is the percentage of study days in which participants remained abstinent during the treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of total abstinence is the percentage of participants who remained abstinent during the entire treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Functioning: Clinical Global Impression (CGI) - Severity of Illness</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI scale is a standardized tool used by investigators to rate the severity of illness, taking into account the participant's clinical condition and the severity of side effects. The CGI scores could range from 1 to 7, with a lower score reflecting a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Functioning: CGI - Therapeutic Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI scale is a standardized tool used by investigators to rate the efficacy of study drug (therapeutic effect), taking into account the participant's clinical condition and the severity of side effects. The CGI scores could range from 1 to 7, with a lower score reflecting a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Craving Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Rating of craving is included to assess a potential relationship between treatment and craving severity. Participants were asked to answer the question: &quot;Over the past week, what has your desire or craving for an alcoholic beverage been at the time of day that you usually drink?&quot; The 100 mm line of the VAS was anchored on the left by &quot;No desire at all&quot; and on the right by &quot;Extreme desire&quot;. Participants marked a spot on the line where they felt their craving severity fit best. Craving VAS scores could range from 0 to 100, with a lower VAS score reflecting a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Motivation VAS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to answer the question: &quot;Over the past week, how motivated were you to stay alcohol abstinent?&quot; The 100 mm line of the VAS was anchored on the left by &quot;No motivation at all&quot; and on the right by &quot;Extremely motivated&quot;. Motivation VAS scores could range from 0 to 100, with a higher score reflecting a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mood VAS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to answer the question: &quot;Over the past week, how did you feel?&quot; The 100 mm line of the VAS was anchored on the left by &quot;Extremely bad&quot; and on the right by &quot;Extremely good&quot;. Mood VAS scores could range from 0 to 100, with a higher VAS score reflecting a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not related to the study drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not related to the study drug.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Heavy Drinking Days</title>
        <description>Percentage of heavy drinking days was defined as days with ≥5 standard drinks for men and ≥4 standard drinks for women assessed by Alcohol Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) method. The Alcohol TLFB is a drinking assessment method that obtains estimates of daily drinking by means of an interview between investigator and participant. The TLFB assesses recent drinking behavior. On the TLFB, clients retrospectively estimate their daily alcohol consumption in standard drinks over a time period prior to the interview, and thus the measure provides quantitative estimates of alcohol use.
A drink is standardized to an equivalent to 25-30 cL of beer or wine coolers (5% alcohol), 12-15 cL of table wine (11-14% alcohol) and 4-6 cL of hard liquor/spirits (35-40% alcohol).
Percentage was calculated based on number of heavy drinking days divided by total number of days in the given 2-week interval.</description>

        <description>Rating of craving is included to assess a potential relationship between treatment and craving severity. Participants were asked to answer the question: “Over the past week, what has your desire or craving for an alcoholic beverage been at the time of day that you usually drink?” The 100 mm line of the VAS was anchored on the left by “No desire at all” and on the right by “Extreme desire”. Participants marked a spot on the line where they felt their craving severity fit best. Craving VAS scores could range from 0 to 100, with a lower VAS score reflecting a better outcome.</description>
