  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of foot drop limits normal gait. Our prior data has suggested that approximately
      30% of MS patients have foot drop. Although we have observed that &quot;task-specific&quot;
      rehabilitation using the Lokomat can improve ambulation in chronic MS patients, subjects with
      &quot;foot drop&quot; have difficulty translating task-specific training to normative gait patterns
      over ground, despite improving speed and endurance.

      One of the key limitations of the Lokomat is a lack of robot-assisted training for the ankle
      joint. The Anklebot, an MIT-developed rehabilitation robot for the ankle, has the potential
      to address this. The device can move throughout three planes and train ankle flexion,
      extension, inversion and eversion; however, therapy with the Anklebot alone does not train
      the knee or hip.

      We plan to test whether subject foot drop and overall gait benefit more from Anklebot therapy
      alone or a combination of Anklebot and Lokomat.

    <description>The Ankle-Bot (Wheeler et al., 2004) is a stand-alone robot assisted device that is worn via a leather boot and knee brace (Fig.1). The Ankle-Bot can assist ankle movement throughout 3 planes. The percentage of force generated by the Ankle-Bot can be adjusted from no help, 0% assistance to 100% assistance. The device is low impedance and a subject can easily over come the forces generated by the Ankle-Bot. The Ankle-Bot will guide and assist the subject into ankle flexion, extension, inversion and eversion.</description>
