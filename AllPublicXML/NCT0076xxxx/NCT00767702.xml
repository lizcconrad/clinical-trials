  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore scientists opinions and practices regarding the use of population
      descriptors (e.g., race, ethnicity, ancestry, geography and nationality) to describe a
      research study population. It will collect genetic researchers opinions, understandings and
      experiences studying human genetics and genetic variation.

      Scientists who are a principal investigator or co-principal investigator n a human genetic or
      genomic study of a common disease with at least preliminary data that uses population
      descriptors may be eligible for the study.

      Participants are asked to think about their study populations and how they are described in
      their research. They participate in two audio-taped semi-structured interviews that last from
      about 90 to 120 minutes. They may also participate in one or both of the following optional
      study components:

        -  A third semi-structured interview that explores implementing a new method of describing
           study populations in data analysis.

        -  2 to 3 days of lab observation, in which a member of the study research team meets the
           lab members, observes daily activities and attends lab meetings.

    <textblock>
      The usefulness of social and political population labels, including those based on race,
      ethnicity, geographic location, ancestry, and nationality, in science and medicine is a topic
      of heated debate. The discussion is significant not only for defining rigorous scientific
      study designs, but for influencing how scientists and the broader society conceptualize,
      discuss, and react to human difference. Misuse of population descriptors in genetic and
      genomic research has the potential to perpetuate misinformation, stigmatize certain groups
      and simplify the complex relationships between individual identity, genetics, and health.
      With such potential harms in mind, National Institutes of Health guidelines to use the Office
      of Management and Budget categories of race and ethnicity to monitor inclusion in clinical
      trials and evaluate potential differences in the safety and efficacy of interventions have
      been questioned. As increasing attention is given to the implications of human genetic
      variation on disease and health, actively engaging with scientists may help to identify a
      lexicon for discussing human genetic variation that is scientifically sound and socially and
      politically meaningful. We aim to conduct a pilot qualitative study of genetic researchers,
      exploring their use of population descriptors in human genetic research, including an
      experiment in which they have the opportunity to describe and group their study populations
      in a new way. We use qualitative methods to capture researchers' opinions and practices as
      they think critically about the use of population labels in their studies. Understanding
      individual scientists opinions about the strengths and weaknesses of different
      classifications in various contexts will provide important data to help define and facilitate
      appropriate use of population descriptors in human genetic research.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The study population is comprised of intramural and extramural principal investigators:

          -  Conducting human genetic or genomic research on common disease

          -  Conducting a project in which they use population descriptors to describe their study
             sample

          -  Have collected, at a minimum, preliminary data that allows them to complete an
             exploratory exercise re-conceptualizing their use of population descriptors in this
             project.

        Participation is limited to researchers who have collected data that gives them sufficient
        background and context to meaningfully complete this exercise. Insight gathered from our
        study population on alternatives to existing methods of population classification and
        description used in human genetic research is especially useful not only because of their
        professional expertise, but because they are the group that would need to implement
        alternatives.
