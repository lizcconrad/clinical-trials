      Study hypothesis:

      The recurrence rate of HCC patients after radical resection is about 60-70%. This study is
      based on the hypothesis that CIK treatment could decrease the recurrence rate by 15% to 20%.

      Abstract:

      This is a randomized controlled study. About 200 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who
      underwent radical resection will be included. The patients will be randomized to group A
      (receive CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly follow up) without any anti-cancer
      treatment after resection of HCC, and the randomize ratio will be 1:1.

      Study treatment:

      Patients in group A will receive 4 cycles of CIK treatments within 3 months after their liver
      resection. Patients in group B will have no anti-cancer therapy. Anti-virus and other
      supportive therapies are available in both groups.
