    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study is a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter

    <textblock>
      The study includes 18 months (547 days) of follow-up after the first vaccination for all
      randomized volunteers who receive at least one vaccination. Analysis of cumulative data
      collected through Day 547 ± 14 days will be reported in the final clinical study report.
