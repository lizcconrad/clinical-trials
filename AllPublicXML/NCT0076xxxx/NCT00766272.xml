  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a degenerative disease that affects more than 400,000 people in the US
      alone. MS is in fact the most common disabling neurological disorder in young adults.
      Symptoms of the disease can include problems with balance, walking, fatigue, weakness and
      vision. Over 85% of people with Multiple Sclerosis have problems walking. This can cause them
      to fall or have a constant fear of falling. To prevent falling, MS patients rely on
      equipment, such as walkers and canes. These costs can cause financial difficulties for MS
      patients and families.

      A significant problem that is only recently being studied is the relationship between falling
      and MS. Recent studies have shown that MS patients fall more often than those without MS, and
      also fall more than the elderly population. The consequent fear of falling is also an
      important problem, as those worried about falling will probably change their daily habits to
      lower their risk. This can mean keeping from certain physical and social activities or even
      staying indoors. Thus, falls and fear of falling can have negative medical, physical,
      psychological, and social consequences for the patient.

      Improving patients' walking may help reduce falls and the fear of falling. Treadmill training
      has been shown to improve walking in patients with MS and to lower their risk of falling. One
      way to train patients on a treadmill is with the use of robots that can help move their limbs
      in a more normal way. This kind of robot-assisted treadmill training may provide even greater
      benefits than treadmill training alone.

      The study is expected to last 6-7.5 months. One group of participants will receive weekly
      telephone calls and will be asked questions on other physical activities, falls, and activity
      limitations the patient had during the week. Participants assigned to robot-assisted
      treadmill training will receive twice weekly training session for 8 weeks, for a total of 16
      sessions. Each session will last about 65 to 90 minutes.

      The goal of this study is to see if robot-assisted treadmill training will reduce falls and
      fear of falling in patients with MS. Robot-assisted treadmill training has been shown to be
      effective in reducing falls and fear of falling in Parkinson's disease patients. This type of
      training has not been tested in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. The proposed study will
      help to address this gap and also provide additional data on other possible improvements due
      to robot-assisted treadmill training including ambulation, social participation, fatigue, and
      balance.

    <description>Body-weight will be supported using a harness, which suspends the subject above a motorized treadmill (Lokomat, Hocoma, Zurich, Switzerland). The system also incorporates a robot-driven gait orthotic, called the Lokomat, which will be secured to the subject's lower extremity and pelvis using adjustable cuffs and pads. The Lokomat uses computer-controlled motors to drive the hips and knees toward more normative kinematic patterns for gait.</description>
