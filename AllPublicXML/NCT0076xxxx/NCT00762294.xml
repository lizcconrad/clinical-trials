    <textblock>
      Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) are effective for secondary prevention of breast cancer and may
      soon replace tamoxifen as first-line therapy in the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast
      cancer. However, because these medications produce a marked reduction in serum estrogen
      levels, this is likely to result in an increased rate of bone loss and risk of developing
      osteoporosis and fractures in postmenopausal women treated with these agents. Indeed,
      substantial bone loss has been reported in several large clinical trials of AIs. Osteoporosis
      drugs are available that could prevent this loss, but they have frequent side effects and are
      expensive. Thus, treating all women receiving AIs might not be the most appropriate and
      cost-effective approach. A better approach might be to select women at highest risk of bone
      loss and only treat them with antiresorptive agents.

      The proposed pilot study will evaluate women who receive anastrozole or letrozole therapy,
      are receiving adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D and have baseline normal or
      moderately low bone mass in order to determine if early changes in bone turnover markers
      correlate with bone loss at one year. If data from this pilot protocol support our
      hypothesis, then we would propose a larger trial to confirm it. The ultimate aim is to
      predict which women are at higher risk of bone loss and therefore treat them earlier with
      bone-sparing agents, while those with lower risk could be monitored on conservative therapy.
