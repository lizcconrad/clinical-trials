      The BRAVISSIMO trial wants to investigate in a controlled setting, the long-term (up to 24
      months) outcome of the self-expanding nitinol Absolute Pro (Abbott Vascular) and the
      balloon-expandable Omnilink Elite (Abbott Vascular) stent in TASC A&amp;B and TASC C&amp;D iliac
      lesions. A separate analysis of both patient populations will be performed and listed.
