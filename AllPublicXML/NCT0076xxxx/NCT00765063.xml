    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this 6 month open-label extension trial is to evaluate long-term
      safety and tolerability of dalteparin in treatment of chronic neuroischaemic foot ulcers in
      diabetic patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and peripheral
      neuropathy.

    <description>Major hemorrhages: defined as fatal bleeding, clinically overt bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin greater than or equal to 20 gram (g)/litre (L) (2 g/ decilitre [dL]), clinically overt bleeding leading to transfusion of greater than or equal to 2 units of whole blood or red cells, or symptomatic bleeding in areas of special concern (intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, intraspinal, pericardial, intramuscular with compartmental syndrome, or intraarticular). Minor hemorrhages: defined as bleeding that did not meet the definition of major bleeding.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically relevant minor (non-major) bleeding was defined as any bleeding compromising hemodynamics, leading to hospitalization, subcutaneous haematoma more than 25 cm^2, intramuscular haematoma, epistaxis lasting for more than 5 minutes, spontaneous gingival bleeding, macroscopic hematuria and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (including at least 1 episode of melaena or hematemesis), rectal blood loss, hemoptysis, and any other bleeding with clinical consequences.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Intact Skin Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>Intact skin healing was defined as 100 percent reduction in ulcer surface area with full epithelialisation. The ulcer area was measured in square millimetre (mm) by measuring the longest width and length of the ulcer after debridement. The area was calculated from an acetate tracing. Ulcers were also documented by standardized photographs. The largest ulcer was considered the study ulcer in participants with multiple ulcers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Improved Ulcer Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>Improved ulcer healing was defined as greater than or equal to 50 percent reduction in ulcer surface area from baseline of the A6301083 study excluding intact skin healing. The ulcer area was measured in square mm by measuring the longest width and length of the ulcer after debridement. Ulcers were also documented by standardized photographs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Underwent Amputation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>A major amputation was defined as above the ankle and was reported as below-the-knee and above-the-knee amputations. A minor amputation was defined as below the ankle amputation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Intact Skin Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>Median time (in months) taken to achieve intact skin healing which was defined as 100 percent reduction in ulcer surface area with full epithelialisation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Amputation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Major Cardiovascular Disease Events (MCVE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>MCVE were defined as death due to vascular cause; non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) excluding procedure related to MI; coronary revascularization procedures not related to MIs; hospitalization for unstable angina or non-fatal stroke.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>11-point Likert Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The 11 point Likert pain scale which used a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) point rating system was used to assess participant's pain score. No distinction was made between neuropathy and inflammatory (nociceptive) pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (EOT) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning).</description>

        <description>Improved ulcer healing was defined as greater than or equal to 50 percent reduction in ulcer surface area from baseline of the A6301083 study excluding intact skin healing. The ulcer area was measured in square mm by measuring the longest width and length of the ulcer after debridement. Ulcers were also documented by standardized photographs.</description>
