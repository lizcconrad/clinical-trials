  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Genetic risk-markers associated with T2DM are thoroughly studied. So far, only a
      few genetic variants, also termed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's), have been
      replicated in several studies and each of them gives only limited explanation for the growing
      incidence of T2DM. The hypothesis of the present study is that determination of combinations
      of genetic variants by SNP-chip technology may improve the prediction of T2DM, complications
      and efficacy of treatment compared to the methods previously used including genome wide
      association (GWA) studies. The SNP-chip/ DNA microarray makes it possible to study several
      SNP's association with T2DM, one by one but also in combination.

      Aims: To study whether specific genetic variants, and combinations of these, 1) are present
      with higher prevalence in patients with T2DM than in the normal population, 2) are associated
      with specific diabetes-related complications and 3) the effect of the anti-diabetic
      treatment.

      Methods: During the next three years 1000 patients with T2DM and 1000 healthy, non-diabetic
      persons will be included in the study, and examined by blood samples, a questionnaire and
      clinical evaluation, all in one visit. Initially, we will perform DNA analyses on blood
      samples from 372 patients included in another clinical study from our department. Description
      of genetics will be done by a DNA-chip with approximately 70 SNP's, which have previously
      been reported to be associated with T2DM.

      Results and conclusions: It is expected that the result of this project can help us
      predicting T2DM, diabetes-related complications and individualizing treatment to the
      individual patient with T2DM.
