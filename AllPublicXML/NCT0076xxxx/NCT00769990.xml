      RATIONALE: Genistein may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating pain
      caused by bone metastases.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of genistein and to see how well
      it works in treating patients undergoing external-beam radiation therapy for pain caused by
      bone metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether genistein is safe when administered in combination with palliative
           external beam radiotherapy in patients with osseous metastases.

        -  To determine the time to pain relief, duration of pain relief, and degree of pain relief
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the incidence of pathologic fractures in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To determine the effect of this regimen on quality of life measures in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy once daily on days 1-10. Patients also receive
      oral genistein once daily on days 1-60.

      Patients complete pain and quality-of-life questionnaires periodically.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days.
