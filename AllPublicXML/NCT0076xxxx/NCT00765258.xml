      To examine, through retrospective and prospective chart review, the difference in pain and
      mobility, pre and post treatment, as assessed by the patient's completion of the VAS pain
      scale and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ).

      CT fluoroscopy guidance during percutaneous sacroplasty is an effective treatment for
      sacro-iliac insufficiency fractures resulting in rapid reduction of pain and improved
      mobility in patients. This can be effectively assessed using the VAS pain scale and RMDQ both
      pre and post procedure.

      The purpose of the study is to report the use of CT fluoroscopy guidance during the
      performance of percutaneous sacroplasty. In addition, clinical results will be reported with
      the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire(RMDQ)pre and post procedure, demonstrating the
      utility of the RMDQ in assessing improvement in patients pain, mobility and ability to
      perform activities of daily living.
