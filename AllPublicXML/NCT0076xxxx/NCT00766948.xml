  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By creating a neurogenebank from Parkinson's disease patients' blood donations we will
      ultimately be able to define genes for Parkinson's disease and other neurological conditions.

          -  Has been diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease by a Scripps Neurologist

          -  Is reliable, cooperative and willing to comply with all protocol-specified procedures

             who is able to do so

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has been previously enrolled in The Parkinson's Disease NeuroGenebank at
             Scripps Clinic Registry

          -  If a blood draw would be contraindicated for any reason

          -  Has a significant chronic medical condition (i.e. CVA, hepatic encephalopathy) which,
             in the investigator's option, may interfere with the patient's optimal participation
             in the study
