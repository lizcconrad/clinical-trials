    <textblock>
      The Immunological system is showing a diurnal rhythmicity. The Mediators that enhances
      inflammation are at highest level during the night. At the same time the endogenous
      production of cortisol is at its lowest. We want to study if there is a better effect of
      treatment with Methylprednisolone for acute MS-attacks if given at nighttime. The effect will
      be measured in relation to neurological deficits and function with Kurtzkes Expanded
      Disability Status Score (EDSS) and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). We want to
      see if the mean improvement in EDSS is greater in the group receiving treatment at night
      opposed to the group that get treatment during the daytime.
