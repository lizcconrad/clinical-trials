  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB/II trial of sorafenib, a new tyrosine kinase inhibition of multiple genes
      that is active against renal cancer, plus vinorelbine, a chemotherapy agent active in breast
      cancer.

      The investigators are combining these 2 drugs in order to determine if the investigators can
      increase the activity of vinorelbine in metastatic breast cancer patients.

      Patients with measurable metastatic breast cancer without previous chemotherapy for
      metastatic disease are eligible for the protocol. They will be treated with 2 different dose
      levels of sorafenib in order to determine the most tolerable dose.

             of normal and/or Creatinine Clearance calculated as &gt;50% lower normal limit, or
             estimated as ≥ 50 ml/min (Appendix C).

          -  Adequate liver function, as indicated by:

               -  bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper normal limit;

               -  AST and ALT ≤ 2 times upper normal limit.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% as measured by either multigated
             acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO).
