      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics following multiple oral doses of 40mg to 200mg VGX 1027 in healthy subjects
      administered for 5 days.

      This study will evaluate:

        -  The safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of VGX 1027 in the range of 40 to
           400mg.

        -  The pharmacokinetics of VGX 1027 in healthy subjects following the first oral dose (Day
           1) and at steady state (Day 5).
