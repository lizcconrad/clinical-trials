  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective (study following participants forward in time) study to
      assess safety and efficacy of infliximab injection under post-marketing use and identify
      problems related to adverse events in participants with ankylosing spondylitis (chronic
      inflammatory condition affecting the axial joints), rheumatoid arthritis (chronic systemic
      disease, primarily of the joints, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes
      and articular structures), psoriasis (scaly skin rash) and psoriatic arthritis (a type of
      inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis). Participants with rheumatoid arthritis
      will receive 6 doses of infliximab 3 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) as an intravenous
      infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) at Week 0, 2, 6 and
      will be observed for 30 weeks; and those with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and psoriatic
      arthritis will also receive 6 doses of injection and will be observed for 24 to 30 weeks.
      Efficacy will be evaluated by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI),
      Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Psoriasis Area and Severity
      Index (PASI), swollen joint counts and tender joint count. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to assess disease activity in participants with ankylosing spondylitis. It consists of 6 items measuring fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, areas of localized tenderness, intensity of morning stiffness and duration of morning stiffness. First 5 items are scored on a 10 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 mm=none to 10 mm=severe; and sixth item is scored on VAS ranging from 0=0 hours to 10=2 or more hours. The total BASDAI score ranges from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe).To give each symptom equal weighting, the average of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score is divided by 5 to give a final BASDAI score. BASDAI total score = 0.2 (Item 1 + Item 2 + Item 3 + Item 4 + Item 5/2 + Item 6/2).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Erythrocytic Sedimentation Rate (ESR) at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>The ESR is a laboratory test that provides a non-specific measure of inflammation. It assesses the rate at which red blood cells fall in a test tube. Normal range is 0-30 mm per hour. A higher rate indicated inflammation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in C-Reactive Protein (CRP) at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>The CRP is acute serum protein released from liver. It is associated with low hemoglobin or erythropoetic resistance. The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. Normal range of CRP is less than 1 milligram per deciliter (mg/dl). A decrease in the level of CRP indicated reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Swollen Joints at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Number of swollen joints was determined by examination of 28 joints and identifying when swelling was present. The number of swollen joints was recorded on the joint assessment form at each visit and scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 2, where 0=no swelling, 1=swelling, but bony landmarks seen and 2=swelling but bone marks not seen.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Tender Joints at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Number of tender joints was determined by examination of 28 joints and identifying when tenderness was present. The number of tender joints was recorded on the joint assessment form at each visit and scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3, where 0=no pain, 1=mild, 2= moderate and 3=severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participants With Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score; range: 0=no disease to 72=maximal disease. Body is divided into 4 sections (head, arms, trunk and legs); each area is scored by itself and scores were combined for final PASI. For each section percent area of skin involved was estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90 - 100%), and severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, thickness, and scaling; scale: 0 (none) to 4 (severe). Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each section * area score * weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Efficacy Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>The level of improvement in symptom before and after the administration of the drug was assessed as per Investigator's discretion and the overall efficacy was assessed based on this result. The level of improvement in disease was assessed in three steps: improved, unchanged and aggravated as per Investigator's discretion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Unexpected Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Unexpected adverse events include those not listed in the approved product information and not described as precautions or warnings.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Drug Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse drug reactions are defined as adverse events for which the Investigator had not described the causal relationship to trial medication as &quot;not related&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) Caused by Drug Misuse, Abuse and Drug Interaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. Drug abuse is defined as the use of the study drug for a non-therapeutic effect, misuse was defined as use of the study medication in a way that was not prescribed and drug interaction was defined as a chemical or physiological reaction that can occur when 2 different drugs are taken together.</description>

It consists of 6 items measuring fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, areas of localized tenderness, intensity of morning stiffness and duration of morning stiffness. First 5 items are scored on a 10 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 mm=none to 10 mm=severe; and sixth item is scored on VAS ranging from 0=0 hours to 10=2 or more hours. The total BASDAI score ranges from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe).To give each symptom equal weighting, the average of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score is divided by 5 to give a final BASDAI score. BASDAI total score = 0.2 (Item 1 + Item 2 + Item 3 + Item 4 + Item 5/2 + Item 6/2).</description>

        <description>The CRP is acute serum protein released from liver. It is associated with low hemoglobin or erythropoetic resistance. The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. Normal range of CRP is less than 1 milligram per deciliter (mg/dl). A decrease in the level of CRP indicated reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement.</description>

        <description>The PASI is combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score; range: 0=no disease to 72=maximal disease. Body is divided into 4 sections (head, arms, trunk and legs); each area is scored by itself and scores were combined for final PASI. For each section percent area of skin involved was estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90 – 100%), and severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, thickness, and scaling; scale: 0 (none) to 4 (severe). Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each section * area score * weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Participants With Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 30</title>
          <description>The PASI is combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score; range: 0=no disease to 72=maximal disease. Body is divided into 4 sections (head, arms, trunk and legs); each area is scored by itself and scores were combined for final PASI. For each section percent area of skin involved was estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90 – 100%), and severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, thickness, and scaling; scale: 0 (none) to 4 (severe). Final PASI=sum of severity parameters for each section * area score * weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4).</description>
          <population>Data was not evaluated as only 1 participant with psoriatic arthritis was enrolled in this surveillance and no PASI evaluation was done for it.</population>
