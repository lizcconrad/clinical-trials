  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disturbances in the amino acid neurotransmitter (AANt), gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)
      function are hypothesized to contribute to the neurobiology of Major Depressive Disorder
      (MDD) and insomnia. The principal objective of this project is to use magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) to provide the first in vivo characterization of cortical GABA levels in
      individuals with primary insomnia, and to determine whether subjects with MDD, achieving a
      partial response with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment but still experiencing
      significant residual symptoms including insomnia, have altered levels of this
      neurotransmitter. The investigators are also exploring the correlation between cortical AANt
      levels and abnormalities in sleep parameters in primary insomnia and as a residual symptom of
      major depression.

      Three groups of subjects (MDD with partial remission and residual insomnia, primary insomnia,
      and healthy) will participate in the study. All subjects will complete a telephone screening,
      and if appropriate a complete face-to-face evaluation, to determine their eligibility for the
      study. All subjects meeting eligibility criteria for the study will complete a baseline MRS
      session to evaluate differences in GABA concentrations between the three groups.

          -  Males or females between the ages of 25 and 55 years

          -  Clinical diagnosis of primary insomnia meeting DSM-IV criteria.

          -  Current insomnia ratings (current Sleep Onset Latency SOL &gt; 30 minutes, Insomnia
             Severity Index (ISI) &gt; 14, total sleep time (TST) &lt; 6.5 hrs/night).
