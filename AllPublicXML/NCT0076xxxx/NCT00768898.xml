      The purpose of this study is to determine the correct volume of lissamine green to use when
      assessing conjunctival staining, and to determine the time course needed to evaluate
      conjunctival staining after lissamine green has been instilled in the eye.

    <measure>Conjunctival Staining at 1 Minute</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute after instillation</time_frame>
    <description>Lissamine green was instilled in each eye. Conjunctival staining was assessed by the investigator in the nasal and temporal sections. The Oxford Scheme was used for each section, with a possible score of 0-5 for each section, where 0=absent and 5=severe. The nasal and temporal scores were summed, for a possible score of 0-10 for each eye. Each subject was represented by a single eye, referred to as the &quot;study eye.&quot; The study eye was defined as the eye that attained the highest stain at any measurement time point during the screening visit.</description>

        <title>Conjunctival Staining at 3 Minutes</title>
        <description>Lissamine green was instilled in each eye. Conjunctival staining was assessed by the investigator in the nasal and temporal sections. The Oxford Scheme was used for each section, with a possible score of 0-5 for each section, where 0=absent and 5=severe. The nasal and temporal scores were summed, for a possible score of 0-10 for each eye. Each subject was represented by a single eye, referred to as the &quot;study eye.&quot; The study eye was defined as the eye that attained the highest stain at any measurement time point during the screening visit.</description>
