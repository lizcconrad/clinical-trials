  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to study whether a certain blood test can reliably identify
      the presence of malaria in people who have been infected with, but who do not have symptoms
      of malaria.

      In this study, two groups of volunteers will be exposed to malaria through the bites of
      infected mosquitoes. In one group, volunteers will be given several doses of a drug called
      mefloquine, known to prevent the development of malaria symptoms. The other group will not be
      treated with any drug that could prevent symptoms or infection. After exposure, both groups
      will be monitored for a period of approximately 6 months to see if they develop symptoms of
      malaria. Any subjects who do so will be treated with appropriate medications. Subjects in
      both groups will have their blood checked regularly during this period for the presence of a
      certain malaria antibody called Merozoite Surface Protein 1, or Anti-MSP-1 for short, using a
      special blood test (also known as an assay). At the completion of the study, the results of
      all assays will be analyzed to determine if this test can be used to diagnose malaria
      infection in persons without symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive) at the
             time of screening

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the participant before screening procedures

          -  Free of clinically significant health problems as established by medical history and
             clinical examination before entering into the study

          -  Available to participate for duration of study (approximately 6 months, not including
             screening period)

          -  If the participant is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, (i.e., either
             surgically sterilized or one year post-menopausal) or, if of childbearing potential,
             she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions (e.g.,
             intrauterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptives; diaphragm or condom in
             combination with contraceptive jelly, cream or foam; Norplant® or Depo-Provera®)
             during this study, have a negative pregnancy test at the time of enrollment, and must
             agree to continue such precautions for at least two months after completion of the
             malaria challenge if part of the control cohort, or for three months after the final
             mefloquine dose is taken if part of the mefloquine cohort.

          -  Prior to entry into this study, participants must score at least 80% correct on a
             short multiple-choice quiz that assesses their understanding of this study. If they do
             not score 80% on the initial quiz, the protocol information will be reviewed with them
             to ensure comprehension and they will have the opportunity to retest (using the same
             test). Participants who fail the Comprehension Assessment for the second time will not
             be enrolled.
