  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study proposal is that pediatric urinary stone formers have genetic
      risk factors which predispose their urinary stone production. 50-60% of pediatric stone
      patients have a positive family history of urinary stone disease. Several genetic mutations
      have been identified which predispose patients to various types of urinary stones. These
      genetic mutations can also lead to other significant sequela besides stones, including
      osteopenia/osteoporosis (bone loss). Furthermore, metabolic abnormalities can be identified
      in more than 50% of pediatric stone formers, some of which can be improved/alleviated with
      medical intervention to help decrease rate of stone formation and the need for
      hospitalization and surgical intervention.

    <description>All Stone Forming Patients and their families will undergo one of three groups of testing:
Testing 1 - This testing form involves using a specimen from the Pediatric Urologic Blood, Tissue, Urine, Serum, and DNA Repository.
Testing 2 - Involves complete in-patient evaluation at UT Southwestern GCRC for patients with hypercalciuria and their families.
Testing 3 - Involves simple out-patient evaluation for patients with hypercalciuria and their family members.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female English-speaking Caucasian patients &gt;4 years of age with a history of
             stone formation before age 20 years, their family members, and sex- and age-matched
             pediatric normal volunteers will be included regardless of current age, gender, race
             or ethnicity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded with voiding dysfunction or metabolic disorders including
             renal tubular acidosis, chronic renal insufficiency, intestinal malabsorption
             (inflammatory bowel disease, history of ileal resection or bladder augmentation, and
             cystic fibrosis), hyperparathyroidism, prolonged immobilization, vitamin D excess,
             hpercalcemia, hypophosphatasia, Bartter's syndrome, high dose steroid therapy,
             prematurity, and chronic lasix use. Any child with a bleeding diathesis or who is
             immunocompromised will be excluded given the increased risks of drawing blood.
             Participants who have been on anti-seizure medication such as Topamax or other
             lithogenic drugs and anti-seizure medication will be excluded. Non-English speaking
             subjects are not eligible to participate in the study, as this study specifically
             focuses on English-speaking Caucasian patients based on the adult study from which
             this study project has been derived.
