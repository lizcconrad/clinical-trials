  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in 160 patients in first line treatment
      and 114 in second line treatment with advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB/IV).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial will address the issues of bevacizumab treatment duration and
      treatment safety as first-line therapy for patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Following
      disease progression or treatment failure, the potential benefit of continued bevacizumab
      therapy will be tested by randomizing patients to two treatment arms, including second-line
      chemotherapy with or without further bevacizumab. It is hypothesized that continuation of
      bevacizumab with pemetrexed as second-line treatment following progression will result in
      improved clinical outcomes for patients with NSCLC.
