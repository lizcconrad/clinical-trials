      RATIONALE: Gathering information about the Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      level, and cancer stage from patients who have undergone radiation therapy for prostate
      cancer may help doctors predict how patients respond to treatment and help plan the best
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the Gleason score, PSA level, and cancer stage in
      predicting outcome in patients who have undergone radiation therapy for localized prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the value of the pre-operative Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level,
           and clinical stage in predicting the risk of failure and death in patients who have
           undergone radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patient medical records are reviewed to collect data about pre-treatment prostate biopsy,
      assigned Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and radionucleotide bone scan.

      Patients complete a Bowel Toxicity questionnaire to assess quality of life related to acute
      and long-term bowel toxicity after radiotherapy.
