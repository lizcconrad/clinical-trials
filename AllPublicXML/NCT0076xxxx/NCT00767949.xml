  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that, in time, destroys the macula, which
      is the central part of the retina that gives sharp central vision. The primary purpose of
      this study is to assess the safety of iSONEP which is a humanized monoclonal antibody against
      a bioactive lipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S1P modulates the AMD-associated processes of angiogenesis, inflammation and fibrosis. A
      potential strategy for treating choroidal neovascularization associated with AMD is to reduce
      the biologically available extracellular levels of S1P. iSONEP is highly selective for S1P
      and binds with picomolar affinity. Lpath proposes that iSONEP would deprive many cell types
      (fibroblasts, pericytes, vascular endothelial cells and inflammatory) of important growth and
      survival factors thus targeting the multiple maladaptive processes of exudative AMD that
      ultimately result in the loss of photoreceptors, their supporting cells, and visual acuity.
      Targeting simultaneously multiple components of the choroidal neovascular response is a novel
      approach and has the potential to be more potent than &quot;single-targeted&quot; therapeutics such as
      anti-VEGF therapies.
