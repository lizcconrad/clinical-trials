  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the clinical benefit of tramadol/acetaminophen
      versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (diclofenac 50 milligram [mg]) in the
      treatment of pain in participants with ankylosing spondylitis (inflammation of the spine
      causing pain and stiffness) receiving stable treatment of disease modifying anti-rheumatic
      drugs (DMARDs).

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open labeled (all people know the identity of intervention),
      randomized (study drug assigned by chance), parallel group (a medical research study
      comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different
      interventions (treatments) trial to compare the effectiveness (pain relief) and safety of
      tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg with diclofenac in participants with ankylosing
      spondylitis receiving stable treatment of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
      Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment
      groups (tramadol/acetaminophen and Diclofenac). One group will be treated with tramadol 37.5
      mg/acetaminophen 325 mg combination tablet and another group will be treated with diclofenac
      50 mg tablet. Participants randomized into this study will be instructed to take one tablet
      Ultracet or diclofenac 50 mg orally, twice a day for 8 weeks. Evaluations will be performed
      as outlined: at Screening, at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8. The primary efficacy
      parameter is to compare the mean change from Baseline in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain
      score between the two treatment groups (tramadol/acetaminophen versus diclofenac).
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) Total and Sub-scale Scores at Week 2, 4, 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The BASFI is a self-assessment instrument used to assess function. It comprises of 8 specific questions regarding function in ankylosing spondylitis and 2 questions to identify participant's ability to cope up with everyday life. Each question is answered on a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. The mean of VAS score gives BASFI score between 0 to 100 where 0=easy to 100=impossible.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Total and Sub-scale Scores at Week 2, 4, 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI comprises of 6 questions pertaining to 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis: a) fatigue; b) spinal pain; c) peripheral arthritis; d) enthesopathy; and e) morning stiffness. It is used to measure disease activity. It consists of VAS ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 = no problem and 100 = worst problem. To give each symptom equal weightage, the mean (average) of two scores relating to morning stiffness is taken. The resulting 0 to 500 is divided by 5 to get BASDAI score between 0 to 100 (0 = no problem and 100 = worst problem).</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
