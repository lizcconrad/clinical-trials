      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving more than
      one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy given together with cetuximab
      works in treating patients undergoing surgery to remove peritoneal carcinomatosis from
      colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy and cetuximab, in terms of
           progression-free survival at 3 years, in patients with completely resected peritoneal
           carcinomatosis of colorectal origin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the therapeutic strategy among patients who are or are not fit to receive
           chemotherapy.

        -  Determine progression-free survival at 5 years and overall survival at 3 and 5 years in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the overall tolerability (mortality, morbidity) of this regimen, including
           surgery, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo complete resection of the peritoneal carcinomatosis. Beginning 4-8 weeks
      after surgery, patients receive cetuximab IV over 2.5 hours. Patients also receive FOLFOX
      chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and
      fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12
      courses.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.
