  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to find out what effects (good and bad) that a combination of
      treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery has on you and your pancreatic
      cancer. The chemotherapy drugs to be used: Gemcitabine, Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin, 5-FU and
      alpha-interferon. The goal is to decrease the size of the tumor, so that removal by surgery
      can be performed. Current treatments for this stage of pancreas cancer offer less than ideal
      results, with little opportunity for treatment with curative intent.

    <textblock>
      Subjects must have biopsy proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas which is bidimensionally
      measurable on CT. Cancer must be considered locally advanced (not able to be treated
      surgically). Subjects must not have received prior treatment for pancreatic cancer. Subjects
      must not have received prior radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis (for any reason).
      Subjects cannot be receiving immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. prednisone, methotrexate).
      Eligible subjects will receive initial chemotherapy regimen to include eight cycles of
      Gemcitabine and Docetaxel. All subjects will be re-evaluated for surgery - if tumor has
      shrunk enough, subject will undergo surgery, followed by additional chemotherapy of
      Oxaliplatin, 5FU and Alpha-interferon and radiation therapy; once subject has recovered from
      side effects of the chemo/radiation therapy, they will receive a final chemotherapy regimen
      of four cycles of Gemcitabine and docetaxel. Subjects who are not surgical candidates after
      eight cycles of chemotherapy will undergo an additional four cycles of Gemcitabine and
      docetaxel followed by reassessment for surgery. If they are a surgical candidate, they will
      undergo surgery followed by chemo/radiation therapy regimen. If they are not a surgical
      candidate, they will undergo the chemo/radiation therapy regimen.

      Subjects may be removed from the study treatment for the following reasons:

        -  The investigator feels the subject is not benefitting from treatment

        -  The subject chooses to discontinue for any reason

        -  The subject experiences side effects which are considered to be unacceptable

        -  The subject has an increase in the size of their tumor
