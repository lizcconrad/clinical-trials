  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a factorial design randomized controlled trial to (1)compare
      multi-faceted decision support (intervention) to streamlined clinical alerts (control) and
      (2) evaluate whether collecting information about women's risk of pregnancy using a networked
      tablet computer (intervention) is superior to the way clinicians usually collect this
      information (control).

      Over the course of 1 year, we will abstract data from the electronic medical record when
      study clinicians prescribe teratogenic medications, conduct phone interviews with women
      prescribed medications by participating clinicians, and survey participating clinicians about
      their satisfaction with the decision support they receive. We will use this data to confirm
      our hypotheses that clinicians in the intervention groups will (1) prescribe fewer
      teratogenic medications, (2) be more likely to prescribe contraception when a teratogenic
      medication is prescribed, (3) have more patients report satisfaction with the counseling they
      received, and (4) report more satisfaction with the decision support they received.
