  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The major risk
      factor for liver cancer is hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The purpose of the study is to
      sequence the HBV genome in patients with chronic HBV infection, and in patients with liver
      cancer resulting from chronic HBV infection. The goal is to identify mutations in the HBV
      genome that predisposes these high risk individuals to the development of liver cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:1. Patients diagnosed with liver cancer based on biopsy or serum AFP
        level, associated with characteristic hypervascular liver tumors on triphasic spiral CT
        scan or MRI.

        2. Patients with non-cancer liver conditions such as cirrhosis, adenoma, cholangioma, or
        nodular hyperplasia.

        3. Patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infections not associated with liver
        cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:No other patients except those listed above will be recruited.
        Additionally, patients will be excluded if, upon looking through their medical records,
        information required for data analysis are missing.
