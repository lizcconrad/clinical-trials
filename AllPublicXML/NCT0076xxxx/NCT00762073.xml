  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, dose-ranging study in subjects with
      eosinophilic esophagitis, 2-18 years of age. Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of
      four treatment groups. The Treatment Period will be 12 weeks during which subjects will visit
      the clinic at study weeks 0 (Baseline Visit), 2, 4, 8 and 12 (Final Treatment Evaluation) for
      clinical symptom assessment and safety evaluation (including adverse events and vital signs).
      All study treatments (active drug and placebo) will be administered orally twice daily during
      the Treatment Period, once in the morning after breakfast and once in the evening at bedtime.

    <measure>Percent of Participants Who Responded to Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined as a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) clinical symptom score (CSS) and a reduction in peak eosinophil count to ≤6/high power field (light microscopy) from esophageal biopsies collected at the final evaluation. The EoE CSS, scored from 0 to 18 by a doctor, assessed 6 categories: 1) heartburn, 2) abdominal pain, 3) nocturnal awakening with symptoms, 4) nausea, regurgitation, or vomiting, 5) anorexia or early satiety, and 6) dysphagia, odynophagia, or food impaction (a severe symptom). Each domain was scored as follows, based on symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the assessment:
0 = No symptoms and no coping behaviors required; 1 = Mild: Symptoms limited to 1-3 days or no symptoms because coping behaviors were required to avoid symptoms; 2 = Moderate: Symptoms on &gt;3 days, with or without minor coping behaviors; 3 = Severe: Symptoms interfered with activities of daily living or symptoms persisted and required major coping behaviors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Histologic Response</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Histologic response was defined as a maximum peak eosinophil count at the final treatment evaluation of ≤6 eosinophils/high power field (light microscopy). The maximum peak was identified by examining the peak eosinophil counts obtained from the proximal, mid, and distal esophageal biopsies and selecting the maximum value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Histologic Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Histologic remission was defined as a maximum peak eosinophil count at the final treatment evaluation of ≤1 eosinophils/high power field (light microscopy). The maximum peak was identified by examining the peak eosinophil counts obtained from the proximal, mid, and distal esophageal biopsies and selecting the maximum value.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum peak number of eosinophils at baseline and at the final treatment evaluation was identified by examining the peak eosinophil counts obtained from the proximal, mid, and distal esophageal biopsies and selecting the maximum value. A negative change from baseline indicates that eosinophil count has decreased.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Endoscopy Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Esophageal endoscopy was used to assess the level of inflammation and eosinophilia. Four categories of endoscopic findings were evaluated and scored for this study: (1) pallor and diminished vascular markings; (2) furrowing with thickened mucosa; (3) presence of white mucosal plaques; and (4) concentric rings or strictures. For each category, 0 points were allocated if no esophageal sites were involved, 1 point if 1 or 2 esophageal sites were involved, and 2 points for pan-esophageal involvement (see Aceves et al., 2007). The maximum possible endoscopy score was 8 points. A negative change from baseline indicates that esophageal inflammation decreased.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment Score of Disease Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Physician investigators were asked to complete a visual analog scale (VAS) to provide a global assessment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) activity in each participant. The VAS was a 100-mm horizontal line on which the right extreme (100) was labeled &quot;worst possible disease activity&quot; and the left (0) was labeled &quot;no disease activity.&quot; Investigators were instructed to consider the line for the VAS as a continuum with their own opinion of extremes on either end. Investigators drew a vertical line at a point that best approximated the participant's current level of EoE disease activity. The investigator was to take into consideration how esophageal disease was impacting the participant's daily activities. The following instruction was given to the investigators: &quot;Using the visual analog scale below, please mark a vertical line on the scale to indicate your assessment of EoE activity in this participant at this time.&quot; A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Budesonide</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, 4, or 8, or at the Final Treatment Evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>On the day that pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples were obtained, each participant delayed the morning dose of study medication until instructed to dose in the clinic. The sampling timepoints included pre-dose (0), and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the analytical method was approximately 20 pg/mL in plasma using 0.2 mL of the sample. Because the PK analyses for the medium and high dose oral budesonide suspension (OBS) groups were based on plasma samples collected following administration of identical single doses of OBS, the data for the medium-dose group (OBS once-daily) and high-dose group (OBS twice-daily) were summarized together.</description>

        <title>Percent of Participants Who Responded to Therapy</title>
        <description>Response was defined as a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) clinical symptom score (CSS) and a reduction in peak eosinophil count to ≤6/high power field (light microscopy) from esophageal biopsies collected at the final evaluation. The EoE CSS, scored from 0 to 18 by a doctor, assessed 6 categories: 1) heartburn, 2) abdominal pain, 3) nocturnal awakening with symptoms, 4) nausea, regurgitation, or vomiting, 5) anorexia or early satiety, and 6) dysphagia, odynophagia, or food impaction (a severe symptom). Each domain was scored as follows, based on symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the assessment:
0 = No symptoms and no coping behaviors required; 1 = Mild: Symptoms limited to 1-3 days or no symptoms because coping behaviors were required to avoid symptoms; 2 = Moderate: Symptoms on &gt;3 days, with or without minor coping behaviors; 3 = Severe: Symptoms interfered with activities of daily living or symptoms persisted and required major coping behaviors.</description>

The EoE CSS, scored from 0 to 18 by a doctor, assessed 6 categories: 1) heartburn, 2) abdominal pain, 3) nocturnal awakening with symptoms, 4) nausea, regurgitation, or vomiting, 5) anorexia or early satiety, and 6) dysphagia, odynophagia, or food impaction (a severe symptom). Each domain was scored as follows, based on symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the assessment:
0 = No symptoms and no coping behaviors required; 1 = Mild: Symptoms limited to 1-3 days or no symptoms because coping behaviors were required to avoid symptoms; 2 = Moderate: Symptoms on &gt;3 days, with or without minor coping behaviors; 3 = Severe: Symptoms interfered with activities of daily living or symptoms persisted and required major coping behaviors.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Endoscopy Score</title>
        <description>Esophageal endoscopy was used to assess the level of inflammation and eosinophilia. Four categories of endoscopic findings were evaluated and scored for this study: (1) pallor and diminished vascular markings; (2) furrowing with thickened mucosa; (3) presence of white mucosal plaques; and (4) concentric rings or strictures. For each category, 0 points were allocated if no esophageal sites were involved, 1 point if 1 or 2 esophageal sites were involved, and 2 points for pan-esophageal involvement (see Aceves et al., 2007). The maximum possible endoscopy score was 8 points. A negative change from baseline indicates that esophageal inflammation decreased.</description>

        <description>Response was defined as a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) clinical symptom score (CSS). The EoE CSS, scored from 0 to 18 by a doctor, assessed 6 categories: 1) heartburn, 2) abdominal pain, 3) nocturnal awakening with symptoms, 4) nausea, regurgitation, or vomiting, 5) anorexia or early satiety, and 6) dysphagia, odynophagia, or food impaction (a severe symptom). Each domain was scored as follows, based on symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the assessment:
0 = No symptoms and no coping behaviors required; 1 = Mild: Symptoms limited to 1-3 days or no symptoms because coping behaviors were required to avoid symptoms; 2 = Moderate: Symptoms on &gt;3 days, with or without minor coping behaviors; 3 = Severe: Symptoms interfered with activities of daily living or symptoms persisted and required major coping behaviors.</description>

        <description>The EoE CSS, scored from 0 to 18 by a doctor, assessed 6 categories: 1) heartburn, 2) abdominal pain, 3) nocturnal awakening with symptoms, 4) nausea, regurgitation, or vomiting, 5) anorexia or early satiety, and 6) dysphagia, odynophagia, or food impaction (a severe symptom). Each domain was scored as follows, based on symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the assessment:
0 = No symptoms and no coping behaviors required; 1= Mild: Symptoms limited to 1-3 days or no symptoms because coping behaviors were required to avoid symptoms; 2= Moderate: Symptoms on &gt;3 days, with or without minor coping behaviors; 3= Severe: Symptoms interfered with activities of daily living or symptoms persisted and required major coping behaviors.
A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment Score of Disease Severity</title>
        <description>Physician investigators were asked to complete a visual analog scale (VAS) to provide a global assessment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) activity in each participant. The VAS was a 100-mm horizontal line on which the right extreme (100) was labeled “worst possible disease activity” and the left (0) was labeled “no disease activity.” Investigators were instructed to consider the line for the VAS as a continuum with their own opinion of extremes on either end. Investigators drew a vertical line at a point that best approximated the participant's current level of EoE disease activity. The investigator was to take into consideration how esophageal disease was impacting the participant’s daily activities. The following instruction was given to the investigators: &quot;Using the visual analog scale below, please mark a vertical line on the scale to indicate your assessment of EoE activity in this participant at this time.&quot; A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

        <description>On the day that pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples were obtained, each participant delayed the morning dose of study medication until instructed to dose in the clinic. The sampling timepoints included pre-dose (0), and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the analytical method was approximately 20 pg/mL in plasma using 0.2 mL of the sample. Because the PK analyses for the medium and high dose oral budesonide suspension (OBS) groups were based on plasma samples collected following administration of identical single doses of OBS, the data for the medium-dose group (OBS once-daily) and high-dose group (OBS twice-daily) were summarized together.
