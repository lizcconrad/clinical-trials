  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is widely used for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Side-effects are few and
      mainly from the gastrointestinal tract. Since metformin is cleared from the blood exclusively
      via the kidneys reduced renal function is a relative contraindication. We have earlier
      demonstrated that metformin safely can be used to a lower GFR level of 30 ml/min/1.73. Below
      that level the risk of lactacidosis, a severe complication, increases.

      In the present study we plan to analyse serum levels of metformin repeatedly in patients with
      moderate renal failure (CKD = GFR of 30-60 ml/min/1.73). Blood samples will be taken as
      trough values in the morning, week 0, 2, 4, and 8 and at four weeks a blood sample will be
      taken two hours after intake of the morning dose of metformin. Renal function will be
      estimated with creatinine and cystatin C at each occasion. The intraindividual variation of
      metformin will be calculated.

      The study rests on a new method for measuring metformin. The technique uses Liquid
      Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectometry (LCMSMS). Proteins are removed from serum by adding
      acetonitrile to the sample. After centrifugation a diluted portion of the supernatant is
      injected into the LCMSMS-system. The total runtime for a sample is 6 minutes.

      The study will show if variation in serum levels of metformin measured in the same patient is
      high or low and thus give us better understanding whether a change i serum level is due to
      biological variation or to increased retention caused by progressive renal failure.
