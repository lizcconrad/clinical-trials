  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-third of the US population, almost 80 million adults, have cardiovascular disease and
      mortality associated with heart disease which still remains a leading cause of death around
      the world. The major risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with atherosclerosis
      is dyslipidemia, characterized by high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or low
      levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL).

      HDL has a well established role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease protection. HDL
      mediates the removal of cholesterol from the atherosclerotic plaques for elimination from the
      body. The major component of HDL consists of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA I). Recent intervention
      studies with synthetic HDL particles and recombinant ApoA-I have shown that HDL has the
      capacity to reverse coronary atherosclerosis.

      RVX000222 is a member of a novel class of small molecules that are candidates for the
      treatment of dyslipidemia by increasing plasma levels of ApoA-I and HDL.

               4. If female, non-pregnant (as determined by a negative serum pregnancy test at
                  Screening), non-lactating, and not of childbearing-potential or willing to
                  practice an acceptable form of birth control. If male, be willing to practice an
                  acceptable form of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will not be enrolled:

               1. Have presently, or have a history of, clinically significant disease, including
