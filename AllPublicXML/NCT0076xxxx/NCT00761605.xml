  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone
      extended-release (mechanism to dissolve a drug over time in order to be released slower and
      steadier into the blood stream) in improving or maintaining the subjective symptoms of the
      participants in three participants' groups (that is, by the reason to switch: lack of
      efficacy group, lack of tolerability group, and lack of compliance group) who switched from
      other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone extended-release tablets at flexible
      doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study
      following participants forward in time), single arm, and non-comparative study of
      paliperidone Extended-release (ER) in participants switching from the previous oral
      antipsychotic to flexibly dosed paliperidone ER. The total study duration will be
      approximately of 24 weeks per participant. The study consists of 2 parts: Screening (that is,
      14 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (24 weeks). Efficacy will primarily be
      evaluated by change from baseline in symptom checklist 90-R (SCL90-R) at Week 24.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL90-R) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SCL90-R (Derogatis, 1992) measures 9 domains, including somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism, which provides a global index of distress, the Global Severity Index (GSI). SCL-90-R includes 90 items rated on 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scale score range from 0 to 360. Higher scores indicate worsening of disease. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale assesses the degree of dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SWN-20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self-control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sleep Quality Based on Visual Analog Scale at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality was assessed by an 11-point visual analog scale. Participants indicated on the 11-point visual analog scale (score ranging from 0 to 100 millimeter) how well they have slept in the previous 7 days, from 0 (very badly) to 100 (very well); and how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days, from 0 (not at all) to 100 (all the time). Scores were averaged for the previous 7 days. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Daytime Drowsiness was assessed by an 11-point visual analog scale. Participants indicated on the 11-point visual analog scale (score ranging from 0 to 100 millimeter) how well they have slept in the previous 7 days, from 0 (very badly) to 100 (very well); and how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days, from 0 (not at all) to 100 (all the time). Scores were averaged for the previous 7 days. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Krawiecka Scale Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Psychopathology of participants was assessed by Krawiecka scale. Psychopathology of participants was assessed by Krawiecka scale, score ranges from 0 to 16. Higher score indicates worsening of disease. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL90-R) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SCL90-R (Derogatis, 1992) measures 9 domains, including somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism, which provides a global index of distress, the Global Severity Index (GSI). SCL-90-R includes 90 items rated on 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scale score range from 0 to 360. Higher scores indicate worsening of disease. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The PSP scale assesses the degree of dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SWN-20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self-control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daytime Drowsiness Based on Visual Analog Scale at Week 24</title>
        <description>Daytime Drowsiness was assessed by an 11-point visual analog scale. Participants indicated on the 11-point visual analog scale (score ranging from 0 to 100 millimeter) how well they have slept in the previous 7 days, from 0 (very badly) to 100 (very well); and how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days, from 0 (not at all) to 100 (all the time). Scores were averaged for the previous 7 days. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>
