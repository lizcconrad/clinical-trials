      Rationale:

      In light of the demonstrated activity of anti-angiogenesis agents in rGBM, it is reasonable
      to postulate that adding these agents to standard RT and chemotherapy in the up-front
      management of newly diagnosed GBM may improve the clinical benefit. This study will examine
      the safety and tolerability of adding CT-322 to the standard radiation therapy/temozolomide
      (RT/TMZ) backbone of treatment for newly diagnosed GBM
