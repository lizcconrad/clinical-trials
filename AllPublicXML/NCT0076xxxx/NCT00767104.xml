  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand how this study pillowcase works
      when people use it to treat acne. Most people, including people with acne, sleep six to eight
      hours each night in direct contact with bedding fabrics that provide no benefit to the
      healing process associated with acne. The fabric in this study pillowcase may be able to
      reduce bacteria on the skin. This study would evaluate how acne is affected by this silk-like
      pillowcase. This type of study has not been done before.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of subjects with mild to moderate/severe facial acne vulgaris with an
      assessment of 2-4 on the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale . We will enroll 40-60
      subjects in order to obtain 40 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects will be defined as
      those that complete the protocol, or those that fail to complete due to an adverse event
      related to the study. One-half of subjects will be assigned to sleep on the study product,
      which is a standard size pillowcase made of a silk-like fabric. The other half will be
      assigned to sleep on the placebo pillowcase made of 100% cotton. Each subject will be
      instructed to sleep on this pillowcase every night for 12 weeks. Investigators will be
      blinded to the type of pillowcase used by the study subject. The distribution of placebo and
      study product pillowcases will be randomized 1:1. The study period will last for 12 weeks.
      Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, weeks 2, 6 and 12.

    <description>Silk- Like pillowcase-One-half of subjects will be assigned to sleep on the study product, which is a standard size pillowcase made of a silk-like fabric every night for 12 weeks. The study pillowcases are fabricated from a light-weight plain-weave fabric woven of 100 percent synthetic yarns. The fabric is comprised of approximately 50% polyester and 50% nylon. The yarns in the fabric are formed from continuous-filament fibers, with no fibers projecting beyond the planar surface of the fabric. The antimicrobial technology used in the fabric is incorporated into the fibers during the finishing process and does not migrate out of the fabric or cause adverse reactions with skin contact.</description>

            <description>The study pillowcases are fabricated from a light-weight plain-weave fabric woven of 100 percent synthetic yarns. The fabric is comprised of approximately 50% polyester and 50% nylon. The yarns in the fabric are formed from continuous-filament fibers, with no fibers projecting beyond the planar surface of the fabric. The antimicrobial technology used in the fabric is incorporated into the fibers during the finishing process and does not migrate out of the fabric or cause adverse reactions with skin contact.</description>
