    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of paliperidone extended-release (ER)
      in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional
      instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal
      into the self).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric
      (conducted in more than one center), prospective (study following participants forward in
      time), single arm, and non-comparative study of paliperidone Extended Release(ER) in
      participants with schizophrenia. The total study duration will be approximately of 104 weeks
      per participant. The study consists of following parts: Screening (that is, 14 days before
      study commences on Day 1); acute Treatment phase (single-oral dose of paliperidone for 12
      weeks, dose ranging from 3 to 12 milligram); Extension phase 1 (12 weeks) and Maintenance
      treatment which will be followed by additional Extension phase 2 and long-term maintenance
      treatment. Efficacy of the participants will primarily be evaluated by Clinical Global
      Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Assessed as Very Much Improved or Much Improved Based on Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale - Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale Score - Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale assesses the degree of dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

    <measure>Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) Score - Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant).</description>

    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

        <title>Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) Score - Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population</title>
        <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant).</description>
