    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the side effects of desloratadine syrup and how
      effective it is in relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis or hives in Filipino children. The
      participants will take desloratadine syrup for 14 days. At the end of treatment, side effects
      will be recorded, as well as how the participants tolerate the medication. Effectiveness will
      also be rated at the end of treatment.

    <measure>Number of Adverse Events Reported By Category After 14 Days of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was assessed by determining the incidence of all Adverse Events (AE) which occurred between Baseline Visit (Day 1) &amp; Final Visit (Day 15) &amp; were recorded in Case Report Forms. Total number of AEs reported were presented in several categories. Classification, causality &amp; intensity for AEs were determined by investigator after obtaining sufficient information. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was any adverse drug experience that resulted in: death; life-threatening condition; inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity.</description>

    <description>Safety was assessed by determining the incidence of all AEs which occurred between Baseline Visit (Day 1) &amp; Final Visit (Day 15) &amp; were recorded in Case Report Forms. Number of participants experiencing AEs were presented in several categories. Some AEs lead to discontinuation (d/c). Classification, causality &amp; intensity for AEs were determined by investigator. A SAE was any adverse drug experience that resulted in any of the following: death; life-threatening condition; inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity.</description>

        <title>Safety of Desloratadine Syrup Reported by Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events After 14 Days of Treatment</title>
        <description>Safety was assessed by determining the incidence of all AEs which occurred between Baseline Visit (Day 1) &amp; Final Visit (Day 15) &amp; were recorded in Case Report Forms. Number of participants experiencing AEs were presented in several categories. Some AEs lead to discontinuation (d/c). Classification, causality &amp; intensity for AEs were determined by investigator. A SAE was any adverse drug experience that resulted in any of the following: death; life-threatening condition; inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity.</description>
