  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is assessing the efficacy and safety of AVE5530 (25 mg and 50 mg) in add-on
      to ongoing treatment with high doses of statin in a double-blind manner in comparison with
      placebo, in the management of patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia considered as
      inadequately controlled despite their ongoing statin treatment.

      The main objective is to evaluate the effects of the association AVE5530+statin on LDL-C
      level reduction after 12 weeks of treatment. The effects of AVE5530 on other lipid parameters
      will be assessed as secondary objectives.

      The two doses of AVE5530 tested in this study are 25 mg and 50 mg taken in the evening, with
      dinner dosing. The study will include a pre-randomization phase up to 6 weeks, a double-blind
      treatment period of at least 12 months and can be variably extended up to approximately 18
      months.
