    <textblock>
      The purpose of this is study to evaluate improvement of sleep disorder caused by cancer pain
      after the administration of Hydromorphone Oral Osmotic System (OROS) in Korean participants
      with cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center
      (conducted in more than 1 center), prospective (study following participants forward in time)
      dose-ascending study to evaluate the clinical usefulness of hydromorphone OROS in improvement
      of sleep disturbance caused by cancer pain.Total duration of study will be 3 weeks. The study
      consists of 3 phases: Screening phase (up to 1 week), Treatment phase (2 weeks), and
      Extension phase (12 weeks). The study will include 6 visits: Day -7, Day 1, Day 15, Day 43,
      Day 71, and Day 99. During screening phase, potential participants will receive strong oral
      (long acting) opioid analgesic (for 7 days) until Day 1 and the participants will be
      evaluated for participation in clinical study on Day 1. During treatment phase, participants
      will receive hydromorphone OROS (8 milligram [mg] to greater than or equal to 32 mg), once
      daily for 2 weeks, and the dose will be adjusted every 2 days from Day 3 at the
      Investigator's discretion and according to the strong oral (long acting) opioid analgesic
      administered from screening phase to Day 1 (the initial dose of the study drug will be
      determined by converting the dose of the previously administered analgesic to that of the
      daily dose of oral morphine with the equivalent analgesic effect to the study drug [dose with
      equivalent analgesic effect; Hydromorphone OROS dose: oral morphine dose =1:5]). Participants
      who completed treatment phase and suffer from continuing cancer pain will be enrolled to
      extension phase and study drug will be administered as per Investigator discretion for 99
      days. Participants primarily will be evaluated for improvement in sleep disturbance measured
      by Korean Brief Pain Inventory (KBPI). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <description>K-BPI is a questionnaire designed to measure the degree of pain severity and the impact of pain in performing daily routines. K-BPI comprises of 9 items out of which 6 items were assessed. Score of each item ranges from 0 to 10, where 0=no pain/impact and 10=severe pain/impact. The 6 items that were assessed are: a) level of pain worst in last 24 hours; b) level of pain weakest in last 24 hours; c) level of pain average in last 24 hours; d) level of pain right now; e) how much pain reduced with the therapy taken; sixth item was further classified into 7 categories: i) general activities ii) mood iii) ambulatory ability iv) routine works v) interpersonal relation vi) sleep vii) life enjoyment.</description>

    <description>Participant's pain intensity was measured using NRS ranging from 0=no pain to 10=unimaginable extreme pain. Participants maintained pain diary for 3 days before Baseline until Day 15 and pain intensity was measured twice daily (morning and afternoon). Here average pain intensity is reported. Average pain intensity was calculated as mean of morning pain intensity and evening pain intensity for each baseline and Day 15.</description>

        <description>K-BPI is a questionnaire designed to measure the degree of pain severity and the impact of pain in performing daily routines. K-BPI comprises of 9 items out of which 6 items were assessed. Score of each item ranges from 0 to 10, where 0=no pain/impact and 10=severe pain/impact. The 6 items that were assessed are: a) level of pain worst in last 24 hours; b) level of pain weakest in last 24 hours; c) level of pain average in last 24 hours; d) level of pain right now; e) how much pain reduced with the therapy taken; sixth item was further classified into 7 categories: i) general activities ii) mood iii) ambulatory ability iv) routine works v) interpersonal relation vi) sleep vii) life enjoyment.</description>
