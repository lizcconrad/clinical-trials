    <textblock>
      The Disease Activity Score (DAS) is a system of measurement developed in the 1980s that uses
      certain criteria, including joint counts and patient perceived disease activity, to measure
      disease activity in people with Rheumatoid Arthritis . More recently, the European League
      against Rheumatism (EULAR) has developed a new system of measurement known as the Rheumatoid
      Arthritis Impact of Disease score, or EULAR-RAID score. The EULAR-RAID score is a composite
      score based on patient reported outcomes, and includes such criteria as pain, functional
      disability, fatigue, sleep disturbances, coping, overall assessment of physical well being
      and overall assessment of psychological well being. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the practical modalities and performance of the EULAR- RAID score in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis who have been prescribed etanercept as part of usual medical practice.

    <measure>Reliability of the European League Against Rheumatism - Rheumatism Arthritis Impact of Disease (EULAR-RAID) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EULAR-RAID score reliability assessed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (using a consistency definition where the between-measure variance is excluded from the denominator variance and its 95% confidence interval) and the standard error of measurement (SEM) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). A higher intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) indicates greater score reliability (0.0 to 0.10=virtually none; 0.11 to 0.40=slight; 0.41 to 0.60=fair; 0.61 to 0.80=moderate; 0.81 to 1.00=substantial).</description>

    <description>EULAR-RAID is an assessment of patient reported outcomes for pain, functional disability, fatigue, sleep disturbance, coping, overall assessments of physical well-being and emotional well-being based on 7 numerical rating scales (NRS) questions.

             than 5 mm, or radiographic lung density greater than 1 cm and consistent with TB)
             should receive appropriate prophylactic therapy as recommended by the French Agency
             for healthcare Product Safety (AFSSAPS, http//afassaps.sante.fr/), serious infection
             (infection associated with hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotics) within 1
             month of test article administration or active infection at screening, open cutaneous
             ulcers, known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
             or hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive.

          -  Current or prior history of blood dyscrasias. Abnormal safety baseline blood test e.g.
             hemoglobin &lt;= 85 g/L; hematocrit less than 27 %; platelet count less than 125 x 109/L;
             white blood cell count less than 3.5 x 109/L; serum creatinine greater than 175
             µmol/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT
             [SGPT]) greater than 2 times the laboratory's upper limit of normal.

          -  Pre-existing or recent onset central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease.

          -  Cardiovascular conditions, e.g., myocardial infarction within 12 months of the
             screening visit, unstable angina pectoris, class III or IV congestive heart failure as
             defined by the New York Heart Association classification or decompensated congestive
             heart failure.

          -  Uncontrolled conditions, e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension (defined as screening
             systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg or screening diastolic blood pressure
             greater than 100 mm Hg), severe pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization or
             supplemental oxygen.

          -  At increased risk of malignancy.

          -  Reasonable expectation that the subject will not be able to satisfactorily complete
             the study.

          -  History of or current psychiatric illness, alcohol or drug abuse that would interfere
             with the subject's ability to comply with protocol requirements or give informed
             consent.

          -  Employment by the investigator or reporting directly or indirectly to the

        <title>Face Validity: Correlation Coefficients of the EULAR-RAID Score With the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Health Status: Time-normalized Average</title>
        <description>Time-normalized average is the area under the curve (AUC) / time between first and last observations. PGA of health status is a single-item participant rated response to the question “in general, how would you rate your health over the last 2 to 3 weeks”; scored 0 (very well) to 10 (extremely bad). Face validity assessed using a correlation coefficient between the EULAR-RAID score and PGA health status score. A higher correlation coefficient indicates greater EULAR-RAID score validity (best &gt;0.85).</description>

        <description>Sensitivity to change analyzed by testing if the difference of change from baseline of EULAR-RAID score minus the change from baseline of each component (pain, functional disability, fatigue, sleep disturbance, coping, overall physical and emotional well-being with score range 0 [not affected, very good] to 10 [most affected]) was different from 0 or not. Results expressed as standardized response mean (SRM) calculated as ratio of mean change over standard deviation of the change.

        <description>EULAR response rate is based on DAS28. For DAS28 ≤3.2 at observation (low disease activity), change from baseline of &lt;-1.2=good response or ≥-1.2 to &lt;-0.6=moderate response; DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 at observation (moderate or high disease activity), change from baseline of &lt;-1.2 or ≥-1.2 to &lt;-0.6=moderate response; DAS28 &gt;5.1 (high disease activity) at observation, change from baseline of &lt;-1.2=moderate response. DAS28 calculated using the 28 joints count, ESR mm/hour, and PGA of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity measured on 11-point rating scale: 0 [none] to 10 [extreme]).</description>

        <title>Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (MCII) of the EULAR-RAID Score: 75th Percentile of Change at Week 4 and Week 12</title>
        <description>MCII is a 2-question assessment of how rheumatoid arthritis has affected the participant in the last 48 hours. Question 1: in comparison to study start (Improved, No Change, or Worse). Question 2: if response was Improved, participant rated how important the improvement was (Very important, Moderately important, Slightly important, or Not important at all). The MCII score is defined as the 75th percentile of the change in EULAR-RAID score between baseline and observation among participants whose evaluation of the response therapy at observation was Moderately or Slightly important improvement.</description>

        <title>Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) of the EULAR-RAID Score: 75th Percentile of Change at Week 4 and Week 12</title>
        <description>PASS is a 1-question assessment of how rheumatoid arthritis has affected the participant in the last 48 hours (If you were to remain in the next few months as you were during the last hours, would this be Acceptable or Unacceptable to you?). PASS score is defined as the 75th percentile of the change in EULAR-RAID score between baseline and observation among participants whose evaluation of their symptom state at observation was Acceptable.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving &gt; 0.6 DAS28 Response at Week 12</title>
        <description>DAS28 calculated from number of painful and swollen joints using 28 joints count (PJC, SJC), ESR (mm/hour), and patient's global assessment of disease activity (arthritis activity measured on 11-point rating scale scored 0 [none] to 10 [extreme]). DAS28 score calculated as 0.56*square root (√) (PJC28) + 0.28 *√ (SJC28) + 0.70*ln ESR + 0.014*PGA*10. DAS28 score &gt;5.1=higher disease activity; ≤3.2=low disease activity; &lt;2.6=clinical remission.
