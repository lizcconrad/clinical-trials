  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total intravenous anesthesia(TIVA) is a commonly used anesthetic technique. Although TIVA can
      be accomplished with a variety of drug combinations, infusions of Propofol and Remifentanil
      are often used with dosage adjusted manually by the anesthesia provider.The pharmacokinetics
      of these drugs are well understood, and that knowledge has led to the development of computer
      controlled infusion pumps that can administer the drugs based upon pharmacokinetic models.
      Computer controlled infusion schemes automatically adjust the drug administration based upon
      pharmacokinetic models which typically dictate a tapering infusion scheme. When one considers
      the dosage of a computer controlled infusion it is obvious that manually imitating a similar
      scheme may be difficult.This study will evaluate manually controlled infusion schemes using
      the models built into the Applied Medical Visualizations (Medvis) display and compare the
      manual dosage schemes to the predicted effect site concentrations and pharmacodynamic effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), the anesthetic propofol and the opioid
      remifentanil are often used together. Previous studies have demonstrated the synergy between
      these combinations of medications. From these data, drug interaction models have been
      developed to pair drug effect-site concentrations with event markers of interest to the
      clinical anesthesiologist. For example, the amount of remifentanil and propofol typically
      required during the induction of anesthesia to cause loss of responsiveness to verbal or
      moderate stimuli has been studied. Likewise, the blood concentration levels present during
      emergence from anesthesia have been explored describing levels typically present for patients
      to return to consciousness.

      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the infusion doses of both
      remifentanil and propofol for pediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery at CHOP.
      These data will be applied to the pharmacokinetic models to determine the predicted effect
      site concentration, and the relationship of that concentration to the 50% and 95% doses as
      predicted by the model.
