      (QD), in treating subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin is a primary regulator of blood glucose concentrations. A subnormal response to
      circulating insulin levels at target tissues leads to a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose
      uptake. Insulin resistance is associated with normal to high insulin levels and is often
      accompanied by dyslipidemia, a disruption in lipid metabolism resulting in increased
      triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein levels as well as decreased high-density
      lipoprotein levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the early stages of insulin
      resistance, a compensatory mechanism of increased insulin secretion by the pancreas maintains
      normal to near-normal glucose levels. Once the pancreas fails to maintain the increased
      insulin output, overt type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs.

      TAK-559 is a novel oxyiminoalkanoic acid under investigation for use as an oral agent in the
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. TAK-559 has partial peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist activity, potent peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activity, and modest peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor-gamma activity at high concentrations in nonclinical models.

      This study was designed to evaluate the safety and glycemic control of TAK-559 in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose symptoms were managed by diet and exercise.
