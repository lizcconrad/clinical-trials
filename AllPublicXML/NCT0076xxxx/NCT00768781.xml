      The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of two
      mindfulness-based interventions, mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBT-I) and
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), for reducing arousal and improving sleep among
      individuals with psychophysiological insomnia.

      Specific Aim 1: To obtain evidence for the relative effects of MBT-I and MBSR compared to a
      delayed-treatment control condition followed by behavior therapy for insomnia (BT-I) on
      arousal levels. It is hypothesized that MBSR and MBT-I will be superior to the control
      condition at reducing arousal levels.

      Specific Aim 2: To obtain evidence for the relative effects of MBT-I, MBSR, and the
      delayed-treatment control on sleep. It is hypothesized that MBT-I will be superior to the
      MBSR and control conditions at improving sleep parameters.

      Specific Aim 3: To investigate the relationship between measures of arousal (self-report and
      objective measures) and sleep (self-report and objective measures) to enhance the
      understanding of the role of arousal in psychophysiological insomnia.

      The conceptual model for this study identifies two possible targets of treatment: arousal and
      sleep. In this model, BT for insomnia directly targets nighttime symptoms of insomnia (BT
      pathway), which improves sleep by increasing the homeostatic drive for sleep. Although BT is
      hypothesized to indirectly reduce arousal, no study has specifically investigated this
      effect. In contrast, MBSR is an intervention that is hypothesized to target arousal and, as
      preliminary findings suggest, also improves some symptoms of insomnia (MBSR pathway). It is
      therefore hypothesized that a combination of BT and mindfulness is superior to each treatment
      alone as it targets both nighttime symptoms and hyperarousal (Mindfulness + BT pathway). Our
      preliminary data suggests that this combination treatment has effects on both self-reported
      arousal and sleep. Conceptually, this novel approach would provide a set of self-regulating
      skills that could potentially target a broader range of daytime and nighttime symptoms that
      is characteristic of an insomnia disorder.

      To test the conceptual model, this study employs a randomized clinical trial design with
      three conditions: 1) Mindfulness-Based Therapy for insomnia (MBT-I), 2) mindfulness-based
      stress reduction (MBSR), and 3) delayed-treatment condition followed by behavior therapy for
      insomnia (BT-I). Each of the three treatments will be delivered in a group format with 8
      weekly sessions spanning an 8-week period.

    <description>The rationale for treatment is that MBSR targets arousal, which is a prominent perpetuating factor of insomnia. Each session meets weekly for 120 minutes and consists of a therapist-led mindfulness meditation, followed by a discussion of the meditation and its application into the participant's everyday life. For homework, each participant is required to practice formal meditation at least 45 minutes a day, 6 days per week. Participants will be provided a tape, an mp3 file, or CD to aid in the participant's personal practice at home. Formal meditations that will be led and discussed include eating meditation, body scan, sitting meditation, Hatha Yoga, and walking meditation. In addition, informal mindfulness practices will be discussed.</description>

    <description>MBTI treatment includes the hypothesized active elements of both mindfulness meditation and behavior therapy for insomnia. The intervention includes 8 weekly sessions. Each session meets weekly for approximately 120 minutes. The general format of each session includes formal mindfulness meditation (quiet and movement meditations) and instructions for the behavioral intervention, with a focus on integrating the principles of mindfulness with these instructions. Each participant is required to practice formal meditation for at least 45 minutes a day, 6 days per week as homework. Participants are provided a tape, mp3 file, or CD to aid in the participant's personal practice at home.</description>

    <description>This delayed treatment condition consists of an 8-week monitoring period (sleep diaries, PSAS) and then BT. The BT treatment consists of 8 sessions of behavioral interventions for insomnia, with instructions targeting the nighttime symptoms of insomnia. The primary components of this treatment package are stimulus control, sleep restriction, and sleep hygiene education. In the BT condition, each weekly session lasts 120 minutes and consists of formal instructions for the behavioral interventions along with a time for discussion of the application of these instructions into each participant's unique circumstances.</description>
