    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of flexibly dosed
      paliperidone extended-release (ER) in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder
      with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and
      hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective (study following participants forward in time), single
      arm, and non-comparative study of paliperidone Extended Release(ER) in participants with
      schizophrenia (after switching from the existing drug to paliperidone ER). The total study
      duration will be approximately of 48 weeks per participant. The study consists of 2 parts:
      Screening (that is, 14 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (single-oral dose of
      paliperidone for 48 weeks, dose ranging from 3 to 12 milligram). Efficacy of the participants
      will primarily be evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening. Change from Baseline is calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 48. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is 100-point validated clinician-rated scale that assesses degree of difficulty in 4 areas of functioning: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors rated on 6-point scale (1=absent to 6=very severe).Total transformed score from 1 to 100 is generated from raw score based on clinical interpretation of scores generated in 4 areas of functioning, with higher transformed score indicating better function. Total score is divided into 3 levels: 71-100 (mild difficulty); 31-70 (marked difficulty) and 1-30 (severe difficulty). Change from Baseline is calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 48. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant). Change from Baseline is calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 48. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale Score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SWN-20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self-control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood. Change from Baseline is calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 48. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

          <description>DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10.</description>

The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self-control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Positive Subscale Score at Week 48</title>
        <description>The PANSS Positive Subscale assesses seven positive-symptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal functions. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, with a range of 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology). Change from Baseline is calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 48. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <description>The PSP is 100-point validated clinician-rated scale that assesses degree of difficulty in 4 areas of functioning: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors rated on 6-point scale (1=absent to 6=very severe).Total transformed score from 1 to 100 is generated from raw score based on clinical interpretation of scores generated in 4 areas of functioning, with higher transformed score indicating better function. Total score is divided into 3 levels: 71-100 (mild difficulty); 31-70 (marked difficulty) and 1-30 (severe difficulty). Change from Baseline is calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 48. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant). Change from Baseline is calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 48. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale Score at Week 48</title>
        <description>The SWN-20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self-control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood. Change from Baseline is calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 48. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <population>ITT population for efficacy included all the participants who received paliperidone ER at least once and who had at least 1 post baseline efficacy assessment. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies the participants evaluable for this measure.</population>
