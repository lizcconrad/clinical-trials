      (QD), in the treatment of neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic polyneuropathy is a frequent complication in individuals with type 1 and 2 diabetes
      mellitus, and can result in progressive functional and structural deficits in both somatic
      and autonomic nerves. Diabetic polyneuropathy is characterized by degenerative changes in
      nerve fibers resulting in progressive functional and structural deficits in both somatic and
      autonomic nerves.

      TAK-583 is a synthetic compound currently under development for the treatment of diabetic
      polyneuropathy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAK-583
      for the treatment of mild to moderate diabetic polyneuropathy in subjects with type 1 or type
      2 diabetes mellitus. Study participation is anticipated to be about 8 months.
