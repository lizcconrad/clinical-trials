      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new injectable bulking agent for the treatment of
      fecal incontinence in adult men and women. This study has been designed to assess the safety,
      effectiveness and performance of Durasphere in adults suffering from fecal incontinence under
      monitored clinical conditions.

      The frequency and severity of fecal incontinence symptoms will be measured using a modified
      Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score as the primary criteria by which success is evaluated.
