    <textblock>
      To characterize the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine in two pediatric populations:
      children, ages 2 to &lt; 12 years, and adolescents, ages 12 to &lt; 18 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has an open-label, single-dose classical pharmacokinetic design with no comparator
      treatment or group. Twenty-four (24) children, ages 2 to &lt; 12 years, and 12 adolescents, ages
      12 to &lt; 18 years, with symptoms due to hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies will
      complete the study. To ensure that younger children are represented, at least 35% (8) of the
      children enrolled will range from 2 to &lt; 6 years of age.

          -  Male and female children and adolescents, ages 2 to &lt; 18 years, with a minimum weight
             of 24 pounds will be eligible to participate. In addition, each subject will be &gt; 5th
             percentile and &lt; 95th percentile for weight based on age and gender.

          -  Subjects will have a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 5th percentile and less than or equal to
             90th percentile for age and gender.

          -  Subjects who have a history of allergic rhinitis and who are experiencing symptoms due
             to hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies will be included.

          -  Subjects who do not use concurrent medications, except for low-dose inhaled
             glucocorticosteroids for allergic rhinitis or mild concurrent asthma, if dose is
             stabilized before entry in the study (ie, dose is not changed for 1 month prior to
             entry or during the study), and inhaled short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists for
             concomitant asthma, as needed;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, or neurologic
             disease.

          -  Findings from the medical history or physical examination with vital sign measurements
             that are not within the range of clinical acceptability.

          -  Have a known sensitivity or allergy to diphenhydramine or EMLA cream.

          -  Have a known sensitivity or allergy to red dye.

          -  Have asthma symptoms at the time of study entry or requiring medications other than
             allowed in Inclusion Criterion 4;

          -  Took any prescription (other than allowed in Inclusion Criterion 4) or nonprescription
             medication, within seven days or five half-lives (whichever is longer) before the
             study's start date.

          -  Took any herbal supplements or drank grapefruit juice with 28 days of the study's
             start date.

          -  Participated in, or completed, another clinical trial within seven weeks before the
             study's start date.

          -  Have a history of drug, alcohol, and tobacco use (older children and adolescents)

          -  Have a history of hepatitis B, a previous positive test for hepatitis B surface
             antigen, or a previous positive hepatitis C antibody.

          -  Have a history of HIV infection or previous demonstration of HIV antibodies.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or
