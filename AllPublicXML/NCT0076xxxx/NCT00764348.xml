  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who present to a wound care center for management of their wounds will be evaluated
      clinically to establish if their wounds are chronic or acute. These patients will undergo
      standard of care management of their wounds. If debridement is indicated for the patient, the
      patient will be asked to participate in a study. Once the standard of care debridement is
      complete, the material debrided from the wound, instead of being discarded into a biohazard
      bag, will be prepared for shipment. The samples will then be shipped to the Center for
      Biofilm Engineering where microscopic evaluation will be conducted on the material.
      Conclusion will be made from that analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A planktonic concept of the bacteria present on the surface of a chronic wound is no longer
      viable. Microscopic studies show that biofilm is present on chronic wounds yet does not seem
      to be prominent on the surface of acute wounds. Biofilm is able to neutralize our host
      defenses and commandeer host systems, and possesses an impressive array of defenses and
      virulence factors. Clinically we see a significant difference in the healing behavior between
      chronic and acute wounds. Also, suppression of biofilm using multiple simultaneous strategies
      including debridement, anti-biofilm agents, specific biocides, antibiotics and advanced
      technologies improves wound healing. This suggests biofilm plays an important role in delayed
      wound healing.
