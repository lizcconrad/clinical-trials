      Once the patients are identified that have a full thickness wound on a limb clearly
      identified as having critical limb ischemia, these patients will be evaluated. The data that
      will be extracted from each chart will include patient's age, patient's gender, number of
      office visits, presence of diabetes, presence of osteomyelitis, type and amount of antibiotic
      administered, number of hyperbaric oxygen treatments, and if the wound healed.

      Clinicians have even learned to group patients into different etiologic categories based on
      underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, decubitus ulcer, surgical site infection,
      venous insufficiency, arterial insufficiency and others. It seems that wounds have been
      grouped into these categories because of their common barriers, which should allow us more
      precise algorithms and may provide better outcomes. That is diabetics tend to have the
      barriers of poor perfusion, endothelial cell dysfunction, white blood cell dysfunction,
      hyperglycemia, neuropathy and repetitive trauma. Venous insufficiency patients tend to have
      perivascular cuffing and peri wound edema. However patients with venous leg ulcers commonly
      have peripheral arterial disease and diabetes (3). The point is regardless of the etiology of
      the wound every patient must be evaluated for all barriers on every visit. Arbitrarily
      dividing chronic wounds in the etiologic categories has not significantly improved wound
      healing outcomes.
