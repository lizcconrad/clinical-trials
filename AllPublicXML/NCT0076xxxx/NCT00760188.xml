        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing primary knee arthroplasty

          2. Patients with one of the following primary diagnoses in the medial compartment of the
             knee:

               -  Osteoarthritis,

               -  Avascular necrosis

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Inability to co-operate with and complete the study.

          2. Inadequate fixation of cementless components. If either before or after randomization
             the surgeon feels that cementless fixation is inadequate, cemented components should
