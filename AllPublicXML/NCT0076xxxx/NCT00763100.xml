  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are three main objectives, centering on those patients targeted for surveillance
      imaging. The first objective is to compare image quality and specificity of breast
      tomosynthesis and conventional 2D mammography in a BIRADS 3 diagnostic population. The second
      objective is to compare image quality and ability to determine post-surgical and
      post-radiation changes from recurrence in a post-cancer subset of a BIRADS 3 population
      having undergone conservation therapy (lumpectomy with or without radiation. The final
      objective is to compare image quality and the ability to determine chemoresponsiveness in a
      post-cancer subset of a BIRADS 3 population, who are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

        Three groups of patients will be enrolled:

        Group 1 will enroll patients that have been categorized as a BIRADS 3 on the basis of
        screening and diagnostic conventional imaging work-up.

        Group II will enroll patients that have been categorized as a BIRADS 3 for surveillance
        imaging because they have undergone breast conservation therapy for breast cancer.

        Group III will enroll patients that have been categorized as a BIRADS 3 for surveillance
        imaging because they are currently undergoing primary systemic therapy.
