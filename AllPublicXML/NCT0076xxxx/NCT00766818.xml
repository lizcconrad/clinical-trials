    <textblock>
      In this study, we are looking at blood concentrations of Kaletra in HIV positive patients
      during pregnancy. The patients will come in for 4 visits lasting ~24hrs. These visits take
      place at 20-24 weeks, 30 weeks, 32 weeks and 8 weeks post-partum. At the end of vist 2 (week
      30), we will increase your dose to 2 adult Kaletra tablets, and one pediatric Kaletra tablet
      (total dose 500/125mg). The dose will remain increased until you are 2 weeks post partum,
      then it will return to the standard 2 adult tablets (400/100mg).

          -  Active opportunistic or serious bacterial infection at the time of entry

          -  Past or present obstetrical complications (including, but not limited to: placentia
             previa, eclampsia, confirmed birth defects, multiple gestation pregnancies)

             visits

          -  Currently receiving or expected to receive other protease inhibitors in conjunction
             with Kaletra®

          -  HIV genotype showing accumulation of protease inhibitor mutations expected to result
             in virologic failure on Kaletra® OR documented virologic failure on
             Kaletra®-containing regimen attributable to the Kaletra® component

          -  Chronic hepatitis B and/or C virus infection

          -  Cushing's Syndrome

          -  Untreated hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism

             all subjects with anemia who enroll in the study must be receiving or start
             hematinics, including iron and folate supplements, immediately upon enrollment and
             continue until anemia resolves or end of pregnancy. The hematinic supplements may be
             discontinued at the discretion of the investigator if they consider continuation would
             not be in the best interest of the subject.
