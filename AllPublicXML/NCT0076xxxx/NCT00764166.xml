  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to evaluate the PSA (biochemical) progression-free survival (PFS)
      of high-risk metastasis-free PC patients, treated with LH-RH agonist for one year with or
      without docetaxel after prior radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT).

      The study was powered at 80% to detect a 25% improvement in biochemical PFS for a total
      sample size estimated at 252 patients, with a two-sided type I error rate of 5%
      (non-parametric methods.

      Docetaxel was shown to be active in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (PC) in
      phase III trials (1-2). It is likely to demonstrate a substantial role in the management of
      early-stage PC patients in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, where clinical trials are
      underway.•53% of all men who undergo radical prostatectomy will develop prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) elevations in the 10 years following surgery, with approximately 77% of these
      recurrences occurring within the first 2 years.A prospective, multicenter, national,
      randomized, two-arm, phase III study comparing hormonal treatment (LH-RH agonist alone) with
      or without docetaxel was designed to evaluate the interest of chemotherapy in non-metastatic
      prostate cancer patients at high risk of systemic recurrence after initial treatment (radical
      prostatectomy or radiotherapy).
