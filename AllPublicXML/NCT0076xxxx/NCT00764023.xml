  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this protocol is to salvage human-related material that is normally destined
      for destruction, so it can be used in infection-related scientific studies. This clinical
      material can be studied in order to better understand the molecular, cellular, or ecological
      components of the infected or potentially infected tissue or device.

      The samples can include material such as wound debridement, removed orthopedic implants,
      removed catheters or shunts, excised tonsils, amputated tissue, sputum, stool, or other
      excretions. The samples can be cultured for microbes, examined using microscopy, or analyzed
      using molecular techniques. The studies can examine microbes or the host's response to
      microbes by examining the nucleic acids (e.g. 16S DNA, mRNA), proteins, or other metabolites.
