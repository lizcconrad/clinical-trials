    <textblock>
      Treatment of recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains controversial and many
      therapeutic options exist. The aim of this study is to compare pleural symphysis by talc
      poudrage during medical thoracoscopy and surgical management combining pleural abrasion and
      blebs or bullae resection for treatment of recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

      Treatment of recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains controversial and many
      therapeutic options exist. What is the best technical option : treatment of the lung and the
      parietal pleura or treatment of the pleura with pleural symphysis ? Talc pleurodesis
      performed during medical thoracoscopy and resection of blebs or bullae associated with
      pleural abrasion during surgical thoracoscopy (or video-assisted thoracic surgery) are the
      most usual methods. These two procedures have never been compared in a prospective trial. The
      aim of this study is to compare pleural symphysis by talc poudrage during medical
      thoracoscopy and surgical management combining pleural abrasion and blebs or bullae resection
      for treatment of recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax.
