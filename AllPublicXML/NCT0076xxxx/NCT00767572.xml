  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) accounts for approximately 8% of all congenital heart
      problems. Patients with CoA are well known to have an increased rates of early heart disease,
      high blood pressure, heart failure and stroke. Abnormal arterial function (dilation and
      constriction of the blood vessels) has been observed in these patients and likely contributes
      to the increased risk of cardiovascular problems. However, therapies targeted at improving
      arterial function have not been investigated in this population. Statin therapy (cholesterol
      medicines like Lipitor) have been studied in other subgroups of patients with abnormal
      arterial function and has shown benefit in improving arterial function and reducing risk of
      cardiovascular problems.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients with CoA have abnormal arterial function leading
      to increased cardiovascular risk. We further hypothesize that statin therapy may improve this
      problem. We plan to compile a complete database of information regarding these patients
      cardiovascular health and propose to then examine the effect of atorvastatin (Lipitor) on
      arterial function as measured by changes in arm arterial function tests.

      The study design is a randomized double-blind cross over clinical trial. Patients who meet
      inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be enrolled. They will undergo a baseline
      cardiovascular assessment including echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic
      resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), serum blood samples, brachial artery reactivity testing, and
      carotid intimal media thickness testing. Once they have completed their baseline testing,
      they will be randomized to either atorvastatin 80mg or placebo. They will complete 12 weeks
      of therapy and return at the end of 12 weeks to have a repeat brachial artery study and serum
      studies. There will then be a four week washout period where they take no medication. They
      will return for a follow up visit at the end of that four week period for repeat baseline
      brachial artery testing and serum studies. They then will be assigned to the opposite agent
      they were on previously (so if they originally were on placebo they switch to atorvastatin
      and vice versa). They will complete another 12 weeks of therapy and return at the end for a
      final brachial artery study and blood testing.

          <title>Pre-post Change in Brachial Artery Reactivity</title>
          <description>Brachial artery reactivity was assessed by Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), performed before and after the 12 week period on therapy. FMD uses high-frequency ultrasound measurement of changes in brachial artery diameter after a 5-minute blood pressure cuff arterial occlusion. Brachial artery reactivity has been shown to predict long-term cardiovascular events.</description>
          <population>12 enrolled participants were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week course of either atorvastatin or placebo, followed by a 4-week washout, then 12 weeks on the alternate intervention.</population>
