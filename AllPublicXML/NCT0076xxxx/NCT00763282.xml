      Pressure ulcers (PrUs) are the most frequent significant medical complication after spinal
      cord injury (SCI). PrU prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates are high, and
      most persons with SCI will have at least one serious PrU during their lifetime. VA costs of
      treating the almost 3,500 unique Veterans with SCI and a severe ulcer at an SCI Center in
      FY10 was just under $400 million.

      Background:

      Pressure ulcers (PrUs) are the most frequent significant medical complication after spinal
      cord injury (SCI). PrU prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates are high, and
      most persons with SCI will have at least one serious PrU during their lifetime. VA costs of
      treating the almost 3,500 unique Veterans with SCI and a severe ulcer at an SCI Center in
      2010 was just under $400 million.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) was to determine whether a
      multi-component self-management (SM) intervention increases the use of skin-protective
      behaviors and reduces skin worsening in Veterans with SCI, compared to an education control
      (ED) intervention. Secondary outcomes included PrU knowledge, self-management skills,
      communication with providers, self-efficacy, community integration and days on bedrest.
      Another objective was to conduct focus group interviews with patients and providers and to
      analyze transcripts of SM group sessions to determine barriers and facilitators with regard
      to spinal cord injury and pressure ulcer prevention.

      Methods:

      This was a multi-site efficacy intervention study with a single blind prospective randomized
      design. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and key variables.
      Supplemental focus group interviews were conducted with patients with SCI (n=35) and SCI
      providers (n=39). Focus group interviews and SM group calls were transcribed verbatim and
      analyzed using constant comparative techniques.

      Study participants included Veterans hospitalized for Stage III/IV PrUs at or below the level
      of injury, from six VA SCI Centers around the country (Long Beach, Houston, Milwaukee,
      Augusta, Hines and St. Louis). Prior to discharge, PrU risk factors were identified and 1:1
      PrU education was provided. Randomization and the behavioral interventions began at
      discharge. The number of randomized subjects were 72 in the ED group and 72 in the SM group
      (n=144). The analytic sample included subjects with complete data (n=92).

      The intervention included 8 site coordinator-initiated calls using didactic (ED) or
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) strategies to address PrU risk factors. The second component
      included telephone group calls that included either didactic information about SCI or SM
      skills including: 1) knowledge about the medical condition; 2) self-monitoring; 3)
      problem-solving skills; 4) skill for managing the effects of the condition; 5) adherence to
      necessary health behaviors; and 6) self-advocacy with health care providers. ED subjects
      received general health information and were not instructed in any specific problem solving,
      self-monitoring or SM techniques. The ED intervention was comparable to the SM with respect
      to natural history/ time, dosing, measurement processes, attention, therapeutic alliance,
      social support, and in receiving a manualized treatment with specific therapist procedures.
      Self-reported outcome data were obtained by phone at 3 and 6 months, and from mailed photos
      of study ulcers.

      Status:

      Study is complete. Additional analyses are ongoing and future manuscripts are planned.

    <description>Skin Behavior Change was calculated as the percentage of Self-Reported Behavior at 3 and 6 months (minus the percentage at baseline).
The study reported the number of guideline-recommended skin care behaviors, assessed by the Skin Care Behavior Checklist, a self-reported measure of adherence to 8 guideline recommended skin care behaviors. The average percentage of the 8 behaviors adhered to for each participant was measured by intervention arms at admission (baseline), 3 and 6 months post-discharge.</description>

    <description>Self Management (SM) + Motivational Interviewing (MI). Self Management and Motivational Interviewing (SM+MI) participants were assigned to both a self-management and motivational interview group. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based form of counseling to help individuals to engage in behavior change. Self Management (SM) consists of: 1) on-site decisional support to promote provider adherence to ulcer management guidelines, 2) enhanced, interactive PrU education, 3) chronic disease self-management skill building via telephone based groups, 4) proactive care management using MI to support ongoing self-management activities, and 5) distance technology.</description>

    <description>Education (ED). An education control intervention (ED) designed to be a credible intervention that is comparable to the SM will control for potential effects of natural history/time, treatment dosing, measurement processes, attention, the non-specific effects of therapeutic alliance, social support, and of receiving a manualized treatment with specific therapist procedures. The ED intervention will differ only in that subjects will not be instructed in any specific problem solving, self-monitoring, or SM techniques, with the exception of encouraging them to become informed consumers of SCI care.</description>

          <description>The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score is a scale to classify spinal cord injuries (SCI).
A= complete SCI where no motor or sensory function is in the sacral segments S4-S5.
B= incomplete SCI where sensory but not motor function is below the neurological level and includes the sacral segments S4-S5.
C= incomplete SCI where motor function is below the neurological level and fewer than half of key muscles have a muscle grade &lt; 3.
D= incomplete spinal cord injury where motor function is below the neurological level and at least half of the key muscles have a muscle grade &gt;3.</description>

        <title>Percent of Possible Self-Reported Skin Care Behaviors</title>
        <description>Skin Behavior Change was calculated as the percentage of Self-Reported Behavior at 3 and 6 months (minus the percentage at baseline).
The study reported the number of guideline-recommended skin care behaviors, assessed by the Skin Care Behavior Checklist, a self-reported measure of adherence to 8 guideline recommended skin care behaviors. The average percentage of the 8 behaviors adhered to for each participant was measured by intervention arms at admission (baseline), 3 and 6 months post-discharge.</description>

The ED intervention will differ only in that subjects will not be instructed in any specific problem solving, self-monitoring, or SM techniques, with the exception of encouraging them to become informed consumers of SCI care.</description>

        <description>Skin worsening was defined as when a participant with an open wound at the time of discharge is found to have &gt;20% wound area at 3 or 6 months post-discharge (including new wounds and reopened wounds). Worsening was also defined as a when a participant with a closed wound at discharge is found to have a new or reopened wound at 3 or 6 months post-discharge.</description>

Education (ED): An education control intervention (ED) designed to be a credible intervention that is comparable to the SM will control for potential effects of natural history/time, treatment dosing, measurement processes, attention, the non-specific effects of therapeutic alliance, social support, and of receiving a manualized treatment with specific therapist procedures. The ED intervention will differ only in that subjects will not be instructed in any specific problem solving, self-monitoring, or SM techniques, with the exception of encouraging them to become informed consumers of SCI care.</description>
