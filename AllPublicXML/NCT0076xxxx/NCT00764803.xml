      The purpose of this study is to compare the survivorship and efficacy of the Encore 3DKnee™
      system with that of the Encore MJS™ Knee System in a group of 600 patients for whom data
      collection is already under way.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the survivorship and efficacy of the Encore 3DKnee™
      system with that of the Encore MJS™ Knee System in a group of 600 patients for whom data
      collection is already under way. Approximately 300 patients have already received the MJS™
      knee system and data, as described below, has been collected for these patients over a period
      of two years. A second group of 300 patients will receive the Encore 3DKnee™ system over the
      next two years, and equivalent data will be collected for these individuals. A portion of the
      data has been collected over the past year, and now we would like to obtain permission from
      the patients to analyze these data as well as collect an additional year of data.
