  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a patient education program for chronic
      wound care. The wound care nurse practitioner (NP) at the Ann Arbor VAMC will use a wound
      self-management &quot;after-care summary&quot; with approximately half of her patients. This study will
      examine whether using this patient education tool for self-management of wound care results
      in improved patient outcomes.

    <description>The wound care NP will measure the wound and assess adherence to the following self-management activities: visiting the wound care clinic as scheduled; offloading; applying dressings; obtaining assistance at home; and participating in social activities. This information will be entered into a computer database on a VA computer that will generate a summary chart showing the relationship between adherence and wound healing. The generated &quot;after-care summary&quot; will be discussed with the patient and used to set self-management goals.</description>
