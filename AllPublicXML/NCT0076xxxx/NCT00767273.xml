        Inclusion Criteria:- Adult patients (&gt;18) with histologically confirmed adenocarcinomas of
        the pancreas with a - treatment plan consisting of definitive or palliative radiation
        therapy and/or chemotherapy with or without surgery.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test if a woman of child-bearing potential (WOCBP).

          -  WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout
             the study period.

          -  All patients will be evaluated in a uniform manner at the Stanford GI Combined
             Modality Tumor Board to determine eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:1. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
        ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
        pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
        compliance with study requirements.

        2. Any concurrent malignancy other than non-melanomaskin cancer, or carcinomainsitu of the
        cervix. Patients with a previous malignancy without evidence of disease for &gt;5 years will
        be allowed to enter the trial.

        3. WOCBP who is pregnant or breastfeeding. 4. Inability to sign written consent.
