      This study randomizes patients seen by Redmond Medic One into a control arm and a study arm
      when they present with acute coronary syndrome and have non-contributory ECG's
      (i.e.non-STEMI). The control group is treated normally and delivered to the receiving
      hospital. The study group is treated normally as well, however troponin measurements are made
      using an i-STAT blood analyzer prior to hospital arrival. The results are presented to the
      receiving physician. Door-to-reperfusion time is monitored for both groups.
