    <description>Percentage of participants achieving world health organization (WHO) predefined antibody threshold &gt;=0.35 mcg/mL along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 7 common pneumococcal serotypes (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) and 6 additional pneumococcal serotypes specific to 13vPnC (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A) were presented.

    <time_frame>28 to 42 days after dose 1</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of IgG concentrations 1 month after 13vPnC vaccination in group 3 of study 6096A1-3011 (NCT00761631) to posttoddler responses in 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) group for 7 common serotypes and in combined 13vPnC groups for 6 additional serotypes of study 6096A1-3005 (NCT00444457) is not reported here because analysis population includes participants who were not enrolled in this study. ClinicalTrials.gov is designed for reporting results from only those participants who were enrolled in study and described in Participant Flow and Baseline Characteristics modules.</description>

    <description>Serotype-specific OPA GMTs for the 7 common pneumococcal serotypes (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) and 6 additional pneumococcal serotypes specific to 13vPnC (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A) were determined in the blood samples of all the participants using a microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay. GMT (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were evaluated. GMs were calculated using all participants with available data for after dose 1 blood draw.</description>

        <description>Comparison of IgG concentrations 1 month after 13vPnC vaccination in group 3 of study 6096A1-3011 (NCT00761631) to posttoddler responses in 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) group for 7 common serotypes and in combined 13vPnC groups for 6 additional serotypes of study 6096A1-3005 (NCT00444457) is not reported here because analysis population includes participants who were not enrolled in this study.
