  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this evaluation was to determine the effectiveness of an educational program
      designed to assist family caregivers to learn the knowledge and skills to take better care of
      their frail elder relatives and themselves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spouses, children, and other family members typically care for frail elderly persons. These
      family caregivers attempt to provide care for their relative in the home, despite the
      potential for excessive stress to themselves. This care may extend over many years, involving
      unrelenting management of their relative, which puts the caregiver at risk for the
      development of physical and mental health consequences. The stress of caring for a frail
      elder may result in the institutionalization of the care receiver due to declining health or
      abilities in the caregiver as caregivers frequently continue to provide care at the expense
      of their own health. The goal of the education program is to fill an important need, that is,
      assist caregivers to become empowered, hardier, and have the ability to cope with the stress
      associated with caregiving. The aim is to investigate whether this educational intervention
      improves selected outcomes for family caregivers of frail elders. The selected outcomes are
      knowledge of caregiving, hardiness, quality of life, physical health, depressive symptoms,
      burden, and coping.

    <description>Hardiness was measured using the Psychological Hardiness Scale, a 40 item scale (Younkin &amp; Betz, 1996). Responses for each item were obtained on a 5-point Likert continuum from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; (1) to Strongly Agree (5).</description>

    <time_frame>pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, six-month post-intervention, and twelve-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge about caregiving was operationalized by total score on a content-specific test (17 items) for the family caregivers' educational program that measured knowledge and behaviors. True/false answers were given to items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, six-month post-intervention, and twelve-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life measured using a Cantril (1965) ladder scale. The participants viewed a picture of a ladder with nine rungs, with the top rung labeled &quot;best possible life&quot; (9) and the bottom rung labeled &quot;worst possible life (0).</description>

    <measure>Physical and Mental Health (change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, six-month post-intervention, and twelve-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 Health Survey (Ware &amp; Sherboume, 1992), a 36-item self-report scale was used to measure the caregiver's view of their health.</description>

    <measure>Depressive Symptomatology (change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, six-month post-intervention, and twelve-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), a 20 item self report scale, was used to measure depressive symptomatology. Participants rated how frequently each symptom occurred during the past week on a scale ranging from rarely or none of the time (0) to most or all of the time (3).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden (change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, six-month post-intervention, and twelve-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), developed by Novak and Guest (1989), a 24-item multidimensional measure was used to measure caregiver burden. This inventory includes five factors: Time-dependence burden, Developmental burden, physical burden, Social burden, and Emotional burden.</description>

    <measure>Coping (change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, six-month post-intervention, and twelve-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS) (Jalowiec, Murphy, &amp; Powers, 1984) was used to measure coping mechanisms. There are 60 items classified into 8 different coping styles: confrontive, evasive, optimistic, fatalistic, emotive, palliative, supportant, and self-reliant.</description>
