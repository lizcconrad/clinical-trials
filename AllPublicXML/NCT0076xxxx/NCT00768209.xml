    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the effects of a single dose of the study medication in
      subjects with and without hepatic impairment. 18 to 24 subjects will participate by having
      multiple blood draws taken to measure the level of study medication in their blood over time.

      This study will look at the effect of a single does of study medication in three groups. Each
      group will have 6 - 8 subjects with similar levels of hepatic impairment. Group 1 will have
      normal hepatic function. Groups 2 and 3 will be made up of subjects with mild to moderate
      hepatic impairment. Subjects will have blood taken at specific intervals to measure study
      medication levels. Subject participation will last approximately 7 to 9 days.
