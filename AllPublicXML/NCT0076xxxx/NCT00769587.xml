      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of systemic mastocytosis by blocking blood flow to
      the disease.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well thalidomide works in treating patients with
      relapsed or progressive systemic mastocytosis.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate at 6 months in patients with systemic mastocytosis
           treated with thalidomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression.
