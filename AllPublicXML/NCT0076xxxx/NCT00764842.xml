        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Noninflammatory degenerative joint disease including

               -  Osteoarthritis of the natural femoral head

               -  Avascular necrosis of the natural femoral head

               -  Rheumatoid arthritis

          3. Correction of functional deformities

          4. Femoral fracture

          5. Patients must be able and willing to complete all study-related visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Anyone who is under 18 years of age

          2. Infection or sepsis

          3. Insufficient bone quality which may affect the stability of the implant

          4. Muscular, neurological or vascular deficiencies, which compromise the affected
             extremity

          5. Skeletally immature patients and cases where there is a loss of abductor musculature,
             poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around hip joint which would make the procedure
             unjustifiable

          6. Osteomyelitis

          7. Rapid joint destruction or bone absorption apparent on roentgenogram

          8. Pathological conditions of the acetabulum which would prevent achieving proper range
             of motion, appropriate head stability, and/or a well-seated and supported smooth
             articulation of the head within the acetabulum

          9. Alcoholism or other addictions

         10. Materials sensitivity

         11. Loss of ligamentous structures

         12. High levels of physical activity (e.g., competitive sports, heavy physical labor)

         13. Pregnancy
