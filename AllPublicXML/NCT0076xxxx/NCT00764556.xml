  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are commonly admitted to hospital
      with exacerbations of their lung disease. A combination of the acute illness and treatment
      with oral steroids causes a rise in blood sugar. Patients with high blood sugar do worse than
      those with normal blood sugar. The aim of this study is to develop a safe and effective
      protocol for tight control of blood glucose with insulin on acute medical wards outside the
      intensive care environment. This will allow us to perform a formal trial to determine whether
      blood glucose control with insulin reduces death and complications from COPD exacerbations.
