      The intent of this protocol is to obtain blood samples from subjects with or without a wound,
      so the blood can be used in wound-related scientific studies. It is also the intent of this
      protocol to salvage debrided wound material that is normally destined for destruction, so it
      can be used in wound-related scientific studies.

      The samples will be studied in order to attempt to better understand wounds and their
      associated barriers to healing. Analytical methods used to examine the blood or debridement
      can investigate morphological, molecular, immunological, cellular, viral, biochemical,
      chemical, genetic, and/or transcriptional components of the samples. It is the goal of this
      study to determine if these tests may be able to provide important insights into the keys of
      wound healing, wound persistence, or wound deterioration.
