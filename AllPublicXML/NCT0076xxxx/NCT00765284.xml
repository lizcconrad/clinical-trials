      To determine whether 8 weeks of Niaspan treatment increases cholesterol efflux in male
      subjects with low HDL-C cholesterol when compared to no treatment.

      To determine whether 8 weeks of Niaspan treatment increases fecal cholesterol excretion when
      compared to no treatment.

      This will be a single center, open-label, randomized, mechanism of action study consisting of
      8 weeks of active treatment preceded by a screening phase from one to 8 weeks and a baseline
      measurement of parameters of reverse cholesterol transport for 10 days. The population for
      this trial is 15 non-diabetic men aged 18-70 years. Ten subjects will be low HDL-C male
      volunteers who will receive aspirin and Niaspan and five subjects will be low HDL-C male
      volunteers who will receive only aspirin.
