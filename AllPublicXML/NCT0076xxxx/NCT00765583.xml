  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 75 subjects will be enrolled into a 36 month study. Subjects will be treated with
      Restylane® on both sides of the face (nasolabial folds) at the first visit, on one side of
      the face at month 4.5 and on the other side of the face at month 9. Both sides of the face
      will then be treated again at month 18. The subjects will evaluate themselves and will also
      be evaluated by the treating doctor and a blinded evaluator (a person that does not know when
      the different sides of the face are treated). Side effects and medications taken during the
      study will also be recorded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will employ a randomized, evaluator-blind design. One of the nasolabial folds will
      be randomly assigned to be corrected with Restylane and then re-treated at 4 ½ months. The
      opposite side will be treated with Restylane and not re-treated until 9 months. Both
      nasolabial folds will be re-treated at 18 months. Each subject will serve as their own
      control, allowing comparison of the outcome between the contralateral sides.

      This is a multi-center U.S. trial with a planned enrollment of 75 subjects at three centers.
      The goal of the study is to enroll and complete follow-up for 60 evaluable subjects. In order
      to compensate for early discontinuations, a total of at least 75 subjects will be recruited
      and treated.

      After giving written informed consent, potential study participants will undergo a screening
      evaluation and initial treatment (Visit 1). The two nasolabial folds will be randomized for
      treatment so that one side will be designated for re-treatment with Restylane at 4 ½ months;
      the other at 9 months. At month 18 (Visit 7) both nasolabial folds will be re-treated.
      Follow-up visits will be scheduled through 36 months after initial treatment or touch-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or non-pregnant, non-breast feeding females aged 18 years or older.

          -  Subjects seeking augmentation therapy for correction of bilateral nasolabial folds.

          -  Subjects with a score of 3 or 4 on the Severity Rating Scale.

          -  Subjects with the ability to understand and comply with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Subjects willing to abstain from exclusionary procedures (e.g., further augmentation
             therapy,laser or chemical resurfacing; Botox® injections below eye level; facelift)for
             the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects willing to give written informed consent to participate in the trial.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth
             control during the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active or chronic skin disease, inflammation or related conditions, such as infection,
             psoriasis and herpes zoster near or on the nasolabial folds.

          -  Patients that have undergone procedures based on active dermal response (e.g. laser
             and chemical peeling procedures), within 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Use of any facial tissue augmenting therapy or aesthetic facial surgical therapy
             within nine (9)months prior to study entry, e.g. injection or other form of
             implantation of tissue augmenting substances, Botox injections below the level of the
             eye-brows, facelift.

          -  Concomitant anticoagulant therapy, antiplatelet therapy, or a history of bleeding
             disorders.

          -  Patients who have previously experienced unanticipated adverse reactions when treated
             with hyaluronic acid based products.

          -  Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient unsuitable
             for inclusion (e.g., patients not likely to avoid other treatments, patients not
             likely to stay in the study for six months, or patients anticipated to be unreliable).

          -  Subjects with cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions in the area to be treated.

          -  Use of any investigational drugs or devices within 30 days prior to randomization.
