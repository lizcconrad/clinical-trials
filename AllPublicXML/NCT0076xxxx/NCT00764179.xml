  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonates with intra-uterine growth delay represent more than 2% of the 800 000 annual births
      in France. Studies have shown that milks enriched with protein allow to accelerate newborns
      growth. According to some papers, growth acceleration would have a favourable effect on
      psycho-motor development at age of 2 or 3. However, for other authors, this would not lead to
      any benefit and even an early hyperproteinic feeding would have bad long term consequences
      such as appearance of several diseases in the future adult (overweight, diabetes, arterial
      hypertension, renal function alteration).The main objective of this clinical trial is to
      check that an hyperproteinic feeding does not lead to any benefit on psycho-motor development
      at age of 2, compared with a milk containing same level of protein than milk proposed to
      newborns of normal weight. The secondary objectives of our clinical trial are to compare the
      effects of these two types of milk on renal function, arterial blood pressure, body
      composition, corpulence, food preferences, insulin resistance and intestinal integrity at age
      of 2. A sub study will also be realized to analyse the proteic turn over . This sub-study
      will be undertaken only with neonates of Nantes Hospital.
