      The aim of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy on an autologous CD34+ subset
      bone marrow stem cell infusion into the middle cerebral artery in patients who have suffered
      acute middle cerebral artery stroke.

    <textblock>
      The proposed trial will involve the recruitment of a total of 20 patients.

      The cells will be collected from ten subject recruited as cases, via bone marrow sampling.
      The aspirate will be centrifuged on a Ficoll density gradient to isolate mononuclear cells,
      which will be resuspended in heparinized isotonic saline for infusion into the area of the
      stroke intra-arterially using the middle cerebral artery.

      The investigators will monitor each case and control for a period of 6 months post-stem cell
      infusion. Initially, they will be subjected to a review after one month,three months and
      finally 6 months.

      Assessment of adverse events will be by physical examination and measurement of laboratory
      parameters. Assessment of efficacy will be by physical examination and the measurement of
      laboratory, CT and MRI parameters.

             onset.

          -  DWI-MRI has reliably shown relevant acute ischemic lesions

          -  Extracranial duplex/transcranial Doppler must confirm intra/extracranial arteries
             permeability.

          -  The stroke is severe (NIH Stroke Scale &gt;= 8 before procedure).

          -  An age range of 18-80 years old.

             for basal cell carcinoma.

          -  Hematological causes of stroke.

          -  Severe co-morbidity.

          -  Hepatic or renal dysfunction.

          -  The patient is female and of childbearing potential (unless it is certain that
             pregnancy is not possible) or breast feeding.

          -  Patient is likely to be unavailable for follow-up.

          -  Patient with evidence of life threatening infection of life threatening illness.

          -  Patient was already dependent in activities of daily living before the present acute
             stroke.
