    <textblock>
      There's high incidence of seborrhic dermatitis among patients suffering from Parkinson's
      disease. Seborrhic dermatitis is caused by increased exertion of sebaceous glands. Previous
      studies have shown an increase of sebum excretion rate in parkinsonian pateints. Other
      studies demonstrated improvement in seborrhic dermatitis after anticholinergic treatment.
      From these studies we concluded that there might be hyperactivity of the parasympathetic
      system among PD patients, that cause increased exertion of sebum, therefore local injection
      of botulinium toxin, which inhibitis acetyl choline realese, might improve the rash of
      seborrhic dermatitis.

      40 patients suffering from Parkinson disease or other parkinsonian disorders will participate
      in this study.

      Before treating the patients with botulinium toxin, we will measure the sebum exertion with
      the sebumeter device and make clinical evaluation of the rash. We will also take a picture of
      the rash.

      Then Botulinium toxin (60- 100 units) will be locally injected to the rash area.

      Two weeks after the injection the patients will be called and evaluated clinicly and by the
      sebumeter. Then they will be checked again after 3 weeks, after a month and after two, three
      and four month's.

      SEBUMETER SM 810- this is the device we will use to measure sebum exertion before and after
      injecting botulinium toxin. The measurement is based on grease-spot photometry. A special
      tape becomes transparent in contact with the sebum on the skin surface. For the determination
      of the sebum, the measuring head of the cassette is inserted into the aperture of the device,
      where the transparency is measured by a light source sending light through the tape which is
      reflected by a little mirror behind the tape. A photocell measures the transparency. The
      light transmission represents the sebum content on the surface of the measuring area. A
      microprocessor calculates the result, which is shown on the display in µg sebum/cm² of the
      skin.
