  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the amount of buprenorphine found in the blood after taking
      sublingual buprenorphine tablets versus after implantation with 4 Probuphine (buprenorphine
      implants).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study intended to evaluate the relative bioavailability of 4 Probuphine
      implants versus 16mg QD sublingual buprenorphine, as determined by plasma BPN AUC(0-24),
      during 24 hours at steady state. This study will also provide open-label safety and
      tolerability data in patients treated with Probuphine.

             contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

          -  Received treatment for opioid dependence (e.g., methadone, BPN) within the previous 90
             days
