      To learn whether or not an Interferon defect in cell signaling, recently discovered in immune
      cells from melanoma patients as well as breast cancer patients, is common to all cancers.

      BACKGROUND

      We have previously demonstrated that tumor-specific T cells could be identified in &gt;50% of
      patients with metastatic melanoma and these cells appeared to be rendered anergic in vivo
      [Nature Medicine 5:677, 1999]. Recently we discovered that there is a signaling defect in the
      Interferon (IFN) pathway in immune cells from melanoma patients [PLOS Medicine 4:897 2007].
      Interestingly, preliminary studies are showing the same defect in immune cells from breast
      cancer patients (unpublished). We would like to expand our research to all types of cancer to
      determine whether these phenomena occur in different cancer types.

      OBJECTIVES

      Our primary objective is to determine whether there is an IFN signaling defect in different
      types of cancers and to determine what is causing this defect.

      The second objective is to determine whether these PBMCs are rendered anergic.

      INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN

      The study population will consist of patients who have been diagnosed with cancer, regardless
      of sex or ethnicity. Blood will be collected during the subjects regularly scheduled
      laboratory appointment and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated for
      research purposes. These PBMCs will undergo studies, i.e. phosflow, qPCR, proliferation,
      survival, etc., to determine immune responses for T cells (CD4 and CD8), B cells (CD19),
      natural killer cells (CD16), and possibly monocytes (CD14).
