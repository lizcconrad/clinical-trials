  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ranibizumab
      given via subconjunctival injection in patients undergoing corneal transplantation.

  <detailed_description>

      As a secondary objective, this study also aims to establish the corneal and anterior chamber
      concentration of ranibizumab when delivered subconjunctivally at the limbus in patients
      undergoing corneal transplantation. The effects of ranibizumab on corneal epithelial healing
      will be examined following adjunctive use in corneal transplantation. Finally, clinical
      characteristics including recurrent corneal neovascularization will be studied.
