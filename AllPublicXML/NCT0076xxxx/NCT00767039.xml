  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approval of surfactant by the FDA in 1989 for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome
      (RDS) in premature infants greatly improved survival rates. Newer surfactants approved by the
      FDA were more concentrated and had a more rapid onset of action. The overall efficacy of
      newer surfactants appeared similar until in 2004, Ramanathan and colleagues suggested that a
      double dose of Curosurf improved survival in infants 25-32 weeks gestational age, compared to
      infants treated with Survanta, the most commonly used surfactant preparation in the United
      States. While the data was suggestive, it was not clear that the improvement in survival was
      reproducible or that Curosurf was responsible for the improved survival rates.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Curosurf in improving lung function
      and survival rates and reducing the complications of prematurity in very premature infants &lt;
      30 weeks gestational age at birth.

      Specific Aims:

        -  To determine whether there is a sustained difference in the level of respiratory support
           during the first 3 days of life in extremely premature infants treated with Curosurf
           versus Survanta

        -  To determine whether Curosurf is associated with a higher incidence of hemodynamically
           significant PDA, compared with Survanta

        -  To determine whether there is a difference in the cerebral blood flow response to
           Curosurf versus Survanta

        -  To determine whether there is a difference in morbidity in very premature infants
           treated with Curosurf versus Survanta

      We reasoned that if Curosurf was primarily responsible for improved survival rates, compared
      with Survanta, then there should be a sustained improvement in respiratory function in the
      first three days of life, when the direct pulmonary effects of the surfactant preparations
      would be most easily detected. It was also possible that Curosurf and Survanta could have
      effects on other systems that could secondarily affect long-term survival of the infant.
      These other organ systems would include, but not be limited to, the development of a
      hemodynamically significant Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Intraventricular Hemorrhage or
      Periventricular Leukomalacia, or Necrotizing Enterocolitis. We propose to examine how
      surfactant administration affected the hemodynamic precursors of these common morbidities of
      very premature infants.

    <description>Mean Airway Pressure delivered by mechanical ventilator or nasal CPAP (cm H20) at 48 hours following surfactant administration. A volume cycle ventilator strategy that allowed airway pressure to vary with changes in lung and chest wall compliance was used for mechanically ventilated infants, while inspired oxygen concentration was controlled by the clinical team.</description>

    <description>Mean Airway Pressure x Percent Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FIO2) at 48 hours after surfactant administration, delivered by mechanical ventilator or nasal CPAP assesses the components of respiratory support primarily affecting blood oxygenation. This index combines these parameters so that a systematic difference in clinical management of mean airway pressure or FIO2 between groups is not mistaken for a drug effect.</description>

    <description>Hemodynamically significant PDA, considered significant by the clinical team and having at least 2 objective echocardiographic signs (PDA &gt; 1.5 mm diameter, retrograde diastolic flow in the descending aorta, and left atrial enlargement) were tallied. Hemodynamically significant PDA may increase lung water and decrease lung compliance, requiring increased mechanical ventilator support.</description>

    <time_frame>First hour after 2nd surfactant dose</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal changes in blood flow were assessed using Doppler echocardiography following the second surfactant dose of Survanta (beractant) or Curosurf (poractant alfa), to determine whether there was a direct effect of surfactant type on PDA size or pulmonary volume overload through the PDA. The hour interval following the second surfactant dose was selected for study, when the subjects were otherwise clinically stable, not needing additional stabilization procedures.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anterior Cerebral Artery Blood Flow Velocity Following Second Dose of Surfactant</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour following second surfactant dose at 12-24 hours after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in Anterior Cerebral Artery blood flow velocity following the second dose of beractant, reflects the change in brain blood flow associated with surfactant administration. Blood flow velocity is measured by range gated Doppler ultrasound and brain blood flow changes in proportion to changes in arterial carbon dioxide levels, induced by surfactant administration. Variability in brain blood flow is associated with increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhage.</description>

    <description>Patients with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), had chronic lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen support at &gt;/= 36 weeks post menstrual age, were tallied. BPD is a chronic lung disease that develops, at least in part, as a consequence of NICU respiratory management of premature infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome.</description>

        <description>Percent change in Anterior Cerebral Artery blood flow velocity following the second dose of beractant, reflects the change in brain blood flow associated with surfactant administration. Blood flow velocity is measured by range gated Doppler ultrasound and brain blood flow changes in proportion to changes in arterial carbon dioxide levels, induced by surfactant administration. Variability in brain blood flow is associated with increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhage.</description>

          <description>Percent change in Anterior Cerebral Artery blood flow velocity following the second dose of beractant, reflects the change in brain blood flow associated with surfactant administration. Blood flow velocity is measured by range gated Doppler ultrasound and brain blood flow changes in proportion to changes in arterial carbon dioxide levels, induced by surfactant administration. Variability in brain blood flow is associated with increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhage.</description>
