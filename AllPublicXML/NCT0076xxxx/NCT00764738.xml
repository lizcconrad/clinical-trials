  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual outcomes using monthly ranibizumab therapy are well established in clinical trials,
      but the best way to assess when and how to treat patients with PRN therapy has not been
      proven. Information is lacking on Multi-focal ERG and microperimetry outcomes with
      ranibizumab therapy. Additionally, VA and OCT outcomes don't always correlate and other
      assessments such as the Multi-focal ERG and microperimetry may be useful as early predictors
      of when patients should be retreated. This study will assess 2 groups (monthly and PRN
      therapy) and assess high resolution OCT, microperimetry, and Multi-focal ERG outcomes. For
      the PRN group retreatment will be based on OCT criteria. We will investigate if
      microperimetry or multifocal ERG would have been an early predictor of fluid recurrence.

    <description>OCT performed monthly. Fluorescein Angiography performed at baseline, month 3, month 5, month 8 and month 12.
Microperimetry performed at baseline, month 3, month 5, month 8, and month 12 for monthly ranibizumab and at baseline, month 3, month 5 through month 12 for as needed ranibizumab.
Multifocal ERG done at the same monthly visits as the microperimetry.</description>
