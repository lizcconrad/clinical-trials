  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the MEL 80 Excimer Laser is effective in
      the treatment of mixed astigmatism up to 6.0 D, when used as part of the Laser In Situ
      Keratomileusis (LASIK) procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LASIK has become one of the most common refractive eye procedures performed in the country.
      In the mixed astigmatism procedure, a combination of both a steepening (hyperopic treatment)
      and a flattening (myopic treatment) occur on the corneal surface. The surgeon will produce a
      standard keratomileusis flap using a microkeratome, exposing the corneal stroma. Recontouring
      under the flap is then accomplished by the removal of tissue from the stroma with the laser.
      This recontouring results in an altering of effective lens power of the central cornea,
      measured in diopters (D). The MEL 80 Excimer Laser System will be evaluated for its ability
      to create accurate and stable mixed astigmatic refractive correction results.
