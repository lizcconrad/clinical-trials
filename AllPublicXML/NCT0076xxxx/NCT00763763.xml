    <textblock>
      Patients not previously exposed to imatinib and with resistant or refractory Ph+ ALL,
      lymphoid blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukaemia (LBC CML) or with de novo Ph+ ALL and
      aged over 55y were eligible in the study. The DIV regimen consisted in one IV injection of
      vincristine 2 mg combined with 2 days of dexamethasone 40 mg PO repeated weekly for 4 weeks
      as induction and then monthly for 4 months as consolidation. Imatinib was administered at 800
      mg per day during the induction period and at 600 mg/d continuously during consolidation.
      Patients in CR not eligible for HSCT were allocated to maintenance therapy consisting in
      weekly SC injection of Pegasys 45 µg and continuous administration of imatinib 400 mg per day
      for 2 years.

    <textblock>
      Gleevec™ is now considered as the gold standard treatment in chronic phase chronic myeloid
      leukemia (CML), for patients who are not candidate for an allogenic bone marrow
      transplantation. However, in advanced phase CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), development of resistance to imatinib has become the
      central issue concerning the use of imatinib as a monotherapeutic agent. The response rate
      (complete hematological remission) at the dose of 600 mg/d in poor prognosis lymphoid blast
      phase CML and Ph+ ALL was about 20% and median time to disease progression was only 2.2
      months. In VITRO studies have addressed the question of combined therapy with imatinib. A
      synergistic or additive activity has been demonstrated with vincristine and dexamethasone,
      two major drugs for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). On going clinical
      studies are also testing Gleevec™ in association with daunorubicin and cytarabine (standard
      dose) in CML in myeloid blast phase (CST571AFR01) or with MITHOXANTROME and cytarabine
      (intermediate dose) as a consolidation regiment in Ph+ ALL in first CR (CSTI571AFR03). The
      safety of the combined therapy was excellent in the two studies. Therefore, we propose to
      initiate a study to assess the efficacy and the safety of Gleevec™ combined with vincristine
      and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive
      acute lymphoblastic leukemias
