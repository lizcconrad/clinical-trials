  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a poor prognosis if not caught early enough. One of
      the factors that may impact the ability to control NSCLC is low oxygen levels (hypoxia)
      inside the tumour. This study will use 18F-FAZA PET scans to assess whether patients have
      hypoxic tumours and to monitor the changes to the hypoxic areas of a tumour during currently
      available standard treatment. It is hypothesized that 18F-FAZA PET may predict response to
      treatment, local control, and/or survival in NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced NSCLC has a poor prognosis with a 5 year overall survival rate of only 15%.
      Tumour hypoxia may impact the ability to control NSCLC. Using 18F-FAZA PET, this study will
      assess patients for hypoxic treatment. With this information, we can start individualizing
      patient treatment to target hypoxia. The relationship between areas of hypoxia (18F-FAZA) and
      high glucose utilization (18F-FDG) will also be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically-proven, by biopsy or cytology, unresected lung cancer of
             the following histological types: squamous cell carcinoma; adenocarcinoma;
             undifferentiated large cell carcinoma, and non-small cell, not otherwise specified
             (NOS, diagnosis on cytology alone)

          2. Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage I, II, IIIA, or IIIB
             with detectable tumour that can be encompassed by radiation therapy fields, including
             both primary tumour and the involved regional lymph nodes.

          3. Patients must be deemed to be suitable to undergo definitive (i.e. potentially
             curable) chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy by the treating Physician.

          4. The prescribed radiotherapy dose must be a minimum of 60 Gy in 30 fractions

          5. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age. If female of child bearing potential and outside the
             window of 10 days since the first day of the last menstrual period, a negative
             pregnancy test is required.

             surgery did not proceed are eligible for this trial)

          4. No distant or metastasis, prior chemotherapy, or thoracic neck or radiotherapy

          5. Evidence of any small cell histology
