  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will provide novel information concerning the ability of exercise to enhance the
      capacity for oxidative metabolism of fatty acids and improve insulin resistance in older
      adults who are at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes. Ultimately this may help
      identify mechanisms and therapeutic targets implicated in skeletal muscle metabolic
      dysregulation. The proposed study is to conduct a randomized controlled exercise training
      intervention trial in older men and women. In addition, the response to exercise in these
      subjects will be compared to those of highly endurance-trained, age-matched athletes.

      Hypothesis and Specific Aims:

        1. To determine whether aerobic exercise improves both skeletal muscle fat distribution and
           insulin sensitivity of older men and women. We will test two hypotheses.

           i. Physical exercise in older adults will decrease the amount of fat interspersed within
           muscle, specifically the fat between muscle groups (intermuscular adipose tissue) as
           well as decrease specific lipid metabolites within muscle cells, compared to controls.

           ii. Exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity of older men and women will be
           related to the changes in muscle fat content independent of changes in total body fat or
           visceral abdominal adipose tissue.

        2. To determine whether increased capacity for oxidative fatty acid metabolism within
           muscle results in improved insulin sensitivity in older adults. We will test two
           hypotheses.

           i. Exercise training will increase the capacity of muscle to oxidize fatty acids
           assessed both in vitro and in vivo.

           ii. Improved capacity for oxidative fatty acid metabolism will predict improvements in
           insulin sensitivity.
