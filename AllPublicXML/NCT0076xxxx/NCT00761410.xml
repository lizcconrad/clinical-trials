  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the P.F.C. Sigma RPF knee accommodates functional
      stability with a post-operative passive range of motion of greater than 125° of flexion and
      to demonstrate that the range of motion does not compromise the longevity of the implant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary endpoint is to demonstrate that 90% of patients have a functionally stable knee that
      can achieve post operative range of motion of 125 degrees or greater.

      The secondary endpoint is to investigate the survivorship of the P.F.C. Sigma RP-F knee at 1,
      2, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years
