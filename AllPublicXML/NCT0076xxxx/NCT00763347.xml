    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of SYR-619, once daily
      (QD), in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic control with
      diet and exercise, or by taking metformin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with
      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% is type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected, placing an ever
      increasing burden on families and the health care system.

      SYR-619 is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is
      thought to be primarily responsible for the in vivo degradation of 2 peptide hormones
      released in response to nutrient ingestion, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the dose-response efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      treatment with SYR-619 in subjects with type 2 diabetes who do not previously achieve
      adequate glycemic control with lifestyle modification (diet/exercise) or metformin or
      sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic monotherapy.

      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 14 Weeks. Multiple
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine
      collection, vital signs including sitting and standing blood pressure and pulse, body height
      and weight, physical examinations, electrocardiogram.

             over-the-counter medications is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;160 mm Hg and diastolic pressure &lt;100 mm Hg.

             subject has normal thyroid function (clinically euthyroid)

          -  A female subject of childbearing potential who is sexually active must agree to use
             adequate contraception, and must be neither pregnant nor lactating from Screening and
             throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Able and willing to monitor their own blood glucose concentrations with a home glucose
             monitor.

          -  No major illness or debility that in the investigator's opinion prohibits the subject
             from completing the study.

          -  Currently treated subjects who are stable at Class I or II are candidates for the
             study.

          -  History of coronary angioplasty, coronary stent placement, coronary bypass surgery, or
             myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  The subject is required to take or intends to continue taking any disallowed

               -  Treatment with antidiabetic agents other than study drug or metformin or
                  sulfonylurea is not allowed within the 3 months prior to Screening and through

               -  Treatment with weight-loss drugs, any investigational antidiabetic drugs, or oral
                  or systemically injected glucocorticoids is not allowed from 3 months prior to

                  procedures.

          -  Receipt of any investigational drug within the 30 days prior to Screening or a history
