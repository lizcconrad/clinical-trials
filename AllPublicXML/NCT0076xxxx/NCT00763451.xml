  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in
      comparison to placebo, as an add-on treatment to metformin, over a period of 24 weeks of
      treatment, followed by an extension.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to metformin on
      glycemic control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction when it is used in two
      steps dose titration regimen at Week 24.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to metformin on
      glycemic control in comparison to placebo in terms of HbA1c reduction when it is used in a
      one-step dose titration regimen, the percentage of patients with HbA1c less than 7 percent or
      less than or equal to 6.5%, body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG); to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-lixisenatide antibody development.

      Patients who complete the 24-week main double-blind treatment would undergo a variable
      double-blind extension treatment, which ends for all patients at approximately the scheduled
      date of Week 76 visit (Visit 25) for the last randomized patients.

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change = HbA1c value at Week 24 minus HbA1c value at baseline. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is time from the first dose of study drug and up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug, on or before Visit 12 (Week 24) or Day 169 if Visit 12 is not available, and before the introduction of rescue therapy. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.

    <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 75 centers in 15 countries between September 29, 2008 and January 27, 2011. The overall duration of treatment was at least 76 weeks (24 weeks main double-blind treatment; variable double-blind extension treatment).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 884 patients were screened of which 400 (45.2%) were screen failures; main reason for screen failure was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values being out of the defined protocol range (greater than or equal to 7 percent [%] and less than or equal to 10%). A total of 484 patients were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose level below 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>
