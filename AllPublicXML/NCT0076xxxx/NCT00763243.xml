      This study is an investigation of the effect of a computer-based working memory training
      program on memory and language processing in at-risk children (e.g., those with working
      memory weaknesses) who have received cochlear implants.

    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research program is to improve speech-language outcomes in
      prelingually deaf children who receive CIs. The objective of this proposal is to investigate
      the short-term effects of a novel working memory training program on memory, learning, and
      speech-language outcomes in children with CIs. The specific hypothesis of this project is
      that completion of a behaviorally-based training program designed to increase working memory
      capacity will improve attention, working memory span, and working memory-related
      speech-language processing in a group of deaf children with CIs. This hypothesis is based on
      past research demonstrating the efficacy of working memory training programs in improving
      attention and working memory in children with attention deficits, as well as on past research
      showing an association between working memory and speech-language outcomes in children with
      CIs. Knowledge about the effects of working memory training on CI speech-language outcomes
      will provide a better understanding of the process by which children with CIs learn
      speech-language following implantation and may offer an entirely new avenue of intervention
      to improve speech-language outcomes, particularly in deaf children who show limited
      improvement following implantation.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and application of a novel, computer-based
           working memory training program when applied to children with CIs. We hypothesize that
           children with CIs will show a progression of learning in both auditory and visual
           working memory during the training program that will mirror that of normal-hearing
           children.

        2. Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of the working memory training program on core
           attention, concentration, and working memory processes of children with CIs. We
           hypothesize that children with CIs will show improvement on both laboratory-based and
           parent-report measures of attention, concentration, and working memory processes after
           working memory training, compared to a baseline period.

        3. Specific Aim 3: Determine the effect of the working memory training program on working
           memory-related speech-language outcome measures in children with CIs. We hypothesize
           that children with CIs will show improvement on auditory working memory, verbal naming
           fluency, and word repetition after training.

    <measure>Digit Span Total Raw Score (Construct Measured: Verbal Short-Term/Working Memory)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at Screening Visit, Pretraining Visit (2-5 weeks later), Posttraining Visit (5 weeks after Pretraining Visit), 1 month follow-up visit (1 month after Posttraining Visit), and 6 month follow-up visit (6 months after Posttraining Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of digit span forward and digit span backward based on the WISC-III Digit span subtest. Subjects are presented with sequences of single digits, starting with 2 digits, which increase by 1 digit after 2 sequences are presented at each digit length. The test is discontinued when 2 items are missed at the same digit length. Raw score is the number of items (digit sequences) answered correctly. Subjects must recall all digits either in forward (digit span forward) or backward (digit span backward) order. The Digit Span test is a measure of verbal short-term/working memory. Scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating better verbal short-term/working memory.</description>

    <measure>Spatial Span Total Raw Score (Construct Measured: Visuospatial Short-Term/Working Memory)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at Screening Visit, Pretraining Visit (2-5 weeks later), Posttraining Visit (5 weeks after Pretraining Visit), 1 month follow-up visit (1 month after Posttraining Visit), and 6 month follow-up visit (6 months after Posttraining Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of memory for sequential spatial locations (forward and backward), based on the subject touching one of 10 blocks in the same sequence (forward) or in the reverse sequence (backward) that they were touched by the examiner. This subtest is based on the WISC-IV-Integrated Spatial Span subtest. The examiner points to blocks on a board, sequentially, starting with a sequence of two blocks (locations), which increase by 1 block (location) after 2 sequences are presented at each span length. The test is discontinued when 2 items are missed at the same spatial span length. Raw score is the number of items (complete sequences) answered correctly. The Spatial Span test is a measure of visuospatial short-term/working memory. Scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating better visuospatial short-term/working memory.</description>

    <measure>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) - Working Memory Subscale Raw Score (Construct Measured: Behavioral Attention-Concentration and Working Memory)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at Screening Visit, Pretraining Visit (2-5 weeks later), Posttraining Visit (5 weeks after Pretraining Visit), 1 month follow-up visit (1 month after Posttraining Visit), and 6 month follow-up visit (6 months after Posttraining Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF is a parent-report questionnaire of executive functioning behaviors in children. For each item, parents rate whether the child engages in the behavior &quot;never&quot; (=1), &quot;sometimes&quot; (=2), or &quot;often&quot; (=3). Raw scores for subscales are sums of item scores. The Working Memory subscale consists of 10 items asking about attention, concentration, and active controlled memory. Working Memory subscale raw scores are measures of attention, concentration, and working memory, and range from 10 to 30. Higher raw scores indicate more problems with attention, concentration, and working memory.</description>

    <description>The Cogmed Working Memory Training program is a 5-week program of computer-based exercises that require the user to complete tasks involving verbal, visual, or combined verbal-visual memory skills. In addition to memory skills, Cogmed tasks demand attention, concentration, and reasoning skills. Users are expected to practice Cogmed exercises at home for 40 minutes/day, 5 days/week, during the 5-week training period. The program uses an adaptive algorithm that presents users with problems of increasing difficulty at a level slightly higher than that at which they have recently achieved success.</description>

        <title>Digit Span Total Raw Score (Construct Measured: Verbal Short-Term/Working Memory)</title>
        <description>This is a measure of digit span forward and digit span backward based on the WISC-III Digit span subtest. Subjects are presented with sequences of single digits, starting with 2 digits, which increase by 1 digit after 2 sequences are presented at each digit length. The test is discontinued when 2 items are missed at the same digit length. Raw score is the number of items (digit sequences) answered correctly. Subjects must recall all digits either in forward (digit span forward) or backward (digit span backward) order. The Digit Span test is a measure of verbal short-term/working memory. Scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating better verbal short-term/working memory.</description>

Cogmed Working Memory Training Program : The Cogmed Working Memory Training program is a 5-week program of computer-based exercises that require the user to complete tasks involving verbal, visual, or combined verbal-visual memory skills. In addition to memory skills, Cogmed tasks demand attention, concentration, and reasoning skills. Users are expected to practice Cogmed exercises at home for 40 minutes/day, 5 days/week, during the 5-week training period. The program uses an adaptive algorithm that presents users with problems of increasing difficulty at a level slightly higher than that at which they have recently achieved success.</description>

        <description>This is a measure of memory for sequential spatial locations (forward and backward), based on the subject touching one of 10 blocks in the same sequence (forward) or in the reverse sequence (backward) that they were touched by the examiner. This subtest is based on the WISC-IV-Integrated Spatial Span subtest. The examiner points to blocks on a board, sequentially, starting with a sequence of two blocks (locations), which increase by 1 block (location) after 2 sequences are presented at each span length. The test is discontinued when 2 items are missed at the same spatial span length. Raw score is the number of items (complete sequences) answered correctly. The Spatial Span test is a measure of visuospatial short-term/working memory. Scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating better visuospatial short-term/working memory.</description>

        <title>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) - Working Memory Subscale Raw Score (Construct Measured: Behavioral Attention-Concentration and Working Memory)</title>
        <description>The BRIEF is a parent-report questionnaire of executive functioning behaviors in children. For each item, parents rate whether the child engages in the behavior &quot;never&quot; (=1), &quot;sometimes&quot; (=2), or &quot;often&quot; (=3). Raw scores for subscales are sums of item scores. The Working Memory subscale consists of 10 items asking about attention, concentration, and active controlled memory. Working Memory subscale raw scores are measures of attention, concentration, and working memory, and range from 10 to 30. Higher raw scores indicate more problems with attention, concentration, and working memory.</description>

Cogmed Working Memory Training Program : The Cogmed Working Memory Training program is a 5-week program of computer-based exercises that require the user to complete tasks involving verbal, visual, or combined verbal-visual memory skills. In addition to memory skills, Cogmed tasks demand attention, concentration, and reasoning skills. Users are expected to practice Cogmed exercises at home for 40 minutes/day, 5 days/week, during the 5-week training period. The program uses an adaptive algorithm that presents users with problems of increasing difficulty at a level slightly higher than that at which they have recently achieved success.</description>
