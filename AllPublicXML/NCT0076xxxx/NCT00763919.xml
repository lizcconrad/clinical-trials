      In this study, patients with bipolar disorder who do not take their medications as prescribed
      will receive specialized education and therapy treatment to determine whether the specialized
      treatment is effective in helping patients to take their medications consistently.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a chronic disorder characterized by manic and depressive episodes
      that disrupt healthy, functional lives. Despite recent advances in medication treatments,
      many BPD patients do not take their medications. Medication nonadherence is associated with
      multiple risks, such as relapse, rehospitalization, lengthier hospital stays, and, in some
      cases, increased risk of suicide. Some studies have shown that treatment adherence in BPD can
      be improved, particularly through psychological education, development of self-management
      strategies or behaviors, and ongoing relapse prevention.

      This study will examine the effectiveness of medication adherence treatment modules
      specialized to deal with specific reasons for nonadherence. Participants, all of whom have a
      history of medication nonadherence, will undergo structured interviews and complete
      self-report questionnaires to determine individual reasons for nonadherence. Based on their
      individual profiles, participants will be assigned to one or more of the following
      intervention modules:

        1. Psychoeducation: This module uses education about BPD and related treatment to address
           patient issues such as opposition to preventive efforts, denial of the need for or
           effectiveness of medication, negative attitudes toward drugs in general, lack of
           information about mood stabilizers, and stigma or embarrassment related to BPD
           treatment.

        2. Substance abuse: This module targets substance abuse problems that interfere with
           medication adherence.

        3. Communication with providers: This module addresses fear of medication side effects by
           improving communication with health care providers.

        4. Medication routines management: This module addresses difficulties establishing a
           medication routine and outside opposition to medications by developing strategies for
           consistent medication adherence routines.

      Each module will involve four 60-minute sessions conducted in a 4- to 6-week period. The
      study therapist will conduct each of these sessions individually with the participant,
      combining or coadministering modules in a single session if participants are assigned to more
      than one module. Depending on which module or modules participants are assigned to, they may
      also be contacted by phone one to three times by the therapist to complete all module
      materials.

      This study will be conducted in two phases. In the first, an initial group of participants
      will undergo the module treatments and then participants and therapists will be interviewed
      about the effectiveness and feasibility of the interventions. This feedback will be used to
      refine the modules. In the second phase, a second group of participants will undergo
      treatment in the refined modules and provide more feedback. All participants will continue
      with their regular treatment while undergoing module treatments.

      Participation in this study will last 4 to 6 weeks, with follow-up interviews and assessments
      ending 6 months after completion of the intervention. In all, there will be five assessments,
      completed at an initial screening visit, just before treatment, just after treatment, and 3
      and 6 months after the completion of treatment. The initial assessments will last 60 to 90
      minutes and involve questionnaires and a structured interview. The other four assessments
      will last 45 to 60 minutes. Treatment adherence, attitudes toward medications, BPD symptoms,
      and overall functioning will be measured at each assessment. The number of pills used in each
      participant's prescription bottles will also be counted as a measure of medication adherence.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BPD) Type I or Type II, as determined by a
             standardized diagnostic interview, the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview
             (MINI)

          -  Demonstrated history of poor medication adherence, as determined by self-report or
             clinician report. In this study, self-reported treatment nonadherence will be
             identified with the Tablet Routines Questionnaire (TRQ). Poorly adherent individuals
             will be defined as those who miss 30% or more of medication within either the past
             week or past month (those missing 30% or more within past week will be considered to
             be nonadherent over the past month). Clinician-assessed nonadherence will be
             identified via a clinician version of the TRQ to identify nonadherence of 30% or more
             over the past 30 days.

          -  BPD of at least 2 years' duration

          -  Treatment with medication to stabilize mood for at least 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable/unwilling to participate in psychiatric interviews, as based on the clinical
             opinion of the investigator or the treating clinician

          -  High risk of suicide, as seen in factors such as active suicidal ideation, recent
             suicide attempt, or current intent or plan

          -  Inability to speak English

          -  Individuals who have participated in Project 1, Personal Adherence Evaluation of
             Individuals Receiving Treatment for Bipolar Disorder (PAE in BD)
