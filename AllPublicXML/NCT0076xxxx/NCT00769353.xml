      This research will examine the impact of brain activity, cognitive processing immune
      functioning, and gastrointestinal functioning on depressive symptoms and response to a
      psychotherapeutic intervention in youths with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

      Depression is costly, worsens morbidity and mortality, and has detrimental effects on disease
      course in physically ill populations. This research takes a novel multi-dimensional approach
      to assess the neurobiological basis of depression in chronic pediatric physical illness using
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as a model. It also evaluates the efficacy of a modified
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on emotional well-being, physical health, economic costs,
      and neurobiological outcomes. These results will provide key building blocks for a paradigm
      shift within medicine by integrating behavioral health into the comprehensive medical care of
      physical illnesses.

      Little is known about how the brain and body interact to increase depressive vulnerability,
      particularly in youth. Adult studies identify disruptions in limbic and prefrontal brain
      activity in the pathophysiology of depression. Cytokines secondary to inflammation and
      exogenous treatment with steroids can cause mood and cognitive changes in these same brain
      regions. It is important to understand the neuropsychiatric effects of IBD and its treatment
      on underlying brain structures during adolescence, a critical developmental period for brain
      maturation underlying emotional regulation and cognitive processing. More importantly,
      neuronal plasticity during adolescence may still allow reversibility of disease-related brain
      effects through teaching coping strategies for life-long illness management that could change
      developmental trajectories and reduce vulnerability in adulthood.

      Using translational neuroscience approaches, this research will examine: 1) brain regions
      that underlie emotional and cognitive processing in youth with active IBD and depression
      using brain functional magnetic resonance imaging compared to youth with IBD and no
      depression, and normal controls; 2) the inter-relationship between depressive symptoms in IBD
      and brain, immune, and gastrointestinal functioning; and 3) efficacy of a combined
      CBT-physical illness narrative intervention targeting emotional and cognitive processing
      compared to supportive non-directive therapy in the depressed IBD cohort with longitudinal
      tracking of emotional, physical health, economic, and neurobiological outcomes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for youths with IBD for Step 1 of Screening Process:

          -  Age 12 to 17 inclusive

          -  English-speaking

          -  Capable of completing CDI

          -  Meeting diagnostic criteria for IBD

          -  Absence of mental retardation by history

          -  Having at least one appointment at the GI clinic.

        Criteria for Classification of IBD:

          1. Presence of appropriate history: abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, bloody diarrhea
             (with or without extraintestinal symptoms) or, less commonly, a) primary
             extraintestinal symptoms, b) growth retardation, c) perirectal abscess, or d) acute
             abdomen.

        Physically Healthy Comparison Children

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 12 to 17 inclusive

          -  English-speaking

          -  Capable of completing CDI

          -  Absence of mental retardation by history

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  self-report of a cold, flu or other infection within the past two weeks

          -  self-reported use of any antibiotics within the past 2 weeks

          -  score of 6 or more on the blood draw screening questionnaire

        Screening process for youths with IBD: Participants will be recruited from the clinic
        through a 2-step screening of all consecutive pediatric patients seen in the IBD clinic or
        while medically hospitalized for an IBD flare-up at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, who
        have confirmed IBD and who meet the other eligibility criteria as determined by medical
        staff in IBD clinic (Tables 5 and 6). The medical diagnosis of IBD will be determined by a
        GI physician using criteria below and will be confirmed in the medical record. Step 1:
        administration of the CDI and CDI-P during the medical visit. Those subjects whose CDI
        and/or CDI-P score of &gt; 10 will be invited by phone to participate in Step 2: a face to
        face interview. Step 2 assessment will be conducted within one week of Step 1 so that both
        CDI score and IBD severity ratings are still valid from the Step 1 screen.

        All subjects meeting eligibility criteria for Step 2 will be invited to participate in the
        completion of neuropsychiatric questionnaires, blood draw, pupil measurements, and brain
        functional magnetic resonance imaging.

        All subjects meeting eligibility criteria after Step 2 will be invited to participate in
        the treatment phase of the study.

        Normal controls (N=15) will be recruited from the Department of Pediatrics during
        outpatient clinical office visits.
