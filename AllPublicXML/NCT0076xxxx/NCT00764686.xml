  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS) is a chronic, inflammatory, rheumatic disease (Khan, 2002). AS is
      associated with increased work disability and use of healthcare resources (Ward et al, 2008).
      Evidence suggests that group exercise is the most effective form of physiotherapy management
      for individuals with Ankylosing Spondylitis (Dagfinrud et al, 2008). To date, no research has
      been published in relation to short, intensive group exercise programmes.

      This study aims to investigate the effects of a five day exercise and education programme for
      individuals with Ankylosing Spondylitis. Effects of the programme on disease activity,
      function and spinal mobility will be measured using using validated quantitative measures;
      the overall value of the programme for patients will be explored by means of semi-structured
      interviews.

      Patients with a diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis are referred to the 5-day exercise and
      education programme by consultant rheumatologists at the Mater Misericordiae University
      Hospital. All patients referred to the programmes beginning 06/24/2008 and 08/25/2008 will be
      invited to participate.

      Participants scoring 0-6 on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index are classified as
      low disease severity level and are allocated to Group 1; participants with a score of 6.1-10
      are classified as higher disease severity and allocated to Group 2. Group 1 has two
      hydrotherapy classes, a gym-based exercise class and an education session daily. Group 2 has
      one hydrotherapy class, a gym-based exercise class and an education session daily. Exercise
      sessions are 1 hour in duration and are given by staff physiotherapists. Education sessions
      are 1 hour in duration and are given by senior members of the rheumatology multi-disciplinary
      team at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital.

      Outcome will be assessed upon entry to the study (pre-intervention), at 5 days
      (post-intervention) and at 4 weeks (follow-up). A semi structured interview will be carried
      out with each participant immediately post-intervention to explore the overall value of the
      group programme for participants.
