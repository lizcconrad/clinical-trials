    <textblock>
      Hyperthermia - a warming of the tumor at 42-43 ° C - in combination with radiation and / or
      chemotherapy is a proven method of treatment for malignant tumors. The amplification of the
      effect of radiotherapy and various chemotherapeutic agents (platinum analogues, nitrogen-Lost
      derivatives, cytotoxic antibiotics) is experimentally demonstrated. Randomized clinical
      trials have shown a better chance of survival and better local tumor control without
      increasing the toxicity of combined treatment especially also in children's tumors. The
      combination of hyperthermia and radiation therapy is more effective than radiotherapy alone.
      Hyperthermal temperatures increase blood circulation in tumors as a response to stimulation
      with heat. Tumor tissue, having a minor circulation and being acidotic, is resistant to
      radiotherapy, but sensitive to hyperthermia, while tumor with a high blood flow is
      sensitivity to radiation. This positive interaction is a compelling reason for the
      combination of hyperthermia and ionized radiation.

      Hyperthermia, in combination with chemotherapy, increases the concentration of cytostatics in
      the tumor region, raising blood flow caused by warmth. In addition, hyperthermia increases
      toxicity of drugs in cells, being normally resistant to many drugs. Hyperthermia can
      synergistically be combined with chemotherapy treating &quot;high risk&quot; - tumors with curative
      intention.

      In addition to the clinical use of surface hyperthermia (BSD 500 - O), with appropriate
      treatment of tumors up to 3 cm deep from the surface of the body with established indications
      and palliative indication in advanced stages of cancer, a prospective, randomized study with
      quality-controlled thermometry shall establish the optimal sequence of Hyperthermia in
      combination with irradiation. Therefore the treatment sequence of once per weeks is compared
      to a sequence of three times per week.
