  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There were evidences that the non-immune mediated inflammatory pathways of cell damage
      occurred in vitro in human islets upon hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Autologous
      stem cell therapies were an emerging set of therapies that showed promise with a low side
      effect profile. we hypothesized that infusion of mononuclear cells from buffy coat obtained
      from bone marrow might provide multiple signals for regeneration and inflammation-induced
      lesion recovery of local tissues, of which the effect might be maximized by intra-arterial
      pancreatic infusion through angiography and combination with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

      This trail includes a foregoing sub-trial that investigate the feasibility and safety of a
      novel method for massive bone marrow collection. The traditional BM collecting procedure is
      unfavorable because it yields minor bone marrow. Studies have shown that physiological
      exercise can increase bone marrow blood flow, which might facilitate BM collection.

      We plan to include a total of 60 patients with type 2 diabetes and randomly assign them to
      either a control group or an exercise group (n =30 each). The patients in the exercise group
      exercised 30 minutes before the operation. All patients underwent routine surgical care. The
      collected BM volume, operation time, collecting speed , puncture times and pain scores during
      the operation were recorded. Bone marrow samples were tested for CD34+ flow cytometry and
      whole blood cell count.
