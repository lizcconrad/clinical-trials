  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common postoperative complications after coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG). Postoperative AF produces a substantial impact on hospital
      resources with an estimated annual expenditure of over $1 billion. This includes the cost of
      pharmacological treatment and the cost of the increased length of stay. The incidence of AF
      is about 30-40% in CABG patients and increases with age of the patient. As the average age of
      the patient that undergoes CABG surgery is increasing, it is critical to find a way to
      prevent or reduce the incidence of this complication.

      We propose a prospective, randomized, controlled study to determine the role of pulmonary
      vein isolation by bipolar ablation in the prevention or reduction of postoperative AF. The
      block- randomization plan will be used to maintain balance of the study and control arms
      throughout the study.
