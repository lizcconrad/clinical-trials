  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three fixed
      dosages of Lu AA34893 compared to placebo in the treatment of patients with Major Depressive
      Disorder.

      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is reported to be the most common mood disorder, with a
      lifetime prevalence of about 15% and as high as 25% in women. MDD is characterised by the
      presence of one or more Major Depressive Episodes (MDEs) that presents with depressed mood,
      loss of interest or pleasure, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, feelings of guilt or
      low self-worth, and poor concentration. MDD is a disabling, severe illness that tends to be
      chronic, and repeated episodes are common. Despite the availability of a range of effective
      treatments in MDD, a significant proportion of patients do not respond or achieve remission
      and many relapse despite continued treatment. Lu AA34893 has a novel mechanism of action and
      this could be of clinical relevance in addressing currently unmet needs in MDD.
