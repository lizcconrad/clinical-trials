    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient was enrolled in Protocol AGLU-008-01, AGLU-009-02, or AGLU01502

          -  The patient's legal guardian(s) provided written informed consent prior to any study
             related procedures being performed

          -  The patient and his/her guardian(s) were able to comply with the clinical protocol,
             which required extensive clinical evaluations for an extended period of time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from this study if they did not meet the specific inclusion
             criteria, or if the patient experienced any unmanageable AE in Protocol AGLU-008-01,
             AGLU-009-02, or AGLU01502 (as determined and agreed upon by the Principal Investigator
             and Genzyme Corporation), due to Synpac rhGAA therapy, that would preclude continuing
             therapy
