        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients requiring total joint reconstruction due to:

             Arthritis (osteo-, rheumatoid, traumatic) malignancy Ankylosis functional deformity
             Avascular necrosis revisions Benign neoplasms fracture Multiple operated joints

          2. Patients who are skeletally mature.

          3. Patients must have at least one of the following criteria for surgical TMJ treatment.

               1. Presence of considerable pain and/or limited function in the joint area.

               2. Clinical and imaging evidence consistent with anatomic joint pathology

               3. Previous failure of non-surgical treatment/therapy or a failed implant.

               4. High probability of patient improvement by surgical treatment.

          4. Patients must be able to return for follow-up examinations.

          5. Patients without serious compromising general medical conditions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with active infection.

          2. Patient conditions where there is insufficient quantity or quality of bone to support

          3. Patients with perforations in the mandibular fossa and/or bony deficiencies in the
             articular eminence compromising support for the artificial fossa component.

          4. Patients with mandibular and/or zygomatic arch screw holes compromising component
             fixation

          5. Patients requiring partial joint reconstruction or other TMJ procedures not listed as
             an indication.

          6. Patients who are NOT skeletally mature.

          7. Patients who are incapable or unwilling to follow postoperative care instructions.
