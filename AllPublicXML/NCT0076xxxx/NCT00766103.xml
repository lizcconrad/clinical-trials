  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of hypo- and hypercarbia during induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest is high.
      The original report from HACA-group reported that hypothermia treated patients had improved
      survival and neurological outcome. Suprisingly, in that trial normocarbia was not achieved
      even though the aim was set for ventilatory support as normoventilation. This study aims to
      investigate the effects of mild hypo- and hypercarbia on cerebral perfusion (blood flow,
      intracranial pressure) and metabolism (microdialysate metabolites). We hypothesize that
      uncontrolled ventilatory suppport may render the patients in risk of exacerbation of neuronal
      damage, conversely, further improvement in outcome may be achieved with succesfull
      ventilatory management. We intend to enroll 10 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients
      succesfully resuscitated and subsequently treated with controlled hypothermia for 24 hours.
      The patients in need of anticoagulation are excluded. We plan to induce mild hypocarbia and
      hypercarbia during and after induced hypothermia. Metabolic and perfusion data are collected
      with clinically used methods such as transcranial doppler, intracranial pressure measurement,
      near infrared spectroscopy, jugular bulb, intracerebral microdialysis).
