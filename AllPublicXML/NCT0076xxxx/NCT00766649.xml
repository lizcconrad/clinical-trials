    <textblock>
      This study will determine if a drug called sirolimus is safe to give to people with
      geographic atrophy GA and if it can help preserve vision in patients. GA is an advanced form
      of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD affects the macula, the central part of
      the retina needed for sharp, clear vision. There are two types of AMD, wet and dry. In dry
      AMD, cells in the macula die.GA may at least partly be caused by inflammation. Sirolimus
      helps prevent inflammation and therefore may help treat GA.

      People with GA in both eyes with visual acuity between 20/20 and 20/400 in each eye may be
      eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Sirolimus injections in the study eye at each 3-month clinic visit. The drug is injected
           under the outer layer of the eye after the patient receives antiseptic and numbing
           drops. Antibiotic drops are continued for 2 days after the injection.

        -  Eye examinations before the first injection, 1 month after the first injection, during
           each clinic visit (11 to 15 visits over 2 to 3 years) and 3 months after the final
           injection. The examination includes testing visual acuity, measuring eye pressure and
           checking eye movements. To examine the inside of the eye, the pupil is dilated with eye
           drops. Regular photographs of the inside of the eye and optical coherence tomography
           photographs, which allow measurement of the thickness of the retina, may be taken during
           the eye examination.

        -  Autofluorescence imaging. The patient sits in a chair with his or her head placed in a
           chin rest in front of a camera. A light in the camera is used to scan the eye.

        -  Blood tests. Blood is drawn at the first visit and at up to seven study visits to check
           blood chemistries, such as liver and kidney function.

        -  Urine pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant.

      Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people
      over age 55 in the United States, is a heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal
      degeneration occurs predominantly in the macula in the context of aging and leads to
      impairment of central visual acuity. AMD occurs in two general forms, one of which involves
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with subsequent formation of a disciform scar. This is
      often referred to as the neovascular or &quot;wet&quot; form. A second form, the subject of this study,
      is termed &quot;dry&quot; or atrophic macular degeneration and involves a constellation of clinical
      features that can include drusen, pigment clumping and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
      dropout and geographic atrophy (GA). GA can begin as a thinning of the RPE with involvement
      of the underlying choriocapillaris and lead subsequently to an atrophic change in the macula.
      Inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of GA. Sirolimus inhibits the production,
      signaling and activity of many inflammatory factors relevant to the development of GA.
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the safety and possible efficacy of
      multiple sirolimus subconjunctival injections in participants with bilateral GA.

      Study Population: Ten participants with bilateral GA associated with AMD, with the potential
      to replace up to five participants if some fail to reach one year of follow-up.

      Design: In this controlled, unmasked, Phase I/II study, one eye of eligible participants will
      be randomized to treatment while the fellow eye will be observed. Participants will receive a
      20 μL (440 μg) subconjunctival injection of sirolimus in the study eye at baseline and every
      three months thereafter. The study will be completed once all participants have received two
      years of study medication and follow-up.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the rate of change in area of GA, based on masked
      grading by an external Reading Center, of fundus photography in the study eye and fellow eye
      at two years compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes will include worsening of
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of three or more lines (15 or more letters), changes in
      area of GA as measured on autofluorescence, changes in drusen volume as measured by optical
      coherence tomography, changes in photoreceptor outer segment (PROS) thickness as measured by
      optical coherence tomography, as well as changes in drusen area based on masked digital
      grading of fundus photographs. Safety outcomes will include the number and severity of
      systemic and ocular toxicities, adverse events and infections.

    <description>Geographic atrophy (GA) is the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina. The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The area of GA was determined using planimetry for color stereoscopic fundus images by masked graders at the Doheny Image Reading Center (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).
This outcome measure was calculated by subtracting the GA value for the study eye at baseline from the GA value for the study eye at Month 24.

             with exposure of underlying choroidal blood vessels. Even if much of the RPE appears
             to be preserved and large choroidal vessels are not visible, a round patch of RPE
             partial de-pigmentation may still be classified as early GA. The GA in each eye must
             be able to be photographed in their entirety.

          4. Participant must have at least one large druse (more than or equal to 125 μm) in each
             eye.

          5. Participant must have a steady fixation in both eyes in the foveal or parafoveal area

        <title>Absolute Change in Total Area of Geographic Atrophy (GA) in the Study Eye at 24 Months as Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Geographic atrophy (GA) is the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina. The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The area of GA was determined using planimetry for color stereoscopic fundus images by masked graders at the Doheny Image Reading Center (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).
This outcome measure was calculated by subtracting the GA value for the study eye at baseline from the GA value for the study eye at Month 24.
One Macular Photocoagulation Study Disc Area (MPS DA) is equivalent to 1.77 mm^2 on the retina.</description>
