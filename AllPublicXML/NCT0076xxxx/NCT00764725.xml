    <textblock>
      The Swefot trial was designed to compare two treatment strategies for patients with early
      rheumatoid arthritis (less than 1 year symptom duration): the use of a combination of
      traditional antirheumatic medications (DMARDs), versus a combination including a newer
      &quot;biological&quot; anti-TNF medication. In order to make this trial consistent with current
      practices in rheumatology, all patients were first given the most commonly used antirheumatic
      medication, methotrexate (MTX). After 3-4 months those patients who had not responded
      adequately to this treatment were randomized to receive either MTX plus sulfasalazine plus
      hydroxychloroquine, or MTX plus infliximab. Again, to be truly life-like, the trial allowed
      patients who could not tolerate one of the added medications to switch in treatment - but
      keeping with the same strategy - so that sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine could be
      replaced by cyclosporin A, and infliximab by etanercept. The primary outcome in this trial
      was the percentage of patients who, after one year of treatment, achieved a &quot;good response&quot;
      as defined by Eular.
