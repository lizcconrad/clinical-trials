      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of lenalidomide in high risk MDS or AML
      with chromosome 5 aberrations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide is effective in the
      treatment of low risk MDS with del(5q). Treatment of this subgroup of MDS patients resulted
      in 67% major erythroid responses and 45% complete cytogenetic responses. We therefore intend
      to test the efficacy of lenalidomide in a group of high-risk patients who are ineligible for
      conventional chemotherapy and who have a dismal prognosis. The patients must have a karyotype
      including del(5q) but patients with a karyotype including monosomy 5 are also eligible. We
      hypothesize that hight risk MDS or AML patients with other chromosomal aberrations than
      del(5q) can be affected by the lenalidomide effect.

    <description>Initial dose is oral lenalidomide 10 mg daily continuously. The dose should be increased to 20 mg day 1 in week 6 and to 30 mg day 1 in week 10. This dose should be kept for seven weeks. Thus, the total study period is 16 weeks.</description>
