  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SMOKN5 is aimed at studying ways to reduce environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) for children who
      are being treated for cancer. The study includes St. Jude parents whose child lives with at
      least one adult smoker who exposes the child to ETS, also called &quot;secondhand smoke.&quot; We are
      comparing two groups of parents to see which group results in lower ETS exposure levels for
      the child being treated with cancer. The first group will receive the standard information
      and advice usually given to parents about secondhand smoke. The second group will take part
      in a new program designed to reduce ETS. The primary objective of the study is to determine
      the efficacy of an environmental tobacco smoke intervention compared to the standard care
      control condition, as measured by parent report. Parents in each group answer questions about
      ETS exposure. We also collect urine samples from the child at specific time points throughout
      the study. The urine is tested to measure the amount of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine.
      Measuring cotinine tells us how much nicotine from tobacco smoke the child has been exposed
      to. Children who are at least 10 years of age or older will also be asked to complete a set
      of questions pertaining to their tobacco use history and ETS exposure from others. This will
      occur at the same five time points in which the parent completes his/her portion. The study
      will last about 12 months for each participating family. Parents who take part in the study
      may learn how to lower their child's exposure to ETS, and this may, in turn, lower the
      child's chances of having ETS-related health problems.

      160 St. Jude families with a cancer patient who meets eligibility criteria will be enrolled
      on the study. Eligible St. Jude patients must be 17 years of age or younger at the time of
      enrollment. They must also be at least one month from initial diagnosis and in active
      treatment. The patient cannot currently be using tobacco, and he/she must live with at least
      one cigarette smoking adult who smokes in his/her presence. Both smoking and non-smoking
      parents are eligible to participate. The inclusion of non-smoking parents reflects the
      primary objective of the proposed study to reduce ETS exposure in the child's environment. We
      will evaluate the efficacy of an ETS intervention by using a randomized controlled trial
      design that incorporates an experimental intervention group (ETS) and a standard care control
      group (SCC). Parents in the SCC group will receive the standard advice with no additional
      intervention. The experimental group will participate in a three month, multi-component
      behavioral program focused on the reduction of the cancer patient's ETS exposure. The program
      will consist of three bi-weekly face-to-face coaching sessions followed by three bi-weekly
      telephone coaching sessions that will occur within the first three months following
      enrollment onto the study. Although telephone counseling sessions will be offered for parents
      who are not available in person, the face-to-face sessions are encouraged as much as
      possible. Parents in this group will receive physician feedback letters acknowledging their
      participation and progress at the start and end of the coaching phase, as well as, a
      follow-up telephone contact at five months. Self-report and biological measures will be
      obtained from all families during clinic visits at baseline and at three, six, nine, and
      twelve months. Reported ETS exposure and the child's urine cotinine levels will serve as the
      primary dependent variables. Other psychosocial and health outcomes will also be assessed.
      Children 10 years of age and older will complete a brief ETS exposure questionnaire that asks
      them to report on exposure in their environment. Parents in each group will be paid $10 for
      each set of study forms they answer. The total amount that a parent in the control group may
      receive is $50. Parents in the ETS intervention program will also receive $12.50 for each
      face-to-face and telephone coaching session in which they take part. The telephone follow-up
      call occurring at five months will not be compensated. The total amount that a parent in the
      ETS intervention group may receive is $125. Patients will receive a $10 hospital gift voucher
      for each urine sample they provide. The total amount that a patient may receive is $50 to
      $60. At the end of the study, parents who were assigned to the standard advice control group
      may receive the ETS intervention program without charge, if they so choose. Also, parents in
      both groups may choose to receive feedback about their child's urine cotinine results at the
      completion of the study.
