  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether women on oral contraceptives (OCs) suffering
      from acquired OC-associated female sexual dysfunction (FSD) for at least 3 months but no
      longer than one year will express the same level of sexual distress when taking SH T00658ID
      compared to Microgynon, the usual OC prescribed for women with OC-associated FSD.

    <description>In 1 section of the CGI the subject rates their total improvement and rate of satisfaction with sexuality during treatment. The assessment scale ranges from 0 to 7: (0=not assessed; 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse). The scale of 1, 2, and 3 were categorized as improvement.</description>
