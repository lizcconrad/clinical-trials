    <textblock>
      The study is for Korean women who are postmenopausal and also suffer from osteoporosis.

      The study will test if women who are given 20 mg of arzoxifene once a day for six months have
      a less severe level of osteoporosis than those women who do not take arzoxifene.

      All patients will receive 500 mg of elemental calcium and 400 to 600 IU Vitamin D daily
      starting 4 weeks prior to study drug administration continuing through the 6 months of
      therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Present with osteoporosis based on total hip, femoral neck or lumbar spine BMD T-score
             of less than or equal to -2.5 but must never have had any osteoporotic fragility
             fracture.

          -  Are ambulatory and are 60 to 85 years of age, inclusive. Aside from diagnosed
             osteoporosis (Inclusion Criterion [1]), all women must be free of severe or
             chronically disabling conditions, have a life expectancy of at least 5 years in the
             opinion of the investigator, be expected to remain ambulatory throughout the entire
             study, and be expected to return for follow-up visits.

          -  Had their last natural menstrual period at least 2 years before beginning the study.

          -  Are able to comprehend the requirements and procedures for the study and to provide
             informed consent before entering the study.

          -  Have at least two lumbar vertebrae (L1 to L4) that are evaluable via dual energy X-ray
             absorptiometry (DXA) and lateral thoracic and lumbar spine x-ray films that can be
             adequately evaluated for existing vertebral fractures at screening.

          -  Have centrally read total hip, femoral neck or lumbar spine T-score less than or equal
             to -2.5

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have known current metabolic bone disorders other than low bone mass, such as
             hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, or osteomalacia.

          -  Have known, suspected, or history of carcinoma of the breast or estrogen-dependent
             neoplasia (e.g., endometrial or uterine carcinoma), except for hysterectomized
             patients with a history of carcinoma in situ of the uterus. For other cancers, be
             disease free and in remission from all other cancers for 5 or more years, except for
             excised superficial lesions, such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin.

          -  Have demonstrated or suspected allergy to raloxifene or arzoxifene

          -  Have unexplained or abnormal vaginal bleeding within 6 months prior to Visit 1 or
             between Visit 1 and Visit 2.

          -  Are experiencing clinically severe postmenopausal symptoms that may require
             estrogen-replacement therapy.

          -  Have a history of or suggestion on ultrasound or pelvic examination of a pre-existing
             gynecologic abnormality that would require further gynecologic treatment (e.g.,
             ovarian cysts, large fibroids, undiagnosed adnexal masses) or of baseline endometrial
             thickness of &gt;5 mm.

          -  Have Papanicolaou's tests showing malignant or premalignant findings.

          -  Have active or any past history of thromboembolic events

          -  Have active or any past history of atrial fibrillation.

          -  Have a history of cerebrovascular accident or documented transient ischemic attack at
             any time in the past.

          -  Have acute or chronic liver disease defined as alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) &gt;100
             U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) &gt;400 U/L, or late stage cirrhosis without
             transaminase elevations.

          -  Have impaired kidney function (serum creatinine &gt;177 micromol/L or &gt;2.0 mg/dL).

          -  Have vitamin D deficiency prior to enrollment (Visit 2; 25-hydroxyvitamin D less
             than10 ng/mL or less than 24.9 nmol/L).

          -  Have any known, severe, or untreated malabsorption syndromes.

          -  Have endocrine disorders requiring pharmacologic therapy except for type II diabetes
             and hypothyroidism. Patients on a stable dose of thyroid replacement therapy during
             the 6 months preceding randomization (Visit 2) who are clinically euthyroid in the
             opinion of the investigator may enroll in the trial.

          -  Consume an excess of alcohol or abuse drugs

          -  Represent an unacceptable medical or psychiatric risk for treatment with an
             investigational drug

          -  Have active or any history of seizure disorder.
