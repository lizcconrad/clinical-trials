    <textblock>
      The complexity of cancer patients' symptoms and health problems constitutes considerable
      distress and burden for patients and their family caregivers. To help them manage the illness
      effectively, there is a need to better understand the complexity of symptoms and symptom
      clusters in patients and caregivers. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to explore a
      set of important fundamental research questions to advance the scientific knowledge of cancer
      patients' and caregivers' symptoms, symptom clusters and health-related quality of life. The
      investigators will follow 500 cancer patients and their caregivers with repeated measures
      over 6 months to assess their symptoms, symptom clusters, and quality of life over time.
      Caregiver burden will also be examined in the caregivers.

      The specific aims of the study, where we will follow 500 cancer patients and their caregivers
      with repeated measures over 6 months, are to:

        1. Explore cancer patients' symptoms, symptom clusters and symptom changes over time; and
           identify subgroups of patients with different symptom clusters.

        2. Identify genomic markers for the different patient subgroups.

        3. Explore symptoms, symptom clusters and burden in caregivers of cancer patients.

        4. Explore relationships between patients' and caregivers' symptoms, symptom clusters,
           quality of life and caregiver burden.

      Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires to collect demographic characteristics and
      self-reported medical history information, a general symptom inventory, specific measures of
      the symptoms of pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, functional status and quality
      of life. The patients' medical record will be reviewed for disease and treatment information.

      The caregivers will also be asked to complete questionnaires about a general symptom
      inventory, specific measures of the symptoms of pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression,
      functional status, quality of life and caregiver burden.

      Data Analyses will be done to identify symptom clusters of the different symptoms, and to
      identify patient subgroups based on their symptom experience and quality of life. Variations
      in symptom clusters and quality of life over time will also be evaluated. Genetic analyses
      will also be done in the patients.

      DNA analyses for genotyping subgroups of patients based on their experience with pain,
      fatigue, sleep disturbance and depression will test the hypothesis that gene polymorphisms
      within the selected candidate genes will exhibit significant differences in frequency
      distribution among the different patient subgroups that are identified through cluster
      analysis.

        500 cancer outpatients (125 with breast cancer and 125 with head and neck cancer receiving
        radiation therapy and 125 ovarian cancer patients and 125 colon cancer patients receiving
        chemotherapy)

        Inclusion Criteria for patients are:

          -  diagnosed with breast, colon, head and neck or ovarian cancer

          -  receiving active treatment for their cancer (chemo- or radiation therapy)

          -  above 18 years of age

          -  able to read / write /speak Norwegian.

        Inclusion criteria for caregivers:

          -  above 18 years

          -  read and speak Norwegian

          -  and written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who had received radiation on the brain as this may affect their abilities to
             reliably complete questionnaires.
