      The purpose of this study is to compare healthy children to children who have a chronic
      illness called Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). JIA is a childhood disease that causes
      swollen joints that are often stiff and painful. JIA affects about 1 in 1,000 children age 16
      and younger.

    <textblock>
      Children with chronic illnesses are at risk for bone fragility due to inflammation,
      glucocorticoid therapy, physical activity limitation, malnutrition, and pubertal delay. The
      impact of low bone mass during childhood may be immediate, resulting in childhood fractures,
      or delayed, due to suboptimal peak bone mass attainment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  for JIA patients: subjects age 5-21 Drawn from Dr. Burnham's prospective cohort study
             of bone health in 101 children with arthritis.

          -  for Control patients: subjects age 5-21 Controls will be a 50% male/female

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  for JIA patients: Subjects with JIA will be excluded if they have conditions or drug
             exposure unrelated to JIA and known to impact growth or bone health.

          -  for Control patients: Chronic disease or syndrome known to affect growth or bone
             health, prematurity (&lt;37 weeks gestation), or use of any medication known to affect
             growth.
