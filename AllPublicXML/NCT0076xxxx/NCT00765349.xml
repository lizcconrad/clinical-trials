      REASON FOR STUDY

      Major non-cardiac surgery has a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Recently, suitable
      measurements of a patient's preoperative cardiorespiratory reserve, performed non-invasively
      by cardiopulmonary exercise testing, have been shown to be predictive of outcome following
      non-cardiac surgery. Although the exact mechanisms behind poor reserve in this population are
      unknown, poor cardiac function and particularly diastolic dysfunction are likely to be
      important.

      AIMS

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of diastolic dysfunction in
      determining poor cardiorespiratory reserve in elderly patients undergoing major non-cardiac
      surgery. This will provide suitable information to inform a further therapeutic preoperative
      interventional study.

      OBJECTIVES AND METHODS

        1. To determine the presence and severity of diastolic dysfunction, measured by
           preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram, in a series of elderly surgical patients
           undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgery

        2. To investigate the relationship between diastolic dysfunction and poor cardiorespiratory
           function during and following exercise measured by non-invasive testing including
           cardiopulmonary exercise testing, non-invasive blood pressure measurements and
           biochemical analysis

        3. To determine whether patients with poor diastolic dysfunction are likely to have worse
           outcomes following major surgery compared with those who show no evidence of diastolic
           dysfunction. Outcomes will be measured in terms of length of hospital stay and early
           postoperative morbidity (validated scoring system) and mortality.
