  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators are examining the effectiveness of two different speech
      therapy protocols for word retrieval impairments experienced by individuals with
      stroke-induced aphasia. One treatment involves errorless naming treatment and the other
      employs verbal plus gestural facilitation of word retrieval. Participants will receive one of
      the two treatments over several months. Before and after treatment the investigators will
      administer several tests and conversational samples to examine changes associated with the
      treatments. The investigators hypothesize that, whereas both treatments will lead to
      improvements in words rehearsed in therapy, communication outcomes in conversation will be
      broader for the verbal plus gestural protocol.

    <description>Speech therapy sessions take place 4 times per week for up to 90 minutes per session. Following a phase of baseline pre-testing, two phases of speech therapy will take place lasting up to 20 sessions per phase. Post-testing will take place immediately upon completion of the treatment phases and again at 1 month post study completion.</description>
