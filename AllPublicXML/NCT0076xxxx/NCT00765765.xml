      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Hydroxychloroquine may help ixabepilone work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to
      the drug.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ixabepilone
      given together with hydroxychloroquine and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  The primary objective of this study is to assess the antitumor activity, measured by
           tumor response rate, in patients who receive this regimen as a third-line treatment.
           (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To measure the duration of response for responding patients.

        -  To measure the time to progressive disease.

        -  To measure survival time.

        -  To characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  To develop pharmacodynamic markers for autophagy detection in patient specimens.

        -  To characterize the effects of hydroxychloroquine on autophagy in patients in vivo.

        -  To investigate whether the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and/or HER2 status
           of breast tumors correlates with treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of ixabepilone followed by a
      phase II study.

      During the first course, patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1 and oral
      hydroxychloroquine twice daily on days 3-21. On all subsequent courses, patients receive
      ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1 and oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily on days 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months.

    <description>Overall Complete Response and Partial Response will be considered tumor response. Ixabepilone as a single agent (40 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) was evaluated in a previous (Phase II) study in women with metastatic breast cancer and that the objective tumor response rate was 11.5%. In another(Phase III) study, Ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine resulted in an objective tumor response rate of 35%, compared to that of capecitabine alone (14%). Therefore, in the Phase II portion of the ixabepilone plus hydroxychloroquine combination treatment study, a tumor response rate of less than 15% will be deemed uninteresting. The target tumor response rate will be 35%. Due to uncertainty about the true response rate of ixabepilone plus hydroxychloroquine combination on this patient poupation, we also will consider a response rate of 30% to be encouraging.</description>

        <description>Overall Complete Response and Partial Response will be considered tumor response. Ixabepilone as a single agent (40 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) was evaluated in a previous (Phase II) study in women with metastatic breast cancer and that the objective tumor response rate was 11.5%. In another(Phase III) study, Ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine resulted in an objective tumor response rate of 35%, compared to that of capecitabine alone (14%). Therefore, in the Phase II portion of the ixabepilone plus hydroxychloroquine combination treatment study, a tumor response rate of less than 15% will be deemed uninteresting. The target tumor response rate will be 35%. Due to uncertainty about the true response rate of ixabepilone plus hydroxychloroquine combination on this patient poupation, we also will consider a response rate of 30% to be encouraging.</description>
