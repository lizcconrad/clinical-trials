      This randomized, controlled clinical trial, the Low Vision Depression Prevention TriAL
      (VITAL), will test the efficacy of collaborative low vision rehabilitation (LVR) to prevent
      depressive disorders in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). In this innovative
      intervention, a low vision occupational therapist collaborates with a low vision optometrist
      to develop and implement a care plan based on a subject's vision status, rehabilitation
      potential, and personal rehabilitation goals. An independent rater masked to treatment
      assignment will assess depressive disorders meeting DSM-IV criteria (primary outcome) and
      targeted vision function and vision-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) at baseline
      and then at 4 months to evaluate short-term effects (main trial end point) and at 12 months
      to evaluate long-term effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in older persons in
      the U.S. and affects more than 10 million people. One third of patients with AMD become
      clinically depressed when they lose the ability to pursue valued activities. Because their
      depression is disabling and unlikely to be treated, preventing depression in AMD is a public
      health imperative as the population ages.

      We will recruit 200 subjects who have bilateral AMD and subthreshold depressive symptoms.
      Their bilateral vision loss and subthreshold depressive symptoms increase their risk to
      develop more severe depressive disorders and functional decline. We will randomize eligible
      subjects to collaborative Low Vision Rehabilitation (LVR) (optometrist and home-based OT) or
      enhanced LVR (optometrist and home-based Supportive Therapy). In this study, usual care LVR
      is enhanced with Supportive Therapy (ST), which is a standardized placebo psychological
      treatment that controls for attention.

      Many older persons with AMD understandably become depressed when their vision loss prevents
      them from pursuing valued goals. This necessitates a disease management strategy that
      combines treatment for vision loss and depression. Because depression in AMD is rarely
      treated, preventing depression is more sensible than waiting to treat it after diagnosis or
      failing to treat it at all. As the population ages and more people are affected with AMD,
      finding ways to prevent depression and improve daily functioning has great public health
      importance. For these reasons, the VITAL Trial has high clinical significance to patients
      with AMD, and wider public health significance as our society confronts the challenge of
      caring for the growing population of older adults with chronic disabilities.

    <description>The primary outcome was a DSM-IV diagnosis of major or minor depression based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).13 The PHQ-9 includes the 9 criteria that define DSM-IV diagnoses of depression and is valid in low-vision patients. A scoring algorithm determines whether the profile of symptoms meets categorical diagnoses of depression. The model is adjusted for treatment group, vision stratum (20/70 to 20/100 vs. &lt; 20/100), baseline better eye scotoma size, baseline depression scores [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)], Medical Outcome Study score (MOS-6), which is a global index of self-rated physical and mental health, and baseline neuroticism scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vision Function: Distance Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Distance vision function was assessed using the near activities subscale of the National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionaire-25 (NEI-VFQ). This subscale measures self-reported difficulty in completing activities that require distance function. The subscale is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better function. Changes in least squares mean (95% CI) from month 0 to month 4 are reported.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life: Dependency</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported depencency was assessed using the Dependency subscale from the National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionaire-25 (NEI-VFQ). Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating less dependency. Changes in least square means from baseline to 4 months are presented.</description>

Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating fewer role difficulties . Changes in least square means from baseline to 4 months are presented.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome was a DSM-IV diagnosis of major or minor depression based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).13 The PHQ-9 includes the 9 criteria that define DSM-IV diagnoses of depression and is valid in low-vision patients. A scoring algorithm determines whether the profile of symptoms meets categorical diagnoses of depression. The model is adjusted for treatment group, vision stratum (20/70 to 20/100 vs. &lt; 20/100), baseline better eye scotoma size, baseline depression scores [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)], Medical Outcome Study score (MOS-6), which is a global index of self-rated physical and mental health, and baseline neuroticism scores.</description>

        <description>Near vision function was assessed using the near activities subscale of the National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionaire-25 (NEI-VFQ). This subscale measures self-reported difficulty in completing activities that require near function. The subscale is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better function. Changes in least squares mean (95% CI) from month 0 to month 4 are reported.</description>
