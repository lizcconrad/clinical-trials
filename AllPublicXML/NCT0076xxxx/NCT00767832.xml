      The purpose of the study is to assess the coagulation changes that occur in patients
      undergoing elective Cesarean delivery using thromboelastography (TEG). We will compare
      coagulation data to assess potential coagulation changes associated with hemoglobin changes
      before and after surgery, and related to estimated blood loss.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the coagulation changes that occur in patients
      undergoing elective Cesarean delivery using thromboelastography (TEG). TEG is a point-of-care
      device which measures the viscoelastic properties of clot formation. This device can provide
      rapid and detailed information about coagulation changes in the perioperative period. We will
      compare coagulation data collected from the study to assess potential coagulation changes
      associated with Hemoglobin changes before and after surgery, and related to estimated blood
      loss.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             unit at Lucile Packard Hospital who undergo elective Cesarean delivery.

          -  We will select 100 healthy ASA 1 patients with singleton pregnancies who are scheduled
             for uncomplicated elective Cesarean delivery, with no anticipated risk of obstetric
             hemorrhage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with underlying coagulation disorders.

          -  Patients with thrombocytopenia.
