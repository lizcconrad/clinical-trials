      Context: Endeavours to reduce overweight by calorie-restriction diets are often neither
      sufficient nor sustained. The growing obesity epidemic demands additional measures to enhance
      and sustain weight loss.

      Objective: To evaluate three alternative weight-loss measures on top of a calorie-restriction
      diet.

      Design, Setting, and Participants: Six-month randomized and controlled trial using a
      three-factorial design. The participants were 110 families with 142 obese parents and their
      119 obese children.

      Intervention: All families kept to a calorie-restriction diet and were assigned at random to
      one or more of three additional weight-loss strategies: (1) a diet on top of
      calorie-restriction with preference for carbohydrates having a low glycemic index (dual
      diet), (2) financial incentive, and (3) continuous telemetric control of weight and physical
      activity (telemonitoring). The design made it possible to determine the effect of each single
      measure: financial incentive vs. no financial incentive (54 vs.56 families),
      calorie-restriction vs. dual diet (53 vs. 57 fami-lies) and telemonitoring vs. no
      telemonitoring (19 vs. 91 families). The design also allowed an assessment of the effects of
      combinations of the additional measures, each adapted for possible effects of the other
      factors.

      Main Outcome In the parents the outcome variable at 6 months was the relative weight loss. In
      children, be-cause of their body growth, the outcome variable was the age-adjusted BMI
      standard deviation score (BMI-SDS). Analysis was done by three-factorial ANOVA and by a
      one-factorial ANOVA with the included Dunnett test as a post-hoc comparison, to distinguish
      between the effects of the different combinations of the additional strategies.

    <description>Financial incentive
For the parents the financial incentive was 5 euros for every kilogram of weight-loss. For children the weight loss was calculated differently, taking into account the individual need of each child to lose weight. Children with a body mass index between the 90th and 97th age-adjusted BMI-percentile were asked to maintain their weight, and were paid in dependence on how well they managed to achieve this goal. Children with age-adjusted BMI-percentiles between 97 and 99, or above the 99th age-adjusted BMI-percentile received 5 euros per weight losses of respectively 500 g or 1 kg.</description>

    <description>The telemedical equipment consisted of a weighing scale for each family, an accelerometer for each participant, and a Homebox for each family which received the data from the scale and the accelerometers via bluetooth and transfered them via a telephone link to a server in Munich.</description>

    <description>The basic diet for all participants was supported by a list giving the calorie contents of a large variety of food-stuffs. The dual diet group received a second list giving the glycemic index (GI) for a large variety of carbohy-drates. Emphasis was placed on a preference for low-GI carbohydrates but not on avoidance of carbohydrates as required by the Atkins diet.</description>

        The participating families were recruited by means of newspaper advertisements in the area
        around the German city of Magdeburg. The children had to be older than 7 years to ensure
        that they were able to read, and younger than 13 to minimize interferences due to puberty.
        177 families responded by telephone and received a letter de-scribing the aim and character
        of the study. 110 families then decided to participate and were invited to the first of
        four meetings with intervals of one week between successive meetings.
