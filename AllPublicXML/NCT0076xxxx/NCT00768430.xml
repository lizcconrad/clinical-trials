  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) generally take weeks to months to
      exert their maximal benefit. There is an urgent need to develop rapid-acting treatments for
      MDD. Ketamine, a high-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, has
      been used as a standard intravenous (IV) anesthetic agent for many years in both pediatric
      and adult patients. Beyond its well-established role in anesthesia and pain management, there
      is emerging evidence that ketamine may have rapid antidepressant properties for patients with
      severe mood disorders.

      In this study we are investigating whether ketamine can have an antidepressant effect
      compared to midazolam. Midazolam has similar anesthetic effects compared to ketamine but has
      not been shown to be an antidepressant, and is therefore acting as an active control in this
      study.

      The study period can last up to 8 weeks, depending on your response to the study medication.
      There are two required overnight stays in our Research Commons as part of this study.

             I Disorders, Patient Edition (SCID-P);

          4. Participants must have a history of at least one previous episode of depression prior
