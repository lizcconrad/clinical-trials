      Glucagon like peptides receptors expression in the stomach of diabetes type 2 Glucagon like
      peptides (GLP-1, GLP-2), are hormones secreted by L cells located along the gastrointestinal
      tract. These hormones are secreted after meals and have some roles in regulating the
      digestion process, absorption, and sending signals to the brain that regulate food
      consumption. GLP peptides affect peripheral targets and have an important homeostatic role.
      GLP-1 decreases the circulatory glucose level and GLP-2 has trophic effects which enable
      adequate intestine growth.

      We aimed in our study to investigate the GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor expression in different
      zones of the stomach in diabetes type 2 patients. If there are differences, it might explain
      the pathological gastric emptying in these patients.

      Understanding the function of these peptides may lead to new therapeutic options for diabetic
      patients with delayed gastric emptying.

      Methods: 20 diabetes type 2 patients with symptoms that need upper endoscopy will be included
      in the study and 20 controls aged 18-70 years. Patients with neurological disease will be
      excluded. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy 3 biopsies will be taken from the antrum, corpus
      and cardia. The biopsies will be stored in -70. After RNA extraction the GLP receptors
      expression will established by real time PCR method. Patients with different expression
      compared to control will undergo isotopic scan for gastric emptying.
