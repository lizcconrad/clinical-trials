  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether in high-risk kidney transplant patients
      (patients whose previous kidney transplant failed, have a high PRA lab test result or are of
      African-American descent) that a combination of Rapamune with Prograf and steroids will
      prevent acute rejection as well as Rapamune and cyclosporine and steroids.
