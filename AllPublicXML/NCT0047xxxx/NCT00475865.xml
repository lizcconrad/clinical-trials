    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to estimate the tolerability and safety of 2 doses of Teriflunomide
      administered once daily for 24 weeks, compared to placebo, in patients with multiple
      sclerosis [MS] with relapses who were on a stable dose of Glatiramer Acetate [GA].

      The secondary objectives were:

        -  to estimate the effect of the 2 doses of Teriflunomide, compared to placebo, in
           combination with a stable dose of GA on Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] parameters,
           relapse rate and patient-reported fatigue;

        -  to perform pharmacokinetic analyses of the 2 doses of teriflunomide in combination with
           a stable dose of GA.

      The duration of the study period for a participant was approximatively 44 weeks broken down
      as follows:

        -  Screening period up to 4 weeks,

        -  24-week double-blind treatment period*,

        -  16-week post-treatment elimination follow-up period.

      '*' Participants successfully completing the week 24 visit were offered the opportunity to
      enter the optional long-term extension study LTS6047 - NCT00811395.

    <description>AE with potential risk of occurrence were defined as follows:
Hepatic disorders;

    <time_frame>baseline (before randomization) and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total lesion volume is the sum of the total volume of all T2-lesions and the total volume all T1-hypointense post-gadolinium lesions measured through T2/proton density scan analysis and gadolinium-enhanced T1 scan analysis.
Least-square means were estimated using a Mixed-effect model with repeated measures [MMRM] on cubic root transformed volume data (treatment group, region of enrollment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline value (cubic root transformed), and baseline-by-visit interaction as factors).</description>

    <description>Number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions per scan is obtained from the total number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions observed during the study divided by the total number of scans performed during the study.
To account for the different number of scans among participants, a Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used (total number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions as response variable; log-transformed number of scans as &quot;offset&quot; variable; treatment group, region of enrollment and baseline number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions as covariates).</description>

    <measure>Annualized Relapse Rate [ARR]: Poisson Regression Estimates</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ARR is obtained from the total number of confirmed relapses that occured during the treatment period divided by the sum of the treatment durations.
Each episode of relapse - appearance, or worsening of a clinical symptom that was stable for at least 30 days, that persisted for a minimum of 24 hours in the absence of fever - was to be confirmed by an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score or Functional System scores.
To account for the different treatment durations among participants, a Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used (total number of confirmed relapses as response variable; log-transformed treatment duration as &quot;offset&quot; variable; treatment group and region of enrollment as covariates).</description>

          <description>EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that qualifies disability in patients with MS. It consists of 8 ordinal rating scales assessing seven functional systems (visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder and cerebral) as well as ambulation.
EDSS total score ranges from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS).</description>

Least-square means were estimated using a Mixed-effect model with repeated measures [MMRM] on cubic root transformed volume data (treatment group, region of enrollment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline value (cubic root transformed), and baseline-by-visit interaction as factors).</description>
