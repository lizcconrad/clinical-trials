    <textblock>
      This study compared two different methods of restoring blood flow to the heart when there has
      been a narrowing or blockage in the blood vessels that supply the heart. Currently there are
      two different ways of restoring blood flow. One is heart surgery where a surgeon operates
      directly on the heart, through an incision in the breast bone (sternum) and takes segments of
      the patient’s (non-essential) veins or arteries and then uses these to bypass blocked or
      narrowed segments in the coronary arteries. This way additional blood can be “piped” into the
      heart muscle wall. The second method is coronary angioplasty with stent implantation.
      Coronary angioplasty is a non-surgical method performed under a local anaesthetic. During
      angioplasty a special balloon is advanced to the site of a coronary narrowing, then inflated
      to make it expand and this action removes the narrowing. This is a more simple and less
      invasive than surgery but its value has been limited by a tendency for narrowings to
      reoccur(restenosis) in the six months following the treatment. When this happens a repeat
      procedure is often performed. To reduce the incidence of restenosis coronary stents are
      implanted. These are tubular metal scaffold devices that are placed inside a coronary artery
      at the site of a previous narrowing to help keep the artery open. These devices are usually
      delivered on an angioplasty balloon and expanded into place.

      Both treatments are equally effective at preventing death and subsequent myocardial
      infarction and most doctors are happy to recommend either option. Angioplasty offers a more
      simple initial procedure but with a chance of needing a repeat performance. Bypass surgery
      represents a more significant initial undertaking with a longer recovery and convalescent
      period but in most cases, provides good relief of symptoms. Patient preference plays an
      important part in the decision process.

      Bypass grafting is currently the therapy most frequently performed world-wide. Angioplasty
      has a number of important advantages but the need for repeat procedures currently limits its
      appeal.

      Since these trials were performed there have been important advances in angioplasty
      techniques. Prominent amongst these has been the development and use of Coronary Stents which
      has been shown (in clinical trials) to reduce the need for repeat procedures after an initial
      angioplasty. Consequently stent implantation is now in routine use world wide.

      If angioplasty is performed with coronary stent implantation then this may reduce the need
      for repeat procedures and address the principal factor currently limiting the value of this
      approach. If the results were found to be as good as with bypass grafting then patients could
      benefit from a shorter hospital stay, a less traumatic operation and a shorter recovery
      period. We therefore wish to compare the outcomes in patients treated with a) bypass grafting
      or b) angioplasty with coronary stent implantation.
