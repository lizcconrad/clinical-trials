  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a common complication of prolonged diabetes mellitus, both with Type 1 and
      Type 2 forms. Treatment of diabetic gastroparesis ranges from changing dietary habits to
      medications and invasive procedures, all of which offer only partial and transient relief,
      with some options having potentially harmful effects. Acupuncture is an ancient treatment
      which has been found to be beneficial for many ailments, including those involving the
      gastrointestinal tract. We propose to evaluate whether acupuncture is an effective and safe
      treatment for diabetic gastroparesis using a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo/sham-controlled crossover trial. Because symptoms of gastroparesis do not correlate
      well with objective tests of gastric emptying (i.e., scintigraphy or 13C breath tests), our
      primary outcome value will be the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI), a reliable and
      validated instrument for quantifying symptoms in these patients. As a secondary outcome we
      will measure gastric emptying using a C13-acetate breath test, as well as the SF-12 Short
      Form Health Survey. Blinding of the participants will be evaluated using a Validation of
      Blinding Questionnaire at the end of the treatment period.

      Diabetic patients suffering from moderate gastroparesis (total GCSI score &gt; 2.50) who fulfill
      the inclusion criteria (and none of the exclusion criteria) will be eligible to participate
      in the study. On induction, participants will fill out the GCSI questionnaire and SF-36
      survey, and will undergo a C13-acetate breath test. They will then be randomly assigned to
      either true acupuncture treatment or placebo/sham acupuncture treatment. Each participant
      will undergo 8 treatments twice-weekly, for a period of 4 weeks. At the end of the eighth
      treatment session, each participant will again fill out a GCSI questionnaire and SF-12 form,
      as well as repeating the C13-acetate breath. Following a 4-week washout period, patients will
      be crossed over to either placebo/sham or true acupuncture treatment, again 8 twice-weekly
      treatments, for a period of 4 weeks. At the end of the second treatment regimen all
      participants will again fill out a GCSI questionnaire and SF-12 form, and undergo a
      C13-acetate breath test. At the end of the second treatment regimen participants will again
      fill out a Validation of Blinding Questionnaire.
