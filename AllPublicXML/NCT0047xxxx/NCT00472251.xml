  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely-accepted that serum testosterone level and BMI (body mass index) representative
      of the degree of obesity has negative correlation. Considering the fact that obesity is being
      mentioned as a risk factor for development of prostate cancer as well as other various
      life-threatening diseases (example: cardiovascular problems), the effect of BPH treatment
      agents on BMI is a subject that should certainly be elucidated. Meanwhile, to our knowledge,
      no prospective study has so far been performed on such issue in Asian population. Prior to
      generating hypothesis of the effect of 5 alpha reductase inhibitor on BMI, the real effect of
      5 alpha reductase inhibitor on BMI change in Korean BPH patients has to be observed in real
      clinical practice. This study will test the effects of one-year medication of 5 alpha
      reductase inhibitor on BMI among Korean men with BPH.

      This study is a prospective, 1-year follow-up, observational study. We are planning to enroll
      100 Korean patients with BPH. At each visit, patients' height, weight, abdominal
      circumference will be checked. Laboratory parameters including fasting glucose, HbA1c, serum
      testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, estradiol, maximum flow rate
      (measured by flowmetry) will be tested. Blood test will be performed twice (at baseline and
      at the end of study). 5mL of blood will be needed at each time from one subject. And total
      IPSS score will be evaluated after 1 year of treatment of 5 ARI. At every visit, use of above
      prohibited medicines and other medications will be investigated. In addition, any surgical
      procedures undertaken during study period will be asked and recorded.

      Subjects of study will be allocated into 3 separate groups. Group 1 will be those taking 5
      alpha reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) only for 1 year. Group2 will be those who switch from
      alpha blocker to dutasteride and take dutasteride for 1 year. Group 3 will be composed of
      those taking both alpha blocker and dutasteride for 1 year.

        We recruited men aged 45-75 years with moderate to severe symptomatic BPH (IPSS &gt; 7 and a
        peak urinary flow rate of &lt; 15 mL/s),an enlarged prostate (â‰¥30 mL on TRUS), a PSA level of
        &lt;10 ng/mL, and no evidence of prostate cancer (on a DRE or TRUS) among patients who visited
        our clinic.
