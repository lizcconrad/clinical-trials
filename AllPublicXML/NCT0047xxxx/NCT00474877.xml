  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tested the hypothesis that there would be a difference in the 12 month progression
      of structural hand impairment and hand function between a group of patients with early RA who
      received static resting splints and those that did not.

      This study is a multi centred RCT recruiting patients across 8 rheumatology occupational
      therapy departments in the UK. Patients with early RA (&lt;5 years) were recruited. The study
      followed patients over a 12 month treatment period. Patients were randomised to receive
      standardised occupational therapy or standardised occupational therapy plus static resting
      splints over 12 months. The primary outcome measure was dominant hand grip strength and
      secondary out measures included; dominant hand MCPJ ulnar deviation, the button board from
      the Arthritis Hand Function Test and the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire.

      Data were analysed using ANCOVA. Baseline outcome values, Ritchie Scores at baseline and the
      number of intra articular wrist and hand steroid injections were controlled for as
      covariates.
