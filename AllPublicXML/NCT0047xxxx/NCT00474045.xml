    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Europe, North and South America and Oceania. The aim of
      this trial is to compare the effect and safety on blood glucose control in pregnant women
      with type 1 diabetes of a modern insulin analogue (insulin detemir) and human insulin (NPH
      insulin) given as long-acting insulin in combination with a short-acting insulin (insulin
      aspart).

      <pre_assignment_details>Non-pregnant women were randomised immediately after it was established that they fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Thus, they were exposed to insulin detemir (IDet) throughout organogenesis. Pregnant subjects were to be randomised after completion of the 8th gestational week (GW) and before the completion of 12th GW</pre_assignment_details>
