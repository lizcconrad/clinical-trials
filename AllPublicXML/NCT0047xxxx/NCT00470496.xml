    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of photodynamic therapy using HPPH
      in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for primary or recurrent head and neck
      cancer. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a drug, such as HPPH, that becomes active when it is
      exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. Giving
      photodynamic therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PDT among 4 investigated light dose levels
      (30, 50, 60 and 75) in combination with surgery in patients with recurrent or primary head
      and neck cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To make initial observations of efficacy (i.e., tumor recurrence rate) of adjuvant PDT in
      these patients.

      II. To determine the HPPH uptake and distribution (when feasible) in recurrent resected
      specimens.

      III. Observe for wound complications.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of laser light.

      Patients receive HPPH intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Patients undergo surgery
      followed by laser light exposure to the entire tumor bed on day 2.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months and then
      periodically thereafter at the discretion of the treating physician.
