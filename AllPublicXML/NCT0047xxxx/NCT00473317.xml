  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When people eat a meal, some, but not all of the calcium in that meal is absorbed, that is,
      moved into the bloodstream. When the skin is exposed to sunlight during summer months,
      Vitamin D is made there and then modified into more active forms by the liver and kidneys.
      These more active forms of Vitamin D improve calcium absorption. Many adults living in the
      U.S. have little or no sun exposure and are low in Vitamin D. We know that specific
      wavelengths of sunlight called Ultraviolet-B cause Vitamin D to be made in the skin.

      At the beginning of the study we will measure your height, weight, skin color, and draw blood
      to measure your blood levels of Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Each subject will wear a
      swimming suit and be exposed to sunlight for 30 minutes total (15 minutes lying on back, 15
      minutes lying on stomach).We will draw blood for Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D on days
      1,2,3,5, and 7 after sunlight exposure. There will be six blood draws for a total of 102 cc
      of blood drawn (about 3 ½ teaspoons drawn each time).
