  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously we have demonstrated in animal experiments,that pancreas is extremely vulnerable
      to handling, reacting with the development of pancreatitis. In human pancreatic surgery,
      post-operative pancreatitis mediates many other post-operative complications. A new
      anastomosis was developed to diminish the injury, as being without any stitches going through
      the pancreas. The aims were to study up to 30 patients as phase one study, with an interim
      analysis in this open uncontrolled trial after the first few patients.

    <intervention_name>Pancreaticojejunostomy without stiches through the pancreas</intervention_name>
    <description>The pancreas is cut with knife, without electric cautery and without stay sutures. Bleeding is controlled with 2-3 exactly placed stiches. The pancreatic stump is sunk inside the jejunum, which is tightened around the pancreas with a purse string. A biodegradable stent is left into the pancreatic duct to prevent its occlusion when tightning the purse string.</description>
