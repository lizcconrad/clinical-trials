  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is considered to be one of the most prevalent
      chronic health conditions in children. It affects between 4% and 12% of young children. A
      relationship between convergence insufficiency (eye teaming) and ADHD has been shown.
      However, the effect of ADHD medications on focusing and eye teaming has not been previously
      investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ADHD
      medication on focusing and eye teaming skills.
