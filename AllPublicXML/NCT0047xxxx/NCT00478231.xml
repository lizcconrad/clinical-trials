        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with limited or no approved treatment options available to them due to
             resistance or intolerance;

          -  Subjects must be failing to achieve adequate virologic suppression on their current
             regimen and have HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/ml, at screening.

          -  Have only R5 HIV-1 at Screening as verified by the Monogram Biosciences Trofile assay.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failed prior treatment with any CCR5 antagonist, in any ongoing CCR5 trials or having
             previously discontinued Maraviroc in trials

          -  Potentially life threatening (Grade 4) laboratory abnormality or medical condition
             (according to the Division of AIDS table for grading severity of adult adverse
             experiences) still under investigation unless a diagnosis has been established and
             felt not to affect risk/benefit assessment or eventual interpretation of safety
             results, based on discussion between the investigator and Pfizer.
