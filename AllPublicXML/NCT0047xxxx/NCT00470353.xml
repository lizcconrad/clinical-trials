      RATIONALE: The use of cholecalciferol and calcium carbonate may keep colon cancer from coming
      back in patients with colon cancer that has been removed by surgery.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying two different doses of cholecalciferol to
      compare how well they work when given together with calcium carbonate in treating patients
      with colon cancer that has been removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the antiproliferative effects of 2 different doses of cholecalciferol (i.e.,
           vitamin D3) in combination with calcium carbonate on the proliferative labeling index in
           patients with resected colon cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the effects of these doses on serum levels of 25-OH-D3, 1,25-OH-D3, 24,25-OH-D3,
           calcium, and parathyroid hormone in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of high-dose cholecalciferol in these patients over 2 years.

        -  Compare the effects of these doses on several biological markers (i.e., cyclin D1,
           protein kinase C, vitamin D receptor, p21, and p27) in the rectal mucosa of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral low-dose cholecalciferol once daily and oral calcium
           carbonate twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral high-dose cholecalciferol once daily and calcium carbonate
           as in arm I.

      Treatment in both arms continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. All patients undergo sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy with 4 quadrant
      mucosal biopsies at baseline and after 6 months of study treatment. After their 6-month
      mucosal biopsy, patients in arm I switch to high-dose cholecalciferol as in arm II.

      Patients undergo blood, urine, and tissue collection periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and/or histopathological analysis. Serum is collected
      monthly for 3 months and then once every 3 months to assess changes in serum levels of
      vitamin D and vitamin D metabolites (i.e., 1,25-OH-D3; 25-OH-D3; 24,25-OH-D3), as well as
      changes in calcium and parathyroid hormone, BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, and phosphorus
      levels. Urine is collected once every 3 months to assess changes in urine calcium and
      creatinine levels for hypercalciuria. Tissue biopsies of normal endorectal mucosa collected
      at baseline and after 6 months of study treatment are evaluated by IHC for proliferative
      index, vitamin D receptor staining, p21, p27, cyclin D1, and protein kinase C.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
