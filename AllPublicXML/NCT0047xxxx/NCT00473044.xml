  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a faith-based curriculum delivered in
      small groups, and emphasizing goal setting along with mutual responsibility, increases
      physical activity.

    <textblock>
      Sedentary lifestyles are common among older adults in the United States, especially among
      minority women. Regular physical activity in older adults has been shown to prevent falls,
      maintain functional status, prevent both dementia and osteoporosis, and decrease mortality. A
      review of the literature has shown that current research approaches using exercise classes as
      the only means of behavior change are ineffective and do not produce long-term sustainable
      improvement. This study is testing a culturally appropriate behavior modification
      intervention using 1) group prayer, 2) the development of social support and mutual
      responsibility for exercise, and 3) group problem solving activities to increase aerobic and
      strength-related activities among older African American women.

      Participants randomized into the intervention arm receive a 45-minute curriculum session and
      a 45 minute exercise class, while those randomized into the control arm receive a 45 minute
      session of interactive lectures on unrelated health topics along with the 45 minute exercise
      class. The exercise class includes both aerobic exercise and strength training using
      hand-held weights.

      Data is collected from pedometers worn by participants, as well as from questionnaires before
      and after the intervention. Blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol are measured before and
      after the intervention.
