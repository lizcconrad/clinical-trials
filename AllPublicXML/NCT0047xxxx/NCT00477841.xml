    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is common in some areas , ranking as the fourth leading cause of death from
      cancer in China and sixth worldwide. Although the prognosis of surgical resection for
      esophageal cancer has been improved, more than 50% of such patients are inoperable and have
      to undergo palliative treatments because of late stage cancer or metastasis. Dysphagia is the
      predominate symptom of patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. To relieve the dysphagia
      and improve the quality of life of such patients, brachytherapy has previously been utilized.
      Recently, stent placement has been widely accepted to be an option for palliation of the
      symptoms due to the esophageal strictures. However, recurrence of the neoplastic stricture
      remains a challenge after stent placement. To combine the advantages of the immediate relief
      of the esophageal dysphagia with the stent placement and radiation therapy with
      brachytherapy, a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds has been developed in the
      authors' institute. The technical feasibility and safety with this new stent has been
      demonstrated to be adequate in a healthy rabbit model. The current study is designed to
      demonstrate the preliminary results with this irradiation stent in patients with inoperable
      esophageal cancer compared to those using a conventional covered stent.
