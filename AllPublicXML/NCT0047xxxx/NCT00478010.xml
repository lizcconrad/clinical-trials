      RATIONALE: Determining how patients makes decisions about participating in a clinical trial
      may help doctors plan clinical trials in which more patients are willing to participate and
      are satisfied with their decision to participate.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV
      pancreatic cancer or stage III or stage IV colon cancer or rectal cancer make decisions about
      participating in a clinical trial.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the relationship between disease factors, patient factors, and understanding
           of the cancer clinical trial, and preferences for decision control in the decision to
           participate in a cancer clinical trial by patients with stage II-IV pancreatic cancer or
           stage III-IV colon or rectal cancer.

        -  Determine the relationship between disease factors, patient factors, understanding of
           the cancer clinical trial, and preferences for decision control with satisfaction with
           the decision to participate in a cancer clinical trial.

        -  Determine how quality of life, trust, and hope impact the decision to participate in a
           cancer clinical trial and the satisfaction with this decision.

      OUTLINE: This is a cross-sectional study.

      Patients complete 12 questionnaires to assess their symptom burden (e.g., nausea, pain,
      fatigue), sociodemographics, hope, quality of life, trust in the healthcare system, trust in
      health professionals, research decision control, perceived risks, adequacy of research
      information, clinical trial participation, and decision satisfaction.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
