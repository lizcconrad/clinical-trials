      Purpose of clinical trial; Evaluate the effectiveness of rituximab in C4d+ CAN

      Primary objective; To determine whether anti-CD20 therapy can stabilize or improve renal
      function and/or proteinuria in patients with C4d+, chronic (humoral) rejection in whom
      standard therapeutic approaches have failed.

      Secondary objective (s);

        -  To compare patient and graft survival between control and rituximab-treated groups

        -  To evaluate the adverse effect profile of rituximab in this group

        -  To correlate changes in circulating B cell numbers, anti-HLA and non-HLA Ab profiles and
           titre with responses to standard therapy and / or rituximab

        -  To correlate changes in T cell responsiveness to alloantigens with responses to standard
           therapy and / or rituximab

      Study Design; Prospective, randomised, two arm, open-labeled

      Study Endpoints; Primary

        -  Rate of deterioration in renal function, defined by slope of reciprocal creatinine plot,
           on samples taken 3-5 months post-randomisation.

        -  Change in degree of proteinuria, where present, at 3-5 months post-randomisation 2˚
           endpoints, determined at 3-5 months post-randomisation and at 1, 2 and 3 years
           post-recruitment are;

        -  Rate of deterioration in renal function, defined by slope of reciprocal creatinine plot,
           determined by analysis of samples taken since previous assessment.

        -  Patient survival

        -  Graft survival

        -  Incidence of culture positive infection

        -  Incidence of malignancy

        -  Degree of proteinuria

        -  Changes in circulating CD20+ cells in peripheral blood

        -  Changes in anti-graft Ab titres, (measured every 3 months)

        -  Changes in T cell responsiveness to alloantigens (measured every 3 months).

      Sample Size; 15 patients to be randomised to each arm (i.e. 30 patients randomised). Up to
      120 patients will need to be enrolled into the study. In addition, in those participants that
      received a living donor kidney, these donors will be approached to provide up to 5 samples of
      blood to help with the in vitro analyses.

      Summary of eligibility criteria;

        -  Male or female renal allograft recipients 18-70 years of age

        -  more than 6/12 post-transplantation

        -  Either deteriorating allograft function on reciprocal creatinine plot or significant
           proteinuria or both.

        -  C4d+/- CAN on renal allograft biopsy

      Investigational medicinal product and dosage; Rituximab, 1g on day 0 and 1g on day 14

      Active comparator product(s); None

      Route(s) of administration; Intravenous infusion

      Maximum duration of treatment of a subject; 14 days with rituximab. The treatment arms of the
      study, including optimisation period, formal run-in and post-randomisation phase lasts for 10
      months post-recruitment.

      Procedures; Screening &amp; enrollment. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by
      screening renal allograft biopsies performed for 'creeping creatinine' and/or proteinuria.
      Recruitment by informed consent prior to enrollment.

      Procedures; Baseline. In addition to routine tests, blood for anti-HLA and non-HLA antibody
      analysis and for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) purification.

      Procedures; Treatment period. 3 month run-in period on optimal conventional immunosuppressive
      therapy, preceded by up to 2 months to allow tailored-optimization. Patients will be reviewed
      at least six times in their normal transplant clinic appointments for routine blood
      biochemistry, full blood count and urine analysis. At the end of the run-in period, further
      blood will be taken for anti-graft antibody analysis and PBMC purification. Those patients in
      whom allograft function stabilises and/or proteinuria improves will have normal transplant
      clinic follow-up appointments and have blood taken for further anti-graft antibody and PBMC
      purification up to every 3 months for 3 years. Those with continued deterioration in either
      allograft function or persisting or worsening proteinuria will be randomised. These patients
      will be reviewed during their normal transplant clinic appointments until the primary
      end-point and will need to have at least 6 routine blood biochemistry, full blood count and
      urine analysis during the final 3 months of this period, post-randomisation. At the primary
      end-point, further blood will be taken for anti-graft antibody analysis and PBMC.

      Procedures; End of Study. •Follow up will continue for 3 years, with blood taken for
      anti-graft antibody analysis and PBMC purification every three months

      Procedures for safety monitoring during trial; Regular patient interviews and examination,
      routine haematological and biochemical analyses. Serious adverse events will be reported and
      forwarded to the sponsor, MHRA, LREC and Roche as appropriate The WLRATC transplant research
      committee will discuss the trial and any safety concerns at their regular three monthly
      meetings. Data will be reviewed after 30 and also after 60 people have been enrolled.

      Criteria for withdrawal of patients on safety grounds; Serious adverse effects related to
      rituximab infusion
