      The purpose of this study is 1) to determine whether Imiquimod or Steroid pretreatment
      modifies UVB laser light response resulting in increased cell death compared to UVB laser
      light alone; 2) to determine if pretreatment of psoriatic lesions with Imiquimod or Steroid
      prior to UVB laser light exposure selectively effects various T cell functions; 3) to
      determine clinical results from the Imiquimod/Steroid/UVB laser light and correlate those
      changes with immuno-histochemical changes in the skin; and 4) to determine if single high
      dose lesion limited UVB laser light intervention combined with Imiquimod or Steroid
      influences T cell changes

    <textblock>
      The characteristic lesion of psoriasis is a sharply demarcated erythematous papule or plaque
      with excessive scaling due to hyperproliferating keratinocytes, infiltrating granulocytes,
      and a dense mononuclear infiltrate with activated T cells. To date, no one mechanism has been
      explanatory for the panoply of changes that occur in both the dermis and epidermis of
      psoriasis patients. Several key findings have shown that cutaneous T cells play a key role in
      the propagation of the disease; memory-type T cells home to the skin, specifically due to
      expression of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), and are the main effector cells in
      psoriatic tissue responsible for the production of cytokines that result in exacerbated
      cutaneous inflammation. T cell recruitment is thought to occur in psoriasis, in part, as a
      result of cytokine and chemokine release from keratinocytes, macrophages, and endothelial
      cells. CLA-positive T cells migrate into the tissues where memory-effector T cells are
      activated and expand. This migration is critical to maintenance of the psoriasis lesions,
      because anti-LFA-1 antibodies (efalizumab) are effective in treating psoriasis, resulting in
      blood lymphocytosis and tissue depletion of T cells. Despite many years of using UVB
      phototherapy in the treatment of psoriasis, its mechanism of action is based mainly on in
      vitro exposures of isolated cells and on extrapolations from UV effects on normal skin, with
      little direct data from lesional skin.

      Previously, our studies determined optimal single efficacious dose using the Excimer laser,
      refined the mechanism of UVB action in psoriasis, developed key cytokine quantitative meth
      -ods to assess targeted mRNA levels in psoriatic tissue after treatment, demonstrated that
      regulatory T cells from psoriasis tissue and blood appear to have a functional defect, and
      demonstrated that UVA component of solar radiation is a critical and significant contributor
      to UV-induced in vivo immuno-suppression. All of these previous findings lead us to our
      current hypothesis that direct selective apoptotic effects on the T mem/Teff cells may result
      in decreased APC activation and IL-12 over-riding of Treg suppression and a re-balanced
      Tre:Tmem/eff cell ratio which in turn may have a sustained remittive effect (high duration
      multi-month clearing of a psoriasis lesion after a single UVB laser light treatment.)

    <description>Lesions were treated with either Imiquimod or Clobetasol cream. Lesions were subsequently treated with UVB and biopsied. From the biopsy samples obtained from the Imiquimod arm, quantitative PCR was performed to measure levels of Myx A, an imiquimod response gene.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Improvement in Lesional Psoriasis Area and Assessment (PASI) Score After Imiquimod and UVB Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after Imiquimod and UVB</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a disease burden measure that integrates area, erythema, thickness and scale of each target lesion. The severity score for each region is calculated by adding the scores for redness, thickness and scale (each of which are graded from 0 to 4). The maximum severity score is 12. The higher the PASI, the worse the disease. Thus, an improvement in PASI score is a lower score than the pre-treatment PASI.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With a 1.5 Fold Increase in mRNA Expression of GRAMD1A and DMXL2</measure>
    <time_frame>Biopsy samples for analysis were taken 1 hour post UVB treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Based upon upregulated mRNA expression of MyxA in 1 out of 7 patients treated with Imiquimod, a list of alternative target genes responsive to Imiquimod was generated. The target mRNAs examined included GRAMD1A, IL2RA, TGHD1, DMXL2. The target gene was consider upregulated if there was a 1.5 fold increase in the mRNA expression of the target gene.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Improvement in Lesional Psoriasis Area and Assessment (PASI) Score After Imiquimod and UVB Treatment</title>
        <description>The PASI is a disease burden measure that integrates area, erythema, thickness and scale of each target lesion. The severity score for each region is calculated by adding the scores for redness, thickness and scale (each of which are graded from 0 to 4). The maximum severity score is 12. The higher the PASI, the worse the disease. Thus, an improvement in PASI score is a lower score than the pre-treatment PASI.</description>
