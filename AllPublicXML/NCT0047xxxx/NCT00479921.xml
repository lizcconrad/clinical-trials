  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza (flu) viruses change continuously, therefore also the parts of viruses used in
      influenza vaccines can vary from year to year. In Europe, manufacturers/marketing holders of
      these vaccines are required to be involved in ongoing clinical trials and to present the
      results to the competent authorities each year. The current study is a phase IIIa clinical
      trial with a commercially available vaccine (Influvac速) supplied in pre filled syringes. It
      is part of the ongoing clinical trial program for Influvac速 and will be done to assess the
      immunogenicity and safety and tolerability of next season's trivalent influenza subunit
      vaccine in two groups of healthy subjects: subjects aged &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 60 years and subjects
      &gt;= 61 years of age (elderly).
