             screening through the time of study drug administration;

          -  Sexually active women, unless surgically sterile or at least 1 year post-menopausal,

             administration, and must agree to continue using such precautions through Study Day
             126. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a

             the study; and

          -  Ability to complete the study period, including follow-up period through Study Day
             126.

             screening up through study drug administration;

          -  Current use of biologic agents such as alefacept or tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors
             within 90 days prior to screening up through study drug administration;

          -  Any disease or illness, other than chronic plaque psoriasis, that may require the use
             of systemic corticosteroids during the study period;

          -  Acute illnesses or evidence of significant active infection, such as fever ≥ 38.0°C (≥

             ULN;

          -  Any other abnormal laboratory values in the screening panel that, in the opinion of

             tests may be repeated once at the discretion of the site investigator(s) or qualified
             designee, prior to Study Day 0, to determine eligibility; or
