  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic disorder of the liver causing jaundice and
      liver damage. When Cystic Fibrosis affects the liver, the damaged liver looks like the liver
      in PSC. This study is designed to answer the question whether isolated PSC may be a form of
      CF only in the liver

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a progressive autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in the
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). CFTR mutations cause loss or
      impairment of CFTR-mediated ion transport across epithelial cell membranes. CF affects many
      organs including the respiratory tract, pancreas, intestine, liver and the male reproductive
      tract. Liver disease occurs less frequently than pulmonary disease. CFTR is expressed in the
      bile duct epithelial cells and is responsible for the hydration of biliary secretions.

      CF was until recently, thought to be a multi-organ disease. However, there are now recognized
      non-classical presentations of CF involving a few organs only and now there is well
      established data on single -organ involvement including Congenital Absence of the Vas
      Deferens and recurrent pancreatitis.

      CF and PSC have several features in common. They both affect intrahepatic bile ducts by
      inspisated biliary secretions, chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Is PSC the &quot;single-organ
      presentation&quot; of CF? Patients with PSC will undergo testing of the CF protein channel by
      nasal potential testing. This test is performed by insering a thin plastic tube 2 to 3 cms
      into the nostril and chloride transport can be measured. This test may shows that the patient
      has an abnormality in the CF protein channel.
