  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK961081 has previously been administered to healthy subjects in a nebulised formulation and
      the first part of this study which will be conducted in healthy subjects proposes to bridge
      the change from nebulised to DPI formulation of GSK961081 before administration to patients.
      The second part of the study will be conducted in COPD patients and aims to assess the safety
      and bronchodilator profile of GSK961081 over 24 hours, during 14 days dosing.

    <measure>Part 1: Summary of area under the GSK961081 concentration-time curve (AUC) after a single dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.0 hour [h]) and 15, 30, 45 minutes (M), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h post dose of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for PK analysis were drawn on Day (D) 1 at indicated time points. The AUC from time zero (0M) to 2h (AUC 0-2) was area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the 2h time period. AUC(0-6) was area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0M to 6h. AUC(0-t) was area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0M to last quantifiable concentration. The AUC extrapolated to infinity (inf) (AUC[0-inf]) was calculated as the sum of AUC(0-t) and Ct/lambda z, where Ct is the observed GSK961081 concentration obtained from the log-linear regression analysis of the last quantifiable time-point and lambda z is the terminal phase rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the log transformed concentration-time data. The number of time points used in the estimation of lambda z. Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points; thus, the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the PK population.</description>

    <measure>Part 1: Summary of maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of GSK961081 after a single dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.0h) and 15, 30, 45 M, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h post dose of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for PK analysis were drawn on D1 at indicated time points. The first occurrence of the maximum observed GSK961081 concentration determined directly from the raw concentration-time data after each single dose. All participants were present at the time of measurement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: Summary of last observed plasma concentration (t-last), time of maximum observed concentration (t-max) and terminal elimination half-life (t-half)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.0h) and 15, 30, 45 M, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h post dose of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for PK analysis were drawn on D1 at indicated time points. The t-last and t-max was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data after each single dose. The t-half was obtained as the ratio of ln2/lambda z, where ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2 (approximately 0.693) and lambda z is the terminal phase rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the log transformed concentration-time data after each single dose. Data for adjusted mean is presented as least square mean. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=x,x,x in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points; thus, the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the All Subjects population.</description>

    <description>Lung function tests (FEV1) was recorded whilst the participant was in a sitting position (if taken whilst the participant was on the bed, their legs should be over the edge). All lung function tests was repeated, until three technically acceptable measurements were made. Each measurement should be done at least 1 M apart. Participants must be resting in the body box for at least 30 seconds prior to any assessments. The FEV1 was measured at 15, 30 M, 1, 4, 12 and 24 h post dose of each treatment period on D1 and 14. Data for adjusted mean is presented as least square mean. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=x,x,x,x in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points; thus, the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the All Subjects population.

    <measure>Part 1: Number of participants with Adverse Events (AE) and Serious adverse events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (MO) in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP and can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with its use. The SAE was any untoward MO that, at any dose, results in death, life threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, congenital abnormality or birth defect, that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.

    <description>ECG measurements were made with the participants in a supine position having rested in this position for at least 10 M before each reading. Data is presented as maximum value of glucose at 0-4 h of each treatment period on D1 and D14. The QTcB was derived automatically by the machine. The QTcF was manually derived by dividing QT interval with cube root of division of RR interval by 1000. Where, RR interval (msec) was calculated as square of QT interval divided by QTcB, which was multiplied by 1000. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline value was defined as the mean of the three pre-dose measurements on D1 for each treatment period. Data for adjusted mean is presented as least square mean.</description>
