  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if the study drug, Vardenafil (approved by Health
      Authorities is available on the market for treatment of erectile dysfunction) has an effect
      on bladder function and micturition frequency. The study drug is to be taken in the form of
      tablets twice a day, one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening. A non-active
      treatment (placebo), a sugar pill, will be used as a comparator to see if the new study drug
      works better than no drug. The timing of visits for the study is as follows: the 1st visit
      (screening visit) at beginning of run-in-assessment with qualifying tests for patients:
      electrocardiogram (ECG), safety laboratory and residual urine (by ultrasonography: a
      non-invasive examination using ultrasound for the assessment of the bladder). 2nd visit
      (randomization visit). During visit this should be performed: urodynamic measurements
      (filling cystometry and pressure flow investigations), ECG and safety laboratory. 3rd visit
      (safety visit) takes place at two up to three weeks of randomized treatment. 4th visit (final
      visit)-following test should be done: urodynamic measurements (filling cystometry and
      pressure flow investigations), ECG, safety laboratory and residual urine (by
      ultrasonography); A phone call 24 hours after visit 4 to assess any SAEs.
