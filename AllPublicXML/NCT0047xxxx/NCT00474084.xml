    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first feasibility study is to evaluate the performance of Vesta™ &amp;
      VestaCOR™ (Hydroxy-Apetite coated GenX) stent in de novo native coronary artery lesions. This
      study will provide the longest follow-up experience available.

      This is a randomized, double blind study conducted at three sites, two sites in India and one
      in The Netherlands. To be eligible, a patient will be required to have a de novo stenotic
      lesion of a length that could be covered by a single stent in a native coronary artery of
      diameter 3.0mm and 3.5mm. A total of at least 60 patients and a maximum of 70 patients will
      be treated with Vesta™ &amp; VestaCOR™ stent. These patients will be randomized to either a
      smooth surface nanofilm coated stent (= VestaCOR™) (approx. 35 patients) or to a porous
      coated stent (= Vesta™) (approx. 35 patients).

      All patients will be followed clinically at 30 days, 4 months, 9 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
      years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is  18 years old

          -  Patient is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

          -  Patient is an acceptable candidate for CABG

          -  Clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive territorial functional
             study. Documented stable angina pectoris ((Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
             Classification 1, 2, 3 or 4) or unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia
             (Braunwald Class IB-C, IIB-C, or IIIB-C), or documented silent ischemia

          -  The target lesion is a single de novo coronary artery lesion with 50 and 100%
             stenosis in one of the major epicardial territories (LAD, LCX or RCA). A second target
             lesion in another major epicardial vessel could be treated and this second lesion
             should fit with inclusion/exclusion criteria and will receive the same type of stent.

          -  The target lesion must be covered by one study stent preferably with a margin of at
             least 4mm on each side of the lesion

          -  The target lesion length should be ≤ 11 mm

          -  The target reference vessel diameter must be  3.0mm and  3.5mm

          -  Patient or the patient’s legal representative has been informed of the nature of the
             study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as
             approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical
             site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female of childbearing potential

          -  Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 30%

          -  Evidence of an acute Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction within 72 hours
             preceding the index procedure, unless the CK and CK-MB enzymes are less than twice the
             Upper Normal Limit

          -  Known allergies to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®) or
             ticlopidine (Ticlid®), heparin, Stainless Steel , contrast agent (that cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated) or drugs similar to hydroxyapatite

          -  A platelet count 100,000 cells/mm3 or 700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC 3,000 cells/mm3

          -  Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine 2.0 mg/dl or 150µmol/L)

          -  Total occlusion (TIMI 0 or 1 (one))

          -  Target vessel has evidence of thrombus or is excessively tortuous that makes it
             unsuitable for proper stent delivery and deployment;

          -  Previous bare metal stenting (less than 1 year) anywhere within the target vessel

          -  Previous drug-eluting stenting anywhere within the target vessel;

          -  The target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent
             placement (e.g. but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser,
             rotational atherectomy, etc.)

          -  Significant (50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require
             revascularization or impede run off;

          -  Heavily calcified lesion and/or calcified lesion which cannot be successfully
             predilated

          -  Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft

          -  Ostial target lesion

          -  Target lesion involves a side branch 2.0mm in diameter with an ostial disease

             non-target vessel. Planned intervention of the target vessel after the index procedure
             is not allowed

          -  Stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 6 months

          -  Unprotected Left Main (LM) coronary artery disease (stenosis &gt;50%)

          -  Planned surgery within 6 months after index procedure
