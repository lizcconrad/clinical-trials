  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The retrospective study will help determine whether or not placement of new devices prior to
      the recommended time was associated with a high risk of relapse or treatment failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following information will be collected from the medical record retrospectively:
      demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight), past medical history, laboratory
      results, microbiologic data, data on the patients' devices (type of device, data that it was
      placed, exchanged or removed), treatment and clinical and microbiological outcomes. This will
      all be collected retrospectively.
