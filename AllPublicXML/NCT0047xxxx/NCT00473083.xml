    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if rash caused by erlotinib can be successfully
      treated and if so to determine the optimal treatment approach.

      Hypothesis:

      Hypothesis 1: If the incidence of rash is 50% while on erlotinib, prophylactic monotherapy
      with minocycline can prevent occurrence in 50% of these patients.

      Hypothesis 2: Treatment of rash is successful in improving rash by at least one Grade in 80%
      of patients.

      Hypothesis 3: In patients with untreated rash, the rash will be self-limiting in 25% of
      patients, and 65% will be grade 1, 2A, and 2b. Ten percent will be grade 3 requiring
      treatment with monotherapy intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib has been shown to prolong survival in NSCLC patients who are no longer candidates
      for further chemotherapy. In July 2005, erlotinib was approved in Canada for the treatment of
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, following failure of first or second-line
      chemotherapy.

      Erlotinib's side effect profile includes rash. The incidence of rash in clinical trials has
      been reported to be approximately 50 - 75%, and has been hypothesised to parallel tumour
      response (20).

      The treatment of rash is controversial and many oncologists believe it is untreatable and
      self-limiting. The cause of the rash is not well understood but is felt to be a systemic
      event. Clinical experience of the investigators has suggested that minocycline 100 mg orally
      given twice-daily for 4 weeks and clindamycin 2% and hydrocortisone 1% topical cream for
      moderate to severe rash is a successful treatment.

      The objectives of this trial are to better delineate the rash and its features and to
      describe an optimal treatment. Since the rash is often facial in distribution and can
      therefore lead to physical and psychological distress to the patient, a dermatology life
      quality index will also be completed throughout the study.

    <description>To investigate if the rash caused by erlotinib is self-limiting.
A time variable will be defined to identify the duration from onset of rash until resolution. Resolution will be defined as resolution to severity Grade 1 for patients with rash of maximum severity grade &gt;1 and resolution to Grade 0 for patients with maximum rash severity = 1. For patients where resolution is not observed the time considered will be the maximum time from onset of rash until end of the study.
The analyses will be performed using the following two sub-populations: subjects with maximum severity of rash of Grade 1, 2a and 2b will constitute one sub-population and Grade 3 will be considered the second sub-population.
The comparisons will be performed primarily for Group 1 vs. Group 3 and Group 2 vs. Group 3 and secondly for Group 1 vs. Group 2.</description>

        <title>Time Duration From Onset of Rash Until Resolution</title>
        <description>To investigate if the rash caused by erlotinib is self-limiting.
A time variable will be defined to identify the duration from onset of rash until resolution. Resolution will be defined as resolution to severity Grade 1 for patients with rash of maximum severity grade &gt;1 and resolution to Grade 0 for patients with maximum rash severity = 1. For patients where resolution is not observed the time considered will be the maximum time from onset of rash until end of the study.
The analyses will be performed using the following two sub-populations: subjects with maximum severity of rash of Grade 1, 2a and 2b will constitute one sub-population and Grade 3 will be considered the second sub-population.
The comparisons will be performed primarily for Group 1 vs. Group 3 and Group 2 vs. Group 3 and secondly for Group 1 vs. Group 2.</description>
