  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and tolerability of ascending single oral doses of SAM-315, an
      investigational drug, in healthy adult subjects. To obtain a preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK)
      and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of SAM-315 in healthy subjects and to evaluate the effect
      of a high-fat meal on the PK of SAM-315, an investigation drug, administered to healthy adult
      subjects.
