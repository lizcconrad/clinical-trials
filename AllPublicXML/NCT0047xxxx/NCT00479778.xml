  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand how bazedoxifene is absorbed in the body when it is
      given in combination with 2 different formulations of conjugated estrogens. It is an open
      label study with no placebo control or comparator drugs. Subjects will take one dose of the
      investigation formulation daily for 14 days.
