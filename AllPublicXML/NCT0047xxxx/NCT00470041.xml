      Description: To investigate bioavailability of two anti-viral drugs (lamivudine and
      zidovudine) from a new oral formulation (trial formulation) especially designed for pediatric
      use.

      Interventions: 12 healthy volunteers will receive in a cross-over design two formulations
      i.e. the commercially available tablet formulation and the trial formulation. Blood samples
      (13 over 24 h) will be taken in order to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the drugs
      from both formulations and will be compared.

      Duration of intervention: 2 days + 7 days of wash-out between both oral administrations.
