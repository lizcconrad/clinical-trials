    <textblock>
      SB-568859 is a medication that is being developed for the treatment of atherosclerosis
      (hardening of the arteries). The purpose of this study is to see if there is a difference in
      how the human body takes up the study drug depending on how the study drug is made. This
      study will compare SB-568859 tablets that are made in 2 different ways. This is not a
      treatment study.
