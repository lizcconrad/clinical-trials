      The effect of non-surgical methods for obesity treatment are not fully documented. This study
      focus on the long term effect of an intensiv follow up (the &quot;Evje Model&quot;) compared to a
      regular follow up.

      The &quot;Evje Model&quot; is a combined model, consisting of repeated stays at a specialist centre,
      telephone follow up at home, home groups, self monitoring and close contact with the
      patients' local physician.

      Eighty patients will undergo an intensive lifestyle intervention following the &quot;Evje Model&quot;.
      This group will be randomised into an intervention group and a control group. The
      intervention group will undergo four years of further follow up in accordance with the Evje
      Model, which means two one weeks stays each year at the Evje Clinic, telephone follow up,
      home groups, self monitoring and collaboration with the patients' local physician.

      The control group will be followed up by the patients local physician and a yearly control at
      the Center for Morbid Obesity at Vestfold Hospital (Sykehuset i Vestfold HF). The control
      group will have a yearly week end at Evjeklinikken for testing.

      The purpose is to measure the effect of these two follow up models in regard to weight loss
      maintanance, Quality of Life and comorbidities.
