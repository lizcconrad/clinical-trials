      To assess: a) The prevalence of Modic changes and other findings on lumbar magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), among Spanish adult chronic LBP patients, b) Patient characteristics and
      radiological findings associated with Modic changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten radiologists from six hospitals across six cities in Spain, consecutively recruited 487
      adult patients (263 women and 224 men) in whom lumbar MRI had been prescribed for low back
      pain lasting â‰¥ 3 months. Patients' characteristics and imaging findings were assessed through
      previously validated instruments. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to
      assess the features associated with Modic changes.

      Outcome measures were: Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), life time smoking exposure, degree
      of physical activity, and image features (disk degeneration, type and extension of Modic
      changes, disk contour, annular tears, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis).
