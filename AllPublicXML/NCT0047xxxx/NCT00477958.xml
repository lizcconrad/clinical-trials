      RATIONALE: A study that assesses the ability of older patients to think, learn, remember,
      make judgments, and carry out daily activities may help doctors plan treatment for older
      patients with cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying an assessment tool in older patients with cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether a geriatric assessment tool can predict toxicity to chemotherapy,
           defined as grade 3 or 4 toxicity, hospitalization, dose delay or reduction, or
           discontinuation of chemotherapy due to toxicity, in elderly patients with cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Explore the longitudinal impact of cancer and chemotherapy treatment on geriatric
           assessment parameters.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo assessments of functional status using the Timed Up and Go
      Assessment (measures physical mobility) and Karnofsky Physician-Rated Performance Rating
      Scale; and cognition using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test. These
      assessments are performed by healthcare personnel. Body mass index and the percentage of
      unintentional weight loss and the number of falls in the past 6 months are also assessed.

      Patients also complete the following self-administered questionnaires: Instrumental
      Activities of Daily Living (measures level of functioning and need for services); Activities
      of Daily Living (measures higher levels of physical functioning); Karnofsky Self-Reported
      Performance Rating Scale (related to survival and clinically significant illness); Physical
      Health Section of the Older American Resources and Services Questionnaire (measures
      comorbidity and the impact on daily activities); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;
      Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Activity Limitations Measure (measures the impact of
      cancer on patients' social functioning); and MOS Social Support Survey Emotional/Information
      and Tangible Subscales (measures perceived availability of social support).

      Patients then begin planned chemotherapy.

      After completion of chemotherapy (or a maximum of 12 months from study entry), patients
      undergo assessments and complete self-administered questionnaires as described above.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 750 patients will be accrued for this study.
