  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lapatinib taken together with
      capecitabine in Japanese patients. The study will proceed in two phases; the first
      phase(Part1) will lead to an evaluation of the mainly tolerability as well as PK parameters.
      If there are no major safety concerns in Part 1, the study will move into the second phase
      (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety and clinical activity.

Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of drug. 5-FU and FBAL were evaluated because of the following reasons: (1) capecitabine is an orally administered fluoropyrimidine carbamate selectively activated to fluorouracil (5-FU) in tumors; (2) FBAL is an inactive major metabolite of capecitabine, and metabolites of capecitabine are excreted mainly in urine.</description>

          <title>AUC0-tau of Capecitabine, 5'-Fluorouracil (5-FU), and Alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL)</title>
          <description>PK samples were collected at pre-dose, and at 0.5 (plus or minus 5 minutes), 1, 2, 3, 4 (plus or minus 15 minutes), 6, 8, and 10 hr (plus or minus 30 minutes) after dosing. AUC is defined as the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0-tau). 5-FU and FBAL were evaluated because of the following reasons: (1) capecitabine is an orally administered fluoropyrimidine carbamate selectively activated to fluorouracil (5-FU) in tumors; (2) FBAL is an inactive major metabolite of capecitabine, and metabolites of capecitabine are excreted mainly in urine.</description>
