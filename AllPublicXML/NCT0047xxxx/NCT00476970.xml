  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to implement and in a controlled randomised trial test a program to
      identify and overcome barriers to CRC screening and thus improve CRC screening rates at MGH
      Chelsea HC.

      Our hypothesis is that a bilingual navigator program, enhanced by using trained interpreting
      staff will improve CRC screening rates at MGH Chelsea HC overall, and decrease disparities
      between patients with limited English proficiency and English speakers

    <textblock>
      We developed a training program for five health center interpreters fluent in eight different
      languages. Patients randomly assigned to the study intervention receive an introductory
      letter in their native language. During the initial contact the navigator educates patients
      about CRC screening and explores patients' barriers to CRC screening. Based on results from a
      qualitative study conducted at in 2006, we developed interventions to overcome individual
      barriers to CRC screening tailored to each individual patient. Specific interventions include
      elucidation of culturally-specific health beliefs; teaching about cancer risk, colonoscopy,
      and colon prep administration; and help with appointment-making and transport.
