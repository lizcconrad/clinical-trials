      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of XL844 in combination with
      gemcitabine, how often it should be taken, and how well people with cancer tolerate the
      combination of gemcitabine and XL844.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has a histologically confirmed advanced malignancy (solid tumor or
             lymphoma) that is metastatic or unresectable, and for which standard curative or
             palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, and there are no
             therapies known to prolong survival.

          2. The subject has disease that is assessable by tumor marker, physical, or radiologic
             means.

          3. The subject is ≥18 years old.

          4. The subject has an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of ≤2.

          5. The subject has adequate organ and marrow function.

          6. The subject has the capability of understanding the informed consent document and has
             signed the informed consent document.

          7. Sexually active subjects (male and female) must use medically acceptable methods of
             contraception during the course of the study.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening.

          9. If a subject has received more than three prior regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy,
             more than two biologic regimens, or more than 3000 cGy to &gt;25% of his or her bone
             marrow, the investigator must discuss with the sponsor regarding subject suitability
             before enrollment.

         10. The subject has had no other diagnosis of malignancy (unless non-melanoma skin cancer,
             in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or a malignancy diagnosed ≥5 years ago, and has had
             no evidence of disease for 5 years prior to screening for this study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has received anticancer treatment (eg, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
             immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational agent, or hormones) within 14 days
             prior to the first dose of study drug.

          2. The subject has not recovered to Grade ≤1 from adverse events (AEs) due to
             investigational agents or other medications administered more than 30 days prior to
             the first dose of study drug.

          3. The subject has received radiation to &gt;25% of his or her bone marrow within 30 days of
             XL844 treatment.

          4. The subject has a primary brain tumor or known brain metastases.

          5. The subject has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          6. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          7. The subject is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          8. The subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully
             with the investigator or designee.

          9. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the
             XL844 formulation or gemcitabine.
