      The purpose of this study is to learn how the amount of protein during moderate weight loss
      influences bone health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is unclear whether protein intake during dieting influences bone density. This information
      is important for determining optimal nutrient requirements during weight loss. This study
      will compare the effects of weight loss with a lower-carbohydrate, high-protein (HP) diet to
      a high-carbohydrate, moderate protein (HC) diet on bone mass and quality in postmenopausal
      women (ages 50-70 years) with the hypothesis that bone turnover and loss of bone will be
      reduced on the HP compared to the HC weight loss diet. Bone loss will be partially explained
      by changes in fat mass and estrogen levels.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: A) weight loss with recommended
      level of protein intake, and B) weight loss with higher protein intake. All participants will
      attend regular counseling sessions (about 50 minutes per session) with a dietitian for
      approximately 1 year, and will be asked to take a daily vitamin/mineral supplement. Also,
      depending on their usual food intake, they may be asked to take a calcium tablet to meet the
      recommended intake throughout the study period. Bone, mineral, protein and lipid markers, and
      hormones that influence bones will be measured. These measurements will provide information
      about body composition (fat, muscle mass, and bone mineral density). Participants will be
      asked to attend 8 diet counseling sessions, with the opportunity to attend a total of
      approximately 28 diet counseling sessions during the year.
