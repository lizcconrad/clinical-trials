      This study is designed as a cluster-randomized trial. The cluster unit is at the community
      level. Communities will be randomized to 1 of 2 study arms: DOTS+ACF or DOTS. Communities in
      the DOTS+ACF arm will receive door-to-door symptom screening of the entire population by
      health care workers between 2 and 4 times over a 9-month period. Those communities in the
      DOTS-arm will receive the current standard of care in those communities (PCF). All study
      communities will be receiving between 4 and 6 visits by community health workers annually as
      part of a program to assess and follow-up illnesses in each household. Households with ill
      residents will be visited more often. The intervention for this study is simply adding 3 to 5
      simple questions to the current protocol. For subjects responding positively to these
      questions, results will be returned to the subject at their home and routine, standard of
      care follow-up diagnostic and treatment algorithms will be followed.

      Despite free ARV drugs and free TB treatment, and an expanding DOTS program, TB rates have
      not diminished in this city overall (29), suggesting that DOTS alone will not be sufficient
      to turn the tide. Nevertheless, an elemental ACF strategy did appear to work well in this
      city. A prior International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research (ICIDR), in one
      area of Rio de Janeiro, evaluated the use of the WHO's directly observed therapy, short
      course (DOTS) strategy versus an enhanced DOTS strategy (DOTS-A), which included household
      contact investigation as a means of identifying cases. A statistically significant reduction
      in incidence rates between DOTS versus DOTS-A communities was seen from 2000 to 2002 (Figure
      2), suggesting that ACF strategies can be instrumental in reducing incidence rates if
      subjects are detected and treated. Treatment completion rates among new TB cases were not
      significantly different statistically in the 2 study arms, however treatment completion rates
      overall increased from 68% to 77% over the course of the study. Overall, the DOTS communities
      exhibited little change (+7%) in TB incidence over the 5-year period, while DOTS-A
      communities showed a combined decrease (-14%) (P&lt;0.05). The difference suggests that a large
      scale ACF campaign at a more intensive level (ie, door-to-door case finding) could have a
      significant impact on long-term TB incidence in a community.
