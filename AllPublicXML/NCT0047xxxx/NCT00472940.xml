  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer and its complications are common problems. In most cases, this condition has a
      profound impact on survival and quality of life (QoL). Fatigue, sexual dysfunction, decreased
      sexual drive, depression and poor appetite are commonly seen in these patients. However,
      these symptoms also are seen in men with other conditions including those with low
      testosterone levels.

      The objective of this study is to determine the number of male patients with cancer that have
      low testosterone levels and to establish the relationship between testosterone levels and the
      symptoms that these patients experience.
