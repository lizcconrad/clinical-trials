    <textblock>
      Combined the chemoembolization and Radiofrequency ablation for the hepatocellular carcinoma
      greater than 3 cm,the ablation volume of coagulation necrosis can be significantly
      increased,which may be enable effective treatment of patients with HCC greater than 3 cm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether the effectiveness of a combination of transcatheter arterial
      chemoembolization(TACE) and radiofrequency ablation(RFA) is superior to TACE and RFA alone in
      treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)greater than 3 cm and to analyze the
      factors affecting the outcomes.

      The patients with HCC of 3 or fewer lesions, each 3cm greater in diameter entered this
      randomized controlled trial. The primary end point was survival, and the secondary end points
      were tumor response.
