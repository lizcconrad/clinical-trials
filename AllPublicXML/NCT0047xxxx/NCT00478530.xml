      To evaluate the scotopic and photopic ERG responses before and after one month of
      intravitreal avastin injection in patients with choroidal neovascularization.

      A positive finding that will reveal a toxic effect of intravitreal avastin injection on any
      component of the retina will have a significant important clinical impact regarding the
      decision whether the benefit of avastin treatment for CNV will prevail over toxic effect.

    <textblock>
      The study will include 20 patients who are diagnosed with CNV and were submitted for
      intravitreal injection of avastin. Patients with uncontrolled glaucoma, any ocular operation
      two months prior to the injection, ocular inflammatory disease, systemic hypertension treated
      with more than one medication, myocardial infarct, congestive heart disease will not be
      included in the study. After the patient will approve to participate in the study and will
      fall in with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient will sign a written consent
      statement (enclosed).

      Medical history and ophthalmic examination will be written in the study file. The patients
      will undergo the full-field ERG test using the ISCEV Protocol. Since the ERG is a non
      invasive test the patient will be admitted on the same day for intravitreal avastin in the
      designated eye. After one month the patient will undergo identical ERG protocol in addition
      to the standard follow-up examinations protocol for intravitreal avastin injection (1 day, 1
      week, 1 month). The other eye will serve as control group.
