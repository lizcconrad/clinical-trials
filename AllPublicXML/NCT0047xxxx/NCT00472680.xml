  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether the amount of dietary protein can influence
      bone health during the weight loss after weight loss surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is unclear whether the amount of protein in the diet during caloric restriction influences
      bone density. This information is important for determining optimal nutrient requirements
      during weight loss. This study will examine usual and higher dietary protein intake during
      severe weight loss following weight loss surgery on bone turnover, mass and quality in women,
      with the hypothesis that higher protein intake will reduce bone turnover and loss, and/or
      prevent the changes in bone quality associated with severe weight loss in women ages 18 to 70
      years.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: A) weight loss with recommended
      level of protein intake, or B) weight loss with higher protein intake. A dietitian will
      provide instructions for a reduced calorie, well balanced diet throughout the 12-month study
      using a nutrition-education behavior- modification program. Participants will have the
      opportunity to speak with the dietitian about their diet by phone, or on-site twice per
      month. In addition they will be asked to take a daily vitamin/mineral supplement and,
      depending on their usual food intake, they may be asked to take a calcium tablet to meet the
      recommended intake throughout the study period. Bone, mineral, protein and lipid markers, and
      hormones that influence bones will be measured. These measurements will provide information
      about body composition (fat, muscle mass, and bone mineral density).
