  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this case-control study, cases were chronic LBP patients aged 30-50 in whom a lumbar MRI
      had been prescribed. Controls were subjects aged 30-50 in whom a cranial MRI had been
      prescribed for headache, who did not suffer from LBP and had no history of clinically
      relevant LBP. Two hundred and forty cases and 64 controls were recruited consecutively in
      Radiology services across six cities in Spain. Imaging findings and subjects' characteristics
      were gathered through previously validated instruments. Radiologists who interpreted MRIs
      were blinded to subjects' characteristics. A multivariate logistic regression model was
      developed to assess the association of Modic changes with LBP, adjusting for sex, age,
      body-mass index, lifetime exposure to smoking, physical activity, and disk degeneration.

    <description>All subjects screened for this study were aged 30 to 50 years, had been referred to participating Radiology services, and underwent a lumbar MRI. Controls were headache patients who had been referred for a cranial MRI, which turned out to be normal, and who either had no history of LBP or had only experienced one episode in their life, which had lasted for less than 7 days.</description>

        Cases: chronic LBP patients aged 30-50 in whom a lumbar MRI had been prescribed. Controls:
        subjects aged 30-50 in whom a cranial MRI had been prescribed for headache, who did not
        suffer from LBP and had no history of clinically relevant LBP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For all subjects: age between 35 and 50 years.

          -  For subjects with LBP: having a diagnosis of chronic low back pain (of 3 or more
             months' duration) as the reason for an MRI.

          -  For subjects without LBP: subjects with a cranial MRI (described as normal) for
             cephalalgia, and who had neither current LBP nor history of LBP.

        Exclusion criteria were: history of spine surgery, current pregnancy, scoliosis with &gt;15ยบ
        curvature, vertebral fractures, &quot;red flags&quot; for potential underlying systemic diseases
        (oncologic disease during the previous 5 years, constitutional symptoms -unexplained weight
        loss, fever, chills-, history of intravenous drug use, or immunocompromised host), or signs
        suggesting cauda equine syndrome (relevant or progressive paresia, loss of sphincter
        control or saddle anesthesia).
