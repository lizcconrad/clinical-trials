      The primary objective is to assess the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel administered
      intraperitoneally with heat at the time of second-look surgery in patients with stage II/III
      ovarian carcinoma.

      This is a phase I study of intraperitoneal hyperthermic docetaxel given at the time of second
      look surgery following front-line normothermic intraperitoneal and intravenous
      cisplatin/paclitaxel for patients with stage II and III ovarian carcinoma. The primary
      objectives are to assess the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel administered
      intraperitoneally with heat at this time and assess the toxicity and morbidity associated
      with this treatment. Eligible patients will have had a complete clinical response to
      front-line therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have had a complete clinical response (negative clinical examination,
             CA125 and CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis) to front-line therapy for stage II/III
             ovarian, primary peritoneal or Fallopian tube carcinoma. This will have included
             initial surgery followed by combined IV/IP chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel.
             Patients must have had a minimum of three courses of IP therapy with both paclitaxel
             and cisplatin

          -  Second surgery to be performed no more than 3 months from last course of initial
             chemotherapy

          -  Age greater than 18 years and negative pregnancy if has child-bearing potential

          -  GOG performance status less than 2

          -  Medically fit for surgery

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined in the protocol hepatic
             function Total Bilirubin ULN AST and ALT and Alkaline Phosphatase must be within the
             range allowing for eligibility. In determining eligibility the more abnormal of the
             two values AST or ALT) should be used.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  The effects of docetaxel on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because taxanes are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have completed front-line therapy for ovarian cancer more than 3 months
             prior to HIPEC.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with stage IV disease including previous parenchymal liver disease, brain
             metastasis or cytologically-confirmed chest metastasis

          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to TaxotereÂ® or other
             drugs formulated with polysorbate 80. History of allergic reactions attributed to
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition used in this study in addition
             to Taxotere.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  More than grade 2 peripheral neuropathy from prior chemotherapy

          -  Pregnant, breast-feeding or known to be HIV positive

          -  Prior malignancy other than non-melanomatous skin cancer more than 5 years ago

          -  No prior chemotherapy other than for front-line ovarian cancer or radiation for any
             reason.

          -  Stomatitis of any grade

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or other conditions that would limit compliance with
             study requirements should be excluded.
