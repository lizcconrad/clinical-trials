  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the afamelanotide (CUV1647) formulation is
      effective in preventing PLE episodes or reducing the severity of PLE symptoms in patients
      with a well documented history of the disease. The study also aims to determine whether
      treatment with afamelanotide (CUV1647) can reduce the use of rescue medication in this group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polymorphic Light Eruption (PLE) is a prevalent photosensitivity disorder, occurring in up to
      20% of the European and US populations and up to 5% of the Australian population. The disease
      is characterised by a rash that is intensely itchy with blisters, bumps and patches
      presenting on areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun. There is a lack of
      effective treatment available for the condition but the most common available forms of
      therapy include sun avoidance and the use of the use of steroids and/or phototherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 - 70 years at inclusion.

          -  Well documented history of moderate/severe PLE as diagnosed/confirmed by a
             photodermatologist or photobiologist. Newly diagnosed patients with moderate/severe
             PLE can be included if numbers of established patients are limited provided their
             diagnosis is confirmed by a photodermatologist or photobiologist.

          -  Recurrent episodes that occur at least once a year, developing in own country (to
             exclude patients affected only when traveling to sunnier climates).

          -  Have given written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Personal history of melanoma, lentigo maligna or multiple (3 or more) dysplastic nevi.

          -  Current Bowen's Disease, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or other
             malignant skin lesions.

          -  Documented history of other photosensitive conditions.

          -  Female who is pregnant (confirmed by positive serum Î²-HCG pregnancy test prior to
             baseline) or lactating.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential that are not using adequate contraceptive measures.
