    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the benefits of continuing celecoxib through six weeks of total knee
      arthroplasty recovery. This is a randomized, double blind study with a group of approximately
      130 primary total knee patients. All patients will receive celecoxib throughout their
      hospitalization as per current minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty protocol. At the
      time of hospital discharge, participating patients will be randomly placed on either
      celecoxib 200mg twice a day or a placebo twice a day.

      This study will determine if the continued use of celecoxib for six weeks after total knee
      arthroplasty hospitalization will further decrease narcotic consumption, improve knee range
      of motion, improve ambulatory ability, and improve patient satisfaction over patients
      receiving celecoxib only during the acute hospitalization.
