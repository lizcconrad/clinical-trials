  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes with poor sugar control can lead to blindness, heart attacks, and amputations.
      Latinos are more at risk for diabetes. A fotonovela is a type of comic book commonly read by
      Latinos that might be a way to teach them about the risk of high sugars. The researchers will
      give patients either a fotonovela about diabetes or one with nothing to do with diabetes.
      Then they will compare how well sugars were controlled afterward in each group. This way they
      can see if these fotonovelas were useful.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated glucose in diabetics is a risk for amputation, renal failure, coronary artery
      disease, neuropathy, and blindness. Controlling glucose better as measured by hemoglobin A1c
      (A1c) reduces risk for these complications. Information itself is often not enough to change
      behaviors that increase risk for these complications. Latinos in America are particularly at
      risk for diabetes (DM) and its complications. A fotonovela is a booklet telling a story using
      photos with superimposed speech bubbles much like an American style comic book. These are
      commonly read by Latinos. A fotonovela that tells a story about diabetes complications in a
      culturally appropriate context that emphasized impact on family might help motivate Hispanic
      patients to control their sugar better. We propose a single-blinded, randomized, controlled
      trial of a DM themed fotonovela against a non-DM themed fotonovela to assess its effect on
      glycemia as measured by A1c. After a primary care provider has seen a Latino type 2 diabetic
      patient, the investigator will consent them then give them an envelope with the DM themed
      fotonovela or another that is indistinguishable in the sealed envelope. The primary outcome
      is hemoglobin A1c one month or more after randomization. Secondary outcomes will A1c in the
      1-5 month and 6-12 month time period looking for durability of effect. A sample size of 260
      allows for a 30% fallout and gives an 80% power to detect a 0.5% change in A1c with a 1.2%
      standard deviation on that change with a two-tailed alpha of 0.05.
