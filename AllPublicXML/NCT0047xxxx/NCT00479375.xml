  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV)-based cervical screening is known to increase sensitivity for
      detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Randomized trials of
      longitudinal efficacy are required to assess whether these gains represent overdiagnosis or a
      protective effect.

      Methods: A total of 12527 women, aged 32-38, attending population-based invitational
      screening in Sweden were randomized 1:1 to HPV test and cytology (intervention arm) or
      cytology only (control arm). HPV-positive women were invited for a second HPV test at least
      one year later and women with type-specific persistent infections were then invited to
      colposcopy. A similar number of random double-blinded procedures are performed in the control
      arm. Women are followed with comprehensive registry-based follow-up. Primary outcome is the
      relative rates of CIN grade 2 or worse (CIN2/CIN3+) found in subsequent screening. Secondary
      outcomes are the relative rates of CIN2/CIN3+ found in the aseline screening and outcomes
      stratified by grade of CIN (CIN 2 or CIN3+).
