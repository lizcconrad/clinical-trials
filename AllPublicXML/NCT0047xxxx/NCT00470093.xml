      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Interleukin-6 may
      stimulate the white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Giving interferon alfa together with
      interleukin-6 may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well giving interferon alfa
      together with interleukin-6 works in treating patients with recurrent multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent multiple myeloma treated with
           recombinant interferon alfa and recombinant interleukin-6.

        -  Determine the safety and optimal dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the impact of this regimen on clonogenic growth of myeloma cells in serial in
           vitro assays.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) once daily. Beginning 1
      month later, patients also receive recombinant interleukin-6 SC once daily. Treatment
      continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
