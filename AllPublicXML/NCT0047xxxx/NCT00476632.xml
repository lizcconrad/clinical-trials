      increase a person's risk of developing certain types of cancer.

      For this study, you will be asked to complete a personal interview. During the interview, you
      will be asked questions about your demographics (age, sex, etc.), certain environmental
      exposures, your medical history, family history, your diet, and your smoking and alcohol use
      histories. It should take around 50 minutes to complete the interview.

      You will also have around 2 ½ tablespoons of blood drawn for special tests. These tests will
      look for any biologic factors associated with certain cancers. The interview and blood draw
      will be scheduled at the time and place of your convenience. You will not be informed of the
      results of any of the testing done with your samples.

      There is a possibility that you might be contacted in the future about if researchers need
      clarification on any of information already collected. You are free to refuse any further
      participation if you wish.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 1,500 participants will take part in this study.
