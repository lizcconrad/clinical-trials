  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the only causative treatment of IgE-mediated
      allergies. The disadvantages of SIT, however, are the requirement of numerous allergen
      administrations over three to five years, and that the treatment itself causes frequent
      allergic reactions. We aim at enhancing grass pollen SIT in hay fever patients by injecting
      the allergen directly into subcutaneous lymph nodes. In a monocentric randomized trial safety
      and efficacy of intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT) with 3 low dose grass pollen extract
      injections over 2 months are compared to subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) using 54
      injections over 3 years.
