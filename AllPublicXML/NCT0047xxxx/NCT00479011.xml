  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypovolaemia and tissue hypoperfusion can pass undetected during and after major surgery. The
      resulting systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction, often not clinically apparent
      for several days, may lead to increased morbidity and mortality and prolonged hospital stay.

      In this regard, intraoperative optimization of circulatory status by volume loading has been
      shown to improve the outcome of patients undergoing high-risk surgery.

      Indeed, several reports (1-7) have shown that monitoring and maximizing stroke volume by
      volume loading (until stroke volume reaches a plateau, actually the plateau of the
      Frank-Starling curve) during high-risk surgery decreases the incidence of post-operative
      complications and the length of hospital stay.

      Unfortunately, this strategy has required so far the measurement of stroke volume by a
      cardiac output monitor, as well as a specific training period for the operators (8), and
      hence is not applicable in many institutions as well as in many countries.

      The arterial pulse pressure variation (∆PP) induced by mechanical ventilation is known to be
      a very accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness, i.e. of the position on the preload/stroke
      volume relationship (Frank-Starling curve) (9).

      By increasing cardiac preload, volume loading induces a rightward shift on the preload/stroke
      volume relationship and hence a decrease in ∆PP. Patients who have reached the plateau of the
      Frank-Starling relationship can be identified as patients in whom ∆PP is low (9).

      Therefore, the clinical and intraoperative goal of “maximizing stroke volume by volume
      loading” can be achieved simply by minimizing ∆PP.

      We designed the present study to investigate whether monitoring and minimizing ∆PP by volume
      loading during high-risk surgery may improve post-operative outcome and decrease the duration
      of post-operative hospital stay.

      Study design Single centre randomized controlled trial

      Investigation centre Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, Santa Casa de Misericórdia
      de Passos, Passos MG, Brazil

      Inclusion criteria

        -  medico-surgical pre-operative decision of post-operative ICU admission (because of
           co-morbidities or/and the surgical procedure)

        -  age &gt; 18 yr

        -  elective surgery

      Exclusion criteria

        -  no informed consent

        -  cardiac arrhythmias

        -  body mass index &gt; 40

        -  patients undergoing surgery with an open thorax

        -  patients undergoing neurosurgery

        -  enrolment in any other protocol

      Ethics committee The study has been approved by the ethical committee of Santa Casa de
      Misericórdia de Passos (Passos, MG, Brazil).

      Informed consent Written informed consent will be required for each patient.

      Start date Sept 22, 2005

      Finishing date January 23, 2006

      Randomisation Randomisation will be done pre-operatively using sealed envelopes. Patients
      will be assigned to a Control group (group C) or to an Intervention group (group I)

      Intraoperative monitoring In group I, a specific multiparameter bedside monitor (DX 2020,
      Dixtal, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) will be utilized to record continuously and simultaneously the
      ECG, the pulse oximetry signal, the arterial pressure curve and the capnographic signal.

      A specific software is uploaded into this monitor, allowing the recognition of respiratory
      cycles (from the analysis of the capnographic signal) and the automatic calculation and
      display of ∆PP.

      Intervention During the surgical procedure, patients will be managed according to standard of
      care at Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Passos.

      Group C will receive per-operative fluid at the discretion of the anesthetist. Group I will
      receive additional hydroxyethylstarch 6% (HES) boluses in order to minimize and maintain ∆PP
      ≤ 10%. During the postoperative period, both groups will be managed by intensivists (in the
      ICU) and clinicians (in the wards) not involved in the intraoperative management nor in data
      collection. These individuals will not be informed of patient allocation.

      Data collection Over the study period all data will be collected prospectively. Patients will
      be followed up until hospital discharge.

      Data collection prior to surgery Parameters to be recorded before the surgical procedure are
      presented in table 1.

      The body mass index is calculated according to the standard formula (BMI = weight/height2).

      Serum creatinine, prothrombin time, hemoglobin, and platelets will be obtained from routine
      pre-operative biological tests.

      Data collection during surgery Parameters to be recorded during the surgical procedure are
      presented in table 2.

      Data collection after surgery Data collection prior to and during surgery will be done by one
      individual. Data collection after surgery will be done by another individual not aware of
      patient allocation.

      Information and parameters to be collected after surgery are presented in tables 3 and 4.

      During the 24h following ICU admission, blood lactate will be measured every 6h and the mean
      lactate value will be calculated over the first 24h ICU period.

      Postoperative infectious, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, hematologic, and renal
      complications (table 4) will be recorded according to criteria previously used by other
      investigators (10-11).

      Duration of mechanical ventilation, of ICU stay, and of hospital stay, as well as hospital
      mortality will be recorded too.

      Data will be collected systematically at days 1,2, and 5, as well as at ICU discharge, and
      hospital discharge.

      Statistical analysis Data will be analysed comparing patients in group C with those in group
      I on an intention-to-treat basis.

      The primary outcome measure is the duration of postoperative hospital stay. On the basis of
      our own hospital registry, the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay in group C is a
      priori estimated at 16 ± 8 days (mean ± SD).

      According to previous publications (1,2), we postulated that the mean duration of
      postoperative hospital stay in group I could be 35% lower.

      A sample size of 33 patients in each group was calculated for a 0.05 difference (two sided)
      with a power of 80% (12).

      Secondary outcome measures are the number of post-operative complications per patient, as
      well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

      Interim analyses and stopping rules An intermediate analysis after the enrolment of the first
      33 patients is planed, in order to readjust the population sample size if necessary, or to
      stop the trial in case a significant reduction in length of hospital stay (primary endpoint)
      is observed.

      Role of funding source Dixtal (Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) will provide and upload the automatic
      calculation software in a bedside monitor owned by Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Passos
      (Passos, MG, Brazil).

      Dixtal had no role in the study design, and will have no role in data collection, data
      analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author (Dr F.
      Michard) will have full access to all data in the study and will have final responsibility
      for the decision to submit for publication.
