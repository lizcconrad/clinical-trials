  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is known to be associated with an increased risk of ocular
      surface disease (dry eye), likely due to the reduction of both estrogens and androgens seen
      in this condition. From preliminary data, we suspect that women with Turners syndrome (45,
      XO), a genetic abnormality that affects sex hormone levels, are also at increased risk of
      ocular surface disease. Comparing POF and TS women may allow us to distinguish different
      mechanisms for ocular surface disease, due to the different etiologies of hormonal (estrogen
      and androgen) alterations posed by POF and TS.
