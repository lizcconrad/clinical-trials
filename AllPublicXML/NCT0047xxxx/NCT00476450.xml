      This study will examine bacteria in patients mouths at different times during stem cell
      transplantation and recovery. Drugs patients receive as part of the conditioning process for
      a stem cell transplant increase their risk of infection. There might be a link between the
      bacteria in the mouth and the bacteria that can cause infections. Knowing the changes in
      bacteria might help researchers determine the best method to prevent infections.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to receive a stem cell transplant may be
      eligible for this study.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

      Review of medical records

      Interview about their oral care

      Oral examination

      Collection of oral specimens just before the stem cell transplant, immediately after the
      transplant, and 3 weeks after the transplant. The specimens are obtained as follows:

        -  &lt;TAB&gt;-About one-fourth teaspoon of saliva is collected with a suction device similar to
           that used in a dental office.

        -  &lt;TAB&gt;-Plaque from the surface of a tooth is collected with a plastic toothpick.

        -  &lt;TAB&gt;-Skin cells from the inside of the cheek and the surface of the tongue are
           collected with a small soft brush.

        -  &lt;TAB&gt;-If a tube is inserted into the patient s lungs to assist breathing and the patient
           is admitted to the intensive care unit, a specimen from the lungs is collected.

      Patients are followed for 100 days after their transplant. Additional oral specimens are
      obtained from those who develop signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mouth is a complex biological ecosystem normally containing over 700 different species of
      bacteria. These bacteria live in an exopolysacchride matrix biofilm. Usually, bacteria
      colonize the oral cavity benignly. However, there are several studies in critically ill
      patients demonstrating changes in oral flora with acute illness. Identification of
      respiratory pathogens in the mouth has led researchers to hypothesize that a relationship
      exists between the oral cavity and pulmonary infections. A common complication of allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) is infection and pneumonia. Identification of
      potential pathogens in the oral cavity of allogeneic stem cell patients could indicate a
      similar association between oral pathogens and infection. A few studies describe the oral
      microbial community in these patients and the possibility that these organisms are a source
      of infection.

      The primary objective of this study is to describe the changes in oral microbial flora of
      allogeneic SCT patients at three time points during their treatment and recovery. Observed
      differences in microbial organisms from baseline (prior to transplantation), through
      neutropenia (within 48 hours of nadir post-transplantation) and myeloid engraftment (14-21
      days post transplantation) will be described.

      In the course of their treatment, if patients develop respiratory signs and symptoms that
      require either a re-admission to an inpatient unit or intensive care unit admission, then
      additional oral specimens will be collected.

      The secondary objective is to assess the oral microbial flora found after development of
      respiratory signs and symptoms in allogeneic PBSCT patients in the first 100 days
      post-transplant. In addition, if the patient requires intubation, tracheal aspirates and oral
      specimens will be collected.

      The population is composed of adult patients who are planning to undergo an allogeneic PBSCT
      and can provide informed consent. The design is a prospective, descriptive study of the
      microbial flora of the oral cavity of adult allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. Saliva
      specimens, dental plaque and mucosal brushings will be collected at the three different
      times. Oral specimens will be obtained from patients who develop respiratory signs or
      symptoms that require an additional inpatient or intensive care unit admission. Patients will
      be followed and assessed for respiratory signs, symptoms, inpatient or ICU admission until
      day 100 post-transplant. The presence of bacteria (type and species) will be determined by
      molecular genetics. The identification of bacteria will be studied using various comparative
      molecular techniques, including DNA arrays and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All adult patients admitted to the Clinical Research Center of the NIH who are 18 years of
        age or older who are scheduled to undergo an allogeneic PBSCT are eligible for enrollment.
        Collection of oral specimens in children who are allogeneic transplant recipients would
        increase the anxiety in these participants and may require sedation. For this reason
        children will be excluded from this protocol.

        All adult patients who provide informed consent and who are scheduled to receive an
        allogeneic bone marrow transplant are eligible for enrollment.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who have had recent oral surgery or oral trauma will be excluded.

        Patients with tracheostomies will also be excluded.

        Patients with sickle cell disease or chronic granulomatous disease who are being
        transplanted will be excluded from the protocol.

        Patients who are less than 18 years of age will be excluded.
