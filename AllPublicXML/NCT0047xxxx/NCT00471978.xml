      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer. It may also help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is analyzing the DNA in blood and tissue samples from patients
      with lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung-cancer risk in patients with lung
           cancer.

        -  Assess the role of germline polymorphisms in DNA repair genes, p53 pathway genes, and a
           matrix metalloproteinase gene (tumor invasion factor) in lung-cancer risk, after
           adjusting for potential confounders.

        -  Assess the roles of gender and age in the genetic susceptibility of lung cancer.

        -  Assess the role of genetic polymorphisms in modifying the diet-lung cancer risk
           association (gene-diet and exploratory gene-gender-diet and gene-gene-diet
           interactions).

        -  Assess the role of polymorphisms on the risk of developing specific histologic subtypes
           of lung cancer in case-only analyses.

        -  Determine whether continued exposures to mainstream and/or second-hand tobacco smoking
           is associated with poorer clinical prognosis in patients treated for lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a case-control study.

      Blood samples are collected from patients and controls. Samples are analyzed by polymerase
      chain reaction for gene polymorphisms. Genes to be studied include GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1,
      ERCC2, XRCC1, EPHX, NAT-2, p53 gene, CYP1A1, NQO1, MnSOD, and GPX1. Tissue samples collected
      from patients undergoing surgery and blood samples are archived for future studies.

      Patients and controls complete questionnaires about diet, medical history, and
      occupational/environmental history.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,400 patients and 3,400 controls will be accrued for this
      study.
