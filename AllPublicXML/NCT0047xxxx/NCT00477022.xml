      the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of vacuum-compression effects of
      Vasotrain on the diabetic foot ulcers using stereological method based on Cavalieri’s
      principle in diabetic patients.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers are common and serious complications of chronic diabetes mellitus. The
      prevalence of foot ulcers among patients with diabetes is 15%. The length of hospital stay is
      approximately 60% longer among patients with foot ulcers, as compared with those without
      ulcers. Diabetic foot ulcers accounts for &gt;50% of all nontraumatic lower-leg
      amputations.Although, current preventive methods and treatment modalities have been effective
      in healing foot ulcers, statistics show high incidence of foot ulcers and amputations in
      individuals with diabetes.On the other hand, only a few studies were performed on the effects
      of Vasotrain in healing diabetic foot ulcers. The use of the machine enhances the delivery of
      oxygen and nutrients to the area, which in turn, facilitate wound healing
