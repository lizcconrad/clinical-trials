  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The test compound and subject of this clinical trial is the haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier,
      HBOC-201 (Hemopure). HBOC-201, initially developed as an alternative to red blood cells for
      surgical patients, has the ability to restore tissue oxygenation in persistently ischemic
      tissue. The development of this new class of compounds, referred to as oxygen therapeutics,
      provides an opportunity to test the safety and efficacy of a new approach to management of
      myocardial ischemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of their ability to perfuse and deliver oxygen, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers
      (HBOC) may be considered in the treatment of several ischemic conditions, such as acute
      coronary syndromes (ACS). Elective percutaneous intervention (PCI) induces transient
      myocardial ischemia due to reduction of coronary flow during balloon inflation in the
      coronary artery, thus simulating in a control setting, the occurrence of an ACS.
