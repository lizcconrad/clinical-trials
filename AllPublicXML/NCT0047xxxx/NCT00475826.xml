      Study Title: Evaluation of chylomicrons metabolism in sub-clinical atherosclerosis in
      patients whit Heterozigous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) treated with statin plus
      ezetimibe.

      Background:

      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a marker of sub-clinical coronary atherosclerosis
      which correlates with higher risk of clinical events. It was already demonstrated that CAC is
      more prevalent in patients with FH compared with normal individuals. A number of studies
      demonstrated that plasmatic removal of chylomicrons is defective in patients with
      atherosclerosis. Despite the fact that is still controversial whether this impairment occurs
      in patients with HF when compared to normal controls, the kinetics of chylomicrons has not
      been studied in HF patients with and without atherosclerosis and more important, it is not
      clear if those changes may be observed in the sub-clinical disease, as reported for CAC in
      asymptomatic individuals.

      Previous studies have demonstrated the inverse correlation among LDL-C levels and the removal
      of remnants chylomicrons using artificial chylomicrons technique. It is also well known that
      high doses of more potent statins are more effective to remove chylomicrons from the plasma
      due to better expression of LDL-C receptors through plasma LDL-C reduction. It was not
      evaluated yet if the association of ezetimibe and statin, enhancing LDL-C receptors
      expression in the liver would enhance the efficacy of the monotherapy with statins to remove
      artificial chylomicrons in patients with HF.

      Study design:

      Open, randomized, single-blinded study in which twenty six outpatients from the Lipids
      Clinical Unit at the Heart Institute (INCOR), University of SÃ£o Paulo, previously diagnosed
      with FH according to US MED PED criteria, without history of CD and a CAC evaluation by MSCT
      (Multiple Sensors Computed Tomography) in the previous year will be compared to 26 control
      individuals matched by age and sex collected from the database of the Lipids Metabolism
      Laboratory.

      Patients will be randomized to receive simvastatin 40 mg as monotherapy or in combination
      with ezetimibe 10 mg and will undergoing three kinetics studies to demonstrate the effects of
      simvastatin 40 mg on the kinetics of the chylomicrons along with other laboratorial dosages (
      lipid fractions, hepatic enzymes and CK).

      The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate if there is any correlation among the
      reduction of the plasma clearance of chylomicrons by the artificial chylomicrons technique
      and the presence of sub-clinical atherosclerosis; the secondary endpoint is to evaluate if
      ezetimibe/simvastatin enhances the effects of simvastatin alone in the removal of
      chylomicrons in patients with HF.
