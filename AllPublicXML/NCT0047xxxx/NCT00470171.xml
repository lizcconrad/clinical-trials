    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study with direct individual benefit. It is a randomized, double blind
      placebo controlled study whose aim is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of
      ursodesoxycholic acid in patients who have been diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

      The hepatoprotective effects of ursodesoxycholic acid may ameliorate the hepatic impairment
      associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis leading to subsequent significant decreases in
      transaminase elevations and non-invasive markers for hepatic fibrosis A positive response is
      defined as a significantly larger decrease in average ALAT levels between the time of
      inclusion in the study and the end of the treatment for the ursodesoxycholic acid group as
      compared to the placebo group.

      The duration of the study will be 12 months. An end of treatment evaluation (EoT) will take
      place at the end of the 12th month of treatment.
