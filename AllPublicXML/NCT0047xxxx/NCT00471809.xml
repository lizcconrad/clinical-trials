      The MARS trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study that compares the capacity
      of azithromycin or montelukast to placebo as effective adjunctive therapy that allows
      reduction of inhaled corticosteroids in children ages 6 to 17 years with moderate to severe
      persistent asthma. The primary null hypothesis is that in children with moderate-to-severe
      persistent asthma, a macrolide antibiotic (azithromycin) or a leukotriene receptor antagonist
      (montelukast) will provide a steroid-sparing effect when compared to placebo as the dose of
      inhaled corticosteroid is reduced. This will be tested following achievement of control of
      symptoms with moderate to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid in combination with a long-acting
      bronchodilator agonist. Use of these doses for the inhaled corticosteroid will be based on
      NHLBI step-up guidelines to achieve asthma control.

      The MARS trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study that compares the capacity
      of azithromycin or montelukast to placebo as effective adjunctive therapy that allows
      reduction of inhaled corticosteroids in children ages 6 to 17 years with moderate-to-severe
      persistent asthma. The primary null hypothesis is that in children with moderate-to-severe
      persistent asthma, a macrolide antibiotic (Mac - azithromycin) or a leukotriene receptor
      antagonist (LTRA - montelukast) will provide a steroid-sparing effect when compared to
      placebo as the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS - budesonide) is reduced. This will be
      tested following achievement of control of symptoms with moderate to high-dose ICS in
      combination with a long-acting bronchodilator agonist (LABA - salmeterol). Use of these doses
      for the inhaled corticosteroid will be based on NHLBI step-up guidelines to achieve asthma
      control. Inadequate asthma control is defined as either:

        1. chronic poor control: a) symptoms, or albuterol use for symptoms or low peak flow, or
           peak flow less than 80% baseline on greater than 3 days per week on average, or b)
           nocturnal awakenings for asthma symptoms requiring albuterol 2 or more nights over 2
           weeks of observation, or c) FEV1 less than 80% of the best pre-randomization value on 2
           consecutive visits 1-4 days apart, or

        2. an asthma exacerbation as determined by need for systemic corticosteroids

      Treatment in the run-in period will be determined by the child's status at the first visit.
      At enrollment (V0) all patients will be given budesonide as the ICS and salmeterol as the
      LABA. Children will be treated with salmeterol BID and a dose of ICS based on chronic
      medication use with stepping-down based on time and symptoms until criteria for inadequate
      control as indication for stepping-up the dose of ICS. When inadequate control is documented
      (V1), a four-day course of prednisone will be administered and the dose of ICS (still
      administered with salmeterol BID) will be doubled to establish control. The children will be
      followed with monthly clinic visits and interim phone calls, emphasizing use of daily diary
      to document symptoms and doses of albuterol required. Reestablishment of control during a
      2-week interval will prompt randomization. If control is not yet established by the first
      increase in ICS dose during the stabilization period, the dose can be doubled along with a
      second prednisone course until a maximum of budesonide of 1600 mcg/day is attained. The daily
      dose of budesonide at randomization will be a minimum of 800 mcg to allow for a maximum of
      4-fold reduction of dose, and a maximum of 1600 mcg to allow for patient safety considering
      side effects of high dose ICS.

      When clinical control is achieved by the increased dose of ICS, a child will then be
      randomized (V2) to one of the three treatment arms, (1) placebo (one placebo tablet and one
      or two placebo capsules), (2) azithromycin (one placebo tablet and one or two capsules
      containing azithromycin with the dose based on weight), or (3) montelukast (one tablet
      containing montelukast with the dose based on age as indicated in the package insert and one
      or two placebo capsule). Children will be followed for an additional six weeks on the dose of
      ICS that achieved control (&quot;1X&quot;) + salmeterol BID with the study medication (V3). They will
      then undergo three 6-week periods of ICS reduction (V4, V5, V6), first to ¾ of the control
      dose (&quot;0.75X&quot;), then ½ of the control dose (&quot;0.5X&quot;) and then ¼ of the control dose (&quot;0.25X&quot;),
      each using salmeterol BID as concomitant medication. The ICS dosing and salmeterol will be
      open-label. Criteria for treatment failure and discharge from the study will be an
      established set of criteria that indicate reappearance of inadequate control of asthma or an
      exacerbation of asthma.

      At the end of the double-blind administration of oral study medication (V6), patients not
      discharged from the study because of having met one of the criteria for inadequate control of
      asthma will have their study medication discontinued, with subjects continuing to take
      placebo capsules in addition to ¼ ICS plus salmeterol. They will then be followed for an
      additional 6-week single-blind wash-out period with an interim contact by phone at 3 weeks to
      determine the course of asthma control to determine the persistence of effect off of the
      study medication (V7).

      The procedures to be performed at V0 are informed consent, pregnancy test, complete physical
      exam, spirometry, and bronchodilator response. The procedures to be performed at V1 are
      spirometry, complete blood count, blood IgE and eosinophils, brief physical exam, EKG, and
      genotyping. The following procedures will be performed at each of V2 through V7: brief
      physical exam, spirometry, forced oscillometry, exhaled nitric oxide, asthma control
      questionnaire, asthma-specific quality-of-life questionnaire, and sinusitis questionnaire. In
      addition, allergy skin testing will be performed at V2, pregnancy tests at V2 through V6,
      methacholine challenge at V2 and V3, and polymerase chain reaction for atypical organisms and
      macrolide antibiotic resistance (nasal wash) at V2, V5, and V7.

      Finally, children will maintain daily diary records of morning and evening symptoms, peak
      expiratory flow rates, and rescue medication use.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        At Enrollment (V0):

          -  Age 6-17 years at time of enrollment. A goal of 33% minority and 40% female subjects
             will be incorporated in recruitment

          -  Weighs at least 25 kg

          -  Asthma diagnosed by a physician and present for at least one year prior to study entry

          -  Moderate to severe persistent asthma:

               1. Patients will be identified in the following general categories. The general
                  principle is that patients will be uncontrolled on a relatively low dose of ICS
                  that can be stepped-up, or controlled on a moderate or high dose of ICS that can
                  be stepped-down.

                  i) On low dose ICS with or without salmeterol and uncontrolled. This patient will
                  be treated with budesonide and salmeterol to determine eligibility criteria. If
                  the addition of salmeterol results in control of symptoms, the patient would be
                  excluded from MARS. If control was not established on low dose budesonide and
                  salmeterol, the dose of budesonide would be increased and entry criteria
                  evaluated based on the algorithm in Figure 1.

                  ii) On a dose of ICS equivalent to budesonide at 400 mcg per day with or without
                  any other medication and uncontrolled. This patient will be treated with
                  budesonide and salmeterol to determine eligibility criteria.

                  iii) On a dose of ICS equivalent to budesonide at 800 mcg per day with or without
                  any other medication and controlled.

                  iv) On a dose of ICS equivalent to budesonide at 1600 mcg per day with or without
                  any other medication and uncontrolled but not requiring prednisone acutely. These
                  patients will be followed to see if they become well controlled with increased
                  adherence or more careful monitoring of symptoms.

               2. Examples are given for Advair as this drug is a commonly used form of ICS and
                  LABA:

                  i) Patients on Advair 100/50 bid and inadequately controlled ii) Patients on
                  Advair 250/50 bid and inadequately controlled iii) Patients on Advair 250/50 bid
                  and well controlled for greater than 3 months and being considered for
                  stepping-down to Advair 100/50 iv) Patients well controlled on Advair 100/50 bid
                  + either montelukast or theophylline for greater than 3 months and being
                  considered for stepping-down to Advair 100/50 bid alone v) Patients on Advair
                  500/50 bid and well controlled for greater than 3 months and being considered for
                  stepping-down to Advair 250/50 vi) Patients well controlled on Advair 250/50 bid
                  + either montelukast or theophylline for greater than 3 months and being
                  considered for stepping-down to Advair 250/50 bid alone

               3. Patients on an equivalent of budesonide 400 mcg, 800 mcg, or 1600 mcg per day
                  with no symptoms, but with an FEV1 less than 80% predicted, will be enrolled as
                  uncontrolled and observed closely for symptoms or low peak flows for 2 weeks. The
                  rationale for enrolling these patients and observing them as &quot;uncontrolled&quot; is
                  that patients with an FEV1 below the range of normal may be having symptoms
                  and/or low peak flows that will become apparent under close observation after
                  appropriate education. Note that a percent predicted value for FEV1 will be used
                  only at the enrollment visit, with criteria for control and inadequate control
                  during both run-in and during the double-blind portions of the study using the
                  highest FEV1 value obtained during run-in for decisions prior to randomization
                  and the FEV1 at randomization for decisions subsequent to that visit.

          -  FEV1 at least 80% predicted if there is going to be step-down at enrollment or at
             least 50% predicted if already suboptimally controlled historically and to be observed
             for 2 weeks to define baseline symptoms. FEV1 measurements will be obtained
             pre-bronchodilator.

          -  Demonstrate a bronchodilator response with an improvement in FEV1 of at least 12% or
             airway responsiveness to methacholine with a PC20 less than 12.5 mg/ml.

               1. Bronchodilator responsiveness testing will be done at Visit 0 (Enrollment) in all
                  patients using 4 puffs albuterol.

               2. Methacholine challenge will be done at Visit 1 (Step-up) in patients who did not
                  respond to bronchodilator at Visit 0. Patients with a FEV1 less than 70%
                  predicted or an upper respiratory infection at the time of Visit 1 will have a
                  second bronchodilator challenge rather than a methacholine.

          -  Varicella immunization complete (unless the subject has already had clinical
             varicella). If the subject needs varicella vaccine, this will be arranged with the
             primary care physician and must be received prior randomization

          -  Willingness to provide informed consent by the child's parent or guardian

          -  Nonsmoker in the past year; in addition, no use of smokeless tobacco products in the
             year prior to study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

             bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Evaluation during the screening process will assure that
             an adequate evaluation of other lung diseases has been performed

          -  Presence of other significant medical illnesses (cardiac, liver, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, any seizure disorder except febrile seizure in infancy) that would place
             the study subject at increased risk of participating in the study
