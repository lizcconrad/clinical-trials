    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib study as a continuation of the original Phase I protocol. The purpose of
      this Phase Ib study is to evaluate the safety of a single course of SGT-53 in combination
      with docetaxel and determine the recommended Phase II doses of SGT-53 and docetaxel in
      combination for evaluation in subsequent clinical studies for the treatment of solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The p53 gene is a vital tumor suppressor gene in humans. Numerous human tumors possess a loss
      or mutation of wild type p53 (wtp53). In addition to playing a crucial role in cell cycle
      control, the p53 gene is a critical component in two of the pathways involved in regulating
      tumor cell growth: cell death (apoptosis) and the regulation of angiogenesis. The loss of
      such critical tumor suppressor activity is believed to be responsible for p53's involvement
      in such a broad array of human tumors and resistance to chemo/radiotherapy. SGT-53 is a
      complex composed of a wild type p53 gene (plasmid DNA) encapsulated in a liposome that is
      targeted to tumor cells by means of an anti-transferrin receptor single-chain antibody
      fragment (TfRscFv) attached to the outside of the liposome. Pre-clinical studies have
      indicated that SGT-53 could sensitize tumors to the effects of radiation/chemotherapy.

      The Phase 1a portion of this clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of SGT-53. In addition, pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of SGT-53
      will be measured and correlated with tumor response and toxicity.

      The Phase Ib portion of this clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety of SGT-53 in
      combination with docetaxel, determine the recommended Phase II doses of these two agents, and
      evaluate the effect of the combination of SGT-53 and docetaxel on tumor size or progression.

    <description>SGT-53 (2.4mg DNA/infusion) will be administered in a standard 3x3 dose escalation design in combination with docetaxel 40mg/m2 starting dose, cohort 1, cycle 1. This protocol will allow for both inter- and intra-patient dose escalations. SGT-53 will be administered weekly, day 1 except weeks 1, 4 &amp; 7 when it will be administered biweekly on days 1 &amp; 4. Docetaxel will be administered every 3 weeks (weeks 1, 4 &amp; 7) on day 3. Patients completing cohort 1, cycle 1 without DLT at docetaxel 40mg/m2 will be allowed to dose escalate to 60mg/m2 in cycles 2 and 3. Cohort 2 (2.4mg DNA/infusion;75mg/m2 Docetaxel) will open 3 weeks after demonstration of 0/3 or ≤1/6 DLTs at docetaxel 60mg/m2. Cohort 3 (3.6mg DNA/infusion; 75mg/m2 Docetaxel) will open after demonstration of 0/3 or ≤1/6 DLTs at SGT-53 2.4mg DNA/infusion and docetaxel 75mg/m2. If necessary, the dose of docetaxel in cycle 2 and 3 may be reduced to 60mg/m2.</description>
