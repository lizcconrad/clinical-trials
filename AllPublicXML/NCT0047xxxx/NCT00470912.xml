  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lupus erythematosus (LE) is characterized by a large clinical spectrum, and sunligt is a well
      established factor in the induction and exacerbation of this disease. In all subsets of LE,
      skin lesions occur preferentially in sun-exposed areas.

      Previous studies have demonstrated that the lesions in LE patients reproduced in controlled
      experimental conditions. The initial reports suggested that the action spectrum for the LE
      was in the UVB range (290 to 320 nm), but more recent studies have demonstrated that UVA (320
      to 400 nm) can contribute to the induction of LE skin lesions.

      Antimalarial agents and topical steroids are the main treatments of chronic LE. The second
      line therapies include retinoids, sulfones, immunosuppressor agents, systemic corticosteroid
      and thalidomide. Moreover, patients are advised to avoid sun, to wear sunprotective clothing
      and to apply sunscreen.

      The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a sunscreen milk with high protection
      factor against UV-B and UV-A, used exclusively, in the photoinduced LE.
