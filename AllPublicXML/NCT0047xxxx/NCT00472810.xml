      1. Study Objective: To compare the safety and effectiveness of the ologen (OculusGen)
           Biodegradable Collagen Matrix Implant and the MMC group in filtration surgery. The
           primary endpoint is to prove the effectiveness via the reduction of IOP, and the
           secondary endpoint is to prove the safety via the incidence of complications and adverse
           events.

        2. Study Design: The study is designed as an open-label, randomized, parallel, comparative
           study. Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign informed consent will
           be included. After enrollment, patients will be randomized into two groups:
           trabeculectomy with OculusGen implant or trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C.

        3. Follow-Up: There will be 7 post-operative and follow-up visits within 6 months of
           surgery: postoperative days 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90 and 180. A window of ± 7 days is
           allowed for the 30, 60, 90 day visits and ± 14 days for the 180 day visits. Further
           follow-up of subjects after the trial will be the responsibility of the investigator.

    <description>20 patients will be recruited according to the enrollment acceptance criteria.Randomisation is performed using a sealed envelope system, where 40 shuffled envelopes designating the surgery to either trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C (MMC) and trabeculectomy with ologen™ Collagen matrix must be open before surgery. Then, patients are allocated and trabeculectomy is performed.If ologen™ treatment is used, the collagen matrix will be placed on top of the scleral flap under the conjunctiva after the trabeculectomy.</description>

    <description>If mitomycin -C is applied, a single cellulose sponge soaked with MMC (0.2mg/ml - 0.4mg/ml) is fashioned into an approximate 2.0 × 4.0 mm rectangular shape and applied to the scleral bed and subconjunctival space taking care to avoid exposure to the conjunctival wound edge. Application time is 2 minutes for MMC. Then, the area treated is copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. After operation, appropriate anti-inflammatory and antibiotic eye-drops will be prescribed.</description>
