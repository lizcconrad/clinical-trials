  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Responder was defined as participant experiencing improvement in pain intensity, as exhibited by a pain score reduction on the Dental Pain Scale (DPS) from baseline of at least 1 unit for two consecutive assessments anytime between the 5 and 20-minute time points. Response in DPS scale was assigned values as 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate) and 3 (Severe).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Confirmed Perceptible Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief by stopping a stopwatch labeled 'first perceptible relief' at the moment they first began to experience any relief. Stopwatch was active up to 120 minutes after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Meaningful Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated the time to meaningful relief by stopping a second stopwatch labeled 'meaningful relief' at the moment they first began to experience meaningful relief. Stopwatch was active up to 120 minutes after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of effect was defined as the time difference between onset of effect and its offset. Onset of effect was the first time point at which two consecutive pain scores less severe than at baseline by at least 1 unit (on the DPS) were attained. Offset of effect was the first of the following events to occur after onset: time to drop out if the drop out was due to lack of efficacy, time of rescue medication, or the first time point following onset of effect at which two consecutive pain scores that are at least as severe as at baseline were attained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sum of Pain Relief Combined With Pain Intensity Differences (SPRID) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes and 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID is time-weighted sum of pain relief scores combined with pain intensity difference (PRID) scores over 60 and 120 minutes. SPRID score range was 0 (worst) to 7 (best) for SPRID 60 and 0 (worst) to 14 (best) for SPRID 120. PRID is sum of Pain intensity differences (PID) and Dental pain relief scale (DPRS) scores at each post-dosing time point. PID was calculated as baseline DPS minus DPS score at given time point (DPS range: 0 [none] to 3 [severe]; baseline DPS range from 2-3). PID score ranges from -1 (worst) to 3 (best). DPRS is 5-point scale ranging from 0 (No-relief) to 4 (Complete).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Dropping Out Due to Lack of Efficacy or Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Median time of dropping out of the participants from the study due to lack of efficacy or rescue medication (ibuprofen 200-400 mg or acetaminophen 1000 mg), whichever comes first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Relief Combined With Pain Intensity Difference (PRID) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>5 to 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>PRID is sum of PID and DPRS scores at each post-dosing time point. The overall possible score range, for PRID is -1 (worst) to 7 (best). PID was calculated as baseline DPS minus DPS score at given time point (DPS range from 0 [none] to 3 [severe]; baseline DPS range from 2-3). PID score ranges from -1 (worst) to 3 (best). DPRS is 5-point scale ranging from 0 (No-relief) to 4 (Complete).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Satisfaction Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to provide an overall assessment of their satisfaction with the study medication on a categorical scale. Response in this scale was assigned values as 0 (Poor), 1 (Fair), 2 (Good), 3 (Very Good) and 4 (Excellent).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dosing Compliance Calculated by Evaluating Amount of Study Medication Applied</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of study medication applied was calculated by weighing medication tube prior and post-dosing.</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Relief Combined With Pain Intensity Differences (SPRID) Scores</title>
        <description>SPRID is time-weighted sum of pain relief scores combined with pain intensity difference (PRID) scores over 60 and 120 minutes. SPRID score range was 0 (worst) to 7 (best) for SPRID 60 and 0 (worst) to 14 (best) for SPRID 120. PRID is sum of Pain intensity differences (PID) and Dental pain relief scale (DPRS) scores at each post-dosing time point. PID was calculated as baseline DPS minus DPS score at given time point (DPS range: 0 [none] to 3 [severe]; baseline DPS range from 2-3). PID score ranges from -1 (worst) to 3 (best). DPRS is 5-point scale ranging from 0 (No-relief) to 4 (Complete).</description>

        <description>PRID is sum of PID and DPRS scores at each post-dosing time point. The overall possible score range, for PRID is -1 (worst) to 7 (best). PID was calculated as baseline DPS minus DPS score at given time point (DPS range from 0 [none] to 3 [severe]; baseline DPS range from 2-3). PID score ranges from -1 (worst) to 3 (best). DPRS is 5-point scale ranging from 0 (No-relief) to 4 (Complete).</description>
