    <measure>Antipsychotic Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Each study visit (i.e. Days 1, 8, 15, 29 and 42)</time_frame>
    <description>Antipsychotic Efficacy was defined as a decrease in the severity and/or frequency of hallucinations and/or delusions. This is measured as the change from baseline (Day 1) to Day 42 in the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - Hallucinations and Delusions scales (SAPS-H+D) score for the ITT Analysis Set. The possible total score is 0 to 100 and a negative change in score indicates improvement.
Analysis Method: Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and missing data was imputed using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.</description>

    <measure>Motor Symptoms Change From Baseline (Negative = Improvement)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each study visit (i.e. Days 1, 8, 15, 29 and 42)</time_frame>
    <description>Motor symptoms were measured using the change from baseline (Day 1) to Day 42 in the combined score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (Activities of Daily Living) and Part III (Motor Examination) using the per-protocol (PP) analysis set. The possible total score is 0 to 160 and a negative change in score indicates improvement.
Analysis Method: ANCOVA, and missing data was imputed using LOCF. The UPDRS Parts II+III score was analyzed by constructing 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the difference between each pimavanserin dose group and placebo mean change from baseline. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the CI was less than or equal to 5.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with a minimum duration of 1 year

          -  Presence of visual and/or auditory hallucinations, and/or delusions, occurring during
             the four weeks prior to study screening

          -  Psychotic symptoms must have developed after PD diagnosis was established

          -  Subject must be on stable dose of anti-Parkinson's medication for 1 month prior to
             Study Day 1 (Baseline) and during the trial

          -  Subject that has received stereotaxic surgery for subthalamic nucleus deep brain
             stimulation must be at least 6 months post surgery and the stimulator settings must
             have been stable for at least 1 month prior to Study Day 1 (Baseline) and must remain
             stable during the trial

          -  The subject is willing and able to provide consent

          -  Caregiver is willing and able to accompany the subject to all visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of significant psychotic disorders prior to or concomitantly
             with the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease including, but not limited to, schizophrenia
             or bipolar disorder

          -  Subject has received previous ablative stereotaxic surgery (i.e., pallidotomy and
             thalamotomy) to treat Parkinson's disease

          -  Subject has current evidence of a serious and or unstable cardiovascular, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic or other medical disorder

          -  Subject has had a myocardial infarction in last six months

          -  Subject has any surgery planned during the screening, treatment or follow-up periods

        Patients will be evaluated at screening to ensure that all criteria for study participation
        are met. These evaluations will include specific measures of psychosis severity, delirium,
        dementia, cardiovascular condition, and pregnancy status. Patients may be excluded from the
        study based on these assessments (and specifically if it is determined that their baseline
        health and psychiatric condition do not meet all protocol-specified entry criteria).

        <title>Antipsychotic Efficacy</title>
        <description>Antipsychotic Efficacy was defined as a decrease in the severity and/or frequency of hallucinations and/or delusions. This is measured as the change from baseline (Day 1) to Day 42 in the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - Hallucinations and Delusions scales (SAPS-H+D) score for the ITT Analysis Set. The possible total score is 0 to 100 and a negative change in score indicates improvement.

        <title>Motor Symptoms Change From Baseline (Negative = Improvement)</title>
        <description>Motor symptoms were measured using the change from baseline (Day 1) to Day 42 in the combined score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (Activities of Daily Living) and Part III (Motor Examination) using the per-protocol (PP) analysis set. The possible total score is 0 to 160 and a negative change in score indicates improvement.
Analysis Method: ANCOVA, and missing data was imputed using LOCF. The UPDRS Parts II+III score was analyzed by constructing 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the difference between each pimavanserin dose group and placebo mean change from baseline. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the CI was less than or equal to 5.</description>
