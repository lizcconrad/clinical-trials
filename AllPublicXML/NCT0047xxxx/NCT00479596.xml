  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate the comparative efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction
      of intradetrusor injections BOTOX® injections (200U) versus placebo (saline) injections in
      the treatment of OAB secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO).

    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder is a common problem that follows chronic prostatic bladder outlet
      obstruction and is part of the benign prostatic hyperplasia syndrome (BPH) in men.
      Unfortunately, it does not often resolve after treatment (TURP, etc) of the obstruction from
      enlarged prostate gland. Patients with obstructive BPH typically commence treatment with
      alpha-blockers or anticholinergic agents; the former being used to treat enlarged prostate
      medically, and the latter to treat overactive bladder symptoms. However, as mentioned,
      anticholinergics cause many intolerable side effects leading to discontinuation in many
      patients. Furthermore this class of drug is still considered a relative contraindication in
      this population by some clinicians. Therefore other modalities need to be studied in these
      men.

      Based on numerous studies in overactive bladder (OAB), we hypothesize that these patients
      will experience significant improvement (particularly if their symptoms of urgency and
      frequency) without significant side effects from intradetrusor injections of BOTOX® even
      though they have were refractory to systemic anticholinergics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male between 40 and 90 years of age.

          2. Clinical signs and symptoms of frequency and urgency

          3. Urodynamic history consistent with OAB that developed in conjunction with Benign
             Prostate Obstruction and that persists for at least 3 months post TURP or PVP, or
             other obstruction relieving procedure.

          4. OAB inadequately controlled with anticholinergic medications

          5. Qmax &gt;12mL/s with a voided volume of &gt;125mL.

          6. IPSS &gt;12, with IPSS QoL &gt;3 at study Visit 1.

          7. Willing to use clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) to empty the bladder or is
             willing to have an indwelling catheter, if necessary following study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of interstitial cystitis, uninvestigated hematuria, bladder outlet
             obstruction due to vesical neck contracture, mullerian duct cysts, urethral
             obstruction due to stricture/valves/sclerosis of urethral tumor, radiation cystitis,
             genitourinary tuberculosis, bladder calculi, or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.

          2. Current indwelling catheter, or removal of chronic catheter &lt;1 month prior to study
             entry.

          3. Non-compliance with wash-out periods for prohibited medications/therapies

          4. Evidence of Urinary Tract Infection according to local standard of care.

          5. History of prostate cancer.

          6. Serum PSA of &gt;10ng/mL. [NOTE: Subjects with serum PSA concentrations &gt;4 and &lt;10 must
             have prostate cancer excluded according to the local standard of care.]

          7. 24 hour total volume voided &gt;3000 mL of urine

          8. Medical condition that may increase their risk of exposure to botulinum toxin
             including diagnosed Myasthenia Gravis, Eaton-Lambert Syndrome, Amyotrophic Lateral
             Sclerosis or any other disease that might interfere with neuromuscular function.

          9. Allergy or sensitivity to any component of BOTOX®
