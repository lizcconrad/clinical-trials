  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vandetanib when given
      together with radiation therapy in treating young patients with newly diagnosed diffuse brain
      stem glioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vandetanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the
      tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving vandetanib
      together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      Patients undergo conformal radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Patients also
      receive oral vandetanib once daily beginning on the same day as radiotherapy and continuing
      for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vandetanib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies, polymorphism analysis
      (e.g., CYP3A4/5), and immunological laboratory methods (e.g., western blot assay). Imaging
      studies are also conducted periodically.
