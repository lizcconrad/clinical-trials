  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MabThera monotherapy in
      patients with refractory, relapsing or chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
      Patients will receive infusions of MabThera 1000mg i.v. on days 1 and 15. The anticipated
      time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

CR was defined as no platelet response or no reduction in the dose intensity of concomitant ITP therapy compared with that at screening. PR response was defined as at least a minor platelet response that enabled a 50% to 99% reduction in the dose intensity of concomitant ITP therapy compared with that at screening. MR was defined as at least a minor platelet response that enabled a 1% to 49% reduction in the dose intensity of concomitant ITP therapy compared with that at screening.</description>
