      Full Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Procrit for the Prevention of Acute Renal
      Failure in Patients Receiving Intravenous Contrast

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a one-time dose of intravenous erythropoietin
      administration in the prevention or attenuation of contrast-induced acute renal failure.

      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate serum and urinary markers of renal injury, including KIM-1,
      BMP-7, and TGF-b, along with other biomarkers, in subjects receiving intravenous contrast and
      correlate their expression with clinical outcomes

      Study Design: Prospective, multi-centered, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial
      of a one-time dose of EPO. Subjects will be followed for seven days or until hospital
      discharge, whichever is longer. Total estimated study duration 3 years.

      Adult subjects with or without diabetes mellitus Eligibility Criteria: undergoing intravenous
      contrast administration for computerized axial tomography (CAT Scan) as inpatients.

      Subjects will be excluded if they have end-stage renal disease (on dialysis or peritoneal
      dialysis); any known history of acute renal failure; have hemoglobin ³ 12.0 g/dL; history of
      use of erythropoietin replacement or transfusion within the prior 3 days; use
      Glucophage/Metformin or Glucovance; are unable to give their written informed consent; have
      hemodynamic instability; have uncontrolled hypertension; have any history of current
      malignancy, where current malignancy is defined as subjects undergoing treatment with
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy, subjects with known metastatic disease, and those with
      terminal malignant disease; any history of MI, CVA, active angina or unstable angina within
      the past three months ; are pregnant or lactating; allergic to intravenous contrast, iodine,
      erythropoietin, mammalian-cell derived products, or human albumin; patients with seizure
      disorders or have CT scan done as hospital outpatients.
