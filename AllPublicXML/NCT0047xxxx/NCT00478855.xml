      1. To determine the value of using piperacillin/tazobactam in reducing the cases of
           extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae colonization
           and infection.

        2. To determine the acquisition rate of ESBL producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae, both
           pre-and post-intervention in the selected medical centers.
