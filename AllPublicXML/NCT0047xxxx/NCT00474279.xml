  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment of healthy older men and women
      with oral MK-677 for 12 months will enhance pulsatile GH release and increase mean GH and
      IGF-I concentrations into the range of young adults and will have favorable effects on body
      composition and functional ability on older adults.

    <textblock>
      This is a two year, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of once daily
      administration of MK-677, an oral GH secretagogue, to healthy older adults. During the first
      year, subjects will be randomized to MK-677 or placebo treatment. In each of three subgroups
      of subjects (men, women off and women on hormone replacement therapy), 16 subjects will
      receive MK-677 and 8 will receive placebo. After 1 year, the subjects who received placebo
      will be switched to MK-677 treatment; the subjects who received MK-677 for the first year
      will be randomized to either placebo or MK-677 for the second year of the study.The study
      will test changes in GH, IGF-I, body composition and function.
