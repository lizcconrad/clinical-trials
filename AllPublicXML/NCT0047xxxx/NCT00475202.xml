  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for
      approximately two-thirds of all non-traumatic amputations performed in the United States. The
      cost of foot ulcers in diabetic patients averages almost $28,000 for the two years after
      diagnosis of the ulcer. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) serves as primary or adjunctive therapy for a
      diverse range of medical conditions. HBO also has been used as an adjunct to antibiotics,
      debridement, and revascularization in the therapy of chronic, nonhealing wounds associated
      with diabetes or non-diabetic vascular insufficiency.

      The aim of the study is to assess whether hyperoxia induced angiogenesis in diabetic patients
      with foot ulcers.
