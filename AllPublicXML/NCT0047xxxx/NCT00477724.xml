  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe CTEPH leads to an impaired physical capacity and a restricted quality of life and poor
      prognosis.

      Pulmonary endarterectomy represents the best choice as therapy, when the thrombi are located
      in the central pulmonary vessels and therefore can be operated. By this operation the
      pulmonary artery pressure can be normalised and the patients' survival improved. Up to now,
      after successful endarterectomy patients only receive anticoagulation.

      Despite operation many patients remain symptomatic and are restricted in their physical
      capacity. Therefore a hypothesis of this project is that most of the patients, even after
      successful operation, show peripheral vascular remodelling with a ventilation-perfusion
      mismatch and elevated pulmonary pressure during exercise.

      In this study we aim to analyse how many patients with CTEPH after endarterectomy show
      elevated pulmonary artery pressures at rest or during exercise and are limited in their
      physical capacity, hemodynamics, oxygen uptake and quality of life and need further therapy.

      Another aim is to examine whether exercise and respiratory therapy may improve the patients
      postoperatively.

      Therefore 30 patients with CTEPH &gt; six months after endarterectomy, with ongoing restricted
      exercise capacity shall be included. After baseline examination in the University hospital
      Heidelberg the patients receive exercise and respiratory therapy for three weeks. The
      patients will receive further examinations at the end of rehabilitation after 3 weeks and
      after 15 weeks. All examinations include medical history, family history, physical
      examination, ECG and echocardiography at rest and during exercise, cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing, assessment of the respiratory muscle strength, the SF-36 questionnaire for quality
      of life, laboratory testing and MRI.

      Rehabilitation will be conducted in the clinic for rehabilitation Koenigstuhl, Heidelberg.
      Participants will be randomised into two groups, a control group receiving a conventional
      therapy for three weeks, in which physical exertion is to be avoided and a training group
      with additional exercise and respiratory therapy.
