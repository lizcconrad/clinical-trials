    <textblock>
      The clinical evaluation of anemia is usually done by examination of the palpebral conjontivae
      coloration. This appreciation remains crude and largely observer dependent, as no reference
      scale was successfully proposed,. A Hb visual scale allowing the assessment of the degree of
      clinical anemia has been developed. Its use has been validated so far in small patient groups
      in the following settings: blood donation, cardiac surgery, oncology and consultation of
      general practitioners.

      The objective of the present investigation is to validate the use of a Hb visual scale for
      the clinical evaluation of anemia in patients with kidney disease patients
