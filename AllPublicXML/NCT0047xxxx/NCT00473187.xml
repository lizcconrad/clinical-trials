  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is characterized by rickets, disproportionate short
      stature, impaired renal phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D metabolism. Despite oral
      phosphate and vitamin D treatment, most children with XLH demonstrate reduced adult height.
      The main objective of the study is to determine the beneficial effects of recombinant human
      growth hormone (rhGH) therapy on body proportions after 36 month in these patients. Secondary
      objective is to monitor side effects of the therapy.
