  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how levels of this newly-discovered hormone, called
      FGF-23, changes in the blood in response to a high calcium dialysis bath during a
      hemodialysis (HD) treatment, and how this relates to changes in the calcium and PTH levels.
      We are also studying the effects of dialysis and inflammation on the levels of Fetuin A.

      We intend to prospectively study a cohort of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on
      hemodialysis in order to determine whether FDF-23 levels independently affect
      non-suppressible PTH levels. The relationship between Fetuin A and inflammatory markers will
      also be determined. By dialyzing patients on 3.5 mEq/L calcium dialysate bath, we seek any
      relationship between ionized calcium, FGF-23 and PTH.

      The goal of this study is to ascertain whether there is a regulatory relationship between the
      novel phosphorus-regulating polypeptide fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), ionized calcium
      (iCa), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. In addition, we will determine if there is an
      inverse relationship between Fetuin A levels and inflammatory markers, interleukin 6 (IL-6)
      and C-reactive protein (CRP), during a hemodialysis treatment.

      All patients participating in this study will be off Zemplar and/or Sensipar for a washout
      period of approximately 4 weeks as these medications will interfere with the study. Patients
      will go through one designated research hemodialysis time for a blood draw. Blood draws will
      be taken during 4 separate intervals at 0, 45, 90 and 150 minutes. At each interval, 4 tubes
      of blood will be drawn.

      There are no further required blood draws once each designated research HD session has been
      completed. At the conclusion of the designated research HD session, vitamin D analogue
      (Zemplar®) and/or Cinacalcet (Sensipar®) will be restarted, and the dose will be adjusted to
      reflect the subject's recent biochemical markers (Ca, Phos, and iPTH).

    <description>Subjects are exposed to a high calcium (3.5 mEq/L) dialysate bath for 150 minutes (part 1). At defined timepoints (0, 45, 90, and 150 min) blood is sampled for calcium, PTH, phosphorous, and FGF-23. At another (later) dialysis session (part 2), the process is repeated except that the subjects are exposed to a normal calcium bath (2.5 mEq/L). For each subject, results from part 1 are compared to the results from part 2.</description>
