  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to evaluate the effect of sertraline administration on
      the binding of 123-I mZINT in 10 healthy subjects. All study procedures will be conducted at
      the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) and Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New
      Haven, CT.

    <textblock>
      Serotonin (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter found in the peripheral and central nervous
      system. It is responsible for regulating a wide variety of physiological processes and higher
      CNS functions. 5-HT neurons project diffusely throughout the brain, innervating the cerebral
      cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, midbrain, brainstem and cerebellum, and play a prominent role
      in regulating physiological and behavioral responses such as arousal, thermoregulation,
      anxiety, and affect.

      All subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including
      baseline clinical laboratory testing, and a baseline physical and neurological evaluation.
      healthy subjects will undergo a baseline 123-I MZINT injection and SPECT imaging described
      below. At baseline, healthy subjects will be started on either no treatment (n=4), or one of
      three different doses of sertraline (25 mg/day n=2, 50 mg/day n=2 or 150 mg/day n=2), which
      will be administered over a 14 day period. Fourteen days following imaging session 1, all
      subjects (treated with sertraline and untreated) will undergo a second 123-I MZINT and SPECT
      imaging study. Data from the baseline and follow-up SPECT images will be compared to evaluate
      for any effect of sertraline on regional brain uptake of 123-I MZINT. The subjects that are
      randomized to no treatment will serve as controls and provide preliminary test-retest
      reproducibility data on the imaging outcome measure.

      The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of sertraline administration on the
      specific [123-I] mZINT. In vitro and in vivo data from early human studies and baboon studies
      strongly support further evaluation of [123I] mZINT in healthy subjects.

    <description>SPECT imaging uses the single photon emissions from radioactive compounds that are (most commonly) injected into a patient and are metabolized by specific organs or body systems. SPECT imaging is performed by using a gamma camera to acquire multiple 2-D images (also called projections), from multiple angles. A computer is then used to apply a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to the multiple projections, yielding a 3-D dataset. This dataset may then be manipulated to show thin slices along any chosen axis of the body, similar to those obtained from other tomographic techniques, such as MRI, CT, and PET. The resulting SPECT images reflect body/organ function as opposed to specific anatomy of other imaging modalities such as CT or MRI</description>
