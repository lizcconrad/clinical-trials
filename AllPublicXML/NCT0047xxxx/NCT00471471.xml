      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response
      to kill tumor cells. Giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF, CpG 7909, and incomplete
      Freund's adjuvant may make a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well vaccine therapy works
      in treating patients with recurrent stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by
      surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of a peptide vaccine comprising MART-1:27-35 peptide, gp100:209-217
           (210M) peptide, and tyrosinase peptide with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and CpG 7909
           emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant in patients with unresectable recurrent stage
           III or IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the efficacy of immunoadjuvants CpG 7909 and GM-CSF, in terms of a strong
           antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response, in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-pigmentary response to this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-tumor response, in terms of objective tumor regression,
           progression-free survival, and overall survival, in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive peptide vaccine comprising MART-1:27-35 peptide, gp100:209-217 (210M)
      peptide, and tyrosinase peptide with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and CpG 7909 emulsified in
      incomplete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, day 50-53, and day 91-94. Samples are examined by
      ELISPOT assay to measure lymphocyte immune response and by flow cytometry for biomarker
      quantification and T-cell response.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for at least 2
      years.
