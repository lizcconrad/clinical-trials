    <textblock>
      Anal fistula is defined as an abnormal communication between the anal canal and the perianal
      skin. Adipose-derived stem cells are a new therapy for the closure of these fistulas. This
      study will test the safety and efficacy of ASCs (adipose stem cells) in the treatment of
      patients without Crohn´s disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perianal fistula accounts for 10% to 30% of coloproctological surgical procedures. Currently
      accepted conventional treatment is surgery intended to treat the tracts using different
      technical options. This surgery usually has a highly bothersome postoperative period and may
      involve two major complications: anal incontinence and recurrence. The biological properties
      of stem cells derived from adult tissues make them adequate candidates for the treatment of
      diseases in which tissues are damaged or the healing process is altered. This study will
      compare the efficacy of ASCs versus ASCs plus Fibrin adhesive versus Fibrin adhesive alone
      for closure of complex perianal fistulas not associated to Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
      Fistula closure is defined as absence of suppuration and re-epithelization of the external
      opening in the clinical evaluation and absence of collections &gt;2 cm directly related to the
      fistula tract treated, as measured by MRI

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with a complex perianal fistula. A complex perianal fistula must meet one of
             the following:

               -  No fistula tract is palpated under the perianal skin or tract parallel to the
                  rectum on examination with a stylet.

               -  Associated anal incontinence in transsphincteric fistulas.

               -  Risk factors for anal incontinence.

               -  At least one prior surgery for a fistulous disease.

               -  Suprasphincteric tracts shown by an image test.

          2. Women of childbearing age should have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (sensitive to 25IU of hCG) and not be lactating before study entry. Both men and women
             should use adequate birth control methods as defined by the investigator.

          3. Seton presence is allowed at the time of study entry and until cells (in groups
