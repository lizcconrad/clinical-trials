      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the treatment with growth hormone has an
      influence on the nitric oxide pathway in healthy males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent endogenous vasodilator and has shown to inhibit key processes
      of atherosclerosis like monocyte adhesion, platelet aggregation, and vascular smooth muscle
      cell proliferation. Impaired endothelial NO production is a main feature of endothelial
      dysfunction, which by itself is an early step in the course of atherosclerotic vascular
      disease.

      Recent studies could confirm this close association between parameters of the NO pathway and
      cardiovascular disease and could further enhance the knowledge on the pathophysiological
      mechanisms. There is a significant relationship between insulin resistance and the endogenous
      NO synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Moreover, evidence could be
      provided that plasma levels of ADMA are a strong and independent predictor of mortality and
      cardiovascular outcome in haemodialysis patients.

      Patients with growth hormone deficiency are characterized by a 1.9 fold higher risk of death
      from cardiovascular disease. Again, there is good evidence, that alterations of the
      NO-pathway are involved in this increase of cardiovascular risk. A reduced endogenous
      systemic production of NO was found in patients with growth hormone deficiency, treatment
      with recombinant growth hormone normalized NO production. The effects of growth hormone on NO
      are possibly mediated by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which stimulates NO synthesis
      in vitro. The onset of IGF-I increase in healthy volunteers treated with GH is evident after
      12 h, the maximum effect takes place between 5 to 8 days. Also in adults with growth hormone
      deficiency, the major effects of growth hormone treatment on IGF-I levels are observed within
      2 weeks. After discontinuation of growth hormone therapy, IGF-1 levels return to base line
      within 2-3 days.

      The aim of the present study is to further elucidate the in vivo effects of GH on the NO
      pathway and NO mediated cardiovascular functions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects without recent severe diseases

          -  Age 50 yrs or older

          -  Body mass index at or below 30 kg/m2

          -  Insulin-like growth factor-1 level below 200 ng/ml

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial

          -  Subjects that are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any severe hepatic, renal, cardiac, endocrine, metabolic, or malignant
             diseases

          -  Requirement for medical drug treatment

          -  Growth hormone treatment during the last 12 months

          -  Drug dependence, alcohol or nicotine abuse

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgement of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.
