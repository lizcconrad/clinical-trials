  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high proportion of patients having cardiac surgery receive red cell transfusions. Yet, the
      investigators do not know whether transfusions are beneficial and they may be associated with
      harm. It is thus important to determine when a transfusion is required. The investigators
      will conduct a small pilot study at St. Michael's Hospital to address this issue. Patients
      having cardiac surgery will be allocated to one of two transfusion strategies with endpoints
      being compliance with the transfusion strategy and clinical outcome. The results of this
      study will be used to design a large definitive multicentered trial of these two transfusion
      strategies.

    <textblock>
      The optimal hemoglobin concentrations for transfusion in the perioperative setting in
      patients having cardiac surgery have not been established, and red cell transfusion rates for
      these patients are high. In a recent retrospective study of seven Canadian centres, which
      included 11,812 cardiac surgical patients, 44% of patients received one or more red cell
      units, and the range of patients transfused was 28% to 60%. As morbidity and mortality may be
      dependent on the severity of anemia and administration of transfusions, it is essential to
      determine at what hemoglobin concentration physicians should be transfusing these patients,
      particularly because the efficacy of transfusion has not been established. However, as any
      definitive trial will require thousands of patients, and as there is variability in
      transfusion practices, preliminary studies need to be completed to ensure the feasibility of
      adherence to proposed transfusion strategies. This pilot study is the first of two pilot
      trials designed to address the question of optimum hemoglobin concentrations for transfusion
      in patients having cardiac surgery prior to undertaking a definitive randomized controlled
      trial. The purpose of this study is to determine adherence to transfusion strategies.
