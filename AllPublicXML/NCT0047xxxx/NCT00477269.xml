    <description>PAH assessed according to the WHO classification: Class I Patients with PAH but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class II Patients with PAH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class III Patients with PAH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class IV Patients with PAH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of Six Minute Walk Test - Total Distance Walked at Different Time Periods</title>
        <description>The Six Minute Walk test was carried out along a course, such as a hospital corridor, measuring at least 20 meters delineated by markers. Patients were instructed to walk at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage in six minutes, resting whenever they needed to. Distance &lt;500 meters suggests considerable exercise limitation; Distance 500-800 meters suggests moderate limitation; Distance &gt;800 meters (with no rests) suggests mild or no limitation.</description>

Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class II Patients with PAH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class III Patients with PAH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class IV Patients with PAH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</description>

          <description>PAH assessed according to the WHO classification: Class I Patients with PAH but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class II Patients with PAH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class III Patients with PAH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class IV Patients with PAH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</description>

        <description>Six Minute Walk test was carried out along a course, such as a hospital corridor, measuring at least 20 meters delineated by markers. During the walk the patient was connected to a portable pulse oximeter via a finger probe. Patients were instructed to walk at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage in six minutes, resting whenever they needed to. The test was terminated if the patient became too distressed or if their SaO2% fell below 60%.</description>

        <description>Six Minute Walk test was carried out along a course, such as a hospital corridor, measuring at least 20 meters delineated by markers. During the walk the patient was connected to a portable pulse oximeter via a finger probe. Patients were instructed to walk at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage in six minutes, resting whenever they needed to. Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) were recorded before the test at resting, at the end of the test and two minutes after the end of the test</description>

        <description>Six Minute Walk test was carried out along a course, such as a hospital corridor, measuring at least 20 meters delineated by markers. During the walk the patient was connected to a portable pulse oximeter via a finger probe. Patients were instructed to walk at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage in six minutes, resting whenever they needed to. Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) were recorded before the test at resting, at the end of the test and two minutes after the end of the test</description>

        <title>Borg Score-Heart Rate (HR) During the Six Minutes Walk Test at Different Time Periods</title>
        <description>Six Minute Walk test was carried out along a course, such as a hospital corridor, measuring at least 20 meters delineated by markers. During the walk the patient was connected to a portable pulse oximeter via a finger probe. Patients were instructed to walk at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage in six minutes, resting whenever they needed to. Heart Rate (bpm) were recorded before the test at resting, at the end of the test and two minutes after the end of the test</description>

        <description>Borg Score during Six Minute Walk test was carried out along a course, such as a hospital corridor, measuring at least 20 meters delineated by markers. During the walk the patient was connected to a portable pulse oximeter via a finger probe. Patients were instructed to walk at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage in six minutes, resting whenever they needed to. Borg Score of Breathlessness was recorded using the following score of 0 to 10, how breathless do you feel? 0 is nothing at all and 10 is maximal breathlessness</description>

Were assessed when the patient was in a stable hemodynamic rest state (as demonstrated by three consecutive Mean PAP and CO measurements within 10% of each other). PAP was assessed when the patient was breathing ambient air, every 2 minutes whilst breathing Nitric Oxide(NO) (1st and 2nd), 5 min after the end of NO administration, and 15 mins after the end of NO administration.</description>

        <title>Mean Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) at Baseline and Study Completion</title>
        <description>The right heart catheter assessment was performed to assess several prognostic hemodynamic variables in pulmonary hypertension, including Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR). Were assessed when the patient was in a stable hemodynamic rest state (as demonstrated by three consecutive Mean PAP and CO measurements within 10% of each other). PAP was assessed when the patient was breathing ambient air, every 2 minutes whilst breathing Nitric Oxide(NO) (1st and 2nd), 5 min after the end of NO administration, and 15 mins after the end of NO administration. SVR was calculated according to the equation: SVR = (Paorta – Pright atrium)/CO</description>
