  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if sequential compression devices (SCD) when worn
      for an hour per day by patients suffering from Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) are helpful for
      the improvement of the RLS symptoms and sleep.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a highly vexing problem manifested by sensory and motor
      symptoms that disrupt sleep onset or sleep maintenance. RLS is the second most common sleep
      disorder and occurs with an estimated prevalence of 10% in the general population. The sleep
      disruption results in daytime symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and mood
      changes. There are no consistently reliable treatment alternatives. There is an urgent need
      for new, innovative treatment strategies because available pharmacological treatments often
      stop working over time or are associated with unacceptable side effects. An effective
      nonpharmacological treatment would be a highly attractive alternative.

      Anecdotally, patients have reported that use of sequential compression devices (SCD)
      prescribed for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis can have a positive effect on RLS
      symptoms. Because this nonpharmacological alternative is available, safe, and affordable,
      further investigation is warranted.

      Simply stated, the null hypothesis is that SCD therapy does not have an impact on RLS
      symptoms.

      Patients will be randomized to wearing SCDs or sham SCDs for an hour each day prior to the
      usual onset of the RLS symptoms. At baseline and at monthly follow-ups for 3 to 4 months,
      participants will complete questionnaires to assess the severity of the RLS symptoms, their
      daytime sleepiness, and the impact of the RLS on quality of life.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than 17 years with a reliable diagnosis of RLS in accordance with the
             International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revised Diagnostic and Coding Manual
             of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years

          -  Unstable medical conditions that may interfere with the requirements of the study (for
             example uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, symptomatic asthma, congestive heart failure
             with symptoms of pulmonary edema), and mental or physical limitations (including
             dementia) that would preclude data collection on questionnaires or wearing the SCD.

          -  Other medical conditions that would serve as exclusion criteria are those where
             increased venous or lymphatic return is undesirable. These specific conditions are
             known or suspected acute deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, severe congestive
             heart failure, pulmonary edema, severe arteriosclerosis, active infection such as
             gangrene, recent vein ligation or skin graft, or extreme deformity of the legs.
