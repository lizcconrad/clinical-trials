      intravitreal POT-4 for treatment of patients with AMD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness for individuals over
      fifty-five years of age that live in the industrialized world. It affects 5-10 million people
      in the US and as many as 30 million worldwide. There are two forms of the disease, both of
      which cause a loss of central vision. Approximately eighty-five percent of patients have the
      less severe dry form that produces gradual but rarely complete vision loss. The remaining
      fifteen percent have the severe wet, or exudative, form that causes rapid, disabling
      blindness. Wet AMD is further characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a growth
      under the macula of abnormal blood vessels originating from the choroidal capillary bed.
      Research has linked chronic inflammation to both forms of AMD.

      Only recently, unrestrained complement activation was identified in genetic studies to be one
      of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AMD. It has also been demonstrated that
      complement activation plays a crucial role in the development of CNV. Therefore, the use of
      intravitreal complement inhibitors may be beneficial in participants subjects with
      neovascular AMD.

      This prospective, uncontrolled, non-randomized, dose-escalating, pilot Phase I study will
      provide initial safety and tolerability information on intravitreal complement inhibitor
      (POT-4) therapy in AMD patients with subfoveal CNV.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Understand and sign the IRB-approved informed consent document for the study.

          -  Age ≥ 50 years.

          -  In the study eye, diagnosis of exudative AMD defined by the presence of drusen larger
             than 63 μm.

          -  In the study eye, the presence of a choroidal neovascular lesion, either predominantly
             or minimally classic or occult with no classic in nature, determined by the Digital
             Angiography Reading Center (DARC) with the CNV defined by its fluorescein angiographic
             (FA) features.

          -  The lesion must contain some visible active CNV, but the active CNV need not be under
             the fovea itself.

          -  Visual acuity of 20/60 or worse in the study eye as measured on an ETDRS chart.

          -  Retinal photographs and angiography of sufficient quality, allowing assessment of the
             macular area according to standard clinical practice, can be obtained.

          -  Willingness to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Choroidal neovascularization in the study eye associated with other ocular diseases
             such as pathologic myopia, ocular histoplasmosis or posterior uveitis, etc.

          -  Decreased vision, in the study eye, due to retinal disease not attributable to CNV,
             such as nonexudative forms of AMD, geographic atrophy, inherited retinal dystrophy,
             uveitis or epiretinal membrane, a vitelliform-like lesion of the outer retina (e.g.,
             as in pattern dystrophies or basal laminar drusen), idiopathic parafoveal
             telangiectasis, or central serous retinopathy. Participants who have any additional
             ocular diseases that have irreversibly compromised or, during follow-up, could likely
             compromise the VA of the study eye including amblyopia, anterior ischemic optic
             neuropathy, clinically significant diabetic macular edema, severe non proliferative
             diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

          -  Decreased vision, in the study eye, due to significant media opacity such as corneal
             disease or cataract, or opacity precluding photography of the retina.

          -  Cataract surgery within three months of enrolment.

          -  Presence of hemorrhage greater than 50% of the CNV lesion.

             30 days prior to enrollment in the study.

          -  Previous Avastin (bevacizumab) injection in the study eye (eye to be treated) within
             30 days prior to enrollment in the study.

          -  Previous corticosteroid injection in the study eye (eye to be treated) within 180 days

          -  Medical problems that make consistent follow-up over the treatment period unlikely
             (e.g. stroke, severe MI, end stage malignancy), or in general a poor medical risk
             because of other systemic diseases or active uncontrolled infections.

          -  Advance coronary artery disease or cerebral vascular disease.
