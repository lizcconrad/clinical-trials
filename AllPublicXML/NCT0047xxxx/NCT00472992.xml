      The primary objective of the Registry was to evaluate the outcomes of pregnancy in women with
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Crohn's Disease (CD) who were exposed to TYSABRI® at any time
      within 90 days prior to first day of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) or during pregnancy.

      This study was conducted in coordination with the TYSABRI® Global Observational Program in
      Safety (TYGRIS) observational study in the United States (US), Canada, and Rest of World
      (ROW).

      The Coordinating Center (CC) monitored participants throughout their pregnancies and
      monitored the infants until 8 to 12 weeks of age in the US and Canada, and within 4 weeks
      after the Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD) in the ROW.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        Females who become pregnant while they are taking TYSABRI® as part of the TYGRIS program,
        during a clinical trial with TYSABRI® that is sponsored by Biogen-Idec, or in the
        post-marketing setting may enroll in this Registry, as follows:

          1. Documentation that the patient was exposed to TYSABRI® within 90 days prior to first
             day of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) or during pregnancy. (If exposure dates are
             unknown, the reporter must be able to specify or estimate trimester of exposure).

          2. The outcome of the pregnancy must not be known at the time of enrollment. For
             pregnancies for which the outcomes are known at the time of enrollment, the
             information will be collected as retrospective reports and analyzed separately.

          3. For US patients, verbal informed consent must be collected at the time of enrollment.
             The Coordinating Center (CC) obtains verbal informed consent (if verbal consent has
             not already been obtained by the physician). The CC then mails the patient a Release
             of Medical Information form to sign and return. If the patient is a minor, verbal
             consent must be obtained from the parent or legal guardian and verbal assent must be
             obtained from the patient.

          4. For Canadian patients, a written informed consent must be collected by the TYGRIS
             investigator at the time of enrollment. A Release of Medical Information form will
             also be signed by the patient and returned to the CC.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
