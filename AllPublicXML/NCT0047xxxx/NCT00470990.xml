  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common metabolic disorders in the U.S, estimated to affect
      16 million Americans. Established risk factors for this disease include obesity, increased
      waist/hip ratio, high insulin levels in the blood, and insulin resistance. Testosterone may
      play a role in developing or preventing diabetes, but we do not yet know for sure. The
      purpose of this research study is to determine if changing testosterone levels in men will
      result in changes in insulin sensitivity. Information learned form this research study may
      have important public health implications and may point to new strategies for treating or
      preventing diabetes.

      The overall aim of this study is to examine the effect of testosterone on insulin sensitivity
      using the models of acute and chronic hypogonadism. All subjects will be in good general
      health and 2 groups of men will be studied in this protocol:

        1. Thirty healthy normal men aged 18-75 years with normal blood pressure, normal
           testosterone levels, and not taking any medications known to influence glucose
           homeostasis or testosterone

        2. Ten adult men (over the age of 18) with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
           (IHH)and normal thyroid, adrenal, and growth hormone axes as well as normal prolactin
           levels and no abnormalities on imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary region. These men
           will be on no medications known to influence glucose homeostasis and will have been off
           hormone therapy for a suitable washout period depending on the type of prior androgen
           replacement.
