      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the attitudes and perspectives of 150 oncologists and 150 geriatricians or
           primary care providers regarding the adjuvant treatment of older women with breast
           cancer of varying ages, health, and functional status.

        -  Determine whether homogeneity exists in treatment recommendations.

        -  Determine the relative impact of chronological age, baseline health, and functional
           status on treatment recommendations.

      OUTLINE: Participants complete a 25-minute online survey regarding their treatment
      recommendations for older women with breast cancer of varying ages, health, and functional
      status.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 participants will be accrued for this study.
