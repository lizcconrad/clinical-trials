      1. The first aim of this proposal is to pilot the feasibility of weekly phone monitoring of
           infant feeding and illness patterns in a socio-economically and racially diverse
           population. Specifically, the investigators aim to estimate the rate of group loss to
           follow up from birth to 13 weeks (3 months) of age with weekly phone interview of
           mothers of late preterm (LPT, gestational age 34 0/7- 36 6/7 weeks gestation) infants.

        2. The second aim is to describe breastfeeding and formula feeding practices, and rates of
           illness and post-discharge hospital care utilization, through age 13 weeks (3 months)
           among late preterm infants born at MacDonald Women's Hospital. The investigators
           estimate that the rate of exclusive breastfeeding among LPT infants at 3 months of age
           is less than the documented rate of 37% for all infants in Cuyahoga County.

    <textblock>
      Late preterm infants (LPT, gestational age 34 0/7 - 36 6/7 weeks) are the largest proportion
      of all preterm (less than 37 weeks gestation) infants. Recent evidence finds an increased
      risk of early post-discharge morbidity and re-hospitalization among LPT as compared to full
      term infants, which is linked to breastfeeding, specifically to early lactation failure and
      decreased breast milk intake. Accurate and inexpensive methods to collect data on rates of
      breastfeeding and early morbidity among LPT infants are critical to design, implementation
      and monitoring of effective interventions. This pilot study evaluates the feasibility of
      weekly phone calling in a racially and socioeconomically diverse population of mothers of LPT
      infants.
