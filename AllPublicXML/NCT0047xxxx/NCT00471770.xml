      To determine the proportion of hospitalized pneumonia cases in children aged 60 months or
      less associated with vaccine-preventable Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14,
      18C, 19F, 23F).

      Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria, including parental informed consent to collect
      clinical-epidemiological information, will have a deep respiratory aspirate specimen to
      determine the etiology of the lower respiratory tract infection. Clinicians may obtain other
      diagnostic specimens, such as pleural fluid, lung tap, cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal
      culture, or serum for serological assays, as indicated clinically. The chest radiograph will
      be taken and read locally according to predetermined criteria and by staff radiologists
      trained in radiographic criteria for pneumonia. Bacterial isolates other than Streptococcus
      pneumoniae will be identified according to standardized procedures. S. pneumoniae isolates
      will be transported to central laboratories for confirmation of identity, serotyping and
      antibiotic resistance testing, using standard techniques. Serotype will be determined using
      type-specific sera (Quellung reaction). Antibiotic susceptibility to penicillin, cefuroxime,
      ceftriaxone, erythromycin, Amoxycillin, Ofloxacin, Vancomycin, and imipenem be conducted
      using E-test according to standardized procedures at the central facilities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age, 60 months or less

          -  Meets study criteria for clinical pneumonia

          -  All the examination are/can be done within (before or after) 72 hours to enrollment
             time

          -  Informed consent obtained from parent or guardian

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received any pneumococcal vaccine in the past

          -  Current or underlying conditions that would pose a hazard in obtaining the deep
             respiratory aspirate (e.g., bleeding diathesis, severe respiratory compromise and
             others as determined by clinician) Aspirates may be obtained from patients who are
             intubated

          -  Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the clinician/investigator would
             pose a hazard to the child by participating in the study

          -  Children with recurrent pneumonia will enter into the study on only one occasion
