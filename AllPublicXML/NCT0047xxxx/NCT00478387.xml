      The purpose of this study is to determine what the immune response is of ovarian cancer
      patients in remission, when they are given the flu vaccine. After receiving the flu vaccine,
      patients will have blood drawn 5 times in 12 months to study antibody response to the flu
      vaccine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects must have a histologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer or primary
             peritoneal carcinoma. Time from completion of chemotherapy will be no more than 6
             months.

          -  If no clinical evidence of disease is present after diagnosis with Stage III or IV
             disease and completion of primary surgery and chemotherapy, or, if no clinical
             evidence of disease is present after completion of chemotherapy for a disease
             recurrence diagnosed after a progression-free interval of at least 2 years, for
             patients of any initial stage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior malignancy (except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) within the past five
             years.

          -  Presence of active CNS disease.

          -  Active bacterial, viral or fungal infections.

          -  Chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiation therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  History of active autoimmunity or immunosuppression.

          -  Use of immunosuppressive drugs within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Patients may
             receive chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive medications at the discretion of their
             physician during the subsequent year after influenza vaccination without exclusion
             from the study.

          -  Patients with tumors of low malignant potential (borderline tumors) will not be
             eligible.

          -  Prior influenza vaccination with the current vaccine.

          -  History of serious sensitivity to eggs, or previous influenza vaccine.

          -  Pregnant of breastfeeding subjects.
