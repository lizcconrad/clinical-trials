  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use MRI imaging, cognitive testing and outcome questionnaires to determine
      how the brain recovers and reorganizes after an injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The extent of recovery from brain injury is often difficult to predict because of our limited
      understanding of how the brain changes as it heals. New brain imaging methods may help in
      this regard. One imaging technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has
      made it possible to study the brain &quot;at work&quot;; that is, we can see regions of the brain that
      are active during particular tasks such as focusing attention, making decisions, or
      remembering words and pictures. Another MRI method called diffusion tensor imaging provides
      information on the pathways between brain regions that may be altered with brain injury.

      The goals of this research are to 1) determine the brain regions involved in making accurate
      judgments about one's abilities and disabilities after a brain injury and whether damage to
      these brain areas affects outcome; and 2) examine how recovery of cognitive and physical
      abilities relates to changes in brain function over time. In order to accomplish the first
      goal we will recruit Veterans who have sustained a head injury and matched control subjects.
      For the second goal, we are asking patients and controls who have previously participated in
      brain injury research with our lab to come back for another visit at three years post-injury.
