    <textblock>
      Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are a group of rare inherited metabolism disorders. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate how UCD-related neurologic injuries affect adults with one of
      the most common types of UCD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UCDs are a group of rare genetic diseases that affect how protein is broken down in the body.
      The cause of UCDs is a deficiency in one of eight enzymes responsible for removing ammonia, a
      waste product of protein metabolism, from the bloodstream. Normally, ammonia is converted
      into urea and then removed from the body in the form of urine. However, in people with UCDs,
      ammonia accumulates unchecked and is not removed from the body. Toxic levels of ammonia can
      build up and cause irreversible neurologic damage that can affect metabolism, cognition,
      sensation, and movement. This study will focus on the most common enzyme disorder among UCDs,
      ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), a disorder inherited from mothers. Using
      different types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study will evaluate how UCD-related
      neurologic injuries affect metabolism, cognition, sensation, and movement in adults with
      OTCD.

      Participants in this study will attend an initial study visit that will include a review of
      medical history, current symptoms, impairments, and diet history; urine and blood collection;
      a physical exam; a full neurological exam; and cognitive and motor testing. During this
      visit, participants will undergo imaging studies and additional cognitive and motor testing
      over a 2- to 3-day period. This will include standard MRI studies and four sessions
      consisting of functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging, and 1H magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy. For the fMRI study, participants perform various motor and behavioral tasks
      while in the imaging scanner. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is used to study and
      evaluate the chemical makeup of specific brain areas. Diffusion tensor imaging is used to
      assess myelination of major brain pathways and their alteration in disease states. This study
      will involve one-time participation. There will be no follow-up visits for this study.

    <measure>Concentration of Glutamine and Myoinositol by MRS</measure>
    <time_frame>one time measurement at study baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Concentration based on area under curve on 1H MRS and quantitated by LCModel. A metabolite's tissue concentration is related to the integrated amplitude of the MRS signal it produces. Integrated amplitude is the area under the MRS signal curve. While MRS signals are usually acquired in the time domain as free induction decays or echoes, they are usually viewed and analyzed in the frequency domain. The frequency domain representation is derived from the acquired time domain data by the Fourier Transform. The protocol we use selects 257 averages. This means, 257 free induction decays. The machine summates the data at each time point to generate one value for the area under the curve. Therefore, we don't have the measurement at each time point.
Furthermore, we measured voxels in two different brain areas containing different kinds of brain matter: one voxel was located in posterior cingulate gray matter (PCGM) and the other in parietal white matter (PWM).</description>

    <measure>Functional MRI Activation in N-Back Tast</measure>
    <time_frame>one time measurement at study baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of OTCD patients and healthy controls during an N-Back task comparing 2-back and 1-back conditions. This contrast was created for each participant using SPM and then entered into a group analysis in which we compare percent signal change between groups. Therefore, we never see BOLD signal change at the individual level, which is why we never see &quot;scores&quot; or numbers at the individual level and we cannot calculate a measure of dispersion for this data.</description>

    <measure>Fractional Anisotropy</measure>
    <time_frame>one time measurement at study baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of white matter integrity in OTCD Patients and Controls in frontal white matter. Fractional anisotropy values fall on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 meaning that the diffusion of water is isotropic and unrestricted, or equally restricted, in all directions and with 1 meaning that diffusion occurs along only one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. Scores closer to 1 are associated with intact white matter while scores closer to 0 are associated with white matter damage.</description>

        <title>Concentration of Glutamine and Myoinositol by MRS</title>
        <description>Concentration based on area under curve on 1H MRS and quantitated by LCModel. A metabolite’s tissue concentration is related to the integrated amplitude of the MRS signal it produces. Integrated amplitude is the area under the MRS signal curve. While MRS signals are usually acquired in the time domain as free induction decays or echoes, they are usually viewed and analyzed in the frequency domain. The frequency domain representation is derived from the acquired time domain data by the Fourier Transform. The protocol we use selects 257 averages. This means, 257 free induction decays. The machine summates the data at each time point to generate one value for the area under the curve. Therefore, we don’t have the measurement at each time point.
Furthermore, we measured voxels in two different brain areas containing different kinds of brain matter: one voxel was located in posterior cingulate gray matter (PCGM) and the other in parietal white matter (PWM).</description>

        <title>Fractional Anisotropy</title>
        <description>Measure of white matter integrity in OTCD Patients and Controls in frontal white matter. Fractional anisotropy values fall on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 meaning that the diffusion of water is isotropic and unrestricted, or equally restricted, in all directions and with 1 meaning that diffusion occurs along only one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. Scores closer to 1 are associated with intact white matter while scores closer to 0 are associated with white matter damage.</description>
