  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence has shown poor outcome for adult patients with pre-operative pulmonary hypertension
      following closure of an atrial septal defect. Life-threatening pulmonary hypertensive crises
      may occur in these patients when they no longer have an atrial communication to decompress
      high right heart pressures. This concern has led some to advocate fenestrated patch closure
      of ASDs in patients with pulmonary hypertension with the prospect of a repeated procedure in
      order to close the fenestrations at a later date.

      Pre-operative resolution of pulmonary hypertension would clearly provide the best long-term
      outcome for these patients, allowing a definitive surgical procedure. There are no reported
      cases of resolution of pulmonary hypertension with the use of pulmonary vasodilators allowing
      successful ASD closure.

      We report the case of a patient with trisomy 21 and a primum atrial septum defect with
      associated cleft mitral valve who was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 8 days of
      life. Elevated pulmonary pressures were documented by cardiac catheterization during which
      the patient was found to have minimally responsive pulmonary vasculature to the
      administration of oxygen. He was started on pulmonary vasodilators which were continued for
      the following 5 months which resulted in gradual reduction in estimated PA pressure allowing
      successful closure of the primum ASD and repair of the cleft mitral valve. Following surgery,
      he was not restarted on pulmonary vasodilators and has continued to do well. The ability to
      reverse his pulmonary hypertension through the use of pulmonary vasodilators made him a
      candidate for his successful, definitive surgical repair. He currently has no residual
      cardiac problems and requires no cardiac medications. There will be no patient follow-up.
