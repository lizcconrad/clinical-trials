    <textblock>
      This study is planned to investigate the incidence of intraoperative floppy iris and its
      relationship with pseudoexfoliation, diabetes, hypertension as well as systemic alpha-1
      adrenergic blocker use.

      Our aim is to investigate the incidence of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) signs
      and evaluate the relationship of IFIS signs as well as complete IFIS with pseudoexfoliation,
      diabetes, hypertension, and alpha-1 adrenergic blocker (A1AB) use. Five-hundred patients will
      be included in this prospective study. Preoperatively, pupil diameter before and after
      dilation, presence of pseudoexfoliation, history of diabetes, hypertension, and use of any
      A1AB will be recorded. Intraoperative adverse events such as pupillary constriction, iris
      billowing, and iris prolapse from the wound will be noted. Multinomial regression analysis
      will be used to evaluate the relationship of IFIS signs with pseudoexfoliation, diabetes,
      hypertension, and A1AB usage. According to the results we will determine the incidence of
      IFIS in our patient population and evaluate its relationship with alpha-1 adrenergic blocker
      use. We will also investigate the relationship of floppy iris problems with
      pseudoexfoliation, diabetes, high blood pressure.
