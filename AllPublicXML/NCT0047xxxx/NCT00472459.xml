  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. organ recipients, have a higher occurrence of AK
      than the untreated population. Keratotic lesions (i.e. AK lesions and warts) in this
      population is highly associated with development of SCC also with 10 times higher mortality
      rate because of SCC than expected. The risk of developing skin cancer, predominantly SCC and
      BCC, increases with graft survival time and the length of immunosuppressive treatment period.

      The higher risk of developing skin malignancy and more aggressive skin malignancies in this
      population, indicate the need for early removal of these pre-malignant lesions.

      In this study, two contralateral areas (5x10 cm2) with skin lesions within the patient will
      be compared. One area will receive Metvix PDT at defined intervals and the other will receive
      lesion specific treatment at the discretion of the investigator. The primary end-point will
      be the accumulated number of new lesions during the study and number of AK lesions that show
      complete response 3 months after baseline. Secondary endpoints will be number of BCC lesions
      that show complete response, number of recurrent lesions, assessment of cosmetic outcome and
      safety.

      The treatment area (5x10 cm2) will be treated at baseline and at 3, 9 and 15 months visits.
      At baseline the area will be treated with fractionated Metvix® PDT treatment consisting of
      two treatment one week apart and at 3, 9, and 15 months visits with single Metvix® PDT
      treatment. The patients will be evaluated for occurrence of new lesions, lesion response and
      recurrence at 3 (not recurrence), 9, 15, 21 and 27 months visits. New and recurrent lesions
      in the treated area will be treated with Metvix® PDT treatment. Lesions with partial response
      in the treated area will be re-treated with Metvix® PDT and lesions with no response will be
      treated with lesion specific treatment at the discretion of the investigator.

      In the contralateral control area (5x10 cm2), new and recurrent lesions and lesions in
      non-complete response will be treated with lesion specific treatment at the discretion of the
      investigator at each study visit.
