  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients experience a slowly progressive, unpredictable loss of
      vision which eventually leads to bare or no light perception, posing a continuous threat to
      patients' independence. Negative psychological states such as distress, sleepiness, anxiety
      and depression are common in RP patients due to the nature of this chronic, disabling
      disease. Psychophysical vision measures are more variable in legally blind RP subjects than
      in normally sighted individuals, and RP patients indicate that variations in vision are often
      related to stress. The primary goal of this research is to examine the vision fluctuations
      within and between days among RP patients using vision tests self-administered by patients
      through their home computers, and determine associations with factors such as perceived
      stress, mood states, sleepiness, or light exposure. The administration of questionnaires will
      allow us to gain some insight into which underlying psychological factors impact certain
      vision measures, allowing the design of future interventional research to attempt to reduce
      such factors. The aims of many future treatment clinical trials for RP will be to improve
      vision and/or reduce the rate of vision loss; thus the sources that lead to increased
      variability of vision need to be identified and alleviated to enable precise evaluation of
      interventions and improve patients' quality of life.

      An initial study visit for enrollment will take place at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye
      Institute's Lions Vision Center. The investigators will enroll 50 RP subjects with vision
      better than hand motions or bare light perception, who are able to complete PC-based vision
      tests. Written informed consent for study participation will be obtained at the first study
      visit.

      At home PC-based vision tests will be performed bi-weekly, for 2 months (i.e. 16 measures) to
      capture the full range of variability. Binocular visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity
      (CS) and visual field (VF) tests will be self-administered by the RP subjects, and will take
      ~10 minutes. Three brief questionnaires will be administered by PC after each vision test
      session: 1) Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); 2) Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS); and 3) Positive
      and Negative Affect Schedules (PANAS). Lab-based vision tests will take place at the time of
      enrollment, and will include: (1) distance best-corrected VA with the ETDRS charts, (2)
      Pelli-Robson letter CS, (3) Goldmann VF with V/4e and III/4e isopters, and (4) Humphrey 10-2
      or 30-2 VF FastPac program. The vision tests and questionnaires are a part of routine
      clinical care.

      After enrollment, The investigators will obtain information about psychological factors by
      administering the following questionnaires by phone on one occasion: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index, Emotional Stability, Beck Depression Inventory, the Self-Motivation Inventory, and the
      Life Experiences Survey. Questionnaires assessing health-related quality of life (SF-36) and
      mental status (MMSE) will also be administered. The investigators will use a phone version of
      the MMSE only for screening. Other variables that may be of importance to the study will be
      assessed through a complete patient medical, ocular and social history, including questions
      such as duration of visual impairment, occupation, marital status, etc. The questionnaires
      are often used in research settings and sometimes in clinical settings. Many patients
      appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback since these areas are not always addressed as
      part of routine, clinical care. Focus group meetings, facilitated by Dr. George and Lori
      Edwards, will help us begin to understand factors are perceived to influence fluctuations in
      vision.

      Subjects will participate in study procedures over the course of a 3 month period. This
      includes an enrollment visit at our center with lab-based vision tests, and then
      approximately 2 months PC-based vision testing.
