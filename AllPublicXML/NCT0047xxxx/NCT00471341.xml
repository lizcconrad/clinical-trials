    <textblock>
      This study involves a drug called celecoxib, which is commonly prescribed for people with
      arthritis. Arthritis is caused by inflammation of the joints or tissues. Inflammation also
      occurs in the blood vessels that lead to your heart, and the purpose of this study is to see
      if celecoxib can reduce the blood vessel inflammation associated with high cholesterol and
      heart disease.

    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammation of the blood vessel wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Elevated
      levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as blood pressure are known to
      be proinflammatory. Recent information suggests that acute ischemic events are associated
      with exacerbations in inflammation. Some data suggest that aspirin use is associated with
      suppression of markers of inflammation, and this response has been linked with improved
      outcome. Similarly, HMG Co-A Reductase inhibitors clearly reduce adverse outcomes in patients
      with atherosclerosis and recently, HMG Co-A Reductase inhibitor use has also been linked to
      reduction in inflammation. Due to the strong association of atherogenesis and plaque
      stability with inflammation, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, has been
      evaluated as a potential tool for clinicians to assess cardiovascular risk, and has been
      found to be highly correlated. There is also evidence to suggest that cyclooxygenase 2
      (COX-2) enzyme is expressed in plaque at regions which are vulnerable to rupture.
      Accordingly, this study is designed to investigate the potential reduction in vascular
      inflammation from a specific COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, as measured by a reduction from
      baseline of CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-alpha). This is
      a double blind, placebo controlled pilot study in hypertensive patients with coronary artery
      disease and dyslipidemia, to evaluate the effect of celecoxib versus placebo on inflammatory
      markers. Patients will receive study drug for three months.
