  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with standard platinum based
      chemotherapy regimens ultimately develop disease progression. Active therapies with improved
      toxicity profiles are clearly needed in this setting. The primary objective of this trial is
      to assess the toxicity profile and to determine the effect on progression free survival and
      time to progression in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with sorafenib in addition to
      carboplatin and pemetrexed.

  <why_stopped>
    Sorafenib administered in the combination with pemetrexed-carboplatin appears to enhance
    thrombocytopenia compared to historical data.
