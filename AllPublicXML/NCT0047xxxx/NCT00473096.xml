    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test an informative computer-based program to
      help women in making good choices among options for treating early stage breast cancer. Women
      who are exposed to the computerized program will, when compared to women who receive standard
      of care offered at the hospital: (a) be more knowledgeable about treatment options,(b) be
      more satisfied with their treatment decision, and (c) be more assured about their treatment
      choice.

      The purpose of this project is to develop and test a computer-based decision support system
      on breast cancer for low-income women who speak English or Spanish. This project is designed
      to respond to the under utilization of breast conserving surgery by women with early stage
      breast cancer, as indicated by both national and local data on treatment choices. The
      literature suggests that underuse of BCS by women for whom it is the recommended therapy may
      relate to inadequacies in efforts to educate them about treatment options. The program was
      designed to convey information to women with varying levels of reading ability. This was done
      through multimedia approaches which include voice-over narrative in simple English or
      Spanish, and use of photo novella and/or &quot;soap opera&quot; presentation of situational material
      that allows women to explore possible consequences associated with different decisions.

      Comparison(s): Women exposed to the computer-based decision support program on breast cancer
      treatment, receiving standard care and education offered at two public hospitals, compared to
      women exposed to standard care and education at the same public hospitals.
