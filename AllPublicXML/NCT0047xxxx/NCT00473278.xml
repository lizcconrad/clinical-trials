  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The significance of our study is in the importance of understanding the quality and quantity
      of proteins in the human tear film, and any unique aspects of tears in children. This pilot
      study will provide data to plan prospective research to better delineate the utility of tear
      proteins in diagnosing and following disease status in a non-invasive fashion.
