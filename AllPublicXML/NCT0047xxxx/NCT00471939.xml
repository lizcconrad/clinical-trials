  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multi-centre, controlled study comparing the safety and tolerability on
      wound healing following an application of I-020502 in a concentration of 1μg/mL TG-PDGF.AB
      versus staples applied in the same patient to burn areas requiring autologous meshed skin
      grafting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent by the patient or his/her legal representative.

             to surgery (screening).

          4. Patients with burn wound(s) between ≥ 5 % and ≤ 50 % TBSA.

          5. Patients with a contiguous deep partial thickness/full thickness wound(s) of two
             comparable sites either contiguous or separate in the same location (e.g. leg) each
             sized between 1% and 2% TBSA but not more than 400 cm2.

          6. Patients who are willing to comply with treatment applications and instructions by the
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          2. Patients with known or suspected allergies to any of the components of the wound
             healing gel I-020502 (e.g. hypersensitivity to bovine proteins).

          3. Digits, head, genitalia, palms of hands, soles of feet, and face are excluded as test
             sites.

          4. Electrical and/or chemical burns.

          5. Patients that are judged to have significant pulmonary compromise.

          6. Transcutaneous tissue oxygenation &lt; 90%.

          7. Clinically significant infections at wound sites.

          8. Clinically significant systemic infections.

          9. Suspicion or presence of active systemic or local cancer or tumor of any kind.

         10. Patients with known immunodeficiency disorders, either congenital or acquired.

         11. Patients with vascular or skin disorders that directly affect the designated wound
             site.

         12. Patients with Diabetes mellitus.

         13. Patients with chronic malnourishment.

         14. Chronic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or systemic corticosteroids within the
             last 2 months prior to surgery.

         15. Any other acute or chronic concurrent medical conditions that in the Investigator's
             opinion are a contraindication to skin mesh grafting and study participation.

         16. Participation in another investigational study within 30 days prior to surgery, for
             investigational devices, or within the last three months for investigational drugs
             related to wound healing.
