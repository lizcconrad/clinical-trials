      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out the best dose of cyclophosphamide
      that can be given with fludarabine, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and low-dose total body
      irradiation (TBI) to patients before a bone marrow transplant to decrease the risks related
      to the transplant while not decreasing the effectiveness of the transplant from an unrelated
      donor.

      Your bone marrow normally produces white cells, red cells, and platelets. Once ready, these
      cells are released into the bloodstream. Aplastic anemia is a blood disorder where the bone
      marrow has stopped working and produces very few or no cells to be released into the
      bloodstream. If not successfully treated, this condition will almost always lead to death,
      primarily because of infection or bleeding. A bone marrow transplant is an option for you
      because your doctors believe it may cure your aplastic anemia. As you do not have a matched,
      sibling donor, a matched, unrelated donor (i.e. not a blood relative) has been selected for
      you. Before you receive a matched, unrelated donor marrow transplant, you will receive
      medications and low dose total body irradiation (TBI) to kill immune cells in your body that
      might reject the cells from your donor. This will allow your body to accept the donor marrow.
      This is called engraftment.

      Cyclophosphamide is a medication that will be used in this study to lower your immune system
      in order to allow your body to accept the donor marrow cells.

      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will be given medications and TBI
      before your bone marrow transplant to allow your body to accept your donor's stem cells. This
      is called the conditioning regimen. Before your transplant, a catheter (i.e. a soft plastic
      tube) will be inserted into a vein under the collarbone to allow for medications and fluids
      to be given.

      The conditioning regimen includes a combination of drugs used to kill the cells in your body
      that may reject the donor cells. The drugs to be used in this study are fludarabine,
      cyclophosphamide, and ATG, as well as low-dose to TBI. All participants in this study will
      receive the same amount of fludarabine, ATG and low-dose TBI. You will receive fludarabine on
      the fifth, fourth, third and second days before your transplant by intravenous infusion
      through your catheter over about 30 minutes.

      You will receive ATG on the fourth, third, and second days before your transplant. This will
      be given intravenously through your catheter over 4 to 6 hours. ATG is an animal product, and
      your study doctor may decide to use a horse or a rabbit product. Both products have similar
      side effects and efficacy. You will receive TBI on the day before your transplant.

      Different groups of patients will get different amounts of cyclophosphamide. You will receive
      cyclophosphamide for a total of either 1 or 2 days before your transplant. The number of days
      depends on your group. You will be placed in the group that is being tested at that time.
      Your doctor will tell you which group you are in. Neither you nor your doctor can choose the
      group. Sometimes there may be a short waiting period for a new patient to be entered in the
      study, and you should discuss with your doctor how this waiting period may affect you.

      The main purpose of this study is to find the best dose of cyclophosphamide. This means that
      small groups of patients are treated with a given dose of cyclophosphamide and followed
      closely until it can be shown that the new marrow has been accepted by the body and the
      treatment has not caused any unacceptable harm. In the early part of the study, participants
      were receiving cyclophosphamide for either 3, 2, 1 or 0 days. The doctors who are conducting
      the study have by now gained some experience with this conditioning schedule, and this has
      helped them to narrow down the number of possible doses of cyclophosphamide that you, as a
      new participant, may receive. You should be aware that some participants who received 3 days
      of cyclophosphamide (the highest dose) suffered severe side effects (including death), and
      therefore, new patients are no longer being placed in this group. You should also be aware
      that participants who received zero days of cyclophosphamide (the lowest dose) experienced
      graft rejection (meaning, their body did not accept the new marrow, and the new cells failed
      to grow). Therefore, new participants are no longer being assigned to this group.
      Participants who now come to transplantation will be treated with either 1 or 2 days of
      cyclophosphamide.

      After the conditioning regimen, the donor marrow cells will be given to you through your
      catheter. The cells will travel into the bloodstream to reach your bone marrow where they are
      expected to make healthy, new blood cells. This step is necessary to replace your diseased
      marrow and because the high dosages of drugs given to you during the conditioning regimen may
      also damage or destroy healthy cells in your bone marrow. Until the new cells begin producing
      healthy blood cells, you will be at an increased risk of bleeding or developing an infection.

      Following the transplant (at least every week until roughly 100 days after transplant, then
      every 3-6 months for 2 years after that), you will have a complete medical history and
      physical exam, including measurement of height and weight. Blood (about 2-4 tablespoons) and
      urine may be collected for routine tests. You will also have a bone marrow aspiration and
      biopsy at 30 and 100 days after transplant and then every 4-6 months for 2 years after that.

      You will be expected to take medications such as cyclosporine (or tacrolimus) by mouth for no
      less than 6-9 months to prevent graft-versus-host disease. You will also be expected to stay
      at the transplant center for at least 3 months after your transplant. You will be asked to
      return to the transplant center for regular follow-up care. The standard tests will be done
      at that time.

      You will be in the study for up to 2 years. Follow-up for transplant will last as long as you
      require care. However, researchers would like to keep track of your medical condition for the
      rest of your life by contacting you and the doctor providing your regular medical care by
      phone or mail once a year. Keeping in touch with you and checking on your condition every
      year helps researchers to look at the long-term effects of the study and transplantation in
      general. It is not necessary for you to agree to follow-up for longer than 2 years to
      participate in this study. After 2 years, you will continue to be followed by your transplant
      doctor, but no longer as part of the study.

      You can be taken off the study (with or without your consent) for several reasons. You may be
      taken off study if you no longer meet the study requirements. Ask you doctor if you would
      like more information about this. You can be taken off study if you need a medical treatment
      not allowed in this study, or the study chair decides that it would be in your best interest
      to leave the study. You may be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur. You will be
      taken off study if your transplant fails to take. In this case, your doctor will decide what
      the best treatment for you will be. You may be taken off study if you are unable to follow
      study instructions or keep study appointments. You may also be taken off study if the study
      is stopped by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the National Institutes of Health
      (NIH).

      This is an investigational study. All of the drugs and medications used in this study are
      FDA-approved and commercially available.

      Up to 94 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 9 will be enrolled at
      MD Anderson.
