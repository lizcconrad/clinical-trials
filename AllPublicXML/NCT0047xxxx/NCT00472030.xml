      The primary objective is to test the safety and efficacy of Xolair in the treatment of the
      autoimmune blistering disease, bullous pemphigoid (BP).

      This is a pilot, open label case-control study. Patients treated with Xolair will be compared
      to patients receiving standard treatment with prednisone.

      The enrollment period for the study is 24 weeks: 16 weeks active treatment and 8 additional
      weeks of observation.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to test the safety and efficacy of Omalizumab (Xolair)
      in the treatment of the autoimmune blistering disease, bullous pemphigoid (BP).

      Study Rationale: The current treatment for bullous pemphigoid is non-specific
      immunosuppression, causing great morbidity in these patients. Recently, pathogenic
      Immunoglogulin Class E autoantibodies have been identified in these patients. Development of
      a more targeted approach to treatment may reduce morbidity.

      Methodology: This is a pilot, open-label case-control study. Patients treated with Omalizumab
      (Xolair) will be compared to patients receiving standard treatment with prednisone.

      Number of centers and patients: This is a single center study that will enroll 12 patients.

      Population: Bullous pemphigoid patients, meeting clinical, histological and immunologic
      criteria for the disease will be enrolled. Pregnant women, children less than 18 years of
      age, and patients unable to give consent will be excluded from this preliminary study.

      Investigational drug: Xolair® (Omalizumab)

      Study duration: 24 weeks: 16 weeks of active treatment, 8 additional weeks of observation

      Evaluation criteria: Primary: 1. Time to cessation of new blister formation. 2. Percent body
      surface area of skin involved before and after treatment 3. Total and average daily dose of
      prednisone required in 30, 60 and 180 days after starting Xolair. Secondary: 1. Number of
      circulating eosinophils 2. Measurement of circulating anti-BMZ (basement membrane zone)
      autoantibodies 3. Histamine release assay.

          -  Patients must have the clinical and histological findings consistent with bullous
             pemphigoid. Clinically this is defined as urticarial plaques and/or vesicles and
             bullae. Histologically patients must show characteristic eosinophilic spongiosis
             and/or subepidermal separation of the skin consistent with BP.

          -  Patients must have either a positive direct (IgG and/or C3 at the BMZ) or indirect
             (IgG on the roof of salt-split skin) immunofluorescence microscopy features of
             pemphigoid.

          -  Patients of both sexes, all races and ethnic backgrounds that are 18 years of age or
             older will be eligible to participate in this study.

          -  Patients much have more than 5% total body surface involved, since patients with less
             extensive disease are often treated with topical measures only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using the contraception method(s) specified during
             this study. Women of childbearing potential must use proven birth control methods

             combined with gel or foam with spermicide, tubal ligation, or a partner who has had a
             vasectomy).

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients under the age of 18.

          -  Patients unable to give informed consent.

          -  Known sensitivity to study drug(s) or class of study drug(s).

          -  Patients with severe medical condition(s) that in the view of the investigator
             prohibits participation in the study.

          -  Any cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer in the past 5 years.

          -  All non-melanoma skin cancers must have been adequately treated at entrance to the
