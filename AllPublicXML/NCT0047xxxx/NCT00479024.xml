      To determine comparative 1-year outcomes in renally impaired patients who previously
      underwent cardiac angiography with Isovue®-370 or Visipaque™ 320 as part of the IOP-104 trial
      protocol and were evaluable for determination of post-contrast significant renal injury
      (defined as &gt;25% increase in SCr or &gt;25% increase in cystatin C).

        Inclusion Criteria: (from previous CARE trial)

          -  • Screening eGFR between 20 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2

               -  Baseline SCr obtained within 72 hours and before hydration or, if obtained after
                  hydration started, had the screening blood sample obtained within 72 hours of
                  contrast administration

               -  At least one post dose blood sample available

               -  Received randomized contrast agent

               -  Underwent only one cardiac angiography procedure (diagnostic cardiac angiography
                  followed by PCI was considered as one procedure if confirmed by investigator and
                  total duration does not exceed 12 hours), then for this study

               -  Provides written Informed Consent and is willing to comply with protocol
                  requirements;

               -  Was included in the patient list provided by Bracco;

               -  At least 1 year has passed since the patient's participation ended in the
                  original CARE trial, as determined from the list provided by Bracco

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Screening eGFR outside the range of 20 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2

               -  Unstable kidney disease or requiring dialysis upon enrollment

               -  Prior to the post-dose blood draw, suffered a critical clinical event that would
                  affect the reliability of serological measurement of renal function

               -  Did not receive randomized contrast agent per CARE protocol

               -  Did not undergo a cardiac angiography procedure per CARE protocol
