        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patient must:

          1. Have had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of Grade 1 or 2 FL, according to World
             Health Organization classification (Harris et al. 1999), at the original time of
             diagnosis. Pathology must be confirmed locally prior to enrollment at the
             investigational site.

          2. Have Ann Arbor Stage III or IV disease.

          3. Must be chemo-naive OR have relapsed disease after receiving only one prior
             chemotherapy regimen. The chemotherapy must have been completed at least 6 months
             prior to first dose of study treatment. Relapse after one prior course of single-agent
             rituximab treatment (in the chemo-naive setting) is also allowed if completed at least
             6 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

          4. Patients must not require cytoreductive therapy for at least 3 months from first dose
             of study treatment, in the opinion of the investigator.

          5. Previous radiation therapy is allowed, but should have been limited and must not have
             included whole pelvis radiation. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects
             of the treatment prior to study enrollment (except for alopecia). Prior radiotherapy
             must be completed 30 days before study entry. Lesions that have been irradiated cannot
             be included as sites of measurable disease unless clear tumor progression has been
             documented in these lesions since the end of radiation therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Are unable to swallow tablets.

          2. Are unable to discontinue use of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.

          3. Are receiving concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy.

          4. Are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          5. Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder (including active bacterial, fungal, or
             viral infection) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
             patient's ability to adhere to the protocol.
