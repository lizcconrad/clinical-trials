  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin
      together with pegfilgrastim works in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable
      bladder cancer or urinary tract cancer and kidney dysfunction. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Colony
      stimulating factors, such as pegfilgrastim, may increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects
      of chemotherapy. Giving combination chemotherapy together with pegfilgrastim may kill more
      tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs may have different effects in patients who have changes in
      their kidney function.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
      and pegfilgrastim, in terms of response rate, in patients with metastatic or unresectable
      transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder or urinary tract and renal insufficiency.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the
      median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the median survival duration in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Assess the safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenous (IV) over 20 minutes, paclitaxel IV
      over 60 minutes, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and pegfilgrastim
      subcutaneously on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 9 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

Partial Response: At least 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, reference baseline sum longest diameter. Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, reference smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1 or &gt; new lesions. Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, reference smallest sum longest diameter since treatment started.</description>
