      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CRA-024781 IV given by 2-hour intravenous
      infusions in patients with refractory solid or hematologic malignancies. To evaluate safety
      and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and to evaluate bioavailability of
      CRA-024781 IV when administered in a single oral dose.

    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a single oral dose of CRA-024781 one week before beginning intravenous
      dosing. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis will be collected on
      several occasions prior to the start of the intravenous treatment.

      The intravenous treatment will consist of 3 consecutive days of CRA-024781 IV administered as
      a 2-hour IV infusion every 3 weeks in a 4 weeks cycle.

      Assessment of the extent of disease will be performed every 8 weeks.

             standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists

          -  estimated life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

          -  ECOG performance grade ≤ 2

             mL/min

          -  total bilirubin within institutional limits (unless elevated from documented Gilbert's
             syndrome)

          -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (≤ 5 x institutional upper
             limit of normal in the presence of liver metastases)

          -  platelet count ≥ 100,000/µL

          -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/µL

          -  Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dL

          -  patients with previously treated brain metastases who are not on corticosteroids are
             eligible

          -  effective contraceptive method (e.g., intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, or
             barrier device) must be used during the study by male and female patients of
             childbearing potential

          -  ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who have had immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
             (within 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to study entry; study entry
             defined as first day of drug dosing

          -  patients who have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study entry

          -  patients who are receiving another investigational drug

          -  patients with active CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease not controlled by prior
             surgery or radiotherapy

          -  uncontrolled illness including but not limited to: ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart
             failure), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, and psychiatric illness that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  risk factors for QTc prolongation and/or Torsade de Pointes

          -  patients with known HIV infection

          -  concurrent systemic hormonal therapy except: stable LHRH agonist therapy for prostate
             cancer; hormonal therapy (e.g., megestrol) for appetite stimulation; nasal,
             ophthalmic, and topical glucocorticoid preparations when appropriate; stable oral
             glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement for adrenal insufficiency; or oral
             contraceptives

          -  patients who have other medical or psychiatric illness or organ dysfunction which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would either compromise the patient's safety or
             interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the study agent

          -  pregnant or lactating women (female patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days of study entry)
