      Hypotheses:

        1. Primary null hypothesis: The rate of clinical response, assessed as patient-reported
           global symptom rating and &quot;adequate relief of IBS symptoms,&quot; does not differ between
           non-depressed IBS patients treated with the SSRI citalopram and patients treated with
           placebo.

        2. Secondary null hypotheses:

             1. Changes in disease-related quality of life, assessed with the IBS-QOL instrument,
                do not differ between patients treated with the SSRI citalopram and patients
                treated with placebo.

             2. Changes in rectosigmoid visceral sensitivity, assessed by barostat balloon
                distention, do not differ between patients treated with the SSRI citalopram and
                patients treated with placebo.

    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects an estimated 15 million Americans at a cost of $1.7
      billion per year. Visceral hypersensitivity is present in many patients with IBS, but its
      contribution to clinical symptoms is unclear. Tricyclic antidepressants may be beneficial in
      IBS, but their side effects can be unacceptable. Because they are better tolerated, selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used to treat IBS, but their efficacy in IBS
      has not been examined in controlled studies. We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial of SSRI treatment in IBS. Non-depressed patients will be studied in order to assess
      SSRI effects on IBS independent of depression. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine whether
      the SSRI citalopram is superior to placebo in improving clinical symptoms, disease-related
      quality of life, and tolerance to rectal balloon distension; 2) To assess whether symptomatic
      improvement is correlated with improvement in quality of life and/or visceral sensitivity.
      Subjects will fulfill Rome II IBS criteria, will have normal screening studies, and will not
      be depressed or on antidepressants. Global and specific symptoms, and satisfaction will be
      rated daily during a 1-week baseline. Subjects will then be randomized in concealed,
      double-blind fashion to citalopram or placebo, will complete the validated IBS-QOL
      instrument, and will undergo rectal compliance and sensory testing with a barostat. Subjects
      will be treated and will rate symptoms and satisfaction weekly for a total of 8 weeks, and
      also daily during the final week for comparison with the baseline. At study end, subjects
      will again complete the IBS-QOL and undergo a barostat study. For the primary outcome, we
      estimate that to detect a standardized effect size of 0.9 in global symptom rating with
      2-sided α=0.05 and β=0.1, 54 subjects are needed. We plan to enroll 60 subjects, which will
      allow detection of an odds ratio for response (adequate relief) of 4.5 with 2-sided α=0.05
      and β=0.2. If the odds ratio for this dichotomous outcome is smaller, this study will provide
      pilot data for a larger trial. Clinical symptoms are expected to fluctuate. Even if
      citalopram is not superior to placebo, prospectively collected data will illuminate the
      relationship between symptoms and visceral sensitivity, and the placebo effect.

    <description>The IBS-QOL is a self-report quality-of-life measure specific to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) that can be used to assess the impact of IBS and its treatment. The IBS-QOL consists of 34 statements about bowel problems, each with a five-point response scale ranging from 1 (no problems) to 5 (most problems). The individual scores are summed and averaged for a total score, then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS-specific quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Mean Sensation Score as a Function of Distending Pressure at the End of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A 500mL polyethylene bag was passed into the rectum, with tubing connected to a barostat, which was controlled by a computer that recorded bag pressure, volume, and corrected volume every second. After 5 minutes, the bag was unfurled with 100mL of air and deflated; with inflations lasting 45 seconds from 0 up to 60 mmHg, increasing by 3 mmHg, and separated by 45-second deflations, subjects rated sensation 30 seconds into each inflation. Sensation score scale: 0=no inflation sensation, 1-5=increasing painless sensation, 6=threshold pain, 10=worst imaginable pain.</description>

        <description>The IBS-QOL is a self-report quality-of-life measure specific to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) that can be used to assess the impact of IBS and its treatment. The IBS-QOL consists of 34 statements about bowel problems, each with a five-point response scale ranging from 1 (no problems) to 5 (most problems). The individual scores are summed and averaged for a total score, then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS-specific quality of life.</description>

        <description>A 500mL polyethylene bag was passed into the rectum, with tubing connected to a barostat, which was controlled by a computer that recorded bag pressure, volume, and corrected volume every second. After 5 minutes, the bag was unfurled with 100mL of air and deflated; with inflations lasting 45 seconds from 0 up to 60 mmHg, increasing by 3 mmHg, and separated by 45-second deflations, subjects rated sensation 30 seconds into each inflation. Sensation score scale: 0=no inflation sensation, 1-5=increasing painless sensation, 6=threshold pain, 10=worst imaginable pain.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Results have been entered as available in the published manuscript; the PI is no longer at UCSF. This trial has the limitation of relatively small sample size. A potential limitation is that patients could have been unblinded based on side effects.</limitations_and_caveats>
