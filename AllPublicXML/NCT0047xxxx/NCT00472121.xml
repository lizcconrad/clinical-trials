  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is the examine the precision of acceleromyography and
      mechanomyography during recovery from a neuromuscular blocking agent and to examine whether
      there is any difference in monitoring block at the dominant or non-dominant arm. Our
      hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in neither the precision nor the level
      of block in the contralateral arms.
