    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as flavopiridol, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving a new schedule of more than one drug (combination chemotherapy)
      may kill more cancer cells. This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best dose, and
      best schedule for flavopiridol when given together with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicities of escalating doses of flavopiridol administered by &quot;hybrid&quot;
      bolus-infusion schedule and given in timed sequence with cytarabine and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia.

      II. Determine the incidence of clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of flavopiridol. Patients receive flavopiridol IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, and 3.

      Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously over 72 hours beginning on day 6 and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride IV over 60-120 minutes on day 9. Treatment repeats every 35-63 days for up to 2
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Serum and bone marrow samples are collected at baseline, during, and after completion of
      treatment for future studies. Flavopiridol levels are measured at baseline and on days 1-3
      for pharmacokinetics.
