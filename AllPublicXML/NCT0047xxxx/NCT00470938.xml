  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a major concern for the geriatric population and represent a significant public
      health problem. Various interventions are being explored to improve balance and decrease
      falls in the elderly. Success has been shown in some programs; various exercise interventions
      place emphasis on strength, balance, or endurance exercises. Results reported in the
      literature are still equivocal. Controversy exists as to optimal types of exercise, and the
      optimum frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise. It is believed that the SpineForce
      device, which places a unique combination of strength and balance demands upon the user, can
      result in rapid increases in balance as compared to other rehabilitation programs. Gains in
      balance have implications for geriatric populations as well as those seeking enhanced sports
      performance and injury prevention. The Purpose of this study is to assess the SpineForce
      device as a novel intervention in the treatment of balance disorders.
