  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if giving oxytocin immediately after delivery
      causes less bleeding, transfusion needs and hastens delivery of placenta.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. During the third
      stage of labor, the period following the delivery of the baby until the delivery of the
      placenta, the patient is at increased risk for blood loss. Controversy remains as to the
      optimal method of delivering the placenta. Two predominant, yet very different, strategies
      have emerged. Expectant management is most commonly used in the United States. This includes
      waiting for signs of placental separation, followed by maternal pushing to expel the
      placenta. Then uterotonic agents are administered,usually oxytocin. This is in contrast to
      active management, which consists of uterotonic administration immediately following delivery
      of the fetus, in association with gentle umbilical cord traction and fundal massage. This is
      the predominant practice in the United Kingdom, where the uterotonic agents of choice are
      either oxytocin alone, or a combination of oxytocin and ergometrine.

      Comparison: Active management with oxytocin to expectant management of the third stage of
      labor on the effect of postpartum hemorrhage.
