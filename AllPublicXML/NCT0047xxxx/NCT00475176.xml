  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) in combination with
      peginterferon and ribavirin for treating hepatitis C virus. One out of three patients with
      hepatitis C develops cirrhosis of the liver, which can lead to liver failure or liver cancer.
      SAMe is a nutritional supplement that is made naturally in all cells of the body and acts to
      improve how the body handles stress. In laboratory experiments with liver cells, SAMe
      decreases the injury caused by liver toxins and improves the ability of interferon to block
      hepatitis C virus.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with hepatitis C infection who did not respond
      successfully to prior treatment with interferon and ribavirin or peginterferon and ribavirin
      may be eligible for this study.

      Participants receive the following treatment:

        -  Peginterferon (given by injection) and ribavirin (taken by mouth) for 2 weeks

        -  Washout period (no medications) for 4 weeks

        -  SAMe (taken by mouth) for 2 weeks

        -  Peginterferon, ribavirin and SAMe for 12-48 weeks, depending on patient response to
           treatment.

      Participants have a thorough physical evaluation before beginning treatment and again at the
      study's end. After starting treatment, patients return for clinic visits and blood tests
      weekly for the first several weeks, then less frequently (at 2-week, then 4-week and 8-week
      intervals until up to 72 weeks) to monitor symptoms, drug side effects, hepatitis C virus
      levels, liver enzyme levels and immune responses to hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is a nutritional supplement which is available as an
      over-the-counter formula. It is a naturally occurring, modified amino acid that is produced
      in virtually all cells and participates in many biochemical pathways as a major methyl donor
      and may play a role in intracellular interferon signaling.

      This study will assess the effects of SAMe on antiviral responses to peginterferon and
      ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1, who have failed to respond to a
      previous course of therapy. After screening evaluation, patients will receive a first course
      of 2 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a (180 micrograms weekly) and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg
      daily) during which symptoms, routine laboratory tests, HCV RNA levels, natural killer (NK)
      cell activity, and lymphocyte interferon-signaling responses will be monitored. After a
      4-week washout period, patients will start SAMe (800 mg twice daily) for 2 weeks and then
      begin a second course of peginterferon and ribavirin in the same doses with similar
      monitoring. Therapy will be continued for at least 12 weeks, and patients with an early viral
      response will continue for a full 48 weeks. The primary criterion for efficacy of SAMe will
      be improved HCV kinetic responses comparing the first and second courses of peginterferon and
      ribavirin. Secondary endpoints will be improvement in NK cell activity and intracellular
      interferon signaling.

      This is a pilot study to determine whether SAMe improves responses to peginterferon therapy
      in terms of intracellular interferon signaling, innate immune responses, and decline in viral
      levels.
