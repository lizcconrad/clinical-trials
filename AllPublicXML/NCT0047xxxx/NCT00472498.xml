  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of patients who
      suffered a cardiac arrest while hospitalized at the VA and were resuscitated after biphasic
      defibrillators were implemented in 2001 to clinical outcomes of patients who suffered cardiac
      arrest before 2001.

      The central purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of patients who
      suffered a cardiac arrest while hospitalized at the VA and were resuscitated after biphasic
      defibrillators were implemented in 2001 to clinical outcomes of patients who suffered cardiac
      arrest before 2001.

      This study will retrospectively collect and analyze clinical data related to the Atlanta VA
      Medical Center, a member of the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, to assess
      clinical parameters in cardiac arrest survivors.

      This study focuses on collecting data retrospectively in regard to cardiac arrest patients to
      discern what factors are playing a role in patient survival after cardiac arrest. Such data
      will help hospitals and physicians to improve quality of care in patients at risk for cardiac
      arrest as well as to implement strategies to reduce such events or improve management of
      these high-risk patients in order to save lives.
