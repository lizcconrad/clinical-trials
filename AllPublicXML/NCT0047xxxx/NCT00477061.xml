      Analgesic administration for pain control in patients with acute abdominal pain, regarding
      acute appendicitis, is controversial. Despite the results previous studies indicating the
      safeness of analgesic use in ED for acute abdominal pain, physicians still prefer to postpone
      their use after performing surgical evaluations. Since many patients admitted to ED are
      unlikely to receive prompt surgical consultation, many of them need pain relief to prevent
      unnecessary suffering. On the other hand such pain relief must not interfere with the
      diagnosis and treatment of patients and do not cause any complications. Morphine is a common
      and effective analgesic which, if shown to have no effect on correct diagnosis of acute
      abdomen, can be used for this purpose.

      Thus we evaluated morphine effect on pain reduction and diagnostic accuracy in patients
      admitted to ED with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
