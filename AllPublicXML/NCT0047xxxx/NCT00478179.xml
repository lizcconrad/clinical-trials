  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is caused by a virus commonly associated with chicken pox. This virus may
      become dormant in the nervous system and later reactivate causing herpes zoster, also known
      as &quot;shingles&quot;. Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a persistent pain in the area of healed skin
      lesions. This study will test the safety and efficacy of treating PHN patients with the
      analgesic patch, Bupivacaine TTS (Eladur™).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or females age 21 years or older.

          -  Pain in thoracic or lumbar regions for a minimum of 90 days after crusting of Herpes
             Zoster (HZ) lesions.

          -  Stable prescribed medications regimen (including opioids, anticonvulsants, and
             tricyclic antidepressants).

          -  Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area to be treated.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) no more than 35 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active HZ lesions, dermatitis, Central Nervous System (CNS) injury.

          -  Any immunosuppressed condition, including but not limited to AIDS/HIV and Hodgkin's
             lymphoma.

          -  Pain control by nerve block or neurosurgical intervention.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic,
             urologic, neurologic, respiratory, endocrine or cardiovascular system abnormalities,
             psychiatric disorders, or acute infection.

          -  Connective tissue disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, mixed
             connective tissue disease).

          -  Recent use (within 30 days preceding the first treatment visit) of any topically
             applied pain medication, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, menthol, methyl
             salicylate, local anesthetics (including Lidoderm®), steroids or capsaicin products on
             the painful areas.

          -  Significant pain of an etiology other than PHN, for example, compression-related
             neuropathies (e.g., spinal stenosis), fibromyalgia or arthritis. Patients must not
             have significant ongoing pain from other cause(s) that may interfere with judging PHN
             related pain.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial of an investigational product or device within 30
             days of the screening visit or concurrently during the conduct of this study.
