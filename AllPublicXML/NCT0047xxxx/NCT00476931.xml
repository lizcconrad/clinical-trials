      The purpose of the study is to study the clinical effects of the investigational drug, SB-509
      versus placebo in patients with diabetic neuropathy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SB-509 contains the gene (DNA—a kind of biological &quot;blueprint&quot;) for a protein. When a
      researcher injects SB-509 into your legs, the drug enters the muscle and nerve cells around
      the injection site and causes these cells to make a protein. This protein causes your cells
      to increase production of another protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      which may improve the structure and function of nerves. In addition, there are changes in the
      levels of 28 additional proteins in your cells. These proteins function to promote the growth
      of cells, are structures in cells, help synthesize products, and affect immune cells, and
      some have unknown functions. This increase in your own VEGF proteins may protect and repair
      the damaged nerves caused by diabetic neuropathy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I or II for at least 12 months
             prior to the study.

          -  Have received a diagnosis of moderate to severe sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy from
             a neurologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system) or
             endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in diabetes). This type of neuropathy is a
             loss of sensation and muscle function that occurs in the legs and hands in a stocking
             and glove distribution. Subjects with diabetic neuropathy that results in loss of
             sensation or muscle function in only one nerve and results in loss of nerve function
             of the blood vessels and causes low blood pressure, will not be eligible.

          -  Unmeasurable nerve conduction velocity in any lower extremity nerve: peroneal, tibial
             or sural due to diabetic polyneuropathy

          -  If female and of childbearing potential, agree to use a medically acceptable physical
             barrier method during the study.

          -  Have blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mm Hg

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 38 kg/m2

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with the following are NOT eligible to participate in this study:

          -  Have moderate to severe ischemic heart disease, any history of congestive heart
             failure, or have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) within the previous 6
             months.

          -  Have chronic foot or leg ulcers for &gt;1 month, gangrene in the legs, or any previous
             amputation of the lower extremity.

          -  Have a history of cancer within the past 5 years (except for curable non-melanoma
             cancer of the skin, superficial bladder cancer in complete remission, or any other
             cancer that has been in complete remission for at least 5 years).

          -  Have colon polyps. If patients have a history of benign colonic polyps that have been
             removed, they must have evidence of a normal colonoscopy within the last 12 months.

          -  Require any drug that depresses patients' immune systems (such as methotrexate,
             cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine) when they receive the study drug and for 30 days
             afterwards.

          -  Have a known disorder that affects patients' immune systems (such as HIV/AIDS,
             hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], sarcoidosis, tuberculosis,
             rheumatoid arthritis, or autoimmune disorders).
