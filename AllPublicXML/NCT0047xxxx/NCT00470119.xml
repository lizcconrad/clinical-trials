      RATIONALE: A low-calorie diet and/or exercise program may help lower an overweight or obese
      postmenopausal woman's risk of developing breast cancer. It is not yet known whether a
      low-calorie diet and/or exercise program are more effective than no diet or exercise program
      in lowering an overweight or obese postmenopausal woman's risk of developing breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the effect of a low-calorie diet and/or
      exercise program on risk factors for developing breast cancer compared with no diet or
      exercise program in overweight or obese postmenopausal women.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the effects of a 1-year exercise intervention, reduced-calorie diet
           intervention, or a combined exercise and reduced-calorie diet intervention vs no

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are stratified according to body mass index
      (&lt; 30 vs â‰¥ 30). Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (exercise program): Participants exercise 3 days per week under the supervision of
           a physiologist and 2 days per week independently at home, for a total of 5 exercise
           sessions (at least 45 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per session) weekly over 12
           months.

        -  Arm II (reduced-calorie diet): Participants meet with a nutritionist individually and in
           small groups. Participants receive general information about diet and behavior
           strategies such as self-monitoring, goal-setting, stimulus-control, problem-solving, and
           relapse-prevention training. Participants learn to set a calorie goal and a fat gram
           goal and how to achieve the goal calorie reduction. Meetings are held weekly during the
           first 6 months of the diet program but taper off over the course of the study.

        -  Arm III (exercise program and reduced-calorie diet): Participants meet with a
           physiologist and a nutritionist, as in arms I and II, and exercise and diet accordingly.

        -  Arm IV (control: delayed diet and exercise): Participants receive study materials on
           healthy diet and exercise at the end of the 12-month study period. In addition,
           participants are offered 2 months of group exercise training with a study physiologist
           and 4 group meetings with a nutritionist to learn about weight loss techniques and
           behavioral principles for achieving weight loss.

      All participants undergo testing at baseline and periodically during study. Participants
      undergo blood collection for evaluation of serum levels of sex and metabolic hormones (e.g.,
      estrone, estradiol, testosterone, free testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin,
      radioimmunoassay and other immunoassays. Participants also undergo anthropometrics and body
      composition measurements and mammographic density assessment.

      Participants complete questionnaires at baseline and at 6 and 12 months for assessment of
      diet and exercise. Quality of life (QOL) is measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months using
      the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form and the Impact of Weight on QOL questionnaire.
      Information on health habits, medical history, family history of breast cancer, and
      reproductive and menstrual history is also collected.

      FINAL ACCRUAL: A total of 439 participants (118 in the caloric restriction arm, and 117 in
      both the CR+Exercise, and exercise only arm; and 87 in control arm) were accrued for this
      study.
