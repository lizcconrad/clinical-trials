  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to determine whether GW856553 (7.5mg BD for 28 days) has an
      effect on endothelial function in dyslipidaemic subjects as assessed by venous occlusion
      plethysmography using brachial artery acetylcholine infusion. This will establish consistency
      with preclinical findings, as well as confirm a physiologic human response at the current
      safe maximal dose. Safety (specifically serum liver function testing) and tolerability will
      also be evaluated in this trial.
