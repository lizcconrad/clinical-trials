      This phase II trial studies how well sunitinib malate works in treating patients with
      endometrial cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or has spread
      to other places in the body (metastatic). Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the objective response rate of recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer to
      sunitinib (sunitinib malate).

      II. To assess the frequency of prolonged stable disease (as defined by percentage [%] of
      patients alive and free from progressive disease at 6 months) in patients with recurrent or
      metastatic endometrial cancer treated with sunitinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time-to- progression, median overall survival, and rate of one-year survival in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer treated with sunitinib.

      II. To assess the toxicity associated with sunitinib in patients with recurrent or metastatic
      endometrial cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months until relapse.
