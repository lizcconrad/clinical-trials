  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue fever, caused by dengue viruses, is a major health problem in tropical and subtropical
      regions of the world. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of and immune
      response to a 2-dose regimen of a new monovalent dengue virus vaccine. This study will test
      the dengue virus vaccine DEN1delta30 in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses account for more than 50 million cases of dengue fever and one half million
      cases annually of dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome. Dengue virus infections can cause
      illness ranging from mild, self-limited febrile illness to life threatening diseases. The
      goal of dengue vaccine development is to induce a long-lived antibody response against all
      four dengue serotypes. The rDEN1delta30 vaccine is a live attenuated dengue virus vaccine
      that may be protective against dengue serotype 1 (DEN1). The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a 2-dose regimen of rDEN1delta30
      dengue virus vaccine. The regimen will differ in when the second booster shot of the vaccine
      is given.

      This study will last 162 days (about 23 weeks) for those participants in Cohort 1, and 222
      days (about 32 weeks) for those in Cohort 2. Participants in Cohort 1 will be randomly
      assigned to receive rDEN1delta30 vaccine or placebo on Study Day 0 and Study Day 120.
      Participants in Cohort 2 will be randomly assigned to receive rDEN1delta30 vaccine or placebo
      on Study Day 0 and Study Day 180.

      There will be a total of 25 visits for each cohort. For both cohorts, the first and second
      vaccination days will include a physical exam and blood and urine collection, vital signs
      measurements, and receipt of the vaccine. A 30 minute observation period will follow
      vaccination. Participants will take their temperature at home three times a day for the first
      16 days and report it in a diary. At all other study visits, vital signs measurements, a
      physical exam, and blood and/or urine collection will occur. At selected study visits,
      participants will turn in their diary cards.

      Some participants may be asked to join an optional skin biopsy substudy.
