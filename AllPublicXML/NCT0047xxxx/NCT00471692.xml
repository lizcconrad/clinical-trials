      Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure. The major current debates revolve
      around laparoscopic hernia repair. The most recent Cochrane review concluded that
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair was associated with less post operative and chronic pain,
      shorter convalescence and earlier return to work when compared to open repair (McCormack K,
      Scott NW, Go PM, Ross S, Grant AM. EU hernia trialist collaboration. Laparoscopic techniques
      versus open techniques for inguinal hernia repair. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2003;
      1(CD001785.). However, laparoscopic repair has not gained wide acceptance. It is more
      expensive, technically difficult for the inexperienced surgeon, is associated with rare but
      potentially more hazardous procedure related complications (Lo CH, Trotter D, Grossberg P.
      Unusual complications of laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair. ANZ
      journal of Surgery 2005 Oct, 75(10): 917 - 919.) and unlike open repair, requires a general
      anaesthetic. Critics state that laparoscopic repair is not suitable for all general surgeons
      and should be restricted to experts. Two prospective studies have shown that a longer
      laparoscopic learning curve exists when compared to open surgery. Up to 200 laparoscopic
      procedures are required to achieve a recurrence rate comparable to open mesh repair. (Bittner
      R, Schmedt CG, Schwarz J, Kraft K, Leigl BJ. Laparoscopic transperitoneal procedure for
      routine repair of groin hernia British journal of Surgery 2002 89; 1062 - 1066.) A
      meta-analysis and large multicentre randomised study have added to these concerns by
      demonstrating a higher recurrence rate with laparoscopic repair. (Memon MA, Cooper NJ, Memon
      B, Memon MI, Abrams KR. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing open and
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. British journal of Surgery 2003; 90: 1479 - 1492.
      Neumayer L, Giobbie-Hurder, Jonasson O, Fitzgibbons R, Dunlop D, Gibbs J et al. Open mesh
      versus laparoscopic mesh repair of inguinal hernias. New England Journal of Medicine 2004;
      350: 1819 - 1827.). Over the period 1998 to 2003, in Denmark, the frequency of laparoscopic
      repair remained constant at 4.5 - 8.0%, the laparoscopic approach being used more frequently
      for bilateral hernia repairs and recurrent hernia repairs. There was a higher re-operation
      rate following laparoscopic repair of bilateral inguinal hernias compared to bilateral open
      hernia repair. (Wara P, Bay-Nielsen M, Juul P, bendix J, Kehlet H. Prospective nationwide
      analysis of laparoscopic versus Lichenstein repair of inguinal hernia. British Journal of
      Surgery 2005 92(10); 1277 - 1281.)

      Given these issues, a considerable number of adult inguinal hernia repairs will continue to
      be performed using the open technique. There is the opportunity to improve the results of
      open repair by potentially improving post operative pain and chronic pain. One method may be
      to perform an ilio inguinal nerve block. However, this procedure can be complicated by
      femoral nerve palsy, colonic or small bowel puncture and pelvic haematomas (Johr M, Sossai R.
      Colonic puncture during ilioinguinal nerve block in a child. Anesth Analg 1999 88 1051 -
      1052, Amory C, mariscal A, Guyot E et al. Is ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block always
      totally safe in children? Paediatr Anaesth 2003; 13: 164 - 166. Vaisman J. Pelvic hematoma
      after an ilioinguinal nerve block for orchialgia Anesth Analg 2001 92 1048 - 1049. Notaras
      MJ. Transient femoral nerve palsy complicating preoperative ilioinguinal nerve blockade for
      inguinal herniorrhaphy. British Journal of Surgery 1995 82: 854. Rosario DJ, Skinner PP,
      Raftery AT. Transient femoral nerve palsy complicating preoperative ilioinguinal nerve
      blockade for inguinal herniorrhaphy. British journal of Surgery 1994 81: 897. Ghani KR,
      McMillan R, Paterson-Brown S. Transient femoral nerve palsy following ilio-inguinal nerve
      blockade for day case inguinal hernia repair. J R Coll Surg Edinb 2002; 47: 626 - 629. Erez
      I, Buchumensky V, Shenhman Z, et al. Quadriceps paresis in pediatric groin surgery. Pediatr
      Surg Int 2002; 18: 157 - 158, Vironen J, Neiminen J, Eklund A, Paavolainen P. Randomised
      clinical trial of Lichtenstein patch or prolene hernia system for inguinal hernia repair.
      British Journal of Surgery 2006; 93: 33 - 39)), resulting in delayed discharge of patients.
      It also has a failure rate of 20 - 30% (Lim SL, Ng SB, Tan GM. Ilioinguinal and
      iliohypogastric nerve block revisited; single shot versus double shot technique for hernia
      repair in children. Paediatr Anaesth 2002; 12; 255 - 260.) The aim of our study is therefore
      to assess the role of ilio inguinal nerve block in adult patients undergoing primary inguinal
      hernia repair.

      Patients presenting to the Royal Hobart Hospital for open surgery to an inguinal hernia were
      approached for inclusion to the study. To patient refused entry. Informed consent was
      obtained and the study was approved by the local ethics and research committees.

      Following induction of general anaesthesia, a sealed envelop was opened. This envelop was
      prepared by the pharmacy department at the Royal Hobart Hospital. This envelope contained two
      syringes presented sterile, each containing a clear liquid. The syringe labelled ilioinguinal
      nerve block was given to the anaesthetist for insertion of an &quot;ilioinguinal nerve block&quot;
      prior to surgical preparation and draping. The second syringe, labelled wound infiltration
      was given to the scrub nurse for wound irrigation by the surgeon prior to closure of the
      external oblique aponeurosis. Patients were divided into the following groups:

      Group 1 - 20mls 0.5% ropivacaine for ilio inguinal nerve block and 20mls saline for wound
      irrigation.

      Group 2 - 20mls saline for ilioinguinal nerve block by anaesthetist and 20ml ropivacaine 0.5%
      for wound irrigation

      Group 3 - 20mls saline for ilioinguinal nerve block and 20mls saline for wound irrigation.

      GA protocol:

        -  0.03mg/kg midazolam IV

        -  2mcg/kg fentanyl

        -  Propofol to induce anaesthesia

        -  Laryngeal mask.

        -  Maintenance with oxygen/air and sevoflurane

        -  Dexamethasone 8mg IV for prophylaxis of post operative nausea and vomiting

        -  100mg PR diclofenac

        -  1g IV paracetamol

      Technique for ilioinguinal nerve block:

      Puncture site 1cm medial to anterior superior iliac spine and a fascial click is detected
      before injection of local anaesthetic. i.e. just below external oblique.

      All patients were prescribed a fentanyl PCA for 2 hours postoperatively (1000mcg in 50ml
      normal saline with a bolus dose of 25mcg set for every 3 minutes. No background rate. If the
      patient was unable to press the button, nursing staff did this until the patient was able to
      do so). Using the PCA machine we were be able to record the number of PCA requests and the
      total PCA fentanyl delivered.

      Post operative outcome measures. On an hourly basis until discharge, patients were asked to
      rate their pain as none, mild, moderate or severe. They were also presented with a visual
      analogue scale for post operative pain.

      On day one, two, fourteen and twenty eight post operatively, the patient was telephoned at
      home and asked to grade their pain on a scale of none, mild, moderate or severe for:

        -  On going to bed at night

        -  The worst pain they had overnight

        -  Getting out of bed in the morning.

      Amount of post operative analgesia required will be asked at the time of the telephone call.

      Patients were also asked for the time for return to:

        -  Walking without discomfort

        -  Exercise without discomfort

        -  Sexual activity

        -  Work

      All operations were performed by the same consultant surgeon or by a surgical registrar under
      direct supervision of the consultant surgeon. All patients had a standard prolene mesh
      repair.

      Primary end point. Post operative analgesia requirements. Visual analogue scores.

      Secondary end points. Return to normal activities.

      Statistics. For an 80% chance of detecting a difference in visual analogue scale with
      standard deviation of 0.5 and p&lt;0.05, 30 patients would be required in each group.
