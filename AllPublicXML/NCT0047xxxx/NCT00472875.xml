      To see if using medication called sulphonylureas can help improve symptoms which patients
      rely on to recognise low blood glucose levels ( hypoglycaemia) and also to see if they can
      reduce the slowing down in brain function which occurs at hypoglycaemia.

      Low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) is the most common and important side effect of insulin
      treatment for diabetes. Most episodes are “mild” and lead to symptoms that alert the
      individual to raise their blood sugar level by consuming sugar or starch (carbohydrate). The
      body also responds to low blood sugars by producing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol,
      which help to restore blood sugar levels to normal. As the brain relies on sugar for fuel, it
      does not function properly if blood sugar levels drop too low, resulting in confusion and in
      extreme cases reduced conscious levels.

      Repeated hypoglycaemia can blunt the protective symptoms and hormonal responses to
      hypoglycaemia limiting patients’ ability to recognise and correct hypoglycaemia, putting them
      at high risk of even more hypoglycaemia (Heller and Cryer, 1991).

      Sulphonylureas are tablets used to treat type 2 diabetes that work by stimulating the
      pancreas to make more insulin. They do this by closing pores called KATP channels which are
      found on the surface of many cells and control the rate of firing of cells. In the pancreas,
      closing them causes cells to fire and release insulin. However, in other tissues such as in
      the brain, these channels have a protective function and they open up during times of lack of
      fuel, such as lack of oxygen or sugar, preventing the cells from firing and putting them into
      a resting mode which reduces their energy requirement(Dunn-Meynell, Rawson and Levin 1998).
      However, if the brain cells responsible for generating symptoms are put into this resting
      mode, they may not produce symptoms, which may contribute to hypoglycaemia unawareness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 1 diabetes (WHO definition) of at least 5 years duration

          -  History of impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (capillary glucose readings &lt; 3.5mmol/l
             without symptoms on &gt; 3 occasions in the past 3 months (those with intact symptoms
             will be unlikely to show an improvement and would not really benefit from taking any
             medication intended just to increase symptoms)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Severe systemic illness

          -  Active malignancy

          -  Severe complications of diabetes such as severe visual impairment, severe renal
             impairment, severe symptomatic autonomic neuropathy

          -  Untreated ischemic heart disease, recent stroke

          -  Lactose intolerance ( the placebo will contain lactose)

          -  Very poor diabetes control (HbA1c &gt; 10%) Liver disease ( increase in ALT / AST &gt; 3x
             ULN)

          -  Chronic Kidney Disease stage 4 or 5 ( eGFR &lt; 30ml/min)

          -  Severe untreated thyroid or adrenal insufficiency ( must be treated and on stable
             doses for at least 6 weeks)
