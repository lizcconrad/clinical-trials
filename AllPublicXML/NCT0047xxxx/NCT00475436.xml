  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK573719 is a high-affinity specific muscarinic receptor (mAChR) antagonist which is being
      developed for once daily treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The long
      duration of action of GSK573719 when administered via inhalation in animal models supports
      the potential for use as a once-daily bronchodilator for COPD
