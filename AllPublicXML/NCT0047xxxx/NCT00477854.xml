    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of chromium picolinate on food intake, food
      cravings, eating attitudes, and appetite. If chromium picolinate is found to have a
      beneficial impact on satiety and food intake, then this supplement may be an alternative or
      adjunctive treatment for overweight people desiring to modify their food intake. The primary
      hypothesis of this study is that among individuals who report being carbohydrate cravers,
      chromium picolinate supplementation will reduce food intake during a test lunch meal and
      produce greater satiety in comparison to a placebo.

    <description>Food intake data and its coefficients, including total food intake, food not eaten, duration of the meal, and bite rate. A mixed model analysis of variance will also be conducted on ratings of food cravings and eating atttudes.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria are:

          1. Healthy female who has not been diagnosed with diabetes, cardiovascular illness, or
             other chronic diseases,

          2. Food craver, determined by self-reported craving for carbohydrates on two out of three
             validated measures of food cravings,

          3. &gt; 18 years of age and &lt; 50 years of age, and

          4. Body mass index between 25 and 39.9 kg/m2. Participants will be scheduled for testing
             during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle to limit the confounding effect of
             the menstrual cycle on energy intake. We will include women who are taking monophasic
             oral contraceptives but will exclude other oral contraceptive regimens. Participants
             with very irregular menstrual cycles will also be excluded because this irregularity
             will make it very difficult to schedule testing during the luteal phase of the
             menstrual cycle.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential participants will be excluded for the following reasons:

          1. Participants who report smoking cigarettes will be excluded because of the effects of
             nicotine upon taste and appetite,

          2. Participants who have a diagnosable eating disorder (i.e., anorexia or bulimia
             nervosa) will also be excluded since intentional restriction of eating and binge
             eating/overeating could increase the variability of the data,

          3. Participants who report using diet pills will be excluded since diet pills may
             potentially influence appetite, hunger, and/or satiety,

          4. Participants will be excluded if they are taking anti-depressant medications,
             anti-psychotic medications, or any medications that may potentially influence
             appetite, hunger, and/or satiety,

          5. Participants who are not determined to be carbohydrate cravers will be excluded,

          6. Participants will also be excluded if they report any allergies to the foods that will
             be used in the study.
