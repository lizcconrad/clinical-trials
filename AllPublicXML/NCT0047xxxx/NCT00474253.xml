  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to demonstrate a faster recovery from neuromuscular block induced
      by 1.2 mg/kg ZemuronÂ® after reversal at 3 minutes by 16.0 mg/kg of Org 25969 compared with
      recovery after a neuromuscular block induced by 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine.
