    <textblock>
      Examine the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in subjects with symptoms of bladder
      overactivity due to pure detrusor instability or sensory urgency. Subjects in study will be
      permitted to escalate or de-escalate between 80 mg/day and 120 mg/day in consultation with
      the investigator and based on their adverse events.

             menopause, or are women of childbearing potential agreeing to use a medically accepted
             means of contraception (for example, intrauterine device [IUD], oral or injectable
             contraceptives, implant, barrier device, sterilization, abstinence, or sex with a
             vasectomized male partner) for the duration of the study. Women using oral
             contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy must have a stable dose and regimen for
             3 months prior to the study.

          -  Have post-void residual (PVR) volume 100 mL within 15 minutes of a spontaneous void.

          -  Patients must have predominant symptoms of bladder overactivity defined as meeting
             both of the following criteria:

               1. bothersome urinary urgency (the sensation of the urgent need to void for fear of
                  leakage) for a minimum of 3 consecutive months prior to study entry, or urge
                  urinary incontinence (UUI; the involuntary loss of urine preceded by urgency) for
                  a minimum of 3 consecutive months prior to study entry

               2. abnormal frequency of micturition (an average voiding interval of 2 hours or less
                  [2] during waking hours) as confirmed by at least two days of recording on the
                  screening dairy collected at Visit 1.

          -  Have UDS established DI or sensory urgency (determined at Visit 2).

          -  Have responded appropriately to all screening questions prior to Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use any medication other than duloxetine for urinary incontinence within 1 day prior
             to starting study medication or at any time during the study.

          -  Use monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or other excluded medications within 14 days
             prior to starting study medication or at any time during the study.

          -  Have any of the following:

               -  A significant arrhythmia despite antiarrhythmic medication, uncontrolled angina,
                  or a significant abnormality on ECG within 6 months prior to study entry that, in
                  the opinion of the investigator, requires investigation or intervention.

               -  Any active cardiac ischemic condition, including myocardial infarction within 6
                  months prior to study entry

               -  Uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension

               -  Active seizure disorder

               -  Unstable diabetes mellitus

               -  Spinal cord lesions, multiple sclerosis, or other neurological abnormalities that
                  affect the lower urinary tract

               -  History of severe allergies requiring emergency medical treatment or multiple
                  adverse drug reactions

               -  History of chronic lung disease associated with four (4) or more acute
                  exacerbations per year resulting in severe coughing

               -  Active or chronic hepatitis A, B, or C.

          -  Are pregnant, have been pregnant in the previous 6 months, or have not resumed normal

          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug other than duloxetine that
             has not received regulatory approval in any country for any indication at the time of
             study entry.

          -  Have any condition, limitation, disease, or abnormal laboratory value that could, in
             the judgment of the investigator, preclude evaluation of response to duloxetine.

          -  Are directly affiliated with the conduct of this study, or are immediate family of
             someone directly affiliated with the conduct of this study (that is, Lilly employees,
