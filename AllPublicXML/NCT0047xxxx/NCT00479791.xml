  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A meal rich in very-long chain omega-3 fatty acids or oleic acid may lower postprandial
      insulin levels in comparison to a meal rich in linoleic acid or palmitic acid. A meal rich in
      very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may lower postprandial triglyceride levels compared to
      other fatty acids.

      Research Design and Methods: Test meals rich in palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and containing 1,000 kcal each
      were administered in a randomized cross-over design every 3 to 4 days to 11 patients with
      T2DM. Serum insulin, glucose, and triglycerides concentrations were measured for 360 minutes.
      All subjects received an isoenergic diet of constant composition throughout the study.
