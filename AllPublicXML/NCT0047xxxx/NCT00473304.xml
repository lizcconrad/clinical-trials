      To evaluate the safety, efficacy and physiological performance of daily disposable spherical
      and toric soft contact lenses in a vision-corrected population of children ages 8-11 years of
      age. To evaluate the ability of the practitioner to fit these lenses and for the children to
      wear and manage these lenses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a bilateral, open-label dispensing evaluation of two daily lens types. Eligible
      subjects will wear the study lenses for 3-months daily wear. 1-Day Acuvue will be worn by
      spherical subjects and 1-Day Acuvue for Astigmatism will be worn by astigmats.

      There is a total of 4 study visits (baseline, contact fitting and dispensing, 1 week, 1 month
      and 3 month follow-up). Tests conducted include manifest refraction and over-refraction,
      keratometry, visual acuity, ACA ratio, lens fit assessment, slit lamp biomicroscopy and
      parent/patient questionaires.

      Each child was provided with a supply of lenses to last until the next scheduled follow-up
      visit, unit-dose rewetting drops for rinsing their lenses if necessary, and a daily log to
      complete each day until the next follow-up visit.

      Informed consent was obtained from all subjects after the nature of the study had been fully
      explained. The study gained approval from the Ethics Committee of the Singapore Eye Research
      Institute.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be between 8-11 years of age.

          -  Signed Written Informed Consent and/or have the consent of a parent or legal guardian
             and Investigator to record this on Case Report Form (CRF) in appropriate space.

          -  Be a neophyte.

          -  Require a visual correction in both eyes.

          -  Require a soft contact lens spherical correction between +5.00 and -9.00 DS.

          -  Have an astigmatic correction between 0.00 amd 2.00 DC.

          -  Be able to wear the lens powers available for this study.

          -  Be correctable to a visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.

          -  Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. For the purposes of this
             study a normal eye is defined as one having:

             (i)No amblyopia. (ii) No evidence of lid abnormality or infection. (eg. entropion,
             ectropion, chalazia, recurrent styes). (iii) No clinically significant slit lamp (eg.
             any infiltrates or other slit lamp findings Grade 3 or above: corneal edema, corneal
             staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection, vascularisation, or abnormal
             opacities).(iv) No other active ocular disease. (eg. glaucoma, history of recurrent
             corneal erosions, cornea infiltrates, conjunctiva, lids, and intraocular infection or
             inflammation of an allergic, bacterial, or viral etiology.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Requires concurrent ocular medication.

          -  Any systemic illness which would contraindicate lens wear or the medical treatment of
             which would affect vision or successful lens wear.

          -  No clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) slit lamp findings including corneal edema,
             corneal vascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, bulbar injection, or
             any other abnormality of the cornea that would contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Diabetic.

          -  Infectious disease (eg.hepatitis, tuberculosis)or an immunosuppressive disease
             (eg.HIV).

          -  PMMA or RGP lens wear in the previous 8 weeks.

          -  Has had refractive surgery. Has had eye injury/surgery within 8 weeks immediately
             prior to enrollment for this study.

          -  Abnormal lacrimal secretions.

          -  Pre-existing ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting.

          -  Keratoconus or other corneal irregularity.

          -  Pregnancy, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrollment only.

          -  Participation in any concurrent clinical trial.
