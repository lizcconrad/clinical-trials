  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous Herceptin with or without
      a taxane for the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women who have relapsed
      at least 12 months after a minimum of 10 months of (neo)adjuvant treatment with Herceptin for
      HER2-positive early breast cancer.Patients will receive either Herceptin monotherapy (loading
      dose of 4mg/kg iv, followed by weekly doses of 2mg/kg iv, or 8mg/kg loading dose followed by
      3-weekly doses of 6mg/kg)or Herceptin + a taxane (docetaxel 100mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks, or
      paclitaxel 175mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks or 75mg/m2 every week). The anticipated time on study
      treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 Guidelines</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL); Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</time_frame>
    <description>CR was defined for target lesions (TLs) as the disappearance of all lesions, and for nontarget lesions (NTLs) as the disappearance of all nontarget nonmeasurable lesions. PR was defined for TLs as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline (BL) in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) of TLs. 95% confidence interval for one-sample binomial using Pearson-Clopper method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response - Percentage of Participants With Progressive Disease or Death</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined as the time from first confirmed CR or PR until death or progressive disease (PD). For TLs, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of the TL, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the beginning of treatment or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For NTLs, PD was defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non target non-measurable lesions. Participants were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</description>

    <description>The time, in months, from when the response (CR or PR) was first noted until the date of documented PD, death, or withdrawal, whichever occurred first. Participants were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</description>

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from day of first study drug infusion until death or PD. Participants were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure was defined as the time from first study drug infusion to failure. Failure was defined as any of the following: PD, death, withdrawal due to adverse event (AE) or lab abnormality, or refusal of treatment. Participants were censored at the last date recorded in the case report form (CRF) or the date of withdrawal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</time_frame>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit According to RECIST Guidelines</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit was defined as stable disease (SD) for 6 months or longer, or a confirmed overall response of CR or PR. For TLs, SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the beginning of treatment. For NTLs, SD was synonymous with incomplete response and defined as the persistence of one or more NTLs and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival - Percentage of Participants Who Died</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 25, 37, and 5 at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression or death, yearly thereafter up to 2 years after cessation of recruitment</time_frame>

        <title>Duration of Response - Percentage of Participants With Progressive Disease or Death</title>
        <description>Duration of response was defined as the time from first confirmed CR or PR until death or progressive disease (PD). For TLs, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of the TL, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the beginning of treatment or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For NTLs, PD was defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non target non-measurable lesions. Participants were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</description>
        <time_frame>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</time_frame>
        <population>FAS. Duration of response was assessed in participants with a best overall response of CR or PR. Cohort A (trastuzumab monotherapy) was closed prematurely due to enrollment difficulties. Therefore, Cohort A included only 3 participants and none of the data from these 3 participants were analyzed for any of the specified endpoints.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit According to RECIST Guidelines</title>
        <description>Clinical benefit was defined as stable disease (SD) for 6 months or longer, or a confirmed overall response of CR or PR. For TLs, SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the beginning of treatment. For NTLs, SD was synonymous with incomplete response and defined as the persistence of one or more NTLs and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>
