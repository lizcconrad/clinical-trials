      Background: Approximately 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have cognitive
      impairments. There is a lack of consensus as to the extent to which psychiatric symptoms,
      depression, age at disease onset, disease duration, and medication is related to the type and
      severity of cognitive impairment. This discrepancy can in part be caused by the lack of
      distinction between patients with different motor symptoms and disease severity.

      Objective: To identify the extent to which psychiatric symptoms, depression, age at disease
      onset, disease duration, and medication is related to the severity and type of cognitive
      dysfunction in patients with idiopathic PD categorized according to motor symptoms and
      disease severity.

      Methods: the population of patients with PD in the old county of Aarhus is described on the
      background of medical records, and stratified in accordance to age, sex and cardinal
      symptoms. Through proportional allocation a sample of a minimum of 50 patients with PD is
      drawn from the population. The patients and 30 healthy matched controls will undergo
      comprehensive neuropsychological assessment including tests of language, memory, executive
      function, and visuospatial function. Furthermore, all participants will be screened for
      depression (Geriatric Depression Scale) and psychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory
      and Symptom Checklist). The patients will be categorized in accordance with their motor
      symptoms via cluster analysis for the purpose of analyzing the effect of psychiatric
      symptoms, depression, and age of disease onset, disease duration, and medication on
      cognition.
