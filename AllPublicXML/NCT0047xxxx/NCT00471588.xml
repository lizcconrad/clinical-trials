    <textblock>
      3 groups of subjects (healthy controls, OCD subjects and stimulant-dependent subjects) will
      receive pramipexole (1.5 mg, single dose), amisulpride (400 mg, single dose) or placebo in a
      cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled design.

      Effects of compulsive behaviour will be assessed using fMRI and cognitive testing.

      Assess biomarkers including cardiovascular responses and plasma levels. All groups studied on
      3 separate occasions following screening, with at least a week intervening between
      consecutive assessments. The procedures to be adopted for study assessment will be identical
      on each occasion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, between 18 - 55 years of age; the groups will be matched for either
             handedness.

          -  Participants must have the ability to comprehend the key components of the consent
             form and provide informed consent.

          -  Participants must lead and write (in English) at a level sufficient to complete study
             related assessments.

          -  Assessment by a psychiatrist or psychologist, which includes a face-to-face evaluation
             of the individual using the DSM-VI diagnosis.

          -  No history of neurological disorder, head/brain injury, hepatitis, or visual
             impairment.

          -  No MRI contra-indications (metal in body, claustrophobia) and able to provide blood
             samples (venous accessibility, especially relevant for drug users).

          -  Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder will have a minimum 2-year history of
             compulsive behaviours satisfying DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD.

          -  Participants with chronic stimulant use will have a minimum 2-year history of
             dependence on class A stimulants, with age of drug abuse onset before 20 years, and
             will satisfy DSM-IV-TR criteria for dependence on stimulant drugs.

          -  Control volunteers have to be in good mental and physical health.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A personal history of psychiatric or neurological disorders, as defined by the DSMIV
             (except OCD in patients with OCD and substance dependence in drug users)

          -  A history or presence of alcohol / substance abuse or dependence (other than
             nicotine), as defined by the DSM-IV-TR (except drug dependence group).

          -  A BDI-II total score greater than 14 will lead to exclusion from the study.

          -  Treatment with methadone or buprenorphine may interfere with the experimental tasks,
             and therefore, will lead to exclusion from the study.

          -  Participants who have any laboratory abnormality that in the investigator's judgement
             is considered to be clinically significant and could potentially affect subject safety
             or study outcome.

               -  History of clinically significant or current renal dysfunction.

               -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology, blood chemistry, MRI,
                  urinalysis or physical examination not resolved by baseline visit.

               -  Impaired liver function at baseline or history of liver dysfunction.

               -  Female participant is pregnant or currently breastfeeding.

          -  Any serious medical disorder or condition that would in the Investigator's opinion,
             preclude the administration of study medication and or a history of clinically
             significant hepatic, cardiac, renal, neurologic, cerebrovascular, metabolic or
             pulmonary disease.
