  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the predictability of an MRM headache attack lends itself to preventative treatment,
      there are currently no drugs specifically indicated for the prevention of MM. Such
      preventative therapies might be administered either short term (during the time around the
      period otherwise known as the peri-menstrual period or PMP) or continuously throughout the
      menstrual cycle.

      Frovatriptan has been developed for the management of migraine and is already licensed for
      use as an acute treatment for this condition. Previous well controlled clinical trials have
      highlighted the potential of frovatriptan as a short-term preventative medication for MM.
      This clinical trial was meant to further explore this indication for frovatriptan in an
      expanded population.
