      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the NeoDisc compared
      to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of single-level cervical
      disc disease, by demonstrating non-inferior comparative results at the 24 month follow-up
      period pertaining to (1) improvement in the Neck Disability Index (NDI) score, (2)
      revision/reoperation/removal rate, (3) complication rate, and (4) maintenance or improvement
      in neurologic status.

      The NeoDisc is an artificial cervical intervertebral disc replacement intended for clinical
      use following a discectomy. Implantation of the device will result in artificial replacement
      of a pathologically damaged or surgically removed cervical disc. Use of the device also
      obviates the need to harvest bone graft from the patient's iliac crest, a common and painful
      part of current surgical techniques.

      The NeoDisc is indicated for cervical spinal arthroplasty in skeletally mature subjects with
      symptomatic cervical disc disease at one level from C3 to C7. Symptomatic cervical disc
      disease is defined as image-confirmed herniated disc, spondylosis, and/or loss of disc
      height, with functional neurological deficit (i.e., exhibits at least one sign associated
      with cervical level to be treated, including abnormal reflex, decreased motor strength,
      abnormal dermatome sensitivity, or pain in a dermatomal distribution).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-60 years of age (inclusive and skeletally mature)

          -  Diagnosis of symptomatic cervical disc disease, defined as image- confirmed pathology:
             herniated disc, spondylosis, and/or loss of disc height. Spondylosis is defined as MRI
             or CT-confirmed disc dessication, loss of disc height, bridging osteophytes, and/or
             uncovertebral arthrosis. Loss of disc height is specified as a measurement of at least
             25% less than an adjacent nonsymptomatic level, but with a minimum of 1mm height
             remaining.

          -  Functional neurological deficit (i.e., exhibits at least one sign associated with
             cervical level to be treated, including abnormal reflex, decreased motor strength,
             abnormal dermatome sensitivity, or pain in a dermatomal distribution)

          -  Symptomatic level is C3-4, C4-5, C5-6 or C6-7 (one level)

          -  Preop NDI ≥30 points
