      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the best way to manage breakthrough
      spotting and bleeding during an extended use regimen of NuvaRing®. Ease of use and
      acceptability of a flexible regimen of NuvaRing® will also be evaluated. A comparison of
      cyclic mood symptoms, pelvic pain, and headaches will be made between a standard 21/7 regimen
      and an extended regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal contraception is undergoing a change away from a 21/7 day regimen where a woman
      utilizes a combination estrogen and progestin therapy for 21 days followed by 7 days of a
      hormone-free interval (HFI). It is well documented that women may experience a higher
      incidence of mood changes, headaches and cramping that begin prior to and during this 7 day
      HFI. By reducing the HFI and extending the active combination contraceptive therapy, it is
      hoped that women will experience greater satisfaction with their contraceptive regimen and
      will experience fewer negative side effects associated with a HFI.

      The most common reason for discontinuation of an extended contraception regimen is irregular
      bleeding. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the best way to manage this
      breakthrough spotting and bleeding. Ease of use and acceptability of a flexible regimen of
      NuvaRing will also be evaluated. A comparison of cyclic mood symptoms, pelvic pain, and
      headaches will be made between a standard 21/7 regimen and an extended regimen.

      The contraceptive ring used in this study contains both an estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and a
      progestin (etonogestrel). These are synthetic (man-made) hormones. The amount of ethinyl
      estrogen released into the bloodstream each day is 120mcg and the amount of etonogestrel is
      150mcg. The NuvaRing®, by Organon, is FDA approved for contraception, but is not approved for
      use in an extended regimen. Therefore its use in this study is considered investigational.

    <description>Subject will use the nuvaring and if they developed breakthrough bleeding or spotting for more than 5 days on the 6th day the ring would be removed and would leave it out for 3 full days and reinsert the same ring the next day. All subjects would be filling out a daily diary or calendar which would rate their blood flow, pelvic pain, headaches, moods, how many pain pills were taken and how many pads, liners or tampons would be used.</description>

    <description>Subject is using the nuvaring continuously and it would be changed out monthly. If she develops breakthrough bleeding or spotting she does not remove the ring until it is her time to change it. All subjects would be filling out a daily diary or calendar which would rate their blood flow, pelvic pain, headaches, moods, how many pain pills were taken and how many pads, liners or tampons would be used.</description>

    <description>Both groups of women will be using the nuvaring continuously, ie if the ring is placed on 3rd of January, on the 3rd of February the ring would be removed and a new one inserted. On the 3rd of March the same thing would happen and so forth. Group 2 if bleeding or spotting occurs for more than 5 days then on the 6th day the ring is removed and will keep it out for three more days and reinsert the same ring on the 4th day.</description>
