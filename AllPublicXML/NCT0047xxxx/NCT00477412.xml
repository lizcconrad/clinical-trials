    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if bortezomib (in combination with
      rituximab plus 2 different intensive chemotherapy regimens) can help to control the disease
      in patients with mantle cell lymphoma. The safety of these drug combinations will also be
      studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      You will receive 2 different drug combinations on this study. The first combination will
      consist of bortezomib and rituximab given together with an intensive chemotherapy regimen
      (cyclophosphamide, mesna, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone). The second
      combination will consist of bortezomib and rituximab given together with another intensive
      chemotherapy regimen (methotrexate and Ara-C [cytarabine]).

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the first combination will be
      given during Cycles 1, 3, 5, and, if needed, Cycle 7. The first combination can be given on
      an outpatient basis (with no overnight hospital stay required), if your doctor allows it. The
      second combination will be given during Cycles 2, 4, 6, and, if needed, Cycle 8. It is
      recommended that the second combination be given on an inpatient basis so that study staff
      can monitor the effect of the study drugs, for your safety.

      You will have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed so that the chemotherapy can be given to
      you more easily. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while
      you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more
      detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.

      First combination:

      For the first combination (during each cycle), you will receive rituximab by vein over 6
      hours on Day 1. Cyclophosphamide will be given by vein (over 3 hours each time) twice a day
      on Days 2-4. Mesna will be given continuously by vein on Days 2-4. Doxorubicin will be given
      over 15-30 minutes on Day 5. Vincristine will be given by vein over 15-30 minutes on Days 5
      and 12. Dexamethasone will be given by mouth or by vein on Days 2-5 and Days 12-15.
      Bortezomib will be given over a few seconds after the first dose of cyclophosphamide and
      immediately after vincristine and doxorubicin have been given on Day 5. Other drugs will be
      given before, during, and after chemotherapy to help prevent or decrease side effects, such
      as nausea and vomiting. These drugs will include Zofran® (ondansetron hydrochloride) given by
      vein over 15-30 minutes. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride given by mouth twice a day for 10 days,
      Valtrex (valacyclovir) given by mouth for 10 days, and fluconazole given by mouth every day
      for 10 days. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, valacyclovir, and fluconazole will be given on the
      same days. This first combination will be alternated every 21 days with a second combination
      of bortezomib and rituximab plus an intensive chemotherapy regimen.

      To help prevent infections, you will receive Filgrastim (G-CSF) injections just under your
      skin, starting at 24-36 hours after the end of the doxorubicin infusion, once a day until
      your white blood cells recover.

      Second combination:

      For the second combination (during each cycle), you will receive rituximab by vein over 6
      hours on Day 1. Methotrexate will be given by vein over 24 hours on Day 2. Cytarabine will be
      given by vein (over 2 hours each time) every 12 hours on Days 3-4. Other drugs will be given
      before, during, and after chemotherapy to help prevent or decrease side effects, such as
      nausea and vomiting. These drugs will include Zofran® (ondansetron hydrochloride) given by
      vein over 15-30 minutes. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride given by mouth twice a day for 10 days,
      Valtrex (valacyclovir) given by mouth for 10 days, and fluconazole given by mouth daily for
      10 days. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, valacyclovir, and fluconazole will be given on the same
      days. When you receive methotrexate, you will also be given leucovorin by mouth to help
      prevent side effects. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn 24 and 48 hours after the end
      of the methotrexate infusion so that the study doctor can learn when it is best to stop
      giving you leucovorin.

      To help prevent infections, you will receive Filgrastim (G-CSF) injections just under your
      skin, starting at 24-36 hours after the end of the doxorubicin infusion, once a day until
      your white blood cells recover.

      During this study, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn 2-3 times a week for routine
      tests. After every 2 cycles, your tumor(s) will be measured using x-rays or CT scans. You
      will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate sample collected. If the study doctor thinks it is
      necessary, you may have a MUGA scan or an ECHO. You will have an exam of your colon (a
      colonoscopy). The colonoscopy will be performed before you receive Cycle 3 of the combination
      bortezomib with intensive chemotherapy, and (if necessary) before Cycle 7 of the combination
      bortezomib with intensive chemotherapy. Biopsy samples of the colon will be taken during this
      exam. To perform a colonoscopy, you will be given laxatives a day before and again right
      before the procedure. You will be given a sedative (to calm you) by vein followed by the
      insertion of a long tube into your rectum to the right side of your colon.

      You will be removed from this study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects
      occur.

      After receiving the study drugs, you will have follow-up visits at different time points.
      These visits will occur every 3 months for 1 year, then every 4 months for 2 years, then
      every 6 months for the next 2 years, and then once a year indefinitely. During these
      follow-up visits, you will have a complete physical exam, and blood (about 1 tablespoon) will
      be drawn for routine tests. You will have a chest x-ray, CT scans, and bone marrow and
      aspirate samples collected.

      This is an investigational study. All of the drugs used in this study are FDA approved and
      commercially available. Up to 110 patients will take part study. Up to 110 will be enrolled
      at MD Anderson.
