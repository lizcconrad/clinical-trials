    <textblock>
      ICU-Protocol.Summary Profuse and tenacious tracheal secretions are a significant factor
      impeding the weaning process in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit
      (ICU). In homeopathy, high dilutions of plant extracts, minerals, and other biological
      substances are used as remedies for the treatment of illness, which is based on the &quot;Law of
      Similars&quot; (the higher the dilution, the stronger the effect). Kali Bichromicum (potassium
      dichromate) is a drug that is commonly used in homeopathy, mostly for conditions involving
      profuse, stringy, tenacious mucous and tracheal secretions. A recent randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study found a statistically significant effect of this
      remedy on improving the amount of tracheal secretion, timing to extubation and discharge from
      the ICU among critically ill patients, with no side effects observed.

      The proposed study will compare the efficacy of Kali bichromicum 10-60 (C30) versus placebo
      in reducing the amount of tracheal secretions in patients intubated with a conventional
      endotracheal tube or tracheostomy and receiving controlled mechanical ventilation in the ICU
      setting. The quantity of the secretions will be studied, as well as sputum neutrophil count
      (using direct microscopy). Time to extubation and the need for re-intubation will also be
      evaluated. 56 patients over the age of 18 years treated with mechanical ventilation for at
      least 3 days will be recruited from the ICU departments of 4 medical centers in Israel. The
      preparations will be administered in the form of small pellet-like globules, which will be
      placed on the mucosa of the mouth, to the side of the endotracheal tube. Patients will be
      randomly allocated to either verum (n=28) or placebo (n=28) treatment, with the remedies
      administered twice daily with an interval of 12 hours, for a period of up to 14 days or until
      the patient is extubated. Any adverse event will be recorded.
