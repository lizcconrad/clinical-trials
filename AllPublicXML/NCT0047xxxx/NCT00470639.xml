  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) as a treatment for depressed adults with bipolar disorder.

      In rTMS high-intensity, fluctuating magnetic fields non-invasively stimulate the cortex of
      the brain depolarising neurons. No anaesthetic is required and the treatment in
      subconvulsive. Recent studies suggest that rTMS can be an effective treatment for depressive
      illness in adults (Loo and Mitchell et al, 2005) and appears to be quite safe.

      Most of the published studies to date have focused on unipolar depression. There is limited
      data of TMS use in bipolar depression. Eg. Pilot study by Nahas Z, Kozel FA, Li X, Anderson
      B, George MS.in 2003, which was negative.

      The investigators wish to assess this in a sham-controlled study of adults. The investigators
      hypothesise that both left and right sided rTMS will have an antidepressant effect superior
      to sham in this population.

      Inpatients and outpatients with major depressive episodes as part of either bipolar I or II
      illness will be eligible. In the event that patients (in any arm) have no significant
      response after a defined period, they will shift to an open phase where they will receive
      left prefrontal 10Hz stimulation. Thus all participants will have the opportunity to receive
      active treatment.
