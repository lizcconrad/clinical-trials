      At a routine visit to the clinic, patients will be asked to answer questions about their
      symptoms, have a routine examination by the doctor, fill out a questionnaire that will ask
      questions about them, about their arthritis, about how it affects their well being and
      quality of life, and about treatment and costs. The questionnaire will take them about 30
      minutes to complete. A blood test may also be required.

      This ends the patient's involvement with the study.
