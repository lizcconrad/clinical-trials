    <textblock>
      For cancer patients with inadequate pain relief, a switch to an alternative opioid is the
      preferred option for symptomatic improvement. However, multiple opioids are often
      simultaneously administered for anecdotal reasons.

      The present study isdesigned to assess the analgesic profiles of two different strategies in
      chronic cancer pain: the opioid rotation from oxycodone to transdermal fentanyl and the
      combination of oral oxycodone and transdermal fentanyl.

      Patients with uncontrolled cancer pain despite treatment of oral morphine equivalent â‰¥100
      mg/d will be randomly assigned to oral opioids to transdermal fentanyl (rotation group) or
      oral oxycodone plus fentanyl (combination group). Patients answer a questionnaire that
      included pain severity (0 to 10) and interference items at baseline and after one week.
      Primary outcomes are change in pain score and treatment success.
