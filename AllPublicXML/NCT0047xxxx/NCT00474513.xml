  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK239512 is being developed for the treatment of symptoms of cognitive impairment in many
      diseases. GSK239512 is a drug that binds to the Histamine 3 receptor (a protein) in the brain
      (receptor occupancy). This study will use the technique of positron emission tomography (PET)
      as an imaging tool to highlight areas of the brain that GSK239512 has penetrated, and
      subsequently bound to receptors, after receiving an oral dose of the drug. It will also look
      at the rate the drug dissociates from the receptors in the brain. Results from the study will
      provide information on doses of the drug to be given in further studies.

          -  Healthy, defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or
             disease as determined by their medical history (including family history), physical
             examination, laboratory studies, and other tests as judged by the investigator.

          -  Body weight â‰¥ 50 kg and BMI within the range of 19-29 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Normal thyroid function tests as judged by the investigator.

          -  Willingness of subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating
             women; or willingness to use adequate contraception the time of the first dose of
             [11C]GSK189254 until completion of the study and for 84 days following the study.

          -  Capable of giving informed consent and can comply with the study requirements and
             timetable.

          -  The subject must be able to read, comprehend and record information.

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject prior to
             taking part in the study.

          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions
             and protocol-stated restrictions.

          -  The subject must have a QTc&lt;450msec (for males) or &lt;480 msec for subjects with bundle
             branch block

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has used or is using regular prescription or non-prescription drugs,
             including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within
             fourteen days or five half lives (whichever was the longer) prior to the first dose of
             study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor the medication
             would not have interfered with the study procedures or compromised subject safety.
             Medications considered to be unlikely to interfere with the study are, thyroid
             replacement therapy, laxatives, occasional use of vitamin supplements, PRN paracetamol
             and NSAIDs, prophylactic aspirin.

          -  The subject had a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or had a positive pre-study urine
             drug / alcohol screen. Abuse of alcohol is defined as an average weekly intake of
             greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater than three units for
             males. One unit is equivalent to a half-pint (220 mL) of beer or one (25 mL) measure
             of spirits or one glass (125 mL) of wine.

          -  History of heavy use (&gt;10 per day) of tobacco or nicotine-containing products within
