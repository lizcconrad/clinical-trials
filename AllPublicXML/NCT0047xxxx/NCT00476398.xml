  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how common diseases of the esophagus can cause chest
      pain. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), commonly known as heartburn, is a common cause
      of chest pain in patients that do not have heart problems. The study test is called PillCam
      Eso, it is a small, pill sized capsule that has a small camera inside it. The camera will
      take pictures of the esophagus and the stomach as it goes down. Findings of the PillCam Eso
      will be compared to findings during conventional upper endoscopy.

      Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is defined by recurrent episodes of retrosternal chest pain in
      the absence of significant cardiovascular disease after a thorough cardiac evaluation. It
      accounts for 2-5% of all emergency department visits. Studies examining the prevalence of
      esophago-gastric lesions in patients with NCCP referred to gastroenterologists have found
      esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, hiatal hernias, gastritis, and gastric ulcers in 62% of
      patients. Advances in endoscopic technologies, particularly, the introduction of the wireless
      video-capsule (PillCam Eso) allows for the possibility of direct visualization of the upper
      gastrointestinal tract in the emergency department. During capsule endoscopy, a patient will
      swallow a pill-sized video-capsule, the wireless images of the gastrointestinal tract are
      transmitted to a computer. Findings of the PillCam Eso will be then compared to findings
      during conventional upper endoscopy.
