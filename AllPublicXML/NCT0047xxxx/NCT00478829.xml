      This study is designed to investigate the status of identifying depression and/or anxiety
      disorder with somatic symptoms in general hospitals in China. The study will generate
      valuable information to the medical community; therefore the early and vigorous treatment is
      possible. It's in line with China government authorities' target to increase the recognition
      rate of depression and/or anxiety in primary care settings to more than 50% by the end of
      2010. The study will also help to identify specific diagnosis and treatment patterns for
      depressive / anxious patients and their comorbid conditions.
