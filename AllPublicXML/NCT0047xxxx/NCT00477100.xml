      The goal of this research study is to collect blood and tissue samples and clinical data from
      patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) or highly suspicious for IBC. The blood and
      tissue samples and clinical data will be stored in a research tissue bank and used to help
      researchers try to better understand IBC.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 1200 patients will take part in this study. Up to
      1000 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      IBC:

      IBC is a rare but rapidly growing form of breast cancer. Currently, there are no known risk
      factors and biological features (such as in the genes) that researchers can use to help
      design better treatments for IBC.

      Study Participation:

      If you are diagnosed with IBC or the doctor believes that you may have IBC, you will be asked
      to participate in this IBC registry study. This registry study is to collect data, blood and
      tissue for future studies.

      All participants will have the following performed:

        -  You will have additional blood (about 3-4 tablespoons each time) drawn for this study
           during a routine blood draw before chemotherapy or the beginning of this study, at the
           end of your first round of chemotherapy, before and after surgery and/or radiation
           therapy, and then about every 6 months for 2 years.

        -  You will have an interview. During this interview, you will be asked questions about
           your medical history as well as general background information. The interview will be
           conducted by the study chair or their designee in the examination room and after the
           meeting with the physician in a private setting. The interview will take about 30
           minutes to complete. Language Assistance will be called if a participant is non-English
           speaking. You do not have to be interviewed if you don't have IBC.

        -  Your clinical data will be collected from your medical record, including information
           about your blood and tumor tissue samples and information from the magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans you
           may have had.

        -  Photos of both breasts will be taken if needed.

        -  If you have standard of care surgery, part of the tissue that is removed during surgery
           will be collected, unless it is already known that you do not have IBC.

      Participants who have been treated for IBC will have the following performed:

      Â°Your original biopsy sample and/or breast surgery tissue sample will be collected for
      diagnosis (if needed by your doctor) and for the study.

      Participants who have never been treated for IBC will also have the following performed:

        -  If you have never received treatment for IBC or you have a breast condition which the
           doctor believes may be IBC, you will have a tumor core, breast tissue, and skin biopsy.
           If lymph nodes are noticed during the core biopsy, lymph nodes core biopsy or final
           needle aspiration will be done as well. To perform a core, breast tissue, and skin
           biopsy, an affected area of skin is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of skin
           tissue is removed with a small knife. This is a fresh sample collected for diagnosis and
           for the study.

        -  When you join the study, and then before radiation therapy begins, you will have a cheek
           (buccal cell) swab, a skin swab, and a stool swab sample collected either in the clinic
           or at home. For the cheek swab, a small sample of cells from the inside of your mouth
           will be collected by scraping a special brush against the inside of your cheek a few
           times, until enough cells are collected. For the skin swab, the same procedure will be
           done on the skin on your chest. For the stool swab sample, you will collect a swab of
           your stool when you go to the bathroom. If you need to collect the samples at home, you
           will be given supplies and instructions on how to do this. You will then mail the
           samples back to the clinic.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be complete after your samples and data are collected
      (about 2 years after your active participation on this study).

      Research Tissue Bank:

      Before your blood and tissue samples and information can be used for research, the people
      doing the research must get specific approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD
      Anderson. The IRB is a committee made up of doctors, researchers, and members of the
      community. The IRB is responsible for protecting the participants involved in research
      studies and making sure all research is done in a safe and ethical manner. All research done
      at MD Anderson, including research involving your samples and information from the IBC tissue
      bank, must first be approved by the IRB.

      If the doctor believes your breast condition may be IBC, but tests showed that this tissue
      was not for breast cancer or IBC, the tissue samples collected will be stored in the IBC
      tissue bank and used as a non-cancer or non-IBC control sample (healthy tissue used for
      comparison) in future studies related to IBC.
