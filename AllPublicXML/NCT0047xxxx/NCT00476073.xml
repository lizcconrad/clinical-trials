      This is a study involving a 12 week treatment phase. During the treatment phase subjects
      receive FLUTIFORM速 or Sertetide速. Efficacy will be assessed by lung function tests and asthma
      symptoms, sleep disturbance. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, vital signs, lab
      tests and ECGs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients at least 18 years or older (females less than one year
             post-menopausal must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test recorded within 72
             hours prior to the first dose of study medication, be non-lactating, and willing to
             use adequate and highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study. A
             highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as
             sterilization, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs
             (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner).

          -  Known history of mild to moderate-severe reversible asthma for &gt; 6 months prior to the
             screening visit.

          -  Demonstrate a FEV1 of &gt;40% to &lt;80% for predicted normal values (EGKS normal values,
             1983) during the screening phase following appropriate withholding of asthma
             medications (if applicable).

               -  No beta agonist use on day of screening.

               -  No use of combination asthma therapy on day of screening.

               -  Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed on day of screening.

          -  Documented reversibility of &gt; 15% in FEV1 in the screening phase.

          -  Demonstrate satisfactory technique in the use of the pressurized MDI.

          -  Willing and able to enter information in the electronic diary and attend all study
             visits.

          -  Willing and able to substitute study medication for their pre study prescribed asthma
             medication for the duration of the study.

          -  Written informed consent obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life-threatening asthma within the past year. This category includes those patients
             with a history of near-fatal asthma, a hospitalization or an emergency visit for
             asthma or prior intubation for asthma.

          -  History of systemic (injectable) corticosteroid medication within 1 month before the
             Screening Visit.

          -  History of omalizumab use within the past 6 months.

          -  History of leukotriene receptor antagonist use, e.g. montelukast, within the past
             week.

          -  Current evidence or history of any clinically significant disease or abnormality
             including uncontrolled coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. 'Clinically significant' is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the patient at risk through study
             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study.

          -  An upper or lower respiratory infection within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Significant, non-reversible, active pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis).

          -  Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive status.

          -  A smoking history equivalent to &quot;10 pack years&quot; (i.e., at least 1 pack of 20
             cigarettes /day for 10 years or 10 packs/day for 1 year, etc)

          -  Current smoking history within 12 months prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Current evidence or history of alcohol and/or substance abuse within 12 months prior
             to the Screening Visit.

          -  Patients who have taken beta-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrhythmics, or potent
             CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole within the past week.

          -  Current use of medications that will have an effect on bronchospasm and/or pulmonary
             function.

          -  Current evidence or history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to test
             medications or components.

          -  Receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the Screening Visit (12 weeks if
             an oral or injectable steroid).

          -  Current participation in a clinical study.
