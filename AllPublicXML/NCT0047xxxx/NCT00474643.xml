    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by childhood-onset obesity
      and endocrine dysfunction that leads to cardiovascular disability and early death within the
      first 3 decades of life.To assess the significance of risk factors for future disabilities,
      carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured and correlated with known
      atherosclerotic risk factors in 27 children with PWS and 24 age-, sex-, and body mass index
      (BMI)-adjusted controls.

      Main outcome measures: Correlation of IMT with age, standard deviation score of BMI
      (BMI-SDS), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL), C-reactive protein, HOMA-IR and ghrelin.
