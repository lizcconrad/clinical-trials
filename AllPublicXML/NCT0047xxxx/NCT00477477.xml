  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of two diets, a low glycemic load diet and a
      low saturated fat diet, in the treatment of adolescents with some heart disease risk factors
      associated with being overweight, such as high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and cholesterol
      problems. The objective of the study is to determine which diet improves these risk factors
      more. The design of the study is a modified feeding study, which requests that the
      participants eat all and only the food provided by the study for 8 weeks, most days per week.
      Dietary counseling by phone will continue between 2 and 6 months of the study and the effects
      of this maintenance period will be assessed at 6 months time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity and overweight among children is high, and increasing. Metabolic
      syndrome, a recently recognized consequence of obesity, is known to confer an elevated risk
      for cardiovascular (CV) disease and diabetes type 2 in adults. The primary treatment for
      metabolic syndrome is lifestyle modification, including dietary changes. However, little is
      known about how dietary composition, as distinct from decreased caloric intake and weight
      loss, alters metabolic syndrome abnormalities in children. Moreover, the optimal pediatric
      nutritional strategy for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome is unknown. The
      overall goal of this research protocol is to evaluate two nutritional approaches to pediatric
      metabolic syndrome in post-pubertal overweight adolescents, a low saturated fat diet and a
      low glycemic load (GL) diet. The design of the protocol is a short-term, modified feeding
      study that evaluates the efficacy of these two nutritional approaches with equal weight loss
      goals. Outcome measures will include the percent changes from baseline to the end of the
      intervention period (8 weeks) in metabolic abnormalities, inflammatory cytokines and
      adipokines, and non-invasive tests of vascular function. Metabolomic profiles are measured at
      baseline and 8 weeks in a subset of the participants.

      To facilitate compliance and adherence, participants chose from a menu of food choices and
      food will be delivered to participants homes to supply most of the meals and snacks
      participants consume. Participants will receive weekly personal nutritional counseling to
      enhance compliance with frequent phone follow-up. Subsequent to the feeding portion of the
      intervention, participants are counselled by phone at least on a monthly basis and the
      effects of this maintenance phase is measured at 6 months.
