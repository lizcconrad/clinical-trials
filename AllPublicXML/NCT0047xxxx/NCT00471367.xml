  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts (A and B). The primary purpose of Part A is to find the maximum
      tolerated dose is for an experimental drug called AZD4877 based on the side effects
      experienced by patients that receive AZD4877 on a twice a week basis. For Part B, an
      additional 20 patients will be treated at the maximum dose identified in Part A. AZD4877 is
      an Eg5 or Kinesin Spindle Protein inhibitor that interferes with tumor cell division leading
      to tumor growth
