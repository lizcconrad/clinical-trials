    <textblock>
      When people eat a meal, some, but not all of the calcium in that meal is absorbed, that is,
      moved into the bloodstream. When the skin is exposed to sunlight during summer months,
      Vitamin D is made there and then modified into more active forms by the liver and kidneys.
      These more active forms of Vitamin D improve calcium absorption. Many adults living in the
      U.S. have little or no sun exposure and are low in Vitamin D. A single dose of 100,000 IU of
      Vitamin D3 has been used both as empiric treatment for Vitamin D deficiency as well as in
      controlled trials without risk of raising blood calcium to dangerous levels.This study is to
      determine the serum levels of Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D after it has been
      modified by the liver) that can be expected when Vitamin D3 is given as a single oral dose of
      100,000 IU.

      The group receiving the supplement will be scheduled for short visits to our research center
      at baseline and days 1,3,5,7 and then weekly for 3 weeks and then every other week for 6
      visits (total 14 visits in 4 months). The group not receiving supplement will be scheduled
      for short visits at baseline and in 4 months. At the beginning of the study we will measure
      your height, weight, skin color, and draw blood to measure your blood levels of Vitamin D,
      25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone. At each visit we will draw blood to
      measure your blood levels of Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There will be fourteen blood
      draws for a total of 280 cc of blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons drawn each time) in the
      supplemented group. There will be 2 blood draws in the group not receiving supplements for a
      total of 60 cc of blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons drawn each time).
