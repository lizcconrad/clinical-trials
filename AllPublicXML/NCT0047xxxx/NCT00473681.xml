    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed clinical trials is to compare the differential
      reduction in blood pressure in underserved hypertensive adult Korean American. The study is
      designed to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive self-help intervention program.

    <textblock>
      CVD is the leading cause of mortality among KA. Recent statistics underscoring the high
      prevalence and impact of uncontrolled HBP upon this population warrant the development and
      implementation of effective intervention. KA experiences a great deal of social isolation,
      which makes it more difficult for them to make behavioral changes for health improvement.
      individual, family, and community behaviors are part of the HBP problem and also constitute
      major part of the solution. The proposed research is designed to investigate these issues in
      a KA population and to lay the groundwork for community-based self-help health education
      interventions to enhance appropriate care and BP control.

      Comparison(s):This community-based self-help intervention approach offers a more culturally
      appropriate approach to closing the health status gap for KA. Incorporating a partnership
      with community leaders and health and human service care providers, this approach will
      utilize state-of-the-art health education strategies and a well-trained bilingual nurse from
      the community.
