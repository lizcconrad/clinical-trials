      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pelvic
      floor muscle training in the management of pelvic organ prolapse in women.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem that adversely affects the daily activities and
      quality of life of many women. Pelvic floor muscle training interventions are commonly used
      by physiotherapists to manage prolapse. However, a Cochrane review found limited evidence to
      support the effectiveness of such interventions. Based on the findings of a successful
      feasibility study, this multi-centre randomised controlled trial will address the paucity of
      evidence. 556 symptomatic women with diagnosed prolapse will be enrolled in 16 UK centres and
      1 New Zealand centre over 16 months and randomised to pelvic floor muscle training plus
      lifestyle advice, or to receive a lifestyle leaflet only. Principal measures of outcome are:
      prolapse symptoms, prolapse severity, and subsequent further treatment up to 12 months after
      trial entry.

    <description>It consists of five outpatient appointments (weeks 0, 2, 6, 11 and 16) with a local trial physiotherapist at a trial centre. At the first appointment a standardised history is taken from the woman, anatomy and function of the pelvic floor muscles are taught, and types of prolapse described, using diagrams and a model pelvis. Women are taught how to contract the muscles, and also how to contract and hold prior to an event that increases intra-abdominal pressure (&quot;the Knack&quot;). Pelvic floor muscles are assessed by vaginal examination and recorded on a dedicated form at each appointment thus determining the content of a single set of exercises for each woman. At least three sets of exercises daily is recommended. Women use an exercise diary to record compliance. Tailored advice is given on ways of reducing intra-abdominal pressure, e.g. advice on weight loss, chronic cough, heavy lifting and general exercise.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Women allocated to the control group will be sent a lifestyle advice leaflet only, and will have no planned contact with the centre until their consultant review appointment at six months. The leaflet gives instructions on seeking advice where appropriate about weight loss, constipation, and avoidance of heavy lifting, coughing and high impact exercise, with a view to minimising increases in intra-abdominal pressure which may cause prolapse to worsen.</description>

    <description>Women in the intervention group attend 5 physiotherapy sessions. At each appointment a clinical history is taken, pelvic floor muscle assessment carried out, exercises taught and prescribed, and appropriate lifestyle advice given. At the first of these appointments a detailed explanation of the pelvic anatomy and different types of prolapse is given.</description>
