  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to determine whether tapentadol (CG5503) is effective and
      safe in the treatment of chronic tumor related pain compared to placebo. In addition
      tapentadol (CG5503) will also be compared to morphine controlled release, also referred to as
      slow release (SR).

      *Tapentadol prolonged-release (PR) is the term used in the European Union and is referred to
      as extended release (ER) in the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normally chronic tumor related pain is controlled when participants receive repeated doses of
      opioid analgesics. However, opioid therapy is commonly associated with side effects such as
      nausea, vomiting, sedation, constipation, addiction, tolerance, and respiratory depression.
      Tapentadol (CG5503), a newly synthesized drug with an prolonged release (PR) formulation,
      also acts as a centrally acting pain reliever but has 2 mechanisms of action. The aim of this
      trial is to investigate the effectiveness (level of pain control) and safety (side effects)
      of tapentadol (CG5503) PR compared with no drug (placebo) and corresponding dose of morphine
      (an opioid commonly used to treat tumor related pain). This trial is a randomized,
      double-blind (neither investigator nor patient will know which treatment was received),
      active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized withdrawal design, multicenter
      trial.

      The trial includes a 2 week titration phase starting with either 40 mg morphine (PR) bid (bid
      = twice daily dosing, one dose in the morning and one dose in the evening) or 100 mg
      tapentadol (CG5503) PR bid. Based on effectiveness and side effects subjects can up-titrate
      in steps of 50 mg tapentadol (CG5503 PR) to a maximal dose of 250 mg tapentadol (CG5503) PR
      bid or 100 mg morphine PR bid. If participants meet the stabilisation criteria at the end of
      the titration phase they will be re-randomized to either placebo or active treatment and will
      continue 4 weeks at the last dose level in the maintenance phase. Only participants on
      tapentadol in the titration phase will be re-randomized to either matching placebo or to
      tapentadol. To maintain the blinding nature of the trial participants in the morphine arm
      during the titration phase will also be re-randomized however they will all remain on
      morphine controlled release in the maintenance phase. Placebo to match tapentadol tablets, as
      well as placebo to match morphine capsules, will be used to mask the treatment allocation.

      Participants will be issued with an electronic diary (eDiary) to capture Numeric Rating Scale
      (NRS) pain intensities.

      Assessments of pain relief include the pain intensity numeric rating scale (NRS) and patient
      global impression of change (PGIC). Safety evaluations include monitoring of adverse events,
      physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms. Venous blood samples
      will be collected for the determination of serum concentrations of tapentadol (CG5503).

    <time_frame>Day 18 through Day 43 (End of Maintenance Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>A &quot;responder&quot; is a participant in the study that:
completed 28 days of the maintenance phase
had a numeric rating scale score below 5 on the 11 point scale (where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates worst possible pain. This twice daily current pain score was averaged over Day 18 to Day 43.
did not use more than 20 mg of rescue medication per day on average in the 28 day maintenance period (from Day 18 to Day 43).
A participant that met all 3 of the above-mentioned criteria is counted as a responder, in other words the participant benefited from the assigned drug treatment. A participant that failed to meet only 1 of the 3 criteria is not counted as a responder.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 14 (End of Titration Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument was developed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The physical components of withdrawal are primarily evaluated and based on questions and clinical observations. The possible opioid withdrawal effects are assessed using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Score (COWS). The COWS is a clinician rated 11-item scale that primarily evaluates the physical components of opioid withdrawal and is based on questions and clinical observations. Responses are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 4 or 5 depending on the item. The total COWS score is the sum of all individual items.
The following withdrawal categories are based on the total COWS score:
None: total score below 5;
Mild: total score from 5 to 12;
Moderate: total score 13 to 24;
Moderately Severe: total score 25 to 36;
Severe: total score above 36. The investigator completes the COWS after participants discontinued trial medication 2 to less than 5 days after last intake of trial medication.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (Start of Titration); Day 14 (End of Titration Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of symptoms of constipation. Participants are asked &quot;How severe have each of these symptoms been in the last two weeks?&quot; e.g. &quot;Pain in your stomach&quot;. There are 3 subscales: 4 questions on Abdominal symptoms, 3 questions on rectal symptoms and 5 questions on stool symptoms. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). The changes in overall mean and in each of the mean sub-scores vary theoretically from -4 to +4 (where a change of +4 would indicate a change from not present to very severe symptom). If the changes in the overall or subscale mean scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation from the start to the end of the titration phase.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial started on 13 Jun 2007 with the enrollment of the first participant and was completed on 04 Jun 2012 with the last follow-up examination. 622 participants signed informed consent. 505 participants were randomized and 504 had at least one dose of trial medication. 496 participants were part of the safety analysis set.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>One site was excluded from all analysis sets (efficacy and safety) due to GCP non-compliance. Thus 8 participants who were randomized and treated are not reported in the tables below.
The participants in the tapentadol titration phase were re-randomized to tapentadol or placebo in the maintenance phase.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants randomized to placebo received 100 mg tapentadol prolonged release (PR) twice daily for 3 days to taper them off the tapentadol dose they had received in the Titration Phase. From the 4th day (Day 18) all participants received matching placebo in the maintenance (i.e. randomized withdrawal) phase.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Scored as Responder in Maintenance Phase.</title>
        <description>A &quot;responder&quot; is a participant in the study that:
completed 28 days of the maintenance phase
had a numeric rating scale score below 5 on the 11 point scale (where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates worst possible pain. This twice daily current pain score was averaged over Day 18 to Day 43.
did not use more than 20 mg of rescue medication per day on average in the 28 day maintenance period (from Day 18 to Day 43).
A participant that met all 3 of the above-mentioned criteria is counted as a responder, in other words the participant benefited from the assigned drug treatment. A participant that failed to meet only 1 of the 3 criteria is not counted as a responder.</description>

        <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) includes several brief questions on 8 aspects, (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health) that a participant was asked to score over the last week. Low scores on the Physical Component Summary measure indicate limitations in physical functioning, e.g. a high degree of bodily pain and physical limitations etc. For the Mental Component Summary measure, a low score is indicative of frequent psychological distress, social and role disability due to emotional problems etc. The theoretical range for the physical component score is 12.3279 to 59.6503. The theoretical range for the mental component score is 13.5313 to 59.6503. Positive values for changes in the component scores indicate an improvement.</description>

The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions are scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead. A positive change in the mean indicates that during this phase the health status improved. A positive change indicates an improvement in health. The minimal important difference is 0.074 (range -0.011 to 0.140).</description>

        <title>Change in the EuroQoL (EQ-5D) Health Status Index (United Kingdom Time Trade-off Value Set) Over Time in the Maintenance Phase for Tapentadol and the Placebo Randomized Withdrawal Treatment Arms.</title>
        <description>The participant scores the EuroQol-5D. The EuroQoL-5D is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1 = no problems, 2 = some problems, 3 = extreme problems).
The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions are scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead. A negative change in the mean indicates a worsening in health status since the beginning of the maintenance phase. A positive change indicates an improvement in health. The minimal important difference in the Health Status Index is 0.074 (range -0.011 to 0.140).</description>

        <description>EuroQoL-5D Health State Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state. The values indicated represent the change from Day 15, a negative mean value indicates a worsening of health-related quality of life since the start of the maintenance phase.</description>

        <title>Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) at the End of the Titration Phase.</title>
        <description>This instrument was developed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The physical components of withdrawal are primarily evaluated and based on questions and clinical observations. The possible opioid withdrawal effects are assessed using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Score (COWS). The COWS is a clinician rated 11-item scale that primarily evaluates the physical components of opioid withdrawal and is based on questions and clinical observations. Responses are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 4 or 5 depending on the item. The total COWS score is the sum of all individual items.
The following withdrawal categories are based on the total COWS score:
None: total score below 5;
Mild: total score from 5 to 12;
Moderate: total score 13 to 24;
Moderately Severe: total score 25 to 36;
Severe: total score above 36. The investigator completes the COWS after participants discontinued trial medication 2 to less than 5 days after last intake of trial medication.</description>

        <title>Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Score (COWS) at the End of the Maintenance Phase.</title>
        <description>This instrument was developed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The physical components of withdrawal are primarily evaluated and based on questions and clinical observations. The possible opioid withdrawal effects are assessed using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Score (COWS). The COWS is a clinician rated 11-item scale that primarily evaluates the physical components of opioid withdrawal and is based on questions and clinical observations. Responses are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 4 or 5 depending on the item. The total COWS score is the sum of all individual items.
The following withdrawal categories are based on the total COWS score:
None: total score below 5;
Mild: total score from 5 to 12;
Moderate: total score 13 to 24;
Moderately Severe: total score 25 to 36;
Severe: total score above 36. The investigator completes the COWS after participants discontinued trial medication 2 to less than 5 days after last intake of trial medication.</description>

        <title>Change in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) During the Titration Phase</title>
        <description>The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of symptoms of constipation. Participants are asked &quot;How severe have each of these symptoms been in the last two weeks?&quot; e.g. &quot;Pain in your stomach&quot;. There are 3 subscales: 4 questions on Abdominal symptoms, 3 questions on rectal symptoms and 5 questions on stool symptoms. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). The changes in overall mean and in each of the mean sub-scores vary theoretically from -4 to +4 (where a change of +4 would indicate a change from not present to very severe symptom). If the changes in the overall or subscale mean scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation from the start to the end of the titration phase.</description>
