  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and safety expansion, Phase I study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinectics and to investigate biomarker changes
      of AZD7762 administered as a single intravenous unit and in combination with irinotecan. The
      study is sponsored by AstraZeneca.
