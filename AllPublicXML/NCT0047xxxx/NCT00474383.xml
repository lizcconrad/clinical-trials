  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the anti-tumor activities and safety of abiraterone
      acetate in participants with prostate cancer (a disease in which cells in the prostate gland
      [a gland in the male reproductive system found below the bladder and in front of the rectum]
      become abnormal and start to grow uncontrollably, forming tumors) who have failed taxane
      (docetaxel)-based chemotherapy.

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm,
      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to evaluate the anti-tumor activities and safety of abiraterone acetate in
      participants with cancer who have failed taxane (docetaxel)-based chemotherapy. Abiraterone
      acetate 1000 milligram (mg) tablet or capsule will be administered orally (by mouth), once
      daily after an overnight fast until disease progression, lack of disease response after six
      28-day cycles of treatment, or when unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Participants will
      be treated for up to 12 cycles. All participants will receive a concurrent low-dose
      glucocorticoid (such as prednisone 5 mg tablet twice daily/prednisolone 0.5 mg tablet once
      daily). Treatment will be continued in responding participants until death, or disease
      progression, or end of the study (which is Week 148). Efficacy will primarily be assessed
      through prostate specific antigen response according to Prostate Specific Antigen Working
      Group (PSAWG) criteria. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
      Participants who have completed 12 cycles of abiraterone acetate treatment, and continue to
      receive clinical benefit from such treatment, will be eligible to enter the extension study.
      Participants who enter the extension study will continue taking abiraterone acetate at the
      dose they were receiving at the end of the main study together with low-dose glucocorticoid.
      Efficacy and safety will be monitored throughout the extension study. Study treatment will
      end when the patient dies, is lost to follow-up, withdraws informed consent, experiences
      sustained side-effects, has disease progression, or the sponsor discontinues the extension
      study. After the end of study visit is completed for the extension study, participants will
      be followed every 12 weeks for survival for up to 3 years following entry into the extension
      study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA response was evaluated according to Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criteria, which was, greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in PSA from Baseline and confirmed by subsequent measurement at least 4 weeks later.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA response was evaluated according to Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criteria, which was, greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in PSA from Baseline and confirmed by subsequent measurement at least 4 weeks later.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Tumor Response as Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until first documented disease progression or end of study visit (Week 148; assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7, 10, and thereafter Day 1 of each cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>The objective tumor response was defined as the percentage of participants achieving a complete (CR) or partial response (PR) on tumor response assessed as per RECIST. The CR was disappearance of all lesions. The PR was at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum LD.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline until first documented disease progression or up to end of study (Week 148; assessed on Days 1, 8 of Cycle 1, thereafter Day 1 of each Cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to PSA progression was the interval from the date of the first dose of abiraterone acetate to the date of PSA progression as defined by the PSAWG criteria. PSA progression was defined as a 50 percent increase over the nadir PSA value, increase in the PSA level by at least 5 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL), and confirmed by second consecutive measurement.</description>

    <description>Duration of PSA response was the time between the date of first PSA response (greater than or equal to 50 percent decline from Baseline) and the date of PSA progression as defined by the PSAWG. PSA progression was defined as a 50 percent increase over the nadir PSA value, increase in the PSA level by at least 5 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL), and confirmed by second consecutive measurement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline until first documented disease progression or death or up to end of study (Week 148; assessed on Day 1 of each cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival was defined as the interval from the date of the first dose of abiraterone acetate to the date of death or date of progressive disease (PD) as assessed by RECIST criteria. PD was at least 20 percent increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
