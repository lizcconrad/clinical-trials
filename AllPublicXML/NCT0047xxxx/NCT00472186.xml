  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine whether post-operative pain following a tonsillectomy
      can be reduced by adding an antacid-like medication to the medications taken after surgery.
      It is hypothesized that even a small amount of stomach acid backing up and entering the mouth
      can increase post-tonsillectomy pain. Therefore, the use of an antacid-like medication should
      help to decrease pain and reduce the amount of narcotic medication required for pain control.

      This study has been limited to children and adolescents ages 5-18 who are undergoing
      tonsillectomy for an indication of obstructive sleep disturbance (snoring, choking/gasping or
      pauses in breathing during sleep.)

      Study participants will be randomized to two groups: study medication (Lansoprazole) or an
      inactive substance(placebo).

      Participants will be asked to do all of the following:

        1. Take the study medication twice a day for 14 days.

        2. Keep a log book which will include:

             -  Record the medications and amount of each medication taken each day for 14 days.
                This includes pain medication and the study drug.

             -  Record your child's activity level daily for 14 days.

             -  Collect your child's urine one time daily and test it using special medicated
                strips to monitor their daily liquid intake for 14 days.

        3. Meet with a Research Assistant or Study Physician 14-21 days after the study to collect
           the log book and perform a post-operative examination.

  <why_stopped>
    Poor compliance with returning of logbooks by families. Two patients were enrolled. Only one
    returned the logbook and therefore not analyzed
