    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to measure the effect of Coca-Cola and Diet Coke, relative to
      mineral water, on non-haem iron absorption. The results from this study will quantify any
      enhancing effect of Coca-Cola or Diet Coke on non-haem iron absorption and will be of use to
      the Coca-Cola Company and the scientific and nutrition community in evaluating the
      nutritional value of these products.

      Previous studies have suggested that Coca-Cola may enhance absorption of non-haem iron. A
      randomized cross-over trial will be undertaken to compare the absorption of iron added to a
      pizza meal consumed with either Coca-Cola, Diet Coke or mineral water. Pizza containing added
      iron, labelled with an iron stable isotope (Fe-58), will be consumed for lunch on two
      consecutive days with either a Coca-Cola, Diet Coke or mineral water drink. Iron absorption
      from the pizza will be determined using the erythrocyte incorporation technique.

      A baseline blood sample will be taken prior to consuming the first test meal (pizza + drink
      1) and after approximately 15 days, a second fasting blood sample will be taken prior to
      consumption of a second set of test meals (pizza + drink 2). Iron isotope enrichment of the
      blood sample will be used as a baseline for the second set of test meals and to calculate
      absorption from the first set of test meals. A third blood sample will be taken after
      approximately 30 days and the iron isotope enrichment will be used as a baseline for the
      third set of test meals (pizza + drink 3) and to determine absorption from the second set of
      test meals. At about 45 days a final blood sample will be taken to determine absorption from
      the third set of test meals. Iron absorption will be calculated from the isotopic enrichment
      in blood, assuming that 80% of absorbed iron is incorporated into red blood cells. Absorption
      of iron consumed with Coca-Cola and Diet Coke will be compared with iron absorption when
      consumed with mineral water. The order in which the volunteers will be given the drinks will
      be randomised.
