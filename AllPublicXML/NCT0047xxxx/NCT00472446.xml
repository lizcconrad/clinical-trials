  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the impact on post-operative pain of the superficial cervical block
      with bupivacaine combined with subcutaneous infiltration of the incisional area in thyroid
      surgery under general anesthesia. In addition, cost savings using the cervical block are
      evaluated (due to reduced length of hospital stay).

      The study is prospective, randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled. The study is
      performed at the Department of Surgery, Cantonal Hospital of St. Gallen.

          <description>bilateral superficial cervical block placed before surgery (just before skin incision)
bilateral superficial cervical block: 10 ml of 5% bupivacaine (Carbostesin®) was used for each side.
Along the cranial dorsal edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, three deposits of approximately 2.5 ml were injected to anaesthetize the cervical plexus with its nervus transversus colli. To anaesthetize the region of the planned skin incision, the remaining 2·5 ml was injected subcutaneously on each side.</description>
