  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum 89 SF is a supply of serum that was collected from people who were vaccinated with the
      pneumococcal vaccine in the late 1980s. The supply of this serum is running low. The purpose
      of this study is to give the pneumococcal vaccine to healthy volunteers and take serum blood
      samples in order to increase the reference serum supply. Study participants will include 250
      healthy men and women, ages 18-45. Study procedures will include a physical exam, interviews,
      blood samples and blood testing. All volunteers will receive the pneumococcal vaccine in the
      deltoid muscle of the arm. Participants will be involved in the study for approximately 17
      weeks.

      Serum 89SF is a pooled sera from individuals vaccinated with a 23 valent pneumococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine collected in the late 1980s. The 89SF standard for ELISA is running
      low (2-3 year supply) and is insufficient to serve for opsinophagocytosis assay (OPA), which
      requires large volumes. The objective of this study is to immunize healthy volunteers with
      licensed polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax 23) with subsequent blood
      donation in a quantity sufficient to make reference sera. Two hundred fifty volunteer
      subjects will be recruited from a total population of up to 600. Study participants will
      include healthy men and nonpregnant females, ages 18-45. Subjects will undergo physical
      examination by a licensed clinician, subject interview, and clinical laboratory and serologic
      testing. Potential subjects must provide written informed consent and meet all eligibility
      criteria. On Day 0, subjects will receive 0.5 mL pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax 23) in the
      deltoid muscle. Volunteers will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes following immunization
      for observation of any adverse reactions. Volunteers will return to clinic in 10-35 days
      following immunization to donate 1 unit (approximately 500 mL) of blood. Volunteers will
      return for a second donation of 1 unit of blood not less than 8 weeks and not more than 14
      weeks following the first donation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             year) must agree to practice adequate contraception (ie, barrier method, abstinence,
             intrauterine device, or licensed hormonal method) for the entire period while on
             protocol.

          3. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24
             hours prior to vaccination and prior to each blood collection.

          4. Participants must be afebrile and in general good health in the opinion of the
             investigator as determined by vital signs, medical history, and physical examination.

          5. Subject laboratory tests, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, total white blood count
             and platelets, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and serum
             protein. All values must be within normal limits (WNL) except AST and ALT that must
             less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN and total serum protein &gt;=6.0 gms; Males: hemoglobin
