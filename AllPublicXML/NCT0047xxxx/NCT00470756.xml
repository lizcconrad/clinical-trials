  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every week we encounter with 5-8 pairs of worried parents of infants with forefoot adduction.
      Most of them usually need only reassurance and education how to manipulate the deformed foot.
      During the examination we usually use provocative maneuver to trigger peroneal activity. This
      manual stimulation usually reveals active eversion and dorsiflexion of the foot in most of
      the children, but not in all of them. Small part of the children reacts in opposite direction
      - instead of the typical eversion they demonstrate inversion and some plantar flexion of the
      foot. We have the impression that this subgroup of children improves the deformity slower and
      sometime less complete than most of the children. We did not find in the literature any
      description of this phenomenon. We postulate, that atypically reacting patients probably have
      different response due to abnormalities of neuromuscular balance between invertors-flexors
      and evertors-extensors muscle groups. This small subgroup of children may need more close
      follow-up and probably casting to speed up and secure the improvement of their deformity.

      Study goals:

        1. Evaluate ability of children with FFA to respond on mechanical triggering of peroneal
           activity

             1. The majority of the patients with standard reaction - foot dorsiflexion and
                eversion (evertors)

             2. The minority of the patients with nonstandard reaction - foot plantarflexion and
                inversion (invertors)

        2. Evaluate randomly selected children from each group for character of muscular response
           on electrical stimulation (EMG) of calf muscles.
