    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a systematic intervention with early
      identifying of patients with posttraumatic amnesia using a reality orientation therapy can
      reduce the period with posttraumatic amnesia in order to get a better outcome for patients
      with traumatic brain injury

      1. A systematic review with the latest investigation and treatment of patients with
           posttraumatic amnesia

        2. Investigate the effect of a systematic nursing programme on the length of posttraumatic
           amnesia

        3. Investigate the effect of a systematic nursing programme after 12 month

        4. Describe perspectives for the future within the early rehabilitation of patients with
           posttraumatic amnesia

    <description>Two matched groups of patients diagnosed with TBI are selected from two university hospitals. In addition to conventional treatment, patients in one group are introduced to a reality- orientation programme consisting of systematic orientation, information, and systematic cooperation with the patientÂ´s relatives.Patients in the other group receive conventional treatment only. All patients are tested on a daily basis in accordance with the RLAS and the GOAT test.</description>
