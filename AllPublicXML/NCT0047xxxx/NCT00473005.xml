  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the survival of metastatic breast patients, it is important to
      investigate the use of novel therapeutic agents combined with known active agents in the
      treatment of breast cancer. This is a phase I study evaluating the maximum tolerated doses
      and toxicities of RAD001 in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic
      breast cancer. RAD001 (INN: everolimus) is a novel macrolide, which is being developed as an
      antiproliferative drug with applications as an immunosuppressant and anticancer agent. Phase
      I trials in patients with solid tumors have shown that treatment with RAD001 is
      well-tolerated with a minimal side effect profile. Capecitabine (Xeloda, Roche) is an oral
      fluoropyrimidine that was approved in 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic
      breast cancer. The all-oral regimen of RAD001 with capecitabine is an attractive approach as
      the treatment of metastatic breast cancer has not yet proven to be curative. We also want to
      find out what possible benefit this combination of drugs might have on treating your cancer.
