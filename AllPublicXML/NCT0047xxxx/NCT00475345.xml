      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not bedtime snacks are necessary to
      prevent overnight low blood glucose reactions (nocturnal hypoglycemia) in adults with type 1
      diabetes who are using intensive insulin therapies, either multiple injections of insulin or
      insulin pump.

      We hypothesize that a bedtime snack is not necessary if the bedtime insulin is very well
      adjusted and delivered, especially by use of insulin pump which is considered the &quot;gold
      standard&quot; for overnight blood glucose control.

      Nocturnal hypoglycemia is a significant side effect of insulin replacement therapy and can
      lead to many problems including coma and death in the most extreme cases and deterioration of
      glycemic control. Strategies to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia include development of newer
      insulins and delivery systems and the use of specific bedtime snack compositions. Detection
      of nocturnal hypoglycemia, as it occurs in everyday life, has been a problem since most
      episodes go unnoticed and therefore untreated leading to a very dangerous situation. With the
      recent availability of technology which allows for continuous glucose monitoring , it has
      been made possible to detect nocturnal hypoglycemia as it occurs in daily life. As well, this
      technology allows for the possibility of better titration of therapy.

      Therefore, the goal of our study was to use continuous glucose monitoring technology as a
      tool to optimize titration of insulin therapy and as a means to detect nocturnal hypoglycemia
      as it occurs in daily life. Specifically, we sought to compare the use of insulin pump
      therapy with no bedtime snacks and using a new type of insulin called an analogue(lispro)
      versus multiple daily injections of insulin, using the same type of insulin analogue, and
      with and without bedtime snacks. Therefore, we compared 3 groups: 1) insulin pump with no
      bedtime snacks; 2) multiple injections with bedtime snacks and 3) multiple injections with no
      bedtime snacks. The groups were primarily compared for the occurrence and frequency of
      nocturnal hypoglycemia. Other comparisons included: long term glycemic control (A1c), weight
      and body composition and quality of life.
