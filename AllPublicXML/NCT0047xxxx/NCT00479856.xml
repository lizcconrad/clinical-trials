    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of lapatinib in combination with
      chemotherapy (capecitabine, docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel) in subjects with ErbB2-overexpressing
      breast cancer whose disease has progressed during or within 12 months after completion of
      trastuzumab-containing therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.

    <time_frame>from start of treatment and every 6 weeks (wks) until Wk 12, then every 12 wks thereafter through the end of treatment (~95 wks; dependent on when participant discontinued study therapy due to disease progression, death, adverse event, of other reason)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall tumor response is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete or partial tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. CR could only be declared if all target and non-target lesions had disappeared. Partial response (PR) is defined as a decrease of 30% or greater in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Clinical Benefit (CB)</measure>
    <time_frame>from start of treatment and every 6 weeks (wks) until Wk 12, then every 12 wks thereafter through the end of treatment (~95 weeks; dependent on when participant discontinued study therapy due to disease progression, death, adverse event, or other reason)</time_frame>
    <description>CB is defined as the percentage of participants (par.) with either a confirmed CR or PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks. SD is defined as small changes that do not meet criteria for CR, PR, or Progressive Disease (defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions).</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death (approximately 95 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>For the subset of participants with a confirmed CR or PR, duration of response was measured as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>start of treatment until first documented evidence of CR or PR (approximately 95 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documented evidence of PR or CR (whichever status was recorded first). When tumor response was confirmed at a repeat assessment, the TTR was taken to be the first time that the response was observed.</description>

    <time_frame>from start of treatment and every 6 weeks (wks) until Wk 12, then every 12 wks thereafter through the end of treatment (~95 weeks); dependent on when participant discontinued study therapy due to disease progression, death, adverse event, or other reason)</time_frame>
    <description>The time from the start of treatment until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause was measured.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through End of Treatment, or discontinuation of study therapy (approximately 95 weeks); from the first dose of lapatinib until 5 days after the last dose of lapatinib</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with the combination of capecitabine, docetaxel, or nab-paclitaxel and lapatinib were measured.

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Histologically/cytologically confirmed breast cancer;

        If the disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, the neoplastic nature of the lesion must
        be confirmed by cytology or histology.

          -  Measurable lesion(s) according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors) [Therasse, 2000].

          -  Documented amplification of the ErbB2 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization
             (FISH) or documented overexpression of the ErbB2 protein by 3+ IHC in primary or
             metastatic tumor tissue.

          -  Subjects must have relapsed breast cancer where the disease progressed during or ≤ 12
             months after completion of trastuzumab-containing therapy in the neoadjuvant or
             adjuvant setting.

        Note: Progression is defined using RECIST criteria, that is, either the appearance of new
        lesions or a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD).

          -  Subjects must not have received prior anti-cancer therapy for metastatic breast cancer
             (MBC). Subjects who received prior antihormonal agents combined with trastuzumab for
             the treatment of disease which first presented as ER positive MBC and recurred while
             receiving trastuzumab or ≤ 3 months after completing this therapy are eligible.

          -  Subjects with stable central nervous system (CNS) metastases as confirmed by

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the physician, would make the
             subject inappropriate for study participation or any serious medical disorder that
             would interfere with the subject's safety (for example, uncontrolled infection, or any
             psychiatric condition prohibiting understanding or rendering of informed consent).

             clinical trial involving investigational agents for anti-cancer therapy.

          <title>Time to Response (TTR)</title>
          <description>TTR is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documented evidence of PR or CR (whichever status was recorded first). When tumor response was confirmed at a repeat assessment, the TTR was taken to be the first time that the response was observed.</description>
          <population>Due to the low incidence of relapse and hence the difficulty in identifying eligible participants, the study was terminated with only 9 out of the 45 planned participants enrolled. As there were too few participants to derive statistically meaningful conclusions, only the primary endpoint was evaluated.</population>
