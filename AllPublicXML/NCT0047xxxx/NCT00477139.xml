      This is a pilot study to gather preliminary data on the baseline immunologic status of
      patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer and to establish an immune monitoring laboratory for
      future clinical trial. We will ask up to 10 patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer in stable
      condition and in reasonable health to participate in this study. The study will establish an
      immune monitoring for correlative studies done in patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer. The
      immunologic tests that will be done are ELISpot, lymphocyte proliferation, intracellular
      cytokine staining, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, and ELISA.

             positive or negative) with or without metastatic disease.

          -  HER-2(+) as determined by one of the following measurements. NOTE: HER-2(+) assessment
             may have been on initial diagnosis and need not be repeated for metastatic lesions

               -  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+, or

               -  FISH + (HER-2 gene signal to centromere 17 signal &gt;2)

          -  No transfusion dependent patients and no transfusion within 30 days of leukopheresis

          -  Documented labs within 7 days of donation consisting of:

             failure, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease or arrhythmia requiring
             medications, angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant
             pericardial effusion)

          -  All patients must give signed written informed consent.

          -  ECOG Performance Score of 0 or 1.
