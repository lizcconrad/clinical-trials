  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause
      of cervical cancer. Indeed, certain oncogenic types of HPV can infect the cervix (part of the
      uterus or womb). This infection may go away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is
      called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of
      the cervix. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has developed a HPV vaccine against the oncogenic
      types HPV-16 and HPV-18 formulated with the AS04 adjuvant (control vaccine) and is also
      evaluating novel HPV vaccines formulations. This study will evaluate a novel GSK Biologicals'
      HPV vaccine (GSK1674330A) in terms of safety and immunogenicity compared to the control
      vaccine. There will be different levels of blinding in the study.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.
