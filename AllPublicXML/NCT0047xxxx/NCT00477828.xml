      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treating sleep apnea with continuous
      positive airway pressure would result in improvements in cognition in patients with
      Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) experience nighttime sleep fragmentation and
      often become hypoxic during the night. The fragmentation and hypoxemia can frequently result
      in daytime impairments including impairments in cognitive functioning. The state-of-the-art
      treatment for SDB is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Many SDB patients who are
      successfully treated with CPAP show improvement in memory and other cognitive functions. Data
      have shown that there is a strong relationship between SDB and dementia with patients with
      Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) having a high rate of SDB. This proposal will examine whether
      treating SDB with CPAP in patients with AD will result in improvement in cognitive
      functioning. The specific aims are to assess whether patients with mild AD and SDB will
      tolerate CPAP and be compliant with treatment; to examine the effect of CPAP treatment on SDB
      in patients with mild AD and SDB; to examine the effect of CPAP treatment on cognitive
      functioning in patients with mild AD and SDB; to examine whether improvement is greater after
      six weeks of CPAP treatment than after three weeks of treatment. Since caregivers are often
      disturbed by the patients poor sleep, we will also evaluate the effect of the patients’
      treatment on their caregivers. Specifically, the secondary aims are to evaluate whether
      caregivers feel that CPAP improves the patient’s sleep and to evaluate whether caregivers
      feel that their own sleep improves as the patient’s sleep improves. Patient identified as
      having mild AD and SDB will have an extensive neuropsychological battery. Half will be
      randomized to CPAP treatment and the other half to shamCPAP. After three weeks
      neuropsychological tests will be repeated. The shamCPAP will be switched to CPAP and the CPAP
      group will remain on CPAP for an additional three weeks. Neuropsychological tests will again
      be repeated. The long-term goal of this line of research is to find a new approach that might
      improve the quality of life, delay the dementing process, postpone institutionalization and
      save millions of dollars in nursing care costs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Mild probable Alzheimer's disease (diagnosed according to the National Institute of
             Neurological and Communicative Disorders &amp; Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related
             Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA] criteria).

          -  Mini Mental Status Exam score between 20 and 27

          -  Respiratory disturbance index &gt;15 (i.e., 15 apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep) -
             Between the ages of 50-85 years

          -  Stable health

          -  reliable caregiver

          -  English speaking

          -  Patients will be allowed to continue acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, psychotropic
             medications, memory enhancers, health food supplements, etc. as long as they have been
             stable on the same dose for at least two months prior to participation and agree to
             continue on this dose for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently receiving treatment for sleep apnea.

          -  Apneas primarily central in origin; narcolepsy or other sleep disorders

          -  Medication known to influence sleep (i.e. sedative hypnotics, narcotics) will be
             excluded if the dose can not remain stable and unchanged for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Bronchospastic and symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as indicated by
             regular use of bronchodilators, steroids, history of carbon dioxide retention, waking
             hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg or SpO2 &lt;92 % by pulse oximetry), or use of supplemental
             oxygen.

          -  Symptomatic coronary or cerebral vascular disease (history of myocardial infarction,
             angina, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks), history of life-threatening
             arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, history of psychosis, or current alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Current diagnosis of active uncontrolled seizure disorder

          -  Any other advanced, severe and unstable disease of any type that may put the subject
             at special risk or interfere with primary and secondary variable evaluations

          -  Change in any medication within one month of participation.
