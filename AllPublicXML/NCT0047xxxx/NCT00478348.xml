  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether drainage after prosthetic repair of
      incisional abdominal hernias increases or decreases complications such as infection, seromas
      and hematomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 3 to 20% of patients who received a midline laparotomy will develop an incisional
      hernia.

      Primary suture of the defect is associated with a recurrence rate between 25 and 50%.Mesh
      repair is superior with regard to the recurrence (12-20%), but early postoperative
      complications include infections, hematomas and seromas.

      Some advocate the use of drains in order to diminish secretions and complications. Other
      claim that drains increase the complication's rate.

      In the absence of a randomized controlled trial it's not clear whether drainage could
      influence positively or negatively the occurence of such complications when performing a
      prosthetic repair of abdominal incisional hernia.

      The aim of this study is to answer this question, comparing prospectively two groups of
      operated patients: the former with drainage and the latter without.
