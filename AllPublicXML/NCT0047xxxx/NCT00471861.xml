      The purpose of this study is to determine whether C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is elevated in
      patients with active migraine headaches. Secondary goal is to determine whether other
      inflammatory markers, such as Calcitonin Gene Peptide (CGRP), Vasoactive Intestinal
      Polypeptide (VIP) or Substance P (SP) are elevated in patients having a migraine headache.

      A random selection of patients both male and female from a primary care practice with a
      diagnosis of having migraine headaches will be enrolled. Thirty (30) patients will be
      recruited mainly from the primary care practice. Recruitment will include males and females
      aged 21-65. The patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. The patients who
      do not have migraine headaches will also be enrolled and function as controls. Non-migraine
      patients will meet inclusion criteria 1, 2 and 3 and all of the exclusion criteria.
