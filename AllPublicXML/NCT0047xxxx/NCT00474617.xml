          -  Subjects known or suspected to have an allergy to narcotics, muscle relaxants or other
             medications used during surgery;

          -  Subjects receiving medication known to interfere with neuromuscular blocking agents
             such as anticonvulsants, antibiotics and Mg2+;

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding;

          -  Females subjects of childbearing potential not using an acceptable method of birth
             control [condom or diaphragm with spermicide, vasectomized partner (&gt; 6 months), IUD,
             abstinence];
