    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, two-period, placebo controlled cross-over Phase IIa study. This study
      is to use CB2 compound of GW842166 in patients with osteoarthritis. The pain assessments and
      WOMAC questionnaires will be used in the study after the repeated dose to evaluate the
      efficacy of CB2 compound of GW842166.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain scores from Baseline to the end of treatment Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) using on the pain subscore for 6-8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and up to Day 14 of each treatment period (approximately up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The index consisted of 24 questions (5 for pain, 2 for stiffness and 17 for physical and composite functions). The visual analog scale (VAS; 0-100 millimeter [mm]) was utilized in this study and participants were asked to rate joint pain they had in last 24 hours in the 5 pain items. Participants were asked to rate pain while performing following activities: walking on a flat surface, going up or down stairs; at night while in bed; sitting or lying and standing upright. Higher score (100) indicates extreme pain and lower score (0) indicates no pain. It was assessed on Day 1 pre-dose (Baseline), Day 1 (1 hour post-dose) and Day 14 (2-4 hours post-dose). Change from Baseline was planned to be calculated by subtracting Baseline value from post-Baseline value. Due to the early termination of this study, no formal statistical analysis was performed. Only summarized data is available.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) rating heat pain threshold and tolerance for 6-8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 14 of each treatment period (approximately up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Heat pain threshold was the temperature at which the participant first feels a painful stimulus. The heat pain threshold on normal skin was usually around 45 degree celcius. Mechanical pain threshold was assessed using an algometer to increase pressure against the skin of the affected joint until the point at which the participant reports pain. It was planned to assess for right knee and right forearm on Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and Day 14 (2-4 hours post-dose). Due to the early termination of this study, no formal statistical analysis was performed. Only summarized data is available.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to the end of treatment in WOMAC stiffness subscore</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 14 of each treatment period (approximately up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were instructed to consider his/her response not only in terms of pain and functional impairment, but also in terms of consequences to his/her personal, conjugal, professional and social activities. The VAS; 0-100 (mm) was utilized in this study and participants were asked rate how much joint pain they have in last 24 hours in the 2 pain items. Participants were asked to rate pain while performing following activities: first awakening in the morning and sitting, lying or resting later in the day. Higher score (100) indicates extreme pain and lower score (0) indicates no pain. It was assessed on Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and Day 14 (2-4 hours post-dose). Change from Baseline was planned to be calculated by subtracting Baseline value from post-Baseline value. Due to the early termination of this study, no formal statistical analysis was performed. Only summarized data is available.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and up to Day 14 of each treatment period (approximately up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS; 0-100 (mm) was utilized in this study and participants were asked rate how much joint pain they have in last 24 hours in the 17 pain items. Participants were asked to rate pain while performing following activities: descending stairs; ascending stairs; rising from sitting; standing; bending to the floor; walking on a flat surface; getting in or out of a car/bus; going shopping; putting on your socks or tights; rising from bed; taking off your socks or tights; lying in bed; getting in or out of the bath; sitting; getting on or off the toilet; performing heavy domestic duties and performing light domestic duties. Higher score (100) indicates extreme pain and lower score (0) indicates no pain. It was assessed on Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and Day 14 (2-4 hours post-dose). Due to the early termination of this study, no formal statistical analysis was performed. Only summarized data is available.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to the end of treatment in participants' and Physician's Global assessment of arthritis condition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and up to Day 14 of each treatment period (approximately up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS; 0-100 (mm) was utilized in this study and participants were asked rate how much joint pain they have in last 24. Participants were asked 'considering all the ways your osteoarthritis (study knee) affects you (him/her), how are you doing today' by investigator for participants' (Physician's) Global assessment. Higher score (100) indicates very poor and lower score (0) indicates very well. It was assessed on Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and Day 14 (2-4 hours post-dose). Due to the early termination of this study, no formal statistical analysis was performed. Only summarized data is available.</description>

    <measure>Time for the 40 meter self-paced walk test and 11 step stair climb test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 14 of each treatment period (approximately up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The time taken for participant to walk for 40 meters from stationary to complete the walk and climb and descend 11 (dependent on site) steps with a handrail was recorded by the investigator or designee. The pain rate was also planned to assesse in participants by using 100 mm VAS after 40 meters walking. The pain was rated as 0 for No Pain and 100 for Extreme Pain. The time was also recorded for the participant to walk the first 20 meter in addition to the time for the complete walk. Due to the early termination of this study, this end point was not assessed.</description>

    <description>The VAS; 0-100 (mm) was utilized in this study and participants were asked to walk for 40 meters from stationary to complete the walk and climb and was recorded by the investigator or designee.

    <time_frame>Up to Day 14 of each treatment period (approximately up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Up to 3 grams of paracetamol in divided doses were allowed as rescue medication per day, but participants were advised that they must refrain from rescue medication within 24 hours prior to a clinic visit (Day 1 and 14). All rescue medication use was planned to be recorded in the diary card. Due to the early termination of this study, this end point was not assessed.</description>
