      Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy with verteporfin for the
      treatment of patients with corneal neovascularization.

      Design: Prospective, non-comparative case series. Participants: Eighteen eyes of 18 patients
      with stable corneal neovascularization who were refractory to conventional treatment.

      Methods: The patients were treated with photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (6 mg/m2). Five
      patients were treated following penetrating keratoplasty, and 2 patients were treated before
      penetrating keratoplasty. Best corrected visual acuity and anterior segment photography were
      performed before and after treatment. The length of cumulative blood vessels and area of
      corneal neovascularization were measured.

      Main outcome measures: Vascular occlusion, best corrected visual acuity, cumulative blood
      vessel length, and corneal neovascularization area.
