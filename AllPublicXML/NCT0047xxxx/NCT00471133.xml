  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine
      encoding a melanosomal antigen in melanoma patients at risk for disease progression or
      recurrence. In this study, the vaccine will be administered intramuscularly using a device
      that applies brief electrical fields to the tissue at the site of injection (a technique
      known as electroporation). It is expected that this device will improve the delivery of the
      vaccine. This study is being performed to determine if this procedure can be administered
      safely and if it is capable of inducing immune responses to the vaccine.

      This study is designed to evaluate administration of a xenogeneic DNA vaccine encoding the
      melanosomal antigen tyrosinase by in vivo electroporation in patients with malignant
      melanoma. The objectives of the study are to characterize the safety and immunogenicity of a
      DNA vaccine encoding the murine tyrosinase gene delivered administered intramuscularly using
      the electroporation based TriGrid Delivery System (Ichor Medical Systems). We will assess the
      nature, frequency, and severity of any toxicity associated with vaccination at escalating
      pINGmuTyr doses and then expand enrollment at then expand enrollment at the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose to assess immunologic responses to the tyrosinase antigen.

      The hypotheses being tested are that the procedure is feasible and safe and that it induces
      immune responses specific for tyrosinase in patients with stage IIB-IV malignant melanoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have documented, histologically confirmed malignant melanoma, American
             Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IIB- IV. Patients with stage IIb-III disease
             are only eligible after standard surgical care with wide local excision and
             appropriate lymph node sampling. Patients with stage IIb, IIc, or III melanoma who are
             free of disease after surgical resection are also eligible, only if they have refused
             high dose Interferon-alfa (INTRON A) or have had a recurrence while on
             Interferon-alfa.

          -  Patients with choroidal melanoma may participate if they fulfill one of the following
             criteria: Basal diameter &gt;16mm; Height &gt;8mm or involvement of the ciliary body with
             tumor.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and must be capable of understanding the
             consent form and giving informed consent.
