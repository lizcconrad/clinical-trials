      This purpose of this study is to test whether a 6-month yoga program improves quality of life
      and reduces fatigue and weight gain in breast cancer survivors.

      Women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of breast cancer than normal weight
      women. Furthermore, women who are overweight or obese or gain weight after diagnosis have an
      increased risk of recurrence or dying from breast cancer compared with normal weight women.
      Yoga has been associated with reduced weight gain and weight loss in persons without cancer.
      However, no studies have tested whether yoga leads to less weight gain or weight loss in
      breast cancer patients. Both obesity and the sequelae of breast cancer therapy can result in
      reduced health-related quality of life and severe fatigue, which may also be favorably
      affected by yoga practice. The specific aims of the proposed trial are to examine, in women
      with Stage 0-IIIa breast cancer who are at least 3 months post primary treatment for their
      disease (other than tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors), the effects of a 6-month yoga
      intervention on health-related quality of life, fatigue, and body weight.
