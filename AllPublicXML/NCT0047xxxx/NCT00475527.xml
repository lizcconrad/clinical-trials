  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a major health problem in children, effecting up to 20% of
      young children. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is also reported to be prevalent in
      children. Several large epidemiologic studies support an association between HP infection and
      lower iron stores. Other small studies suggest improvement in anemia following HP treatment.

      We assume that the prevalence of HP infection in Israeli children diagnosed with IDA is high
      and that that adding therapy for HP in those children will improve the response to iron
      deficiency.

      This is a prospective randomized control study which will be conducted at six large
      ambulatory pediatrics clinics from the Jerusalem district. All of the children diagnosed with
      IDA would be eligible to join the study after informed consent will be obtained. Ethics
      committee approval is obtained. Analysis of stool samples will be carried out by the HP Stool
      antigen EIA (HpSA, Premier Platinum HpSA, Meridian Diagnostics inc, Cincinnati, OH, USA). All
      children enrolled will be treated with standard Fe therapy. Children with positive HpSA will
      be randomized, controlled for age and clinic, to receive or not receive antibiotics
      treatment. Assessment of response to iron therapy will be done at eight weeks later. The
      prevalence of HP infection in children with diagnosed with IDA would be reported. Statistical
      analysis will compare the baseline data between HP-positive and -negative children and the
      response to Fe between the three study groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All of the children diagnosed with IDA at six large ambulatory pediatrics clinics from
             the Jerusalem district.

          -  The diagnosis of IDA would be defined as a low hemoglobin level in the presence of
             iron deficiency (low iron levels, high transferrin saturation and/or low ferritin).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with clinical symptoms fo Helicobacter Pylori, i.e. abdominal pain, peptic
             ulcer etc.

          -  Children with underlying chronic disease needing medical treatment.
