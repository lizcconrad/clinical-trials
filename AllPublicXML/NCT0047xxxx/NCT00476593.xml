  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an established technology which enables a
      detailed cross-sectional visualization of the retinal micro-anatomy, and an objective
      measurement of its thickness in-vivo. Multifocal electroretinogram (MfERG) measures function
      of the central retina. Both technologies are relatively new and they provide complimentary to
      each other information on retinal anatomy and function.

      The aims of this study is to establish normal ranges for OCT and mfERG measurements related
      to age, gender and reproductive factors such as parity and the use of contraception in
      Norwegians; to assess the presumably healthy central retina with the use of anti-inflammatory
      medication with relation to age and sex ; to study the frequency and extent of retinal
      thickening and change in retinal function in patients with anterior uveitis not complicated
      with macular edema; to assess whether the presence of the HLA-B27 haplotype or uveitis
      recidive affects macular thickening/function in uveitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Multifocal electroretinogram (MfERG)
      measurements may vary with race, age, sex, parity and the use of hormone therapy in health.
      It has therefore been recommended to gather normative data on the individual OCT/MfERG
      equipment in each laboratory. This is the reason why we gathered our local normative material
      on both machines. We also assessed our normative material on the OCT in relation to age, sex,
      parity and the use of contraception for future matching with patients.

      It has been hypothesized that para-inflammation states are involved in retinal aging in
      health. We assume that the age-related changes we observed in our normative OCT material are
      related to low-grade chronic inflammation in the retina. We therefore assessed the effect of
      to commercially available anti-inflammatory eye drops- diclofenac and dexamethasone,which are
      often used in inflammation-related states in ophthalmology for their effect on macular
      thickness in health and with aging.

      Uveitis is a frank intraocular inflammation which may lead to macular edema. Macular edema is
      often transient in uveitis and its presence has been previously reported in severe or
      long-lasting uveitis. In some cases mecular edema may become chronic or refractory to
      treatment. However, whether uncomplicated anterior uveitis with no clinically evident macular
      edema leads to macular thickening detectable with the OCT, or whether monolateral uveitis may
      cause bilateral macular thickening is not known. We therefore assesed both eyes of patients
      with anterior uveitis for macular thickening with the OCT.

      To correlate macular anatomy with its function some subjects included in the OCT study were
      also examined with the mfERG. However, at present the MfERG result have not been analyzed.

      <recruitment_details>Healthy subjects were recruited from students and staff at St. Olavs University Hospital and NTU for ophthalmic examination at the Department of Ophthalmology and mfERG testing at NTU, May 05- Sept. 07. From Sept.07 -sept.08 patients with uveitis were recruited from the Dep. of Opthalmology, healthy volunteers- both for OCT examination at the Dep.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>We chose to focus primary on the OCT results because mfERG equipement was moved and its software was updated. MfERG results will be analyzed later. The main reason for participant exclusion in this study was either bad OCT scan quality or participant withdrawal because examinations turned out to be more time consuming then they thought.</pre_assignment_details>
