      Oligoanalgesia1 has been widely recognized as an issue in emergency department.The purpose of
      our study is to assess the impact of the implementation of a computer-assisted support
      program to improve pain management in our ED.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate pain management remains a major challenge for health care providers. Despite
      extensive research on the mechanisms of acute pain, identification of factors leading to poor
      pain management and development of evidence-based strategies, the transfer of this knowledge
      into effective clinical practices has been surprisingly slow. Oligoanalgesia1 has been widely
      recognized as an issue in emergency department (ED) patients. Acute pain is reported by
      60-80% of ED inpatients but is frequently undertreated. Overall, an insufficient proportion
      of patients with acute pain receive any type of analgesia, and pain relief remains
      unsatisfactory. We showed that the implementation of guidelines improved pain management.
      However, rotation of the medical &amp; nursing staff leads to the forgetting of guidelines. The
      purpose of our study is to assess the impact of the implementation of a computer-assisted
      support program to improve pain management in our ED.

    <description>at the end of the pre-intervention period, the patient flow software was modified to open popup windows automatically when pain intensity was not documented or pain was not reevaluated within the recommended interval. The popup window also detailed appropriate pain treatment guidelines based on the documented pain intensity. In addition, the patient's icon in the flow software changed from black to red when pain intensity was &gt;4/10. After a 10-day test period, the post-intervention data collection started.</description>
