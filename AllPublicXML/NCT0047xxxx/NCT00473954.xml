  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer may be caused by a build-up of genetic defects, or damaged genes within the
      body's cells. When genes are damaged, the body may be unable to produce a group of proteins,
      called cytokines, used by the immune system to fight cancer and some infections. The
      investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 contains the human gene for the cytokine
      interleukin-12 (IL-12) in a special carrier system designed to enter the cells and help the
      body to produce cytokines. Therefore, the purpose of the EGEN-001 therapy is to attempt to
      enhance the body's natural ability to recognize and fight cancer cells. Funding Source - FDA

      This study has two purposes:

        -  To determine what different strengths and number of doses of EGEN-001, administered
           directly into the peritoneal cavity, can be given safely in combination with standard
           intravenous chemotherapy for ovarian cancer

        -  To evaluate the anti-cancer activity of EGEN-001 when combined with standard
           chemotherapy; biological markers of EGEN-001 activity will be collected and ovarian
           cancer burden will be evaluated per standard practice.

    <description>In stage 1, patients will receive standard doses of IV carboplatin and docetaxel for 2 treatment cycles with a 3 week interval. Patients will also receive 4 IP infusions of EGEN-001 at 12mg/m2 EGEN-001, 18mg/m2, or 24mg/m2, 10-11 days apart.
Stage 2 of the study will involve cycle escalation at the highest EGEN-001 dose identified from Stage 1. All patients will receive up to 8 doses of EGEN-001, 10-11 days apart plus up to 4 IV carboplatin and docetaxel cycles with 3 week intervals. After receiving the assigned number of treatments of EGEN-001, carboplatin, and docetaxel, patients may continue to receive up to 4 additional infusions of EGEN-001 and 2 IV carboplatin and docetaxel cycles with 3 week intervals.</description>
