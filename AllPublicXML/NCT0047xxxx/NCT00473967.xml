  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Na-ASP-2 is a protein expressed during the larval stage of the N. americanus hookworm life
      cycle. Vaccination with recombinant ASP-2 has protected dogs and hamsters from infection in
      challenge studies. In a clinical study in hookworm-uninfected adults in the USA, Na-ASP-2
      Hookworm Vaccine was safe and immunogenic. This study will evaluate its safety and
      immunogenicity in individuals living in an area of endemic hookworm infection.
