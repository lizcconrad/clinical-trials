    <textblock>
      26 subjects will be enrolled into 5 different dose groups. The trial will consist of a
      screening, a dosing and a follow-up visit.

      Dosing at visit 2, of MKC253 Inhalation Powder, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) will be given
      at 5 dose levels.

      This Phase 1a , single-dose trial incorporates an open-label, ascending dose strategy to
      determine the safety &amp; tolerability of MKC253 (GLP1/TechnosphereÂ®)Inhalation Powder.

      The trial consists of a screening, dosing and a follow-up visit. Single dose administration
      of MKC253 occurs at the dosing visit. Five doses are being assessed: 0.05, 0.45, 0.75, 1.05 &amp;
      1.5 mg GLP-1. Dosing of each ascending cohort will occur after the Principal Investigator has
      reviewed all safety/tolerability data
