  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cefepime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in treating CAPD peritonitis. However, medical
      knowledge has been lacking with regard to its pharmacokinetic profile after it has been
      administered intraperitoneally. The current study aims at determining the drug level at
      different time after the drug has been added into the peritoneal fluid in patients with CAPD
      peritonitis. The results of this study will finally leads to rational prescription of this
      drug at correct dosages.

        4 males and 2 females, of age 57.83 +/-11.63 years with urinary creatinine clearance of
        0.87+/-2.06ml/min/1.73m2 and admitted for CAPD peritonitis were enrolled. After collection
        of peritoneal dialysate for cell count and microbiological work-up, all subjects were
        loaded with 2g cefepime IP and dwelled for 6 hours. This was followed by 250mg cefepime in
        each subsequent 6-hourly peritoneal dialysis exchange. Plasma cefepime levels were
        determined at time 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hrs. Pharmacokinetic analyses
        were then performed.
