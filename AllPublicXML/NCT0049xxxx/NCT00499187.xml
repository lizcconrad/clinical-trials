        Inclusion Criteria - Fanconi Cases

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation
        in this study.

          -  Adult (greater than or equal to 18 years) HIV-1 infected subjects regardless of race
             or ethnicity.

          -  Subjects must be on a stable ARV regimen for greater than or equal to 1 month prior to
             study entry.

          -  Evidence of protocol-defined Fanconi syndrome

          -  TDF subjects must be on TDF-containing regimen at the time of onset of Fanconi
             syndrome.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (females of child-bearing potential only).

          -  Less than two years post-menopausal women of child-bearing potential (TDF subjects
             only) agree to follow an adequate birth control barrier method or agree to abstain
             from heterosexual intercourse while participating in the study.

          -  The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be
             obtained prior to initiation of any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria - Fanconi Cases

        Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this
        study.

          -  Non TDF subjects who have received any TDF within the prior 6 months, or those who
             have received greater than 2 weeks cumulative treatment.

          -  TDF subjects who have previously served as a TDF control for this protocol.

          -  History of current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to
             potentially interfere with laboratory results.

        Inclusion Criteria - Controls

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation
        in this study.

          -  Adult (greater than or equal to 18 years) HIV-1 infected subjects regardless of race
             or ethnicity.

          -  No evidence of protocol-defined Fanconi syndrome

          -  On a TDF-containing regimen matched to a Fanconi case by clinic location, duration on
             TDF and age.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (females of child-bearing potential only).

          -  The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be
             obtained prior to initiation of any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria - Controls

        Subjects who meet the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this study.

        â€¢ History of current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially
