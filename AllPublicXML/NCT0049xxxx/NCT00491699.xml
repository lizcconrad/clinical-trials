  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of XL999 and how well subjects with
      Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer tolerate XL999. XL999 is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple
      kinases including VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, FLT-3, and Src, which are involved in tumor cell
      growth, formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and metastasis.

    <description>XL999 will be administered as a once-weekly 4 hour IV infusion as a single agent. The first cohort will be dosed at 0.4 mg/kg IV once weekly. The maximum dose cohort will not exceed 1.6 mg/kg IV once weekly. Ten subjects are planned for each dosing cohort, with dose escalation dependent on safety and available PK data from prior cohorts</description>

                    -  Active or unstable ischemic disease, including angina pectoris, myocardial
                       infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) within the past 12
                       months.
