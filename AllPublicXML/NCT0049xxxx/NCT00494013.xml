    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and safety of insulin lispro
      protamine suspension (ILPS) as compared to insulin detemir as basal insulin therapy in adults
      with type 2 diabetes. A gatekeeper strategy will be employed for sequentially testing the
      secondary objectives.

             according to the local package insert; Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)--30 mg/day
             pioglitazone or 4 mg/day rosiglitazone.
