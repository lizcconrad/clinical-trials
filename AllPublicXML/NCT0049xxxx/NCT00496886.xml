  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disabling chronic disorder characterized by widespread muscle pain,
      fatigue, and multiple tender points, specific places on the body that become painful with
      only slight pressure. Pain associated with FM cannot be explained medically, often leading to
      a delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the
      nervous system, specifically the brain, processes pain in women with FM.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cause of FM remains unknown, and more than half of all FM patients do not experience
      adequate pain relief from current treatment. Identifying the mechanisms of unexplained pain
      in people with FM is necessary to develop more beneficial treatments. One possible cause of
      FM may be associated with problems in how the body processes pain. People with FM appear to
      be hypersensitive to stimuli that normally are not painful. Specifically, the brain and
      spinal cord may not signal sensations correctly, resulting in abnormal pain sensations. This
      study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how pain is processed
      in the brain of adults with FM compared with adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), another
      chronic disease characterized by long-term pain with a known cause. This study will also
      determine the effect that anticipation and attention have on the processing of nonpainful
      stimuli in women with FM and RA. Both groups of people will also be compared to a control
      group of healthy people.

      Participants in this study will include only women. This study will include two study visits
      that will occur on separate days. Each study visit will last from 2 to 3 hours. During the
      first study visit, participants will complete questionnaires. They will then rate heat
      stimuli applied to their hand and perform mental tasks while in a mock MRI machine. The
      mental tasks will consist of naming the color of words. Some participants will receive
      nonpainful heat stimuli; others will receive both painful and nonpainful heat stimuli. During
      the second study visit, participants will undergo the exact same procedures while in an
      actual MRI machine. There will be no follow-up visits for this study.
