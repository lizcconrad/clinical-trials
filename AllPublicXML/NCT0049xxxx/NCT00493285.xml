  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the MEDI-534 clinical development program is to evaluate the safety,
      efficacy and tolerability of MEDI-534 for the prevention of serious RSV and PIV3 disease in
      young infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety and tolerability of multiple
      doses of MEDI-534 at 10^4, 10^5, or 10^6 TCID50 when administered to RSV and PIV3
      seronegative children 6 to &lt;24 months of age.
