      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and the maximum tolerated
      dose of Conformal or Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy when given in combination with
      gefitinib 250mg in Chinese patients with IIIB or IV NSCLC after failure of platinum-based
      chemotherapy.

      Secondary objectives of the study are to obtain the preliminary information on efficacy after
      concomitant treatment of gefitinib 250mg and radiotherapy in Chinese patients with IIIB or IV
      NSCLC after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy, as measured by RECIST criteria.

      To determine the pattern of failure (e.g., local, regional, or distant metastasis) in
      patients treated with this regimen.

    <textblock>
      Laboratory research has suggested that targeting specific signalling proteins would be well
      suited for selectively enhancing the tumor radiosensitivity. In human xenograft models
      (non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer) treated with gefitinib and irradiation,
      combined therapy has shown a significant increase in tumor growth delay as compared with
      monotherapy of irradiation or gefitinib. The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor ZD1839 selectively potentiates radiation response of human tumors in nude mice,
      with a marked improvement in therapeutic index. The authors concluded that gefitinib
      profoundly enhanced the antitumor action of RT against the tested tumors without significant
      adverse effects, increasing the therapeutic selectively of ionizing radiation in certain
      model systems. Substantial benefits for this multimodality therapy in patients could be
      expected.

      While there are no published data on the feasibility and efficacy of combined gefitinib and
      radiation therapy in Chinese population who might be susceptible to gefitinib monotherapy,
      clinical studies have demonstrated that combining gefitinib with external beam radiation to
      66-74Gy and concurrent weekly chemotherapy after induction chemotherapy were tolerated
      without excessive toxicity. In the present trail, we hope to build on our own experience of
      using combined gefitinib and thoracic radiation with 3D-CRT or intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) technique in a phase I setting for stage IIIb and selected stage IV
      NSCLC. We will follow this treatment (RT and gefitinib) with 60 days gefitinib at standard
      systemic doses.

    <description>Thoracic RT for patients will start from 54Gy, and then escalate dose at 2Gy increment to 60Gy. At each dose level, 8 patients are required to complete RT without dose limiting toxicity(DLT). Evaluation will be done after 8 patients have completed the treatment.If there are &gt;=2 DLT in the first 8 patients, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved. If there is a single DLT revealed, an additional 8 patients will be recruited to that dose level. Should there be severe complication occurred again be at least 1 more DLT, then MTD is thought to be achieved.Hence,MTD will be achieved if at least 2 out of the first 8 patients have a DLT,or if a further 8 patents are recruited, &gt;=2 out of 16 patients have a DLT. Concurrent with RT, patients will be given gefitinib 250 mg/day PO as well as same dose PO for 60 days after the completion of RT.</description>
