  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether urinary PGE-M levels correlate with Crohn's
      disease activity and to compare how well urinary PGE-M correlates with other non-invasive
      biomarkers of disease activity such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin.

      The available clinical measures of Crohn's disease activity can be overly influenced by
      functional symptoms. Placebo response rates in clinical trials are high. Several non-invasive
      biomarkers are currently available for assessing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) disease
      activity including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin.
      Although these markers hold some promise, their performance is less than ideal. What is
      needed is a simple, non-invasive, biologic measure of Crohn's disease.

      Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and is expressed in
      epithelial inflammatory conditions and some cancers. We have developed an assay to quantify
      the major urinary metabolite of PGE2, PGE-M. PGE-M has been previously shown to be elevated
      in the urine of patients with advanced colorectal neoplasia relative to controls.
