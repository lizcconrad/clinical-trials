      The Effects of N-Acetylcysteine on Oxidative Stress in Chronic Hepatitis C

      Objective:

      There is evidence that suggests oxidative stress plays a role in the pathologic mechanism of
      disease progression in chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). This study will test the
      hypothesis that N-acetylcysteine given over one month will decrease oxidative stress and thus
      slow disease progression.

      Background:

      Chronic hepatitis C is the most common blood borne infection in the United States. An average
      of 230,000 new infections occurred each year during the 1980s, although since 1989 the annual
      number of new infections has declined by greater than 80% to 36,000 by 1996.1,2,3 A CDC
      survey in 2003 showed that annual new cases had declined to 30,000.4 The Third National
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conducted during 1988-1994, indicated
      that an estimated 3.9 million (1.8%) Americans have been infected with HCV. In the general
      population, the highest prevalence rates of HCV infection are found among persons aged 30-49
      years and among males. Unlike the racial/ethnic pattern of acute disease, African Americans
      have a substantially higher prevalence of HCV infection than do whites.5 Population-based
      studies indicate that 40% of chronic liver disease is HCV-related, resulting in estimated
      deaths of 8,000-10,000 each year. According to the CDC, estimated medical and work-loss costs
      of HCV-related acute and chronic liver disease are greater than $600 million annually, and
      HCV-associated end-stage liver disease is the most frequent indication for liver
      transplantation among adults.1

      After an acute infection, chronic HCV infection develops in most persons (75%-85%). 6 The
      course of chronic HCV is insidious, progressing at a slow rate without symptoms or physical
      signs in the majority of patients during the first two or more decades. Cirrhosis develops in
      10%-20% of persons with chronic HCV over a period of 20-30 years, and hepatocellular cancer
      in 1%-5%.7

      HCV replicates in the hepatocytes, but it is not directly hepatotoxic. Lymphocytes recognize
      infected cells and initiate an immune response. Damage to the liver parenchyma is mediated by
      inflammatory cytokines, although the mechanism of disease progression is not clearly
      understood. Jain et al. and Pratico et al. have shown that oxidative stress may be a factor
      in progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis.8,9 It is believed that oxidative stress occurs via
      various mechanisms including the reduction of NAD to NADH that causes a redox change and
      inhibition of xanthine dehydrogenase activity resulting in a shift of purine oxidation to
      xanthine oxidase, thereby promoting the generation of oxygen-free radical species. A
      depletion in glutathione (GSH) has also been found in chronic liver disease which impairs
      defense against oxidative stress.10 Several other studies have attempted to evaluate for
      oxidative stress associated with HCV, but until recently accurate markers for evaluation of
      oxidative stress had not been determined. Studies attempting to treat chronic HCV with
      interferon and antioxidant combination have been inconclusive due inability to appropriately
      measure oxidative stress.11, 12

      Guha et al. discuss that for a long time, assessment of lipid peroxidation in vivo was
      restricted to tissue measurements of alkanes, malondialdehyde, or hydroxynonenal levels, all
      of which have serious limitation in accurately assessing oxidative stress. Roberts and
      coworkers discovered a series of novel prostaglandins, now termed F2-isoprostanes, which are
      now considered the gold standard for assessment of oxidative injury in vivo. These
      prostaglandins are formed initially in situ by oxidation of arachidonic acid containing
      phospholipids, and then released by the action of phospholipase. These can be measured in
      plasma or urine samples by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry or ELISA.13-16
      Recently, Dr. Vallyathan's group in West Virginia demonstrated that total antioxidant status,
      glutathione peroxidase, and isoprostane levels were increased in shipyard welders consistent
      with oxidative stress secondary to their occupational exposures.17

      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a precursor of reduced GSH. It is an acetylated form of amino acid
      L-cysteine, and is an excellent source of sulfhydryl groups. It is converted in the body into
      metabolites capable of stimulating GSH synthesis, promoting detoxification, and acting
      directly as free radical scavengers. It has been used clinically for more than 30 years
      primarily as a monolithic. It is now commonly used for pre-treatment to prevent renal injury
      secondary to intravenous dye in patients with renal insufficiency. It is also a mainstay of
      treatment in cases of acetaminophen overdose since the 1980s. In this time period, NAC has
      been shown to be safe without any significant toxicity or side-effects.18 Other studies have
      shown that NAC can prevent apoptosis and promote cell survival. It reduces endothelial
      dysfunction, inflammation, fibrosis, cartilage erosion, and transplant prolongation.19 It has
      also been useful in improving ischemia-reperfusion related liver injury, cocaine and methanol
      related liver injury.20-23

      Considering the above information, it would be worthwhile to evaluate the baseline oxidative
      stress in patients with hepatitis C and note changes, if any after NAC treatment for 6
      months. There have been no prospective studies thus far that have evaluated baseline
      oxidative stress in Hep C patients on and off interferon treatments with evaluation of
      F2-isoprostanes and followed up on lab markers after treatment with NAC.

      Research design:

      Ten patients with HCV proven by PCR, not on treatment, will be recruited from the VA GI
      clinic patient population. Background data will be gathered from the charts and by a
      questionnaire. Blood for baseline liver function tests including serum ferritin, serum
      isoprostane, serum aconitase, plasma glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and
      total antioxidant status (TAS), will be obtained in all patients. These tests will be
      repeated in each patient after 15 days and 1 month of NAC at 1000 mg by mouth twice a day.
      Tests will again be repeated 30 days after stopping the study medication. Hep c mRNA will be
      measured at baseline and at 30 days. The research protocol will be explained to the patient
      and informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment. For the volunteers travel expenses
      and time, $25 will be given at the beginning and end of the study for participation.

      Inclusion criteria will be as follows: Volunteers will be divided into 2 groups: healthy
      patients and HCV patients not on interferon. Exclusion criteria will be as follows:
      significantly decompensated liver cirrhosis of Child's Class C, patients with evidence of
      liver mass or hepatocellular cancer. Patients who are pregnant or on antioxidant such at
      Vitamin E or Vitamin C will also be excluded. Also patients with known allergy to
      N-acetylcysteine will be excluded

      Sample Size calculation:

      Since each patient will be his own control ( reducing the potential confounding of age,

      smoking, medicine, life style etc )assuming variance of 5% in the assay system of the
      biomarkers, 15 patients will give 90% power to see 10% or more difference in aggregate level
      of the oxidant biomarkers.

      Statistical Analyses:

      Baseline demographic (age, sex) and clinical data (symptoms, Child's Classification) will be
      collected for each patient. This data will be compared between the three groups using
      Student's t-test for continuous variables and either Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for
      non-parametric variables. The measured laboratory values in the three groups, for the
      baseline and post N-acetylcysteine, will be compared by using the paired t-test.
