      RATIONALE: Garlic supplements may alter the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone, thereby affecting
      its effectiveness as an opioid analgesic for the relief of moderate or severe pain.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase 4 trial is studying how garlic supplements may change the
      pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and its analgesic and side effects in healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether CYP3A (Cytochrome P450 3A) and/or P-glycoprotein mediated
           interactions exist between garlic supplements and oxycodone (a commonly used oral opioid
           analgesic) in healthy volunteers.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a single-blind, randomized, crossover study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2
      arms. Each arm entails two 30-day treatment periods, with a washout of at least 4 weeks in
      between.

        -  Arm I: In Period 1, participants receive oral garlic powder twice daily on days 1-28 and
           oral oxycodone on day 28. In Period 2, participants receive oral placebo twice daily on
           days 1-28 and oral oxycodone on day 28.

        -  Arm II: In Period 1, participants receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-28 and oral
           oxycodone on days 28. In Period 2, participants receive oral garlic powder twice daily
           on days 1-28 and oral oxycodone on day 28.

      In both periods of each arm, participants receive a combination of oral midazolam and oral
      digoxin for CYP3A and P-glycoprotein phenotyping on day 29. Blood samples are collected
      periodically and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

      Blood and urine samples are collected after receiving oxycodone for pharmacokinetic
      characterization. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its metabolites are measured by
      LC-MS.

      Response to experimentally induced pain by the Cold Pressor Test (CPT) is assessed at
      baseline and periodically after oxycodone treatment. Subjective ratings of opioid side
      effects are assessed by validated questionnaires for somatic side effects and cognitive
      function impairments.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxycodone Oral Clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>Serial blood sampling over 24 hours after a 15-mg oral dose of oxycodone</time_frame>
    <description>Oxycodone oral clearance is computed by Dose/AUC, where AUC is the area under the plasma oxycodone concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity. Oral clearance is a measure of the rate at which oxycodone is cleared from the body via metabolism.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cold Pressor Tolerance AUC</measure>
    <time_frame>Repeated testing for tolerance to Cold Pressor Test just before and at 45, 90, 150 and 300 min after a single 15-mg oral dose of oxycodone</time_frame>
    <description>Cold Pressor Test measures response to experimentally induced pain, in this case by immersion of a subject's hand in icy-cold water. Tolerance is the duration of time a subject is able to keep his/her hand immersed in the cold water. A prolongation in tolerance time indicates analgesic response to oxycodone treatment. Cold Pressor Tolerance AUC is the area under the tolerance versus time curve over a 300-min period after a test dose of oxycodone. Because of non-normality in sample distribution, log transformed AUC estimates were analyzed by Generalized Linear Model.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Somatic Side Effects Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>SSE scores at 150 min after a single 15-mg oral dose of oxycodone</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated the bodily side effects they experienced at 90, 150 and 300 min after oxycodone administration on a 35-item Somatic Side Effects (SSE) questionnaire. Total score (i.e., average of the scores for all 35 items) ranges on a numerical scale from 0 (no somatic side effects) to a maximum of 4 (extreme somatic aide effects). Only the peak SSE scores at 150 min are reported herein.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive-Affective Side Effects Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>CASE scores at 150 min after a single 15-mg oral dose of oxycodone</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated the mental side effects they experienced at 90, 150 and 300 min after oxycodone administration on a 36-item Cognitive-Affective Side Effects (CASE) questionnaire. Total score (i.e., average of the scores for all 36 items) ranges on a numerical scale from 0 (no somatic side effects) to a maximum of 4 (extreme somatic aide effects). Only the peak CASE scores at 150 min are reported herein.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral Midazolam Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Serial blood sampling over 6 hours after a 5-mg oral test dose of midazolam</time_frame>
    <description>Midazolam when given orally is a probe substrate for the in vivo intestinal and hepatic activity of CYP3A (Cytochrome P450 3A) enzymes. The phenotype index in this case is the area under the plasma midazolam concentration from time zero to 360 min after a 5-mg oral test dose. A decrease in oral midazolam AUC indicates enhanced activity of CYP3A enzymes, possibly as a result of enzyme induction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral Digoxin Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Serial blood sampling over 4 hours after a 0.5-mg oral test dose of digoxin</time_frame>
    <description>Digoxin when given orally is a probe substrate for the efflux activity of P-glycoprotein in the small intestine. The phenotype index in this case is the area under the plasma digoxin concentration from time zero to 240 min after a 0.5-mg oral test dose. A decrease in oral digoxin AUC indicates an enhanced activity of P-glycoprotein, possibly as a result of transporter upregulation.</description>

        <title>Cold Pressor Tolerance AUC</title>
        <description>Cold Pressor Test measures response to experimentally induced pain, in this case by immersion of a subject's hand in icy-cold water. Tolerance is the duration of time a subject is able to keep his/her hand immersed in the cold water. A prolongation in tolerance time indicates analgesic response to oxycodone treatment. Cold Pressor Tolerance AUC is the area under the tolerance versus time curve over a 300-min period after a test dose of oxycodone. Because of non-normality in sample distribution, log transformed AUC estimates were analyzed by Generalized Linear Model.</description>

        <title>Oral Midazolam Test</title>
        <description>Midazolam when given orally is a probe substrate for the in vivo intestinal and hepatic activity of CYP3A (Cytochrome P450 3A) enzymes. The phenotype index in this case is the area under the plasma midazolam concentration from time zero to 360 min after a 5-mg oral test dose. A decrease in oral midazolam AUC indicates enhanced activity of CYP3A enzymes, possibly as a result of enzyme induction.</description>
