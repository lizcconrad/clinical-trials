  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the World. In China, gastric
      cancer exceeds all other cancer mortality except lung cancer. Helicobacter pylori infection
      is an important cause of gastric cancer. We have previously started a randomized
      placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial in Changle in 1994 to address the issue of whether
      eradication of H. pylori alone is able to prevent or reduce the risk of gastric cancer. The
      project involved 1600 subjects and is still ongoing. On the other hand, our laboratory
      research indicated that an abnormally high expression of an enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 was found
      in gastric cancer and inhibition of this enzyme by a new drug (specific cyclooxygenase-2
      inhibitor) could kill the cancer cells. The same drug is approved now for use in treatment of
      hereditary colon cancer syndrome (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, FAP), in the same rationale
      of tumour suppressive property of this drug. We are now initiating a second chemoprevention
      study to assess the addition of this specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor together with
      eradication of H. pylori on prevention or reduction of the risk of gastric cancer and to
      assess whether the combination can reverse pre-cancerous lesions in the stomach in the
      high-risk population. The proposed site is Shangdong, China with very high prevalence of
      pre-cancerous lesions in asymptomatic H. pylori carriers. We plan to recruit 1500 H. pylori
      positive subjects for this randomized placebo-controlled study. H. pylori carriers will be
      randomized to receive treatment for the infection or placebo, followed by specific COX-2
      inhibitor or placebo for 3 years. The results will have significant impact on prevention of
      gastric cancer on a national scale and worldwide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject demonstrates a willingness to participate in the study as indicated by written
             informed consent.

          2. Male or female subject is at least 45 years of age.

          3. Subject indicates a willingness to abstain from the use of all NSAIDs (including
             over-the-counter products) and aspirin for the duration of the study.

          4. Female subject of childbearing potential has been using an effective means of
             contraception for 1 week prior to the preliminary visit. She also has agreed to remain
             abstinent, or to use oral birth control pills or single-barrier contraception (partner
             using condom or subject using diaphragm, contraceptive sponge or IUD) beginning at the
             preliminary visit and continuing till the end of the study. Women who are
             postmenopausal or status post-hysterectomy or tubal ligation are exempt from this
             requirement. (Postmenopausal is defined as no menses for the previous 1 year. If
             cessation of menses is within 18 months, FSH must be documented as elevated into the
             postmenopausal range before entry).

          5. Subject is judged to be in stable health based on medical history, physical
             examination, and routine laboratory tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        According to medical history

          1. Subject has a bleeding diathesis or requires anticoagulant therapy.

          2. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension. (Note: Subjects with medically controlled
             hypertension [diastolic blood pressure &lt;95 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure &lt;165 mm Hg]
             may participate.)

          3. Subject has a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack within the past 2 years.

          4. Subject has a history of hepatitis/hepatic disease that has been active within the
             previous 2 years.

          5. Subject has angina or congestive heart failure, with symptoms that occur at rest or
             minimal activity, or has a history of myocardial infarction within the past 1 year.

          6. Subject has a history of neoplastic disease within the previous 10 years. Exceptions:
             subjects with malignancy successfully treated &gt;10 years prior to screening, where, in
             the judgment of the investigator and treating physician, there has been no evidence of
             recurrence from the time of treatment through the time of screening.

          7. Subject has a history of esophageal or gastric surgery.

          8. Subject has undergone previous small or large bowel resection.

          9. Subject has a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's

             of the syndrome of nasal polyps, angioedema, and bronchospastic reactivity) to
             aspirin, paracetamol, or other NSAIDs. NOTE: Subjects with a history of idiosyncratic
             allergic reaction (e.g., rash) to a single NSAID in the past but who tolerated at
             least 2 other NSAID medications without hypersensitivity reactions may participate.

         11. Subject is expected to need chronic NSAID treatment during the trial and/or subject
             has been taking NSAIDs (including salicylates or other aspirin-containing compounds)
             on a chronic basis.

         12. Subject has had ongoing or is expected to require treatment with any of the following:
             Ticlopidine, clopidrogel, or regular doses of aspirin, including &quot;low-dose&quot; aspirin,
             e.g., to prevent complications of vascular disease. Subjects may not discontinue an
             established course of anti-platelet therapy in order to enter this study.
