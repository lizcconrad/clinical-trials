  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will introduce a Clinical Decision Unit (CDU) into the
      University of Alberta Hospital Emergency Department(ED)and assess the influence on ED length
      of stay, patients who leave without being seen, and other ED Overcrowding outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place over a 6-week period that will be spilt into three-two-week blocks.
      Using computerized blocks of 2 weeks, days of the week will be randomly allocated so that
      each day of the week receives one intervention (CDU) and one control day for the study
      period. The CDU involves transforming an ED bed location to a 6-chair internal waiting room
      with 2 adjacent beds assigned to act as assessment and treatment locations. Patients will
      transition between the chair and stretcher to optimize the use of ED space.
