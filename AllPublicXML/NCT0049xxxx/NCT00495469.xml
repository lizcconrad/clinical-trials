    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The blood samples were collected at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and at Week 12 (or early withdrawal). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. The primary analysis was performed on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population with Last observation carried forward (LOCF). Adjusted mean is presented as least square (LS) mean.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (Glycosylated Hemoglobin) (HbA1c) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The blood samples were collected at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and at Week 12 (or early withdrawal). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. The primary analysis was performed on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population with Last observation carried forward (LOCF). Adjusted mean is presented as least square (LS) mean.</description>

          <description>The blood samples were collected at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and at Week 12 (or early withdrawal). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 4 and 8 minus Baseline value. The primary analysis was performed on the ITT Population with LOCF.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Fructosamine (Corrected)</title>
        <description>The blood samples were collected at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 14 (follow up). Participants were asked to be on fast for at least 8 hours prior to each study visits and collection of lab samples. Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. The primary analysis was performed on the ITT Population with LOCF. Adjusted mean is presented as LS mean.</description>

The proportion of participants who achieved the target of &lt;5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) at Week 12 within each treatment group were summarized only.

        <description>Samples were collected at Baseline and at Week 12 (or early withdrawal). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean is presented as LS mean.</description>

        <description>Samples were collected at Baseline and at Week 12 (or early withdrawal). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean is presented as LS mean.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-c)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline and at Week 12 (or early withdrawal). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean is presented as LS mean.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in LDL-c/HDL-c Ratio</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Baseline and at Week 12 (or early withdrawal). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean is presented as LS mean.</description>

        <description>Body weight measurement was taken at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and at Week 14 (follow up). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean is presented as LS mean.</description>
