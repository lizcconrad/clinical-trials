  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATN 062 is designed to gain scientific knowledge of microbicide-use adherence, acceptability,
      and attitudes among sexually active young women
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATN 062 will take place in parallel to another study, MTN 004, &quot;Phase I Study of the Safety
      and Acceptability of 3% w/w SPL7013 Gel (VivaGel™) Applied Vaginally in Sexually Active Young
      Women.&quot; ATN 062 will use quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative
      method will consist of a computerized diary used by participants during the 14 days of the
      gel trial of MTN 004. The qualitative methods will include email messages sent by
      participants to a research assistant as a supplement to the diaries, as well as in-depth
      interviews through teleconferences to contextualize the recorded events. All study activities
      will be timed to coincide with those of MTN 004
