  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TH-302 in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. TH-302 is a hypoxia activated product designed to exploit the hypoxic
      nature of tumors. The study is designed to establish the safety including the maximum
      tolerated dose, the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-tumor activity of TH-302.

             for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C)

          -  Patients who participated in an investigational drug or device study within 28 days
             prior to study entry

          -  Patients who have exhibited allergic reactions to a similar structural compound,
