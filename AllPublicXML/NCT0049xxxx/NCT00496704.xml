      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine when
      given together with capecitabine and oxaliplatin as second-line therapy and to see how well
      it works in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer previously treated with
      irinotecan.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Define the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine
           hydrochloride when administered with capecitabine and oxaliplatin as second-line therapy
           in patients with advanced colorectal cancer previously treated with irinotecan
           hydrochloride. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride in these patients.
           (Phase I)

        -  Assess overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Assess the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Assess the time to treatment failure, duration of response, and time to response in
           patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Assess the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Assess the safety of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride,
      followed by a phase II, open-label study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8,
           oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.
           Courses repeat every 21 days.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride at the MTD determined in phase I
           and capecitabine and oxaliplatin as in phase I.
