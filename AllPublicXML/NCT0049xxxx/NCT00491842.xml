  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the ways in which people reveal their status as a carrier of
      Huntington s disease (HD) or of being at risk for the disease. It will explore factors that
      influence decisions about disclosure and how disclosure is made to family members, partners,
      and close friends.

      HD is an inherited, progressive disease. It causes nerve degeneration, motor disturbance,
      loss of awareness, and psychiatric symptoms. Currently, no effective treatment is available
      to prevent or delay HD progression. The mean age of onset is 35 to 44 years, and the median
      survival rate after onset is 15 to 18 years. HD affects about 1 in 10,000 people in the
      United States, so about 30,000 have HD and more than 200,000 are at risk. Predictive testing
      for HD has been available since 1993. It can be a life-changing event to learn of being at
      risk for HD. Disclosure has been studied among people with HD and other diseases, but
      knowledge about the extent of nondisclosure and disclosure is limited. There is evidence that
      a person s psychological adaptation to AD may be a factor. Adaptation involves processes that
      help a person search for meaning in what has happened, attempt to gain control of his or her
      life, and improve self-esteem in light of the threatening situation.

      Participants ages 18 and older who have had a positive genetic test result more than 6 months
      earlier regarding HD or who have a family history of HD but no predictive testing and who do
      not have symptoms of HD may be eligible for this study. Recruitment is done through HD
      clinics, support groups, and online websites and mailing listservs. About 260 people will be
      in the study. Participants will complete a survey taking 30 to 40 minutes to do. Two survey
      versions are available: for those who are gene carriers and for those at risk. Participants
      are asked to complete the version applying to them. The survey can be done online or through
      a hard copy to complete at home and send to NIH. This survey is anonymous.

      Participants will list the adults with whom they have a relationship and up to 10 people they
      interact with. They will indicate those who know about the HD gene or risk status. They will
      also list those to whom they have personally made disclosure. The goal is to distinguish if
      knowing the status or the act of disclosure is more important. Questions also involve
      discussing the inheritance and features of HD, and participants feelings or concerns about HD
      gene or risk status. Participants will be asked about their first disclosure experience, most
      recent experience of it, and timing of disclosure the time between learning of HD status and
      telling another person about it. There are also questions on decisions of nondisclosure,
      negative and positive aspects of disclosure for participants, and what health care
      professionals can do to help participants disclosure decisions.

      The proposed study aims to describe presymptomatic and at-risk individuals' patterns of
      disclosure about Huntington's disease (HD) and HD risk to family and friends, and to
      investigate whether an association exists between disclosure about HD and psychological
      adaptation to HD. HD is reported to be one of the conditions most frequently involved in
      cases of nondisclosure about genetic risk. Little is known about the extent of disclosure and
      the process of disclosure within the HD population. Evidence suggests that a relationship may
      exist between disclosure of one's condition to others and psychological adaptation to the
      condition; however, this theory has never been tested. The conceptual framework of the study
      is informed by Shelly Taylor's Theory of Cognitive Adaptation. We will use a cross-sectional
      survey to 1) investigate individuals' patterns of disclosure about HD and 2) assess
      psychological adaptation to HD. Participants will be recruited from HD clinics, HD support
      groups, HD websites, and HD online mailing listservs. Eligible participants will be asked to
      complete either a web-based or a paper survey. The main outcome measure is psychological
      adaptation to HD.
