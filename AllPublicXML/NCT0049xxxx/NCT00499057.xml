  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial breast irradiation (PBI) is becoming more widespread in the treatment of early breast
      cancer in patients at low risk of relapse as pathological and clinical findings have
      demonstrated that most breast cancer recurrences after BCS occur close to the tumour bed. In
      our phase II prospective study PBI is administered with high-dose-rate brachytherapy in
      patients with low-risk early-stage breast cancer. Patients receive 4 Gy twice a day for 4
      days (total dose 32 Gy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in our phase II trial of PBI with interstitial HDR brachytherapy are at
      low-risk of relapse. Implants are positioned during surgery or postoperatively, within 12
      weeks. Treatment schedule is 4 Gy twice a day, with a time relapse of at least 6 hours
      between each fraction, for four days, for a total dose 32 Gy. Before post-operative
      implantation, all patients undergo a breast computed tomography (CT) scan to visualize and
      expand the excision cavity and obtain the planning target volume (PTV), i.e. the lumpectomy
      cavity plus a margin of 1-2 cm around it. Through virtual simulation with a 3D treatment
      planning system (TPS), we define the implant catheter position. After implantation, in all
      patients a breast CT scan checked implant geometry. On CT images transferred to a TPS the
      surgical cavity is outlined and expanded, the PTV defined, and inactive and active source
      lengths measured.CT-based 3D software is used to identify and reconstruct the catheters,
      outline and expand the surgical cavity and obtain the PTV. Dwell positions are activated for
      each catheter, and inactive and active lengths defined.Prescribed dose was 85% of the basal
      dose. Dwell weights are optimised in the basal points applying the volume and distance method
      and best values were chosen independently of strategy. A dose-volume histogram that records
      the volume covered by 100% and 150% of the prescribed dose (V100 and V150) was obtained for
      each patient. DHI, defined as V150 - V100/ V100 (7), is recognized as the most suitable
      quality index.
