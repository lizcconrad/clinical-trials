  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the
      combination of Zactima with metronomic chemotherapy. Zactima is an oral anti-angiogenesis
      drug, which means it fights cancer by cutting off a tumor's blood supply. Thus, the drug
      starves the tumor by preventing the delivery of nutrients and oxygen. Metronomic chemotherapy
      is low dose oral chemotherapy pills which are taken daily. Unlike traditional chemotherapy,
      metronomic chemotherapy is thought to fight cancer like Zactima, by cutting off the blood
      supply to tumors. Because the dose is very low, the side effects are generally mild and very
      different from those with higher dose chemotherapy given by vein.

      -  Each study cycle is 28 days long. Participants will take the study drug, Zactima, by
           mouth once a day. The dose of Zactima the participant will receive will be determined by
           the time when they enroll on the study. They will also take the metronomic chemotherapy
           by mouth. This consists of two drugs: cyclophosphamide and methotrexate.
           Cyclophosphamide is taken every day and methotrexate is taken on days 1 and 2 of each
           week.

        -  A physical exam will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle. Vital signs, including height,
           weight, blood pressure, and temperature will be done on Day 1 of each cycle, as well as
           at week 3 of Cycles 1 and 2.

        -  Electrocardiograms will be performed at various points to assess heart function. This
           will be done at week 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, and then every 3 months for the rest of the
           study.

        -  Routine blood tests will be done on Day 1 of each cycle, as well as at week 3 for the
           first two cycles. Urine tests will be done on Day 1 of each cycle.

        -  An ultrasound will be done at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the Department of Vascular
           Medicine at week 3 and week 7.

        -  Participants will have scans done to assess their tumor every 2 cycles (8 weeks). These
           may include a CT scan, MRI, PET scan, x-rays, and/or bone scans.
