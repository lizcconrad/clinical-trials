  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate a superior efficacy of BDP plus rescue salbutamol suspension for nebulisation,
      compared to placebo plus rescue salbutamol, in the relief of symptoms of asthma in young
      children with persistent symptoms of asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic disease which is estimated to affect over 25 million people both in the
      US and Europe(i.e. approximately 10% of the total population).There is evidence that over the
      last 20 years prevalence has considerably increased, especially among children. The diagnosis
      of asthma in children may be difficult, largely because episodic wheezing and cough are among
      the common symptoms encountered in childhood illnesses, particularly in children under 3
      years old.Although in these young children there is the possibility of over treatment, the
      episodes of wheezing may be reduced in intensity by the effective use of anti-inflammatory
      medications and bronchodilators rather than antibiotics. At present, pharmacological therapy
      is used to treat reversible airway obstruction, inflammation and hyperreactivity in both
      children and adults. Medications include preventive treatments in forms of
      antinflammatory/antiallergic agents (e.g. glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists,
      cromolyn sodium) and reliever treatments, in form of bronchodilators (e.g. β-adrenergic
      agonists, anticholinergics). Comparisons: Beclomethasone suspension for nebulisation (400 mcg
      U.D.V.) plus as needed salbutamol compared to placebo plus as needed salbutamol and to as
      needed salbutamol/beclomethasone fixed combination.

        following criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 1 year and ≤ 4 years.

          -  At least 3 episodes of wheeze or asthma-like symptoms in the 6 months preceding the
             study entry.

          -  A cooperative attitude and ability to be trained to inhale correctly from the device
             and to complete the diary cards.

          -  Written parental/guardian informed consent obtained.

        Patients will be then randomised to the treatment period if they meet all the previous
        criteria plus:

             the following symptoms: wheeze, cough or shortness of breath; or had required at least
             one dose of relief salbutamol.
