      Glucagon-like peptide 1 is known to improve sensitivity of the pancreatic beta-cell. Further
      it inhibit secretion from the pancreatic alpha-cell by mechanisms not fully understand. With
      this study we wish to elucidate the potential of GLP-1 to increase the sensitivity of the
      alpha-cell.

      Type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects receive infusions of GLP-1 in increasing doses
      or saline, alpha- and beta-cell responses are measured in blood-samples. During the study
      plasma-glucose levels are clamped at fasting levels.

      With this study we hope to elucidate the pathophysiology behind defect glucose tolerance in
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and further more the potential of GLP-1 in treatment of type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

      Background: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) possesses insulinotropic and glucagonostatic
      properties, and, therefore, GLP-based antidiabetic therapies have been developed. Even though
      the insulinotropic potency of GLP-1 has been shown to be reduced in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a small dose of GLP-1 is capable of normalizing the beta-cell
      responsiveness to glucose in these patients. The glucagonostatic potency of GLP-1 in patients
      with T2DM is not known, and, furthermore, the capability of GLP-1 to reestablish normal
      glucagon secretion in these patients remains to be elucidated.

      Objective: To investigate the alpha-cell sensitivity to GLP-1 in patients with T2DM and to
      establish if GLP-1 is able to reestablish normal glucagon secretion in such patients.

      Method: Ten patients with T2DM and ten healthy control subjects are clamped at their fasting
      blood glucose levels during GLP-1 infusions at increasing doses (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0
      pmol/kg/min) and placebo, respectively. Furthermore, the patients will be hospitalized
      overnight while receiving intravenous insulin and thereafter examined under normoglycaemic
      conditions. Blood are being drawn for analysis of plasma insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1 and
      glucagon.

      Expected results and conclusions: We expect that GLP-1 will inhibit glucagon secretion in a
      dose dependent manner, leading too an increase in glucose turn-over. The results will
      potentially elucidate the interaction between GLP-1 and glucagon secretion and thereby
      broaden our knowledge on the pathophysiology of T2DM. Furthermore, the present study will
      determine the therapeutic impact of GLP-1 on the alpha-cell deficiency characterizing
      patients with T2DM.
