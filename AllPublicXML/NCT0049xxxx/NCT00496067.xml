             diameter of greater than or equal to 3 cm, and all fibroids with a diameter less than
             or equal to 8cm with a prevailing pathology (e.g., as opposed to adenomyosis) of
             fibroids determined through ultrasound

          -  Symptomatic subject presenting with at least one of the following fibroid symptoms:
             pelvic pressure, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, pelvic pain, increasing abdominal girth or

          -  Subject has evidence of bilateral ureteric flow

          -  Subject agrees to participate in the study, including completion of all study-related
             procedures and evaluations, and documents this agreement by signing the Ethics
             Committee-approved informed consent.

          -  Presence of any pedunculated sub-mucosal or pedunculated sub-serosal fibroid(s) as
             determined by MRI, ultrasound or hysteroscopy

          -  Presence of an intra-uterine device (IUD)

          -  Any hydronephrosis as determined on renal ultrasound prior to the procedure

          -  Clinical history of any thrombo-embolic disease or known thrombophilia

          -  Blood Urine Nitrogen (BUN) greater than 7.2mmol/L* and/or serum creatinine greater
             than 106Î¼mol/L* unresolved with change in diet or hydration

          -  History or current evidence of gynecologic malignancy (confirmed by hysteroscopy or
             endometrial biopsy), atypical endometrial hyperplasia, or chronic pelvic inflammatory
             disease

          -  Pelvic mass outside the uterus other than uterine fibroids

          -  Any current acute or chronic systemic infection or localized pelvic infection,
             including a urinary tract infection

          -  Use of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonist, danozol or mifepristone within
             6-months prior to the start of the study procedure

          -  Using anticoagulation therapy (except over the counter treatments (e.g. aspirin)), or
             have an underlying bleeding disorder

          -  Unsuitable for MRI examination (e.g. severe claustrophobia, non-MRI-compatible
             implanted metalloid devices)

          -  Prior endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, or uterine artery ligation

          -  Poor procedural candidate due to medical conditions as determined by the investigator
             (e.g. anesthesia class, renal insufficiency, heart disease);
