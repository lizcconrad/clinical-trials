  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since cultivated autologous oral mucosal epithelial sheets on amniotic membrane have been
      reported to have good clinical results in treating patients with ocular surface disorders in
      both human or animal studies, and such technique has not been used in our hospital, the main
      purpose of this study is to use these cell sheets to treat patients with severe surface
      disorders, which include limbal insufficiency induced corneal surface problem, and
      symblepharon caused by severe conjunctival epithelial insufficiency. We will first choose
      patients who meet the surgical criteria, and these patients need to receive dental
      examination three months before surgery. Two weeks before transplantation, the oral mucosa
      tissue will be obtained by a dentist and the oral mucosal epithelial cell sheets will be
      cultivated on amniotic membrane until reaching confluency and stratification. During the
      transplantation surgery, the abnormal fibrovascular tissues on the ocular surface will be
      removed. The areas of symblepharon will also be released. The cultivated oral mucosal cell
      sheets will be transplanted on the denuded corneal surface or the scleral surface of the
      symblepharon area. Therapeutic contact lenses will be applied after surgery. After operation,
      the patients will be admitted for about two weeks. After discharge, the patients need to
      receive regular follow up weekly during the first two months, followed by biweekly follow up
      until postoperative 6 months. Afterward, the patients need to receive monthly follow up until
      postoperative 2 years. During the follow up, the data of the patients' visual acuity,
      intraocular pressure, slit lamp biomicroscopic findings, and in vivo confocal microscopic
      data will be obtained. The project plans to start from July 1st 2007 until June 30th 2010. We
      plan to enroll totally 20 patients.
