      An atrial septal defect (ASD) is a hole in the heart that can lead to heart failure.
      Depending on the size and severity of the ASD, They can be treated during a heart
      catheterization with a special device that can permanently seal the ASD, but knowing the
      exact size and severity of the ASD is crucial. Newer MRI techniques may provide a better way
      at diagnosing the size and severity of an ASD. We compared MRI to other standard clinical
      ways for evaluating an ASD.

      Background: Atrial septal defect (ASD) flow can be measured indirectly by velocity-encoded
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (veCMR) of the pulmonary artery and aorta (Qp/Qs). Imaging
      the secundum ASD en face could potentially enable direct flow measurement and, additionally,
      provide valuable information regarding ASD size, shape, location, and proximity to other
      structures.

      Methods: Patients referred for possible transcatheter ASD closure underwent a comprehensive
      standard evaluation including transesophageal and/or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), and
      invasive oximetry. CMR was performed in parallel and included direct en face veCMR after an
      optimal double-oblique imaging plane was determined accounting for ASD flow direction and
      cardiac-cycle interatrial septal motion.

      We hypothesized that En face veCMR using an optimized imaging plane can accurately determine
      ASD flow, size, and morphology, and that it would provide information incremental to
      comprehensive standard evaluation.
