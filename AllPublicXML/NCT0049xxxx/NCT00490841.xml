             the data interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy of less than three
             years.

          -  Subject has any medical illnesses that would make them unlikely to respond to
             treatment (e.g., sickle cell nephropathy/sickle cell disease, scleroderma, arteriolar

          -  Kidney to be treated is &lt;8 cm as determined by duplex ultrasound report, CTA report,

             than one method, e.g. CTA and ultrasound, and one of the methods is duplex ultrasound,
             the kidney size as documented by duplex ultrasound shall be used to determine study
             eligibility.

          -  The target lesion is within the artery of a solitary functioning kidney or, the
             subject has a contralateral totally occluded renal artery.

          -  For planned treatment of bilateral lesions: the more critical lesion, i.e. lesion with
             the greater stenosis (which should be treated first), is either treated unsuccessfully
             or requires a bailout procedure. (NOTE: Less critical lesion is excluded at this
             point.)

          -  Subject has any condition that precludes proper angiographic assessment or makes
             percutaneous arterial access unsafe.

             insufficiency without other identifiable etiology).

            <groups_desc>objective is to demonstrate the binary restenosis rate at 9 months is &lt; 28.6% OPC. Assumptions for the primary endpoint analysis:
H0: Restenosis Rate ≥ 28.6%
HA: Restenosis Rate &lt; 28.6%
Assumed binary restenosis rate = 20%
Power = 80%
One-sided type I error = 5%
With the above assumptions, 161 samples would be required. To account for approximately 20% lost to follow–up rate, 202 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The sample size calculation was performed using PASS 2005.</groups_desc>
