      Background: In haemodialysis patients, chronic heart failure (CHF) is responsible for a high
      mortality rate but, presently, very little data is available regarding this population.

      Aim of the study: Aim of this study was to determine whether telmisartan decreases all-cause
      and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in haemodialysis patients with CHF and impaired
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) when added to standard therapies with ACE
      inhibitors.

      Methods: A 3-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial was
      performed involving 30 Italian clinics. Haemodialysis patients with CHF (NYHA class II and
      III; LVEF 40%) were randomized to telmisartan or placebo in addition to ACE inhibitor
      therapy. 332 patients were enrolled (165 telmisartan, 167 placebo), and drug dosage was
      titrated to a target dose of telmisartan of 80 mg or placebo. Mean follow-up period was 35Â±5
      months. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and CHF
      hospitalization.
