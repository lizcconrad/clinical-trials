  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 determined: aliskiren, amlodipine and angiotensin II concentrations in interstitial
      fluid of fat and skeletal muscle; aliskiren and angiotensin II concentrations, and renin
      activity and concentration in fat and skeletal muscle tissues (biopsies); aliskiren,
      amlodipine and angiotensin II concentrations, and renin activity and concentration in plasma.

      Part 2 investigated the potential for aliskiren to modulate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      system (RAAS) activity, and lipid/carbohydrate metabolism in adipose and skeletal muscle
      tissue in obese patients with hypertension in comparison to amlodipine.

    <description>Part 1: After a 1-2 weeks initial washout period, all eligible patients underwent a two week placebo run-in phase (period 1) consisting of treatment with one tablet of placebo to aliskiren once daily (o.d.). This was followed by a 4 week treatment phase (period 2) consisting of treatment with 300 mg aliskiren o.d..
Part 2: Eligible randomized patients in this arm received aliskiren 300 mg tablet o.d. and amlodipine placebo capsule o.d. for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Part 1: After aliskiren treatment (period 2), each patient was entered into a second washout period (4 weeks) during which blood pressure was required to be ≤ 140/90 mmHg. If blood pressure exceeded 140/90 mmHg on two consecutive days (home monitoring) and was confirmed at the study center, the patient was entered into the amlodipine treatment period (period 3). In period 3, all patients received 5 mg amlodipine o.d.. The length of the amlodipine period varied from 4 to 7 weeks.
Part 2: Eligible patients randomized to part 2 received amlodipine 5 mg o.d. and aliskiren placebo for 12 weeks</description>
