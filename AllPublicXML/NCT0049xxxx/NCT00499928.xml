  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the biological fate of radioactive SB-751689 administered to healthy
      males and healthy postmenopausal women. Subjects will receive a single oral dose of
      radioactive SB-751689. Excreta and blood samples will be taken over the course of 7 days.
      This study will help determine the major route of elimination of SB-751689 in humans. It will
      also provide samples (blood, plasma, urine, and stools) for analysis of metabolites, if any.
