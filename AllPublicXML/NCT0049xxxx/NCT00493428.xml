  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that liver cancer cells possess a receptor called the GABA-B receptor
      that when activated, inhibits the spread of cancer cells in test tubes. One of the drugs that
      activate these receptors is Baclofen, an agent that was originally developed to treat
      patients with various neurologic disorders. In this study, patients with recently identified
      liver cancer will be treated with Baclofen in an attempt to prevent or delay spread of the
      cancer beyond the liver. The time it takes for liver cancer to spread in the patients will be
      compared to the results obtained from patients enrolled in previous studies where Baclofen
      was not used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 47 consecutive patients with radiologic or histologic evidence of non metastatic
      liver cancer will be enrolled over a 2-4 year period. Subjects will receive oral Baclofen at
      the manufacturer's suggested maximal dose. Clinical, hematologic, biochemical, and radiologic
      features of liver function, tumor metastasis and recurrence will be monitored at regular time
      intervals over a 2 year treatment period. The primary study end point will be the event of
      interest (time to metastasis or recurrence). Secondary end points will include time to
      metastasis following recurrence, objective tumor responses (complete, partial and non
      response), response duration, survival and safety. It is hoped the results of this study will
      permit liver cancer patients to remain candidates for surgical resection and transplantation
      longer than would otherwise have been the case.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of HCC and no evidence of extra-hepatic metastases on CT/MRI scan of the
             abdomen, CT of the chest and brain and a negative bone scan.

          -  Patients undergoing local therapy (resection, ablation or chemoembolization) and those
             listed for liver transplantation will not be excluded from participating in the study.

          -  Patients with multiple space occupying lesions within the liver (but no evidence of
             extra-hepatic metastases) will continue to be eligible (the distinction between
             regenerative nodules and multi-focal HCC versus intra-hepatic metastases can not be
             made with certainty by presently available techniques).

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) â‰¥ 60 %.

          -  Age 18 years or greater.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Concomitant Medications

          -  Patients should be on stable doses of other medications (no change in dose for two
             weeks prior to study initiation) when entered into the study.

          -  Patient consent must be obtained from all patients prior to entry into the trial.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up i.e. residing within
             reasonable geographical limits of the study site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any investigational agent within a minimum of 6 weeks prior to study treatment.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women; women or men of childbearing potential unless using
             effective contraception. Patients capable of reproduction must agree to use
             appropriate methods of contraception during the study and for six months afterwards.
             Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             within 14 days of study enrollment.

          -  Patients whose partners are pregnant.

          -  Other serious illness or medical conditions which would not permit the patient to be
             managed according to the protocol including:

               -  History of a psychiatric disorder which would impair the ability to obtain
                  consent or follow-up tumor imaging.

               -  Active uncontrolled infection.

          -  Any known defect in GABA metabolism or hypersensitivity to Baclofen.

          -  Patients with previous organ allograft or taking immunomodulatory drugs.

          -  Renal failure not being managed by dialysis.
