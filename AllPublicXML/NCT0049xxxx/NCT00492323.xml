    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of 200
      mg of RWJ-333369 given twice daily compared with placebo in the treatment of postherpetic
      neuralgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postherpetic neuralgia is a distressing syndrome of neuropathic pain that continues for at
      least 3 months after the resolution of the varicella-zoster rash (shingles), can last up to
      years later, and for which therapies are often limited by incomplete pain relief and side
      effects. This is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      the Investigator or the patient know the name of the assigned study medication),
      placebo-controlled, crossover, parallel-group, multicenter study to determine the
      effectiveness and safety of 200 mg of RWJ-333369 given twice daily for 4 weeks compared with
      placebo in patients with Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN). The study hypothesis is that 200 mg of
      RWJ-333369 given twice daily for 4 weeks will be more effective than placebo in reducing pain
      due to PHN, as measured by average daily PHN pain scores. Patients will receive 200 mg of
      RWJ-333369 or matching placebo tablets, given in equally divided doses twice daily by mouth,
      with or without food, for 4 weeks in each of the 2 treatment periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) with a history of varicella-zoster rash
             (shingles), persistent pain for at least 6 months after the healing of the rash

          -  Experienced postherpetic neuralgia pain on a daily basis for the past 3 months

          -  Women must be postmenopausal for at least 2 years, sexually abstinent, or if sexually

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a poor response to 3 or more medications for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN),
             with poor response defined as treatment with medications in the following categories
             of therapy for at least 1 month at therapeutic dosages without at least moderate
             improvement, as judged by the study doctor: Antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants,
