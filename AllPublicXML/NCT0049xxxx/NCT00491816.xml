      Primary Study Objective:

      To assess the pathological complete response rate (pCR) with 4-6 cycles of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy plus erlotinib in patients with triple negative breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty percent of women with breast cancer have triple negative breast cancer. The standard
      treatment for triple negative breast cancer is typically a combination of chemotherapy,
      surgery, +/- radiation therapy. When treated with standard therapy women with triple negative
      breast cancer have a worse long term outcomes as compared to women who do not have triple
      negative breast cancer. Triple negative breast cancer cells usually have a surface marker
      called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). Women whose breast cancer cells have the EGFR
      surface marker have worse long term outcomes as compared to women whose tumors do not have
      the EGFR marker. Erlotinib (Tarceva) targets EGFR and is currently used for treatment of
      other cancers like lung and pancreas. This study will assess a combination of chemotherapy
      with erlotinib in women with triple negative breast cancer.

      For breast cancer patients who receive chemotherapy first and then get surgery, long-term
      survival is longer for women who do not have any microscopic cancer at the time of surgery.
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether a combination of chemotherapy and
      erlotinib will result in no evidence of microscopic disease (pCR) at the time of surgery in
      greater than 20% of enrolled subjects. After completing all chemotherapy, patients will also
      receive maintenance erlotinib for 12 months. This is given to study the tolerability of
      maintenance Erlotinib and also to evaluate if maintenance erlotinib will decrease the rate of
      tumor recurrence.
