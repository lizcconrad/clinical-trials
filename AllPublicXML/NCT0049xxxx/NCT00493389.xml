    <textblock>
      Cortisol deficiency is diagnosed by the adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) stimulation test. This
      test measures cortisol levels in the blood before and after giving an injection of ACTH.
      Currently, the results of this test can only be reliably interpreted when it is carried out
      on people in non-stressful situations. Frequently the test is carried out in hospitalized
      patients in stressful situations, giving results that are hard to interpret.

      Our study is to first do this test in a non-stressful situation, followed by a repeat test in
      a stressful situation, to compare the results and create a set of guidelines for interpreting
      the test when it is carried out in stressful situations.

      This study proposes to provide the reference range of cortisol results when the ACTH
      stimulation test is done under stressful conditions. This important information is currently
      not available in the literature. To achieve this, we will perform the ACTH stimulation test
      in a cohort of patients who are booked for elective surgery. By choosing elective surgery
      patients, we afford ourselves the opportunity of performing the test once before surgery. The
      test is then repeated within 12 hours of surgery. The first test will be done on an
      out-patient basis under usual conditions (minimal stress) while the second will be done under
      intense physical stress. The 2 sets of results will be compared and the effect of stress on
      test results will be determined. For the sake of uniformity, we have chosen patients who are
      booked to undergo repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) as our study cohort.

      The ACTH stimulation is an important test that suffers from limitations resulting from lack
      of clear guidelines for the interpretation of results done under stressful conditions. This
      study will thus improve the usefulness of an important tool in the evaluation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in stressed patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females aged 40 to 80 years, who are booked for elective open repair of
             abdominal aortic aneurysm at The Ottawa Hospital Civic campus

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Pre-operative signs and symptoms of hypofunction of the HPA axis

          -  Pre-operative AST results that indicate HPA failure, necessitating perioperative
             hydrocortisone coverage (Cortisol level post-ACTH &lt; 500 nmol/L)

          -  Presence of multiple co-morbidities such as poorly controlled diabetes,
             dialysis-dependant renal failure, hepatic failure

          -  Presence of hypoalbuminaemia &lt; 35 g/L

          -  Untreated endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, hypogonadism
             detected by pre-operative measurement of TSH, FT4, LH, FSH and free testosterone. Such
             patients will receive any appropriate treatment prior to surgery. Once treated,
             participation in the study will be offered again and results analysed separately

          -  Being on drugs (a) that affect cortisol synthesis (eg. Ketoconazole, etomidate) or
             protein binding (eg. Estrogens), (b) any form of glucocorticoid which would inhibit
             CRH and ACTH secretion.

          -  Use of herbal or anabolic supplements
