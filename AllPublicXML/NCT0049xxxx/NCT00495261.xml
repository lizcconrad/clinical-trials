    <textblock>
      In recent years, mindfulness meditation has been shown to be a promising approach for
      alleviating emotional distress associated with chronic medical and psychiatric conditions and
      in reducing relapse following treatment for depression. The applicability of mindfulness
      meditation to problem gambling has not yet been explored. Mindfulness meditation may be
      particularly suitable for this clinical disorder as it stresses a process-oriented,
      metacognitive, approach to cognitive pathology in contrast to a content-focused approach,
      characteristic of traditional approaches to treating cognitive psychopathology.
      Gambling-related cognitive psychopathology is a well-known characteristic of problem gambling
      and frequently the target of therapy. Although there is growing evidence that
      cognitive-behavioral treatments are effective for gambling, outcomes may be improved by
      teaching gamblers additional ways to cope with cognitive distortions that emphasize
      metacognitive processes.

      Hypothesis The mindfulness-enhanced CBT (MCBT) will report significant reductions in the
      frequency of gambling, gambling urges, gambling cognitions and gambling-related expenditures
      compared to the relaxation-enhanced CBT (RCBT) at end-of-treatment and at the 3-month
      follow-up.

      Significance

        1. feasibility of mindfulness interventions for problem gamblers

        2. tentative data for the effectiveness of the intervention

        3. an additional clinical tool to treat problem gamblers

        4. basis of a larger, grant-funded study obtain more definitive data
