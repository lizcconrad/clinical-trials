  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if alternate dosing of Epoetin alfa was effective
      in maintaining hemoglobin levels in patients with chemotherapy related anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective chart review of patients with chemotherapy related anemia. Two
      hundred (200) patients with chemotherapy related anemia were to have received PROCRIT
      (Epoetin alfa) on a weekly schedule (e.g., once every week or more frequently) for at least 4
      weeks, followed by a maintenance PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) schedule of less frequent dosing
      (e.g. once every 2 weeks, once every 3 weeks, or once every 4 weeks) for at least 6 weeks.
      Hemoglobin response and maintenance of initial treatment phase hemoglobin with alternate
      doses of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) were to be evaluated.Study sites were to record data in a
      Case Report Form which would then be entered into a database. Data was to be recorded,
      starting with the PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) initiation phase (at least 4 weeks duration), and
      extending through at least 6 weeks of maintenance therapy. A minimum of 20 study sites were
      to be enrolled in the data collection process.Data obtained was to be analyzed to reflect
      alternate dosing patterns of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) therapy. The frequency and percentage of
      patients receiving each dosing regimen were to be summarized. Hemoglobin response and
      maintenance of initial treatment phase hemoglobin with alternate doses of PROCRIT (Epoetin
      alfa) were to be evaluated. If PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) was discontinued, the time and
      reason(s) for discontinuation were to be recorded.

      Patients were to have received PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) subcutaneous injection on a weekly
      schedule (e.g., once every week or more frequently) for at least 4 weeks, followed by a
      maintenance PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) schedule of less frequent dosing (e.g. once every 2 weeks,
      3 weeks, or 4 weeks) for at least 6 weeks.
