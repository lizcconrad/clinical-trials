    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify whether cardiovascular complication rates
      are lower in patients who participate in managed diabetes care, in comparison to provincial
      and national rates. This study will involve an electronic medical record (EMR) chart audit,
      augmented by a manual review of hospital and other pertinent medical records, as necessary.

      The DECIDE study will identify whether cardiovascular complication rates (the composite rate
      of myocardial infarction (MI), Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), Coronary Artery
      Bypass Grafting (CABG), stroke, carotid endarterectomy, peripheral revascularization, and
      peripheral amputation) are lower in patients who participate in managed diabetes care by ADEC
      in comparison to provincial and national rates. Comparison statistics will be provided by the
      Institute of Evaluative Sciences (ICES) Atlas 2003 and other Diabetes studies such as the
      2005 DICE study. Complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy will be documented, along
      with hospitalization rates and all cause mortality. Clinical outcomes relevant to diabetes
      management such as blood pressure and lipids will also be compared.

    <description>Interventions (managed diabetes care) employed by the ADEC Program include: diabetes education, nutrition care, individual and group counseling sessions, foot care, and insulin and oral diabetes medication adjustments with a signed medical directive. ADEC Diabetes Educators (Registered Dietitians and Registered Nurses) will use adult education principles throughout the education process and promote self-care by encouraging responsibility and promoting a positive attitude towards acceptance of diabetes. All patients will be encouraged to self-monitor their blood glucose at home. Team member collaboration and with other agencies to promote a total client care approach to diabetes management will be employed.</description>

        Ambulatory patients of the Group Health Centre who are over the age of 18 years with a
        confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and who are enrolled in the Algoma Diabetes
        Education and Care (ADEC) program. ADEC is a managed diabetes care program and part of the
        Group Health Centre (GHC), a multi-specialty, interdisciplinary, ambulatory care facility
        located in Sault Ste. Marie, a northern Ontario community. With diagnostic services and a
        comprehensive electronic medical record, GHC provides health care to most of the
        community's population of approximately 75,000.
