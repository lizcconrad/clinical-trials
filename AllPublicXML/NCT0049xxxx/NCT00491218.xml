  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current outpatient evaluation for angina in low and intermediate risk patients typically
      starts with a functional assessment for coronary ischemia. Exercise treadmill testing is
      often selected as the initial diagnostic modality for coronary artery function. However,
      exercise treadmill testing is limited by its moderate sensitivity and specificity, often
      resulting in further cardiac resource utilization for patient risk stratification and
      reassurance. With the advent of coronary multislice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography,
      coronary artery anatomy can now be evaluated noninvasively. Despite its impressive
      performance characteristics, the role of coronary MSCT angiography in the outpatient
      evaluation of angina remains undefined.

      CT-EXTRA compares the impact on patient safety and downstream resource utilization of a novel
      initial diagnostic strategy employing the addition of coronary MSCT angiography to exercise
      treadmill testing with a standard diagnostic strategy of exercise treadmill testing for the
      ambulatory evaluation of low-intermediate risk patients with possible angina. The study is a
      single center, prospective, non-blinded, randomized clinical trial. Men and women, age 18-70,
      with a low to intermediate pretest probability of coronary artery disease who are referred
      for an exercise treadmill test for angina are eligible. Subjects are randomized either to an
      initial diagnostic strategy of exercise treadmill testing or exercise treadmill testing with
      coronary MSCT angiography. Subsequent diagnostic testing and treatment are the discretion of
      the referring physician. Subjects will be clinically followed for 24 months.

      The clinical impact on patient safety and downstream clinical resource utilization of this
      novel diagnostic strategy in which both coronary artery anatomy and function are initially
      evaluated will be determined. The primary outcome is a composite endpoint consisting of
      freedom from adverse cardiac events, further cardiac diagnostic testing, and future cardiac
      clinical encounters. Secondary outcomes include the impact on the indiscriminate use of
      coronary angiography, subject anxiety, depression, motivation for healthy behavioral change,
      and satisfaction with diagnostic evaluation and use of antiplatelet and antilipid therapy.
      Lastly, the cost effectiveness of the routine addition of coronary MSCT angiography in the
      outpatient evaluation of possible angina will be determined.

      CT-EXTRA is a randomized clinical trial that will compare a novel diagnostic strategy
      employing the addition of coronary MSCT angiography to exercise treadmill testing with a
      standard diagnostic strategy of exercise treadmill testing for the outpatient evaluation of
      low-intermediate risk patients with possible angina. This is the first randomized clinical
      trial that evaluates a diagnostic strategy for outpatient chest pain that incorporates a
      noninvasive assessment of both coronary artery function and anatomy. CT- EXTRA will determine
      whether coronary MSCT angiography adds any incremental prognostic value over exercise
      treadmill testing alone for predicting future adverse cardiac events and reduces downstream
      clinical resource utilization. This study will also evaluate the impact of this strategy on
      the avoidance of unnecessary invasive coronary angiography, statin and aspirin prescription,
      patient anxiety, satisfaction with the diagnostic approach, and motivation for healthy
      behavioral change. Finally, an economic analysis will be performed to assess the differences
      in overall healthcare costs between the diagnostic approaches. In today’s managed
      care-dominated paradigm, it is paramount that a new diagnostic modality such as coronary MSCT
      angiography is not only clinically effective but cost effective as well. CT EXTRA will
      provide critical information to clinicians and health care administrators on the clinical and
      cost effectiveness of an initial diagnostic strategy employing routine coronary MSCT
      angiography in the evaluation of patients for possible angina.

      300 male and female military health care beneficiaries between the ages of 18-70, who are low
      to intermediate risk for symptomatic coronary artery disease and are referred to the Walter
      Reed Cardiology Clinic for an exercise treadmill test for the evaluation of possible angina
      (chest pain or angina-equivalent).

      This study is a randomized, non-blinded, prospective trial to be conducted in the Cardiology
      clinic at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Patients, age 18-70 years, referred to the
      Cardiology clinic for an exercise treadmill test for an outpatient evaluation of possible
      angina and are low-intermediate risk for symptomatic coronary artery disease, will be
      eligible. All patients who meet the aforementioned inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      consented by an investigator and randomized from sealed envelopes to either “mandatory
      coronary MSCT angiography” or “no coronary MSCT angiography” before initiation of exercise
      treadmill testing. The randomization sequence will be generated using a sequence of
      computer-generated random numbers. All consented subjects will complete surveys assessing
      baseline depression using the Beck Depression Inventory, anxiety using the State and Trait
      Anxiety Inventory, and motivation healthy behavioral change using the ladder scale
      questionnaire. Completion of these three questionnaires are for research purposes and will
      take approximately 15 minutes.

      Exercise Treadmill Testing

      All subjects will undergo exercise treadmill testing as initially ordered by the referring
      physician. All exercise treadmill testing will be conducted at the Cardiology clinic at
      Walter Reed Army Medical Center according to standard clinic protocol. Testing will be
      conducted by a health care professional (staff physician, fellow, or nurse practitioner) not
      associated with the protocol. A Cardiology staff physician not affiliated with the protocol
      will officially interpret each exercise treadmill test. Subjects will perform a graded
      exercise treadmill test according to a Full Bruce protocol aimed at reaching 85% of the
      maximal predicted heart rate for age. According to standard clinical practice, an exercise
      treadmill test is considered positive if 0.1 mV of new horizontal or downsloping ST segment
      depression or ST segment elevation 0.80 ms beyond the J point occurs during exercise or
      recovery in two or more contiguous lead. A nondiagnostic test is defined as the absence of
      ischemic electrical changes in the setting of reproduction of chest pain symptoms or when
      peak heart rate is ≤85 % of the age-predicted maximal heart rate. An exercise treadmill test
      is considered negative when &gt; 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate is achieved and
      reproduction of anginal symptoms and development of electrocardiographic ischemic changes are
      absent. In accordance with standard clinical practice, exercise treadmill testing will be
      prematurely terminated in the event of lightheadedness, severe ST depression (&gt;2mm) or
      elevation (&gt;1mm), ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias, exaggerated blood pressure
      increase (&gt;250 mm Hg systolic or &gt;120mm Hg diastolic) and a &gt;10mm Hg decrease in diastolic
      blood pressure. Upon completion of exercise treadmill testing, the subject will be provided a
      copy of the results and official interpretation of the exercise treadmill test for inclusion
      in their medical records. A copy of the exercise treadmill test results will be kept in the
      subject’s file for the investigational team. Completion of an exercise treadmill test
      generally takes about 25 minutes.

      Immediately Following Exercise Treadmill Testing

      All consented subjects following exercise treadmill testing will undergo initial laboratory
      assessment to include fasting lipid panel (LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides), C-reactive
      protein, fasting blood glucose, creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and urine
      pregnancy test (for females). Approximately 15 mL (3 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn by the
      central laboratory, the clinical laboratory at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Excess blood
      will be discarded by the central laboratory according to their standard protocol. All
      laboratory values will be processed through this central laboratory.

      Subjects assigned to the “no coronary MSCT angiography” arm will follow up with their
      referring physician for further evaluation. Additional selection of testing, consultation,
      and choice of therapy is at the discretion of the referring physician. Coronary CT
      angiography will not be available to this group of subjects. Otherwise, the protocol will not
      predetermine the clinical diagnostic or treatment course for the subject. This approach will
      simulate the previous standard of care for the evaluation of possible angina (prior to the
      availability of coronary CT angiography in clinical practice). By excluding the option of
      coronary CT angiography in this group, any possible incremental value of the test can more
      accurately be assessed.

      In the event of a “high risk” exercise treadmill test, subjects will be offered inpatient
      admission. High risk tests will include any of the following: the occurrence of sustained
      ventricular tachycardia, syncope, a high risk Duke treadmill score (&gt;-10), limiting angina in
      stage 1 of the Full Bruce protocol, &gt; 2 mm ST depression in 3 or more leads in stage 1 of the
      Full Bruce protocol. Subjects with such high risk tests who are assigned to the “no coronary
      MSCT angiography” arm will be encouraged to undergo invasive coronary angiography. Subjects
      assigned to the “mandatory coronary MSCT angiography” arm will undergo coronary MSCT
      angiography in an expedited manner. This will be followed by invasive coronary angiography,
      if warranted, 48 hours later. Because the protocol excludes subjects deemed as having a high
      pretest probability of obstructive coronary artery disease, the potential for this occurrence
      should be minimized.

      Patients assigned to the “mandatory coronary MSCT angiography” arm will be scheduled for
      coronary MSCT angiography on an outpatient basis. The procedure for coronary MSCT angiography
      is described below. After completion of coronary MSCT angiography, the results will be
      provided to the referring physician. Additional selection of testing, consultation, or
      therapy is at the discretion of the referring physician. The protocol will not predetermine
      the clinical course for the subject following coronary MSCT angiography.

      Coronary MSCT angiography

      Pre-procedural Medications: In order to obtain high quality computed tomographic images with
      minimal motion artifacts, the goal heart rate is ≤ 65 beats per minute. This usually requires
      administration of beta-blocker medications before image acquisition. In addition, subjects
      with baseline low rates (&gt; 65bpm) generally need a reduced dose of beta-blockers to blunt
      increases in rate during the MSCT scan due to anxiety and or reflex responses to contrast.
      The dose of initial oral beta-blocker will be determined based on resting heart rate at the
      time of exercise treadmill testing. For subjects with a baseline heart rate above 65bpm and
      blood pressure above 100/50, 100-150mg of short acting metoprolol will be prescribed by the
      investigator. Subjects will be instructed to ingest this medication approximately one hour
      before the scheduled outpatient MSCT scan. For subjects with heart rates above 50bpm and less
      than 65bpm and blood pressure above 100/50, 25-50 mg of oral short acting metoprolol will be
      prescribed by the investigator. Subjects will be instructed to ingest this medication
      approximately one hour before the scheduled outpatient MSCT scan. For subjects with a
      baseline heart rate &lt; 50bpm, no metoprolol will be prescribed.

      On the day of the MSCT scan and upon arrival to the Radiology Department, the subject will
      receive a peripheral upper extremity intravenous catheter, placed by a certified nurse in the
      Radiology Department. The subject’s baseline blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded.
      For subjects whose heart rate remains ≥ 65 beats per minute and blood pressure ≥ 100/50,
      intravenous metoprolol (5 mg aliquots every 2-5 minutes under close observation and
      continuous telemetric monitoring, up to 40 mg total) will be administered by a cardiology
      staff or fellow. Once satisfactory heart rate and blood pressure stability are established,
      subjects will undergo MSCT testing as listed below. However, if target heart rate is not
      achievable by this protocol, this is not cause for exclusion from the study, since
      feasibility and accuracy studies have shown that diagnostic scans can be obtained in many
      patients with higher heart rates with advanced scanners. Nitroglycerin, a coronary
      vasodilator, will be administered to all subjects (0.8 mg sublingually) approximately 1
      minute before initiation of the MSCT scan to optimize image quality. Subjects will be queried
      regarding the recent use (within the previous 72 hours) of medications for erectile
      dysfunction (Cialis, Levitra and Viagra) on the day of the MCST scan since these drugs can
      interact with nitroglycerin to cause a potential life-threatening hypotensive effect. On the
      day of the scheduled MSCT scan, subjects who admit to have taken Cialis within the past 72
      hours or Levitra / Viagra within the past 48 hours will not be allowed to undergo coronary
      MSCT angiography and will be rescheduled. Subjects will be instructed to withhold these
      medications for at least 3 days before the scheduled scan.

      All female subjects who are randomized to the MSCT arm will be required to wear a
      radioprotective bismuth shield during the actual MSCT scan. This radioprotective brassiere
      (Cone Instruments Inc, Solen, Ohio) composed of neoprene and bismuth trioxide has been
      studied in 16 slice CT scans and has been shown to reduce breast radiation exposure by
      approximately 40%.25 The bra will be placed directly over both breasts of the female subjects
      by either a female nurse or technician in the Radiology Department. The adhesive strips on
      the undersurface of these radioprotective bras will prevent any slippage during the actual
      scan. Depending on the bust size of the subject, either a medium or large bra will be
      employed for best fit. Each bra is intended for single patient use only and will be discarded
      after each study. The effect of these bismuth shields on image interpretation is unknown. If
      images of the coronary arteries are deemed to be unevaluable, women 40 years and younger will
      be excluded from participation in the study. In this event, only women greater than the age
      of 40 years will be enrolled and radioprotective shields will not be used.

      Subject follow-up

      After completion of initial testing (exercise treadmill test +/- MSCT angiography), subjects
      will be returned to the referring physicians who will dictate further clinical management.
      The results of the exercise treadmill testing and coronary MSCT angiography (if applicable)
      will be provided to the referring physician. Additional selection of testing, consultation,
      and choice of therapy is at the discretion of the referring physician. For subjects assigned
      to the “no coronary MSCT angiography” arm, the referring provider will be instructed not to
      make MSCT an available option for these subjects if further testing is deemed appropriate.
      Otherwise, the protocol will not predetermine the clinical diagnostic or treatment course for
      the subject. This approach should simulate actual clinical practice and the previous standard
      of care (prior to availability of MSCT) and will allow assessment of downstream clinical
      resource utilization in an unbiased fashion.

      Subjects will be followed for a total of two years. During that time, the following factors
      will be evaluated:

        -  Status of the presenting syndrome including final diagnosis

        -  Number of cardiac visits to an outpatient physician or emergency department (ED) because
           of chest pain/anginal equivalent

        -  Cardiac hospitalizations for chest pain syndrome/angina equivalent

        -  Requirement for additional cardiac diagnostic testing, namely further stress testing
           (nuclear, MRI, echocardiography) and/or cardiac catheterization

        -  Need for additional radiographic testing for incidental findings found on coronary MSCT

        -  Need for coronary revascularization procedures

        -  Unstable angina, myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Myocardial infarction is
           defined as a cardiac event requiring admission to the hospital with the development of
           cardiac enzyme level elevation. Unstable angina is defined by accelerating anginal
           symptoms with or without ischemic electrocardiographic changes requiring hospital
           admission and coronary revascularization. Death will be attributed to a cardiac origin
           in the case of documented significant arrhythmia and/or cardiac arrest, congestive heart
           failure, or myocardial infarction. Moreover, any unexplained death that occurs suddenly
           out of the hospital will be ascribed a cardiac cause.

        -  Prescription of antilipid and antiplatelet therapy

      These factors will be determined by electronic medical record review (CHCS-II) and telephonic
      interview with the subjects every 6 months for a total of 2 years. Any visit to an outpatient
      clinic or ED and any inpatient admission will be categorized as “cardiac” if the presenting
      complaint is chest pain or identical to the original complaint which prompted the initial
      exercise treadmill test referral.

      Subjects will return to the clinic at 12 months to complete questionnaires to assess changes
      in depression, anxiety and motivation for healthy behavioral change using the Beck Depression
      Inventory(BDI), State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and ladder scale respectively.
      Subjects will also be surveyed about their current perception of chest pain as cardiac or
      noncardiac and the utility of their index cardiovascular evaluation, to provide insight into
      the etiology of their symptoms.

      Endpoints Primary The primary outcome will be a composite endpoint consisting of adverse
      cardiac events and cardiac resource utilization. Specifically, this will include the
      occurrence of adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina,
      coronary revascularization), utilization of additional diagnostic testing for initial
      complaint, and the occurrence of future clinical outpatient/inpatient/ED encounters for the
      initial cardiac complaint.

      Secondary

      Secondary endpoints will include:

      1. Occurrence of adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, unstable
      angina, coronary revascularization)

      . 2. Need for subsequent cardiac diagnostic testing for the initial complaint of
      angina/angina equivalent 3. Occurrence of future clinical outpatient/inpatient/ED encounters
      for the initial cardiac complaint 4. Avoidance of unnecessary cardiac catheterizations 5.
      Change in motivation for healthy behavioral change, as assessed by the ladder motivational
      scale 6. Change in subject anxiety, as assessed by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory.

      7. Change in subject depression, as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory. 8.
      Satisfaction with diagnostic evaluation for initial complaint

      Predefined Analyses

      In addition to the primary and secondary outcomes, there will be two predefined analyses
      related to these outcomes.

      1. Cost Efficiency Analysis, measured as total direct per-patient cost incurred for each
      diagnostic strategy as related to the primary outcome. The direct per -patient cost in the
      evaluation of outpatient angina will be calculated by adding the following components and
      dividing by the number of patients tested:

        1. cost of all initial tests of each diagnostic arm (exercise treadmill testing +/-
           coronary MSCT angiography

        2. cost of any additional cardiac diagnostic tests deemed necessary by the referring
           provider after the completion of the initial diagnostic strategy arms for evaluation of
           the initial complaint

        3. cost of any subsequent inpatient/outpatient/ED evaluations for the initial cardiac
           complaint over the following 24 months

        4. cost of any subsequent radiographic testing needed for incidental findings found on MSCT
           over the following 24 months The cost of the different diagnostic tests utilized
           (coronary MSCT angiography, exercise treadmill testing, myocardial perfusion testing,
           exercise echocardiography, coronary angiography, and other radiographic tests) and
           clinical encounters (inpatient admissions, ED evaluations, outpatient evaluations) will
           be estimated from current Medicare reimbursement rates.

      2. Statin and aspirin use, measured as the change in the prevalence of statin and aspirin use
      among subjects in each diagnostic arm.
