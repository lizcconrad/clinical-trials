      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of Quantiferon-TB Gold (QFT-G) assay in
      the screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in rheumatologic patients due to start
      or on treatment with TNFα antagonists. The results of QFT-G will be compared to tuberculin
      skin testing (TST) and correlated to clinical and demographic data. The study hypothesis is
      that the inclusion of QTF-G in the screening strategy will allow a more accurate assessment
      of LTBI infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with TNFα antagonists is associated with an increased risk of active tuberculosis.
      Screening for LTBI and adherence to published guidelines have been shown to greatly decrease
      the risk of active tuberculosis. However, the best screening strategy is still object of
      debate. The validity of TST in patients on immunosuppressive treatment has been questioned.
      Recently, interferon-γ assays based on RD1-specific antigens have shown to cause less
      confounding by BCG vaccination and from most non-tuberculosis mycobacteria than TST, and have
      shown improved accuracy over TST in several settings. However, data on their use in
      rheumatologic patients are limited, and their superiority in patients on immunosuppressive
      treatment is unclear since indeterminate results may limit their clinical usefulness in this
      setting.

      Purpose of the study is to investigate the added value of the inclusion of QTF-G assay in the
      screening strategy of LTBI in rheumatologic patients before and during treatment with TNFα
      antagonists.

      The study will compare the results of TST with the results of QFT-G assay in rheumatologic
      patients being evaluated for treatment with anti-TNFα agents or already on treatment with
      anti-TNFα agents. The rate of positive and negative results of the two test will be compared,
      end results correlated to clinical and demographic variables.
