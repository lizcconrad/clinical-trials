      Recent data show that Rosiglitazone treatment can reduce proteinuria in diabetic patients.
      However, currently there are no trials that examine the effects of Rosiglitazone on kidney
      disease progression, that is, doubling of serum creatinine or time to onset of end-stage
      renal disease, in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

      We decided to study retrospectively the possible association between rosiglitazone use and
      clinical course of diabetic nephropathy, including rate of deterioration of renal function,
      appearance and progression of microalbuminuria/proteinuria, survival and acceptance to renal
      replacement therapy.

      Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a public health concern, and projections of its future
      effect are alarming. According to the World Health Organization, diabetes affects more than
      170 million people worldwide, and this number will rise to 370 million by 2030 [1]. About one
      third of those affected will eventually have progressive deterioration of renal function [2,
      3]. The first clinical sign of renal dysfunction in patients with diabetes is generally
      microalbuminuria (a sign of endothelial dysfunction that is not necessarily confined to the
      kidney)[4], which develops in 2 to 5 percent of patients per year [5,6]. In type 2 diabetes,
      unlike type 1 diabetes [7], microalbuminuria is seldom reversible [8], but, instead,
      progresses to overt proteinuria in 20 to 40 percent of patients.[9,10]. In 10 to 50 percent
      of patients with proteinuria, chronic kidney disease develops that ultimately requires
      dialysis or transplantation [11,12,13]. Forty to 50 percent of patients with type 2 diabetes
      who have microalbuminuria eventually die of cardiovascular disease [14,15]; this is three
      times as high a rate of death from cardiac causes as among patients who have diabetes but
      have no evidence of renal disease [6].

      In patients with diabetes and renal disease, lowering blood pressure and the levels of
      urinary albumin is effective in reducing the risk of end-stage renal disease as well as that
      of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke [16]. Angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists appear to be the most effective renoprotective and
      antihypertensive agents [11, 12, 17-21] . Treatment with the ACE inhibitor enalapril over a
      period of six years decreased the incidence of microalbuminuria in patients with type 2
      diabetes who were normotensive and not obese [22].

      Preventing (or delaying) the development of microalbuminuria is a key treatment goal for
      renoprotection [23] and, possibly, for cardioprotection [4]. Recent clinical trials suggested
      that inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system may actually prevent nephropathy. The post
      hoc analyses of the reduction in hypertension in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation
      study [18] and in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint study [24] found a lower incidence
      of overt nephropathy in subjects with type 2 diabetes who received therapy that inhibited the
      renin–angiotensin system than in controls.

      Recent BENEDICT study indicates that treatment with trandolapril with or without verapamil
      significantly reduces the incidence of microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      normal urinary albumin excretion, as compared with placebo [25]. Trandolapril alone also
      appeared to decrease the incidence of microalbuminuria, whereas verapamil had no effect.
      Thiseffect of trandolapril plus verapamil and trandolapril alone in preventing
      microalbuminuria exceeded expectations based on changes in blood pressure alone.

      Unfortunately, even with the appropriate use of available therapy, diabetic nephropathy still
      remains the leading cause of ESRD [2]. More effective strategies are needed in order to
      retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and to reduce cardiovascular mortality in
      diabetic population.

      Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) represent a class of compounds currently used for the treatment of
      type 2 DM that exert their hypoglycemic properties through reduction of IR [26]. These agents
      act by stimulating a certain type of nuclear receptor, called peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR ). Such receptors are abundant in adipose tissue
      cells, but they are also present in various other cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle
      cells, macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, colon epithelial cells, as well as renal
      glomerular and tubular cells. Through transcriptional regulation of various genes, PPAR
      receptors play an important role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid and carbohydrate
      metabolism [26]. Apart from improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 DM, several
      lines of evidence support the notion that TZDs have beneficial effects on other components of
      the metabolic syndrome, such as blood pressure (BP) lowering, triglyceride reduction,
      high-density lipoprotein–cholesterol elevation, redistribution of body fat away from the
      central compartment, decrease of C-reactive protein and plasminogen activator inhibitor -1
      (PAI-1) levels, and others [26].

      Additionally, several animal studies demonstrate that TZDs also reduce urine albumin or
      protein excretion and protect against injury to the kidney [27]. Moreover, experimental
      studies exposed numerous actions of TZDs in the kidney that could explain a possible
      renoprotective effect [27-30]. Our recent study on diabetic rats showed that rosiglitazone
      exerts its anti-inflammatory renoprotective effect by inhibition of mesangial cells
      proliferation, downregulation of apoptosis and blunting responsiveness to angiotensin-2 [31].

      Human study also report significant reductions in UAE among patients with type 2 diabetes by
      rosiglitazone [32].

      Another human study was part of a cardiac safety study where rosiglitazone 4 mg b.i.d. was
      compared to glyburide in 121 patients for 52 weeks [32]. After 28 weeks of treatment, both
      groups had significant reductions in ACR of about 30%, but after 52 weeks only rosiglitazone
      group continued to demonstrate a significant ACR reduction. This finding suggests that
      duration of follow-up is an important variable in assessing the effect of TZDs [32].

      Overall, the above data clearly show that TZD treatment can reduce UAE. However, it should be
      emphasized that currently there are no trials that examine the effects of TZDs on kidney
      disease progression, that is, doubling of serum creatinine or time to onset of end-stage
      renal disease, in patients with diabetic nephropathy [33]. Such studies are needed in order
      to provide the best evidence for a renoprotective effect of TZDs.

      Based on this data, we decided to study the possible association between rosiglitazone use
      and clinical course of diabetic nephropathy, including rate of deterioration of renal
      function, appearance and progression of microalbuminuria/proteinuria, survival and acceptance
      to renal replacement therapy.
