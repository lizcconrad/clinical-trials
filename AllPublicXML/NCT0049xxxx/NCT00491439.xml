  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although epi-keratome laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (Epi-LASIK), penetrating
      keratoplasty and pars plana vitrectomy with corneal epithelial debridement for diabetic
      retinopathy are surgeries commonly performed, the time-sequential, in vivo microscopic wound
      healing process is not fully understood. The purpose of this study is to study the healing of
      corneal wounds after Epi-LASIK, penetrating keratoplasty and pars plana vitrectomy with
      corneal epithelial debridement for diabetic retinopathy by in vivo confocal microscopy, an
      easily performed and non-invasive procedure. We plan to enroll 40 eyes of 40 patients in each
      of these three surgeries. In Epi-LASIK, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, in vivo confocal microscopy,
      and visual acuity are recorded before and 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery. The eyes are
      examined weekly in the first month and at 3 and 6 months. For penetrating keratoplasty and
      pars plana vitrectomy with corneal epithelial debridement, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, in vivo
      confocal microscopy, and visual acuity are recorded before and weekly in the first month
      after surgeries and at 3 and 6 months. Selected images of the corneal basal/apical surface
      epithelia, stromal reactions and corneal endothelial conditions by in vivo confocal
      microscopy are evaluated qualitatively for the cellular morphology and density.
