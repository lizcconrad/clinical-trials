    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of tongue
      stabilization using Aspire Medical Advance™ System for the treatment of obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA). Success is defined as a statistically significant reduction in AHI measured by
      polysomnography (PSG) from baseline to 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major health problem in the United States and can result
      in excessive daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular problems. The primary treatment for OSA
      today is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Many patients however are unable to
      tolerate sleeping with a CPAP machine. Surgery is one of the main treatment options available
      today to these CPAP-intolerant patients. However, current methods of sleep surgery are
      painful, morbid, and/or lack decent effectiveness.

      This trial will measure the effectiveness of the Advance System, an implantable medical
      device to treat OSA. In the trial, patients who meet the study entry criteria receive a
      baseline sleep study (PSG). The Advance System is then implanted and 6 months after
      implantation, another PSG is performed. The trial will compare the baseline and the 6 month
      apnea-hypopnea indices
