  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) can be attributed largely to dysfunction of
      the autonomic nervous system in opiate exposed neonates. Vagal tone is a readily available
      measure of autonomic nervous system functioning. NAS is a widely variable disorder with
      poorly understood pathophysiology; while all opiate exposed infants will exhibit some signs
      and symptoms of NAS, only approximately Â½ have severe enough symptoms to require
      pharmacologic therapy. This research seeks to determine the relationship between infant vagal
      tone and NAS severity. The determination of a link between newborn vagal tone and NAS
      severity could result in the prediction of infants at risk for severe NAS and provide these
      infants and mothers with intensified services and early treatment, thereby shortening the
      course of NAS in the infant.

      Consecutively born methadone exposed infants had hert period and cardiac vagal tone
      measurements extracted via standard EKGs on days 1 and 3 of life. The infant's NAS course was
      assessed serially.

    <description>An EKG will be obtained using a Physio-control EKG monitor (R wave Electronics of Florida) in standard application, with three chest leads. The EKG data is inputted into a vagal tone monitor (Delta Biometrix, Bethesda MD) which computes vagal tone from the EKG signal. This data is then transferred to a disk which is analyzed off-line.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Term infant (&gt;= 37 weeks by 1st or second trimester sonogram),

          -  In utero opiate exposure (either heroin or methadone) requiring a minimum of three day
             infant hospitalization after birth
