    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label trial to assess safety and tolerability of rotigotine in
      subjects with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), administered at an optimal dose for up
      to 1 year in subjects who previously participated in SP790 (6-month pivotal trial) or SP794
      (sleep lab trial). Subjects who successfully completed the Maintenance Period and the Taper
      Period of SP790 or SP794 are allowed to enroll in this trial.
