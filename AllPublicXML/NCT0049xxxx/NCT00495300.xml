      This protocol will collect blood samples and medical information from patients who have had a
      bone marrow transplant using cells from an unrelated donor identified through the National
      Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). The NMDP has two programs in which patients can participate: the
      Research Database Program and the Research Sample Repository.

      Patients who have received a bone marrow transplant at the NIH or other institution from an
      unrelated donor affiliated with the NMDP may be eligible for this study.

      Participants in the NMDP Research Database program will have medical information about their
      disease and their transplant sent to the NMDP before and after the transplant and once a year
      for the rest of their life. The information will be used to help determine how well
      transplant recipients recover from their transplant, how recovery after a transplant can be
      improved, how access to transplant for different groups of patients can be improved and how
      well donors recover from collection procedures.

      Participants in the NMDP Research Sample Repository program will have a small blood sample
      drawn from a vein in the arm just before they start taking medicines for the conditioning
      regimen to prepare them for the transplant. The blood samples will be used to look at ways to
      improve how patients are matched with their donors, to determine and evaluate the factors
      that affect transplant outcome, and to help develop methods to improve tissue matching
      between donors and recipients....

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has entered into a Transplant Center Participation
      Agreement with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). This agreement allows any NIH
      investigator with an NIH Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol to secure
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) or cord blood units from the NMDP/CIBMTR registry for the
      purpose of transplanting patients who have no suitable matched related donors. As part of
      this agreement, the NMDP/CIBMTR Research Program requires that blood samples as well as
      baseline and outcome data (mainly demographic, quality of life, and clinical data) be
      collected and maintained in accordance with the NMDP/CIBMTR IRB approved protocols. The goal
      of the NMDP/CIBMTR Research Program is to improve the safety and effectiveness of unrelated
      donor HSC transplantation for both the donors and recipients, and to have a comprehensive
      source of data that can be used to study unrelated donor HSC transplantation. The NMDP/CIBMTR
      is the sole custodian of the data in the Research Database.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to incorporate all the NMDP/CIBMTR requirements for
      securing data and blood samples on recipients whose transplant was facilitated by NMDP/CIBMTR
      here at NIH as well as TED (Transplant Essential Data) level data submission for NIAID
      Allogeneic recipient patients and their donors. This protocol will include patients at the
      NIH that have enrolled in an NIH IRB approved protocol to receive matched unrelated donor
      (MUD) HSC transplants or cord blood transplants facilitated by the NMDP/CIBMTR. It may also
      include patients that have undergone a MUD transplant at another approved transplant center
      but need to receive additional blood products from the donor while at NIH after completing a
      transplant center transfer.
