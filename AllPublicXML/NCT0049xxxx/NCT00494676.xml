  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional utility for general mobility
      (walking) of new high power permanent peripheral prism glasses, which provide visual field
      expansion device for patients with homonymous hemianopia (the complete loss of half the field
      of vision on the same side in both eyes). The efficacy of real peripheral prism glasses will
      be assessed relative to sham peripheral prism glasses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hemianopic field loss are unaware of objects in their blind (non-seeing)
      hemi-field and often experience difficulties with mobility and navigation, such as walking
      into obstacles on the side of the field loss. In 2000, Peli (2000) described a new
      peripheral-prism design of prismatic correction for hemianopia, which addresses many of the
      inadequacies of existing designs of hemianopic visual aids, and produces true field expansion
      (i.e. the simultaneously seen field is larger with the device than without). In collaboration
      with the Schepens Eye Research Institute (Boston, MA), Chadwick Optical Inc (White River
      Junction, VT) has developed a permanent form of Fresnel prism segments, which are made from
      an acrylic material and can be embedded in a plastic spectacle lens. These permanent prisms
      offer better cosmesis, optical quality and durability than the temporary 40 prism-diopter
      press-on Fresnel prism segments used in previous evaluations of the peripheral prism system.

      In this study we will evaluate new high-power (57 prism diopter) permanent peripheral prism
      glasses. The study will employ a crossover design in which each participant will wear a pair
      of real prism glasses (high-power, 57 prism diopter) and a pair sham prism glasses
      (low-power, 5 prism diopters, that provide little field expansion) in counterbalanced order.
      The efficacy of the real prism glasses relative to the sham prism glasses will be assessed
      for general mobility (walking). We expect that participants will prefer the real prism
      glasses over the sham prism glasses as the former will be more helpful for obstacle detection
      when walking.

      Prism glasses will be fitted by Low Vision Practitioners at community-based Vision
      Rehabilitation Clinics. After wearing the first pair of glasses for 4 weeks, participants
      will return for an in-office follow up visit, at which a questionnaire will be administered
      to record their experiences of wearing the glasses. The second pair of prism glasses will
      then be fitted. Another questionnaire will be administered 4 weeks later to record the
      experiences of wearing the second set of glasses.

      At the end of the period of wearing the second pair of prism glasses, a clinical decision
      will be made as to whether the participant should continue to use the real prism glasses
      (e.g. if a participant finds the prism glasses helpful for obstacle avoidance when walking).
      For participants who continue with the prism glasses, a final telephone follow-up interview
      will be conducted after about 6 months.

    <description>At the end of each crossover period, participants were asked a yes/no question: &quot;If the study were to end today, would you want to continue with these prism glasses (i.e. the prism glasses worn in that period)?&quot; The primary outcome was the overall difference, across the two periods of the crossover, between the proportion of participants saying &quot;yes&quot; to real prism glasses and the proportion saying &quot;yes&quot; to sham prism glasses.</description>

    <measure>Mobility Change Score (All Participants Who Completed Crossover)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated after 4 weeks of wearing each type of prism glasses</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived difficulties with mobility were quantified using a 5-point rating scale (no difficulty to extreme difficulty) for 7 situations (items) relevant to people with hemianopia, including at home, in stores, outdoors, in unfamiliar areas, in familiar areas, in crowded areas, and noticing objects off to the side when walking. The questionnaire was administered at baseline (without prisms) and after each period of the crossover. Interval scale measures of perceived difficulty with overall mobility for each participant were estimated using Rasch analysis of the responses to all seven items (Winsteps software, version 3.70.0.226). Rasch measures were expressed as logits (log odds ratios). Mobility change scores for real and sham prisms were defined as the difference in perceived difficulty relative to baseline (in logits).</description>

            <groups_desc>The analysis used a McNemar test for data combined across both periods of the crossover. We estimated that 70% and 35% of participants would say yes to the real and sham prisms, respectively. For a 2-tailed test, the minimum sample size to detect a 35% difference in yes responses to real and sham prisms was 57 participants, assuming 30% overlap (30% said yes to both pairs of glasses), power of 90% and α of 1%. Assuming an attrition rate of 20%, we planned to enroll 68 participants.</groups_desc>

        <title>Mobility Change Score (All Participants Who Completed Crossover)</title>
        <description>Perceived difficulties with mobility were quantified using a 5-point rating scale (no difficulty to extreme difficulty) for 7 situations (items) relevant to people with hemianopia, including at home, in stores, outdoors, in unfamiliar areas, in familiar areas, in crowded areas, and noticing objects off to the side when walking. The questionnaire was administered at baseline (without prisms) and after each period of the crossover. Interval scale measures of perceived difficulty with overall mobility for each participant were estimated using Rasch analysis of the responses to all seven items (Winsteps software, version 3.70.0.226). Rasch measures were expressed as logits (log odds ratios). Mobility change scores for real and sham prisms were defined as the difference in perceived difficulty relative to baseline (in logits).</description>

        <title>Mobility Change Score (Only Participants Who Discontinued Prism Wear in the Long Term)</title>
        <description>Perceived difficulties with mobility were quantified using a 5-point rating scale (no difficulty to extreme difficulty) for 7 situations (items) relevant to people with hemianopia, including at home, in stores, outdoors, in unfamiliar areas, in familiar areas, in crowded areas, and noticing objects off to the side when walking. The questionnaire was administered at baseline (without prisms) and after each period of the crossover. Interval scale measures of perceived difficulty with overall mobility for each participant were estimated using Rasch analysis of the responses to all seven items (Winsteps software, version 3.70.0.226). Rasch measures were expressed as logits (log odds ratios). Mobility improvement scores for real and sham prisms were defined as the difference in perceived difficulty relative to baseline (in logits).</description>
