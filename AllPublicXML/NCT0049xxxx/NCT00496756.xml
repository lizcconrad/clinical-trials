      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well sorafenib works in
      treating patients with metastatic or unresectable kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicity of dose escalating sorafenib tosylate in patients with
           metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine tumor response in these patients.

        -  Determine time to progression in these patients.

        -  Determine overall survival of these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  Collect data on angiogenesis inhibition induced by sorafenib tosylate.

        -  Collect data on immunomodulatory effects of sorafenib tosylate.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib tosylate (in the absence of grade 3 or 4
      dose-limiting toxicity) until a pre-determined dose is reached.

      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for VEGF
      level determination. Blood samples are analyzed for T4/T8, NK, CD25+, and Fox p3 by flow
      cytometry. Tumor tissue blocks or unstained slides are obtained for chemistry staining of
      VEGF.
