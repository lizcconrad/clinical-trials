      The purpose of this study is to determine whether early recurrence after curative resection
      of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be explained by either dissemination of cancer cells
      during intraoperative tumour manipulation, post-operative systemic immune suppression,
      alteration of biological properties of circulating cancer cells or a combination of these.

      Prognostic relevance of circulating cancer cells and immunosuppression in resectable
      pancreatic carcinoma

        1. Introduction

           Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth commonest cause of death from cancer in men and
           women, with 5-year survival for all stages of disease of less than 5%. The case-fatality
           rate for pancreatic cancer is extremely high and virtually identical to the number of
           new cases (World Health Organization. World cancer report. Lyon: IACR Press; 2003). Most
           patients with cancer of the pancreas are diagnosed at an advanced stage and have a
           median survival of 4 to 10 months, depending on the extent of disease and irrespective
           the type of treatment modality. Overall, fewer than 5% of the patients have resection
           with curative intent, though over 80% will develop cancer recurrence (Jemal A, Thomas A,
           Murray T, Thun M. Cancer Statistics. CA Cancer J Clin 2002; 52: 23-47). The primary site
           of metastatic disease in patients with pancreatic cancer is the liver and/or the
           peritoneal cavity.

           Cancer recurrence is multifactorial and determined by patient-, tumour-, and
           surgery-related factors. Any combination of several mechanisms have been proposed by
           which cancer may recur following potentially curative resection (Coffey JC, Wang JH,
           Smith MJF, Bouchier-Hayes D, Cotter TG,and Redmond HP. Excisional surgery for cancer
           cure: therapy at a cost. Lancet Oncol 2003;4:760-68). Surgery may contribute to the
           overall residual tumor burden by adding disseminated cancer cells during tumor
           manipulation. Due to post-operative immunosuppression the patient may become more
           susceptible to tumorigenesis and/or disseminated cancer cells may escape the immune
           response more easily. Finally, surgical resection may alter biological properties of
           cancer cells and lead to increased cellular proliferation and reduced cell death.

        2. Cancer cell dissemination

           Solid markers are lacking to predict cancer recurrence or cancer progression before
           being measurable with conventional or modern diagnostic imaging. Molecular techniques
           such as the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique have
           proven to be a highly sensitive method and a powerful tool in the study of cancer
           metastasis (Raj GV, Moreno JG, Gomella LG. Utilization of Polymerase Chain Reaction
           Technology in the Detection of Solid Tumors. Cancer 1998; 82: 1419-42). The prognostic
           relevance of circulating cancer cells in patients with pancreatic cancer is hardly
           studied. In patients with breast cancer the number of circulating cancer cells
           expressing EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) has proven to be an independent
           predictor of progression-free and overall survival (Cristofanilli M, Budd GT, Ellis MJ,
           Stopeck A, Matera J, Miller MC, Reuben JM, Doyle GV, Allard WJ, Terstappen LW, Hayes DF.
           Circulating tumor cells, disease progression, and survival in metastatic breast cancer.
           N Engl J Med 2004; 351: 781-91). EpCAM is a marker present on most epithelial cell
           tumours and frequently overexpressed in primary and metastatic adenocarcinoma including
           pancreatic cancer (Rao CG, Chianese D, Doyle GV, Miller MC, Russell T, Sanders RA Jr,
           Terstappen LW. Expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule in carcinoma cells
           present in blood and primary and metastatic tumors. Int J Oncol 2005; 27: 49-57). Also,
           other markers such as CEA, CK20, K-ras have been used to detect disseminated pancreatic
           cancer cells. In patients with colorectal carcinoma circulating cancer cells in
           peripheral or in mesenteric venous blood as detected by RT-PCR, using CEA and CK20 mRNA
           transcripts, seem to represent a prognostic factor (Yamaguchi K, Takagi Y, Aoki S,
           Futamura M, Saji S. Significant detection of circulating cancer cells in the blood by
           reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction during colorectal cancer resection. Ann
           Surg 2000; 232: 58-65. Guller U, Zajac P, Schnider A, Bösch B, Vorburger S, Zuber M,
           Spagnoli GC, Oertli D, Maurer R, Metzger U, Harder F, Heberer M, Marti WR. Disseminated
           single tumor cells as detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
           represent a prognostic factor in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. Ann
           Surg 2002; 236: 768-76).

        3. Molecular characteristics of metastatic cancer cells

           The development of metastasis is a highly selective process favoring the survival of a
           minor subpopulation of metastatic cells. To produce metastases, tumor cells from this
           subpopulation must complete a sequence of interrelated steps. To produce clinically
           relevant distant metastases, the successful metastatic cell must therefore exhibit a
           complex phenotype that is regulated by transient or permanent changes at the gene level.
           Many malignant tumors, including pancreatic cancer, contain heterogeneous subpopulations
           of cells. This heterogeneity is exhibited in a wide range of genetic, biochemical,
           immunological, and biological characteristics such as growth rate, antigenic and
           immunogenic status, cell surface receptors and products, enzymes, karyotypes, cell
           morphologies, invasiveness, drug resistance, and metastatic potential. It is likely that
           specific tumor cells or colonies within the larger heterogeneous tumor specimen are the
           forerunners of distant metastases. The overall efficiency of the whole metastatic
           process itself is low. Although the absolute number of cancer cells required for
           metastasis in humans is unknown, a positive relationship between the number of
           circulating cancer cells and the subsequent development of metastases has been the
           subject of several experimental studies (Fisher, E.R. and Fisher, B. Experimental study
           of factors influencing development of hepatic metastases from circulating tumor cells.

           intravascular tumor cells, tumor vessels and pulmonary metastasis. Cancer Res. 34:

           dissemination during curative surgery for colorectal liver metastases. Eur J Surg Oncol
           2005; 31: 506-511).

           The poor prognosis and lack of effective treatments for pancreatic cancer arise from
           several causes. There are currently no effective biomarkers useful for early detection
           of pancreatic cancer that tends to rapidly invade surrounding structures and undergo
           early metastatic spreading. Moreover, pancreatic cancer is highly resistant to both
           chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Currently, the molecular basis for these
           characteristics is unknown. Gene expression profiles provide important information about
           the molecular characteristics of the cancers and can be used to distinguish closely
           related cancer subtypes. Gene profiling can also be used to develop candidate biomarkers
           and to identify groups of genes involved in specific functional aspects of tumor
           biology. Gene expression profiles that could distinguish between pancreatic tumors,
           chronic pancreatitis and normal pancreatic tissue have been studied extensively using
           different microarrays and microarray platforms. The differentially expressed genes in
           pancreatic tumor tissues were found to be quite specific and highly reproducible among
           platforms and studies (Crnogorac-Jurcevic T, Efthimiou E, Nielsen T, Loader J, Terris B,
           Stamp G, Baron A, Scarpa A and Lemoine NR. Expression profiling of microdissected
           pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Oncogene 2002; 21: 4587-4594. Han H, Bearss DJ, Browne LW,

           pancreatic cancer cells using cDNA microarray. Cancer Res 2002; 62: 2890-96.

           identifies multiple genes differentially regulated in pancreatic cancer. Cancer Res
           2003; 63: 2649-57).

        4. Peri-operative immunological changes

           Suppression of the immune system is a feature of the post-operative stress response, in
           which natural killer (NK) and lymphocyte activated killer (LAK) cells form an integral
           component in immune anti-tumor surveillance. However, a tumor type-specific immune
           reaction in pancreatic cancer or in patients undergoing surgery is lacking. Anti-tumoral
           activities of NK and LAK cells are reduced immediately after surgery so the additive
           effects of surgery may be sufficient to improve the ability of disseminated cancer cells
           to evade the host immune response long enough for metastases to develop (Da Costa ML,
           Finnegan N, Flynn M, Bouchier-Hayes DJ. Laparotomy and laparoscopy differentially
           accelerate experimental flank tumourgrowth. Br J Surg 1998; 85: 1439-42.) (Da Costa ML,
           Redmond HP, Bouchier-Hayes DJ. The effect of laparotomy and laparoscopy on the
           establishment of spontaneous tumour metastases. Surgery 1998; 124: 516-26).

           The suppressive immunological changes that follow surgical stress occur along a temporal
           pattern. Depression of cellular immunity to tumor-associated antigen and depression of
           delayed-type hypersensitivity are present for up to 3 weeks after surgery. In patients
           with pancreatic cancer the prevalence of regulatory T cells (Treg) is increased in the
           peripheral blood as well as in the tumour microenvironment. These Treg cells (CD4+25+)
           are phenotypically similar to Treg cells from normal donors by coexpression of CD45R0
           and CTLA-4 molecules as well as cytokine profile. Regulatory CD4+25+ lymphocytes
           infiltrate tumor and regional lymph nodes, and suppress activation of CD8+ lymphocytes
           and helper CD4+25- lymphocytes (Liyanage, U. K., T. T. Moore, H. G. Joo, Y. Tanaka, V.
           Herrmann, G. Doherty, J. A. Drebin, S. M. Strasberg, T. J. Eberlein, P. S. Goedegebuure,
           and D. C. Linehan. 2002. Prevalence of regulatory T cells is increased in peripheral
           blood and tumor microenvironment of patients with pancreas or breast adenocarcinoma. J
           Immunol 169:2756).

           However, the oncological significance of changes in activities and numbers of NK, LAK,
           Treg and dendritic cells still has to be confirmed.

        5. Aims / Endpoints

             -  Is the number of circulating cancer cells a determinant for cancer recurrence
                and/or survival following potentially curative resection of pancreatic cancer?

             -  Is the genetic profile of circulating cancer cells a determinant for cancer
                recurrence and/or survival following potentially curative resection of pancreatic
                cancer?

             -  Is peri-operative immunosuppression correlated with cancer recurrence and/or
                survival following potentially curative resection of pancreatic cancer?

        6. Patient selection and inclusion criteria: Potentially curable/ resectable pancreatic
           cancer

        7. Study interventions

           - Quantitative analysis of circulating cancer cells

           In the present study peripheral venous blood samples will be obtained before the start
           of surgery, at the end of surgery, on the first day after and on day 7 after surgery
           through a central venous catheter. Tumour tissue samples and random liver tru-cut
           biopsies will be obtained intra-operatively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR technique
           (TaqManR), based on 3 different target markers (CEA, CK20 and EpCAM mRNA transcripts)
           and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) as control gene, will be used to detect and quantify
           circulating cancer cells in the blood stream. Normalized copy numbers (NCN) will be
           determined in each sample (analyzed in duplicate). RNA extraction from all samples will
           be performed using RNeasy mini kit(Qiagen, BD Company). Sample preparation, cDNA
           synthesis and PCR will be performed in separated rooms in order to prevent
           cross-contamination.

           - Genetic profiling of disseminated cancer cells

           Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of mRNA extracted from the primary pancreatic tumor
           and from disseminated cancer cells before, during and the day after surgery. The focus
           of this study is not to identify specific markers for diagnosis or for drug targets but
           to find indications of metastasis through the study of gene expression in cancer cells
           circulating in the bloodstream. Our main objective is to analyze expression profiles of
           circulating pancreatic cancer cells. Changes will be analyzed in the expression of genes
           representative of several different pathways frequently altered during the progression
           of cancer such as tumor suppressors, oncogenes, signal transduction molecules, growth
           factors and angiogenesis factors. Gene expression profile data will be obtained on
           apoptosis, cell cycle, cell growth and differentiation, cell migration and motility,
           signal transduction and other cancer-related genes. Latest developments in microarray
           technology comprise the manufacturing of the complete genome and in designing new
           amplification strategies to be able to analyze very small samples less than 1 ng total
           RNA (Xiang CC, Chen M, Kozhich OA, Phan QN, Inman JM, Chen Y, Brownstein MJ. Probe
           generation directly from small number of cells for DNA microarray studies. Biotechniques
           2003; 34: 386-8, 390, 392-3. Schindler H, Wiese A, Auer J, Burtscher H. cRNA target
           preparation for microarrays: comparison of gene expression profiles generated with
           different amplification procedures. Anal Biochem 2005; 344: 92-101. Puskás LG, Zvara Á,
           Hackler L Jr, Van Hummelen P. RNA amplification results in reproducible microarray data
           with slight ratio bias. Biotechniques 2002; 32: 1330-1341). In the present study the
           number of cancer cells circulating in the blood stream is expected to be extremely
           small. Therefore, linear RNA amplification (T7 RNA-polymerase) is used in order to
           generate enough material for labeling and hybridization on the arrays. Two rounds of
           amplification are performed routinely. This has been performed successfully and
           reproducibly starting from as little as 700 cells isolated via Laser Capture
           Microdissection (data unpublished).

           - Preparation of cell suspension microarrays to isolate circulating cancer cells.

           Although most of the microarray challenges are known and under control, the present
           study has an important specific challenge that is the isolation and enrichment of the
           circulating cancer cells. Currently, the proportion of circulating cancer cells to other
           nucleated blood cells (leucocytes) is unknown in patients suffering from pancreatic
           cancer. Therefore, the first step will be to determine the number of cancer cells per ml
           blood in pancreatic cancer patients and to determine the variability among different
           patients. A second step is to develop an enrichment method to concentrate the cancer
           cells without selecting specific types of cancer cells or loss of information on the
           initial proportion of cancer cells in each patient's blood stream. The fastest way to
           isolate the circulating cancer cells is using flow cytometry after density-gradient
           pre-enrichment in combination with negative selection strategies to discard leukocytes
           (CD45+ and CD34+) from the sorted 'circulating' cancer cells. Isolating cells with LCM
           has been used many times successfully for microarray studies. It has been reported that
           LCM can easily dissect several thousands of cells from pancreatic tissue with a
           RNA-yield of around 1ng/1000 cells (Datson NA, Meijer L, Steenbergen PJ. Morsiak MC, van
           der Laan S, Meijer OC, de Kloet ER. Expression profiling in laser-microdissected
           hippocampal subregions in rat brain reveals large subregion specific differences in
           expression. Eur J Neurosci 2004; 20: 2541-54. Player A, Barrett JC, Kawasaki ES. Laser

           pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Oncogene 2002; 21: 4587-4594).

           - Immunological changes

           Since a tumor type-specific immune reaction in pancreatic cancer or in patients
           undergoing surgery is lacking, the present study will assess the systemic immunological
           changes including cytokine levels before and at different time intervals following
           potentially curative surgery in pancreatic cancer patients.

           PBMC will be extracted from peripheral venous blood and used for further analysis under
           FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) to determine the prevalence of:

             -  CD3-19+ (B-lymphocytes)

             -  CD3+56+ (Killer cells)

             -  CD3-56+CD16+ (NK natural killer cells)

             -  CD8+ (Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes)

             -  CD4+25- (Helper T-lymphocytes)

             -  CD4+25+127- (Regulatory T-lymphocytes)

             -  Inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and
                TNF) will be analysed using a commercially available 'BD Cytometric Bead Array
                (CBA) Human Inflammatory Kit'.

             -  PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and tumour tissue will be stored in
                liquid nitrogen for analysis in future studies.

        8. Statistical analysis

           Univariate analysis as well as corrected, multivariate analysis will be performed in
           order to identify the optimally combined prognostic group of factors: patient-, tumour-,
           and treatment-associated factors as well as the amounts of disseminated cancer cells,
           their genetic expression profile and immunological changes following surgery. The events
           to study will be cancer recurrence (disease free survival DFS) and death (overall
           survival OS).
