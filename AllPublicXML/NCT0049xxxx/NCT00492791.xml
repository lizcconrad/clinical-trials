      The endoscopic capsule is a new tool for exploration of the small intestine. The superiority
      of this technique on the radiological conventional examinations was shown in Crohn's disease.
      However no standardization of the lesions exists and no score of severity was proposed. The
      objective of this exploratory and multicentric study is to develop and validate an endoscopic
      score of severity especially dedicated to the examination by endoscopic capsule of the small
      intestine. Hundred twenty patients reached of disease of Crohn corresponding to various
      groups of severity will be included and will have an examination by video-capsule. The
      recorded examinations will be the standardized collection of all the lesions observed by
      independent readers, which will make it possible to evaluate the level of reproducibility of
      the detection of each lesion. Moreover, each reader will provide his total, qualitative and
      quantitative evaluations, of the severity of the attack of the small intestine. By using the
      data of only one reader, a score of severity will be built by simple linear function of the
      reproducible lesions observed. This score will be validated from the data corresponding to
      other readers of the same examinations, and those corresponding to another sample. Lastly,
      the aptitude of this score to detect the changes of the severity of the attack of the small
      intestine and to define the endoscopic cicatrization will be evaluated from data obtained
      among patients before and after treatment by infliximab or corticoids

      primary objective:Development and validation of an endoscopic score of severity of the small
      intestine adapted to its exploration by capsule among patients with crohn's disease secondary
      objectives:

        -  Study of the reproducibility of the detection of the lesions

        -  total evaluation of the severity of the small intestine (on an ordinal scale with 5
           classes and on a continuous analogical scale).

        -  Study and validation of the sensitivity to the change of the score of severity
           (variation among patients after treatment by Infliximab or corticoids).

        -  Evaluation of the aptitude of the endoscopic score of severity to define the endoscopic
           cicatrization.

        -  Study of the correlation between the endoscopic score of severity and a clinical marker
           of activity: Crohn' S Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and a marker of inflammation: serum
           level of C-Reactive protein (CRP).

        -  Validation of the utility of &quot;Patency Agileâ„¢&quot; used before the capsule. All the patients
           included will have before their endoscopic capsule an examination by patency. After
           validation, the patients will have an exploration by the video capsule. The readers will
           fill a grid with standardized lesions. The films will be read by two other independent
           readers. The patients treated by infliximab or prednisone will have one second capsule
           afterwards 10 weeks.
