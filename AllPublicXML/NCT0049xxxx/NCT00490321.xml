  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of LVADs in providing
      long-term circulatory support for patients who have chronic stage D heart failure and are
      ineligible for a heart transplant.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, which is
      comprised of two independent modules.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients with Stage D heart failure who are not transplant candidates are treated
      with a spectrum of therapies, including specialized medical management as well as mechanical
      support with an LVAD approved by FDA for destination therapy. However, there is substantial
      variation in the therapeutic approaches employed to treat these patients, with relatively low
      numbers of patients receiving DT LVAD therapy to date. Therefore, the VentrAssist DT trial is
      designed to provide maximal flexibility to the investigators/clinicians to incorporate their
      clinical judgment in managing these complex patients.
