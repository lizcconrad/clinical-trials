  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of optimized temporary biventricular
      pacing (BiVP) in patients undergoing open-heart surgery with preoperative LV dysfunction and
      an intraventricular conduction delay. This study will compare extended temporary
      biventricular pacing versus standard of care by assessing patients randomized to the two
      groups, from the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass, until the conclusion of pharmacologic
      circulatory support in the intensive care unit. In addition, effects of biventricular pacing
      will be tested in all patients, at three time points, using different measures of blood flow.
      Results from this research will demonstrate whether temporary BiVP improves cardiac output
      after open-heart surgery and whether ventricular pacing optimization increases cardiac output
      in this setting. Success would lead to the development of recommendations for use of BiVP
      postoperatively and would stimulate the development of pacemakers with appropriate features.

      The primary hypothesis is that the optimum pacing protocol (POPT) will increase cardiac index
      (CI) by 15% (from approximately 2.30 to 2.64 L/min/m2) compared to standard of care as
      measured by thermodilution 12-24 hours postoperatively. Secondary objectives include defining
      POPT at three time points within 24 hours of surgery. The investigator will examine which
      forms of cardiac dysfunction benefit from temporary pacing using direct and indirect measures
      of perfusion and cardiac function. The investigator will also analyze survival, length of
      stay, incidence of arrhythmias, and cost of postoperative care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biventricular pacing (BiVP) reverses intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) and left
      ventricular (LV) dysfunction in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). BiVP improves LV function and
      cardiac index (Cl) at no energy cost. In the MIRACLE trial, in patients with DCM, IVCD and LV
      ejection fraction &lt;35%, demonstrated improved subjective and objective measures of exercise
      tolerance and cardiac function with BiVP. BiVP benefits many, but selection criteria are not
      fully developed, and 30% of recipients are &quot;nonresponders,&quot; at a cost of more than $2
      billion/year. Preliminary data suggest that BiVP can benefit patients with low output states
      after cardiac surgery. This study will assess surgical application of BiVP while assessing
      mechanisms of action and optimization. 190 cardiac surgery patients will be randomized with
      LV dysfunction preoperatively to paced and standard of care groups. BiVP will be optimized
      and continued postoperatively until patients are stable. BiVP will be assessed transiently in
      all patients at three time points. The primary end point is a 15% improvement in thermal
      dilution Cl measured in the intensive care unit (ICU). Effects of heart rate,
      atrioventricular delay, ventricular pacing site, and interventricular delay on Cl will be
      assessed using a randomized sequence of data collection. Secondary endpoints include
      incidence of arrhythmias, inotropic support, urine output, weight gain, morbidity, mortality,
      and ICU costs. These studies are important because of a high probability of clinical benefit.
      The methods employed will provide precision, breadth of measurement, and range of pacing
      sites superior to any other setting. The protocol will provide new and important scientific
      information that will benefit not only surgical patients but also the general population of
      BiVP recipients.

            <description>After weaning from bypass, patients received temporary biventricular pacing for 24 hours. Values obtained from optimization testing determined pacemaker settings (AVD, VVD, heart rate).
Optimization Testing: Atrioventricular (AVD) and interventricular (VVD) delays and left ventricle lead site location were optimized after weaning off bypass (Phase I), after sternal closure (Phase II), and 12 to 24 hours (Phase III) after bypass. Intrinsic heart rate was also optimized in Phase III.
Temporary Biventricular Pacing: Continuous temporary biventricular pacing for 24 hours at a heart rate of 90 bpm or 10 bpm above intrinsic heart rate.</description>
