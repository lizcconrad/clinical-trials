  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts. The first part is a survey to examine vision-specific
      health-related quality of life in a cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis. We test
      visual impairment like visual acuity, visual field, colour discrimination, contrast
      sensitivity, eye movement. The aim of this part is to examine the association between
      responses to the quality of life scale and objective measures of visual impairment.

      The second part is an open controlled study, in which we measure motion detection threshold
      in MS patients with oscillopsia due to pendular nystagmus and in a group of control subjects.
      The objective of this part is to determine whether patients with pendular nystagmus develop
      adaptation to oscillopsia using increased threshold of motion detection. We plan to test the
      effect of visuo-motor rehabilitation on this threshold in patients with oscillopsia due to
      pendular nystagmus.

      In the first part, 100 patients with multiple sclerosis are included. A vision-specific
      health-related quality of life scale and neuro-ophthalmological tests are administered. The
      duration of intervention is about 3 hours by patient and one year to finish this part.

      In the second part, we include about 40 of 100 MS patients who present an oscillopsia due to
      pendular nystagmus and a group of 20 control subjects. The patients and subject will perform
      a motion detection task and the vision-specific health-related quality of life, the
      intervention lasting 1 hour. Then the patients will be randomized in one group treated by
      rehabilitation (one 30 mn session per week during 3 months) and the other one without
      treatment. A motion detection task and the vision-specific health-related quality of life
      scale will be performed at the end of the treatment for both groups.
