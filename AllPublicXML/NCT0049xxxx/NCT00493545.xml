      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of HspE7 and Poly-ICLC
      when given together

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 600 million people worldwide are infected with the Human Papilloma Virus. In
      the majority of cases people can clear the virus on their own however in cases where the
      infection is not recognized or is left untreated, the result can be cervical cancer.

      This study will examine the safety and tolerability of Hsp-E7 and Poly-ICLC administered
      together as a vaccine for Cervical Intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). There will be 4 cohorts
      of subjects in the study each given a higher dose than the one prior providing that prior
      dose has been well tolerated and deemed to be safe.

      Subjects will be immunized every 28 days for a period of 8 weeks (3 administrations).

      Posttreatment evaluation will occur 4 weeks after the last of 3 injections. Subjects with CIN
      2 or 3 disease at the time of enrollment will be eligible to undergo clinically appropriate
      therapeutic treatment of the cervix at the twelfth of the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically documented Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 1, 2 or 3.

          2. Nonpregnant, Nonlactating female greater than or equal to 18 years of age, who is
             either surgically sterile, postmenopausal (no menses for the previous 12 months), or
             practices an effective method of birth control (to be continued throughout the study
             period) as determined by the Investigator (eg: oral contraceptives, injectables or
             implants, intrauterine device, double-barrier methods). The use of cervical cap or
             diaphram is not permitted).

          3. Geographically accessible for ongoing follow up and committed to comply with all
             visits.

          4. Judged to be in good health based upon the results of a medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs and laboratory profile.

          5. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed
             consent.

          6. Negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, HIV-2, Hepatitis B surface antigen,
             and hepatitis C Virus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Prior to Therapy:

          1. Prior exposure to HspE7.

          2. The subject received immunotherapy (eg, interferons, tumor necrosis factor,
             interleukins, or biological response modifiers [GM CSF, G CSF, M CSF]) within 4 weeks
             (28 days) prior to study entry.

          3. Taken within 7 days or is currently taking selective Cox-2 inhibitors and other
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

          4. Received investigational systemic drugs within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to study entry.

          5. Undergoing active treatment of genital warts.

          6. Has taken astemizole within 7 days prior to study drug administration.

        Disease Status:

          1. Has an autoimmune disease that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the
             safety of the subject in this study. Some examples of autoimmune disease that may be
             considered exclusionary include rheumatoid arthritis, systematic lupus erythematosus,
             and autoimmune thyroiditis.

          2. Has a recognized immunodeficiency disease, including cellular immunodeficiencies,
             hypogammaglobulinemia, or dysgammaglobulinemia. The subject has hereditary or
             congenital immunodeficiencies.

          4. Has had a splenectomy.

          5. Has an infectious process that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the
             subject's ability to mount an immune response.

          6. Has a history of severe allergic reaction to insect bites or stings, or to any
             biologic pharmaceutical product, including compounds similar to the test article.
