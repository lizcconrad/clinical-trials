  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor
      sirolimus as a treatment for renal angiomyolipomas in patients with tyberous sclerosis
      complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inherited mutations of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene cause tuberous sclerosis while acquired
      (somatic) mutations of either gene are associated with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis
      (LAM). Renal angiomyolipomas are a feature of both disorders. TSC1 and TSC2 regulate
      signalling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Inhibition of mTOR may
      result in a decrease in size of TSC 1/2 assciated lesions. We are treating patients with
      tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in a non-randomised,
      open label pilot study of safety and efficacy. Change in size of renal angiomyolipomas is the
      primary end point
