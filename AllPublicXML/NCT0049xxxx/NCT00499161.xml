  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to examine the effect of Patient-Centered
      Care (PCC) on a patient's level of satisfaction on discharge from an acute healthcare
      setting. Findings from this study will assist in determining if PCC, administered by nurses,
      should be instituted hospital wide.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. To examine the effect of Patient-Centered Care on patient satisfaction.

        2. To examine the effect of Patient-Centered Care on the quality of patient care.

        3. To examine the effect of patient's perception of nursing care on patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-Centered Care (PCC), also known as individualized patient care or negotiated care,
      focuses on the patient's right to have his/her values and beliefs respected as an
      individual.This respect is viewed as part of a commitment to build a deep understanding of
      the patient as a thinking and feeling individual with the ability to change and develop. A
      person-centered model of care requires a nurse to work with an individual's beliefs, values,
      wants, needs and desires.This adaptation to a patient's personal needs requires the nurse to
      be flexible, respectful, and reciprocal when providing patient care. If the patient's
      expectations are not appropriate to the type of care needed to heal or if the patient refuses
      or denies a specific type of treatment that is known as influencing ones quality of care, the
      nurse must negotiate with the patient. Negotiation incorporates education, which is believed
      to increase the patient's level of understanding. In addition, negotiation allows the nurse
      and patient to define a level of treatment that is specific to the patient's needs but still
      seen as a quality indicator.

      The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has listed PCC as one of six national quality aims for
      improvement. The IOM's vision is that all health professionals will be educated to provide
      and deliver PCC as part of an interdisciplinary team. In 2001, the IOM report &quot;Crossing the
      Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century&quot; recommends a mixture of approaches
      to achieve their vision . These approaches include an appropriate training environment,
      research, public reporting and leadership. At present, there is little evidence to support
      the critical role nurse clinicians' play in providing PCC and satisfying patient's needs.
