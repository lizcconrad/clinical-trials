      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of Vitamin D on renal phosphate and bone
      loss, which are common in HIV infected adolescents and young adults being treated with
      tenofovir.

      ATN 063 tests the hypothesis that in a population of adolescents and young adults with HIV
      infection who are being treated with tenofovir as part of an antiretroviral (ARV) combination
      regimen, vitamin D supplementation will decrease renal phosphate loss, increase plasma
      phosphate, decrease plasma PTH, and improve markers of bone turnover, including a decrease in
      plasma N-telopeptide and BAP.
