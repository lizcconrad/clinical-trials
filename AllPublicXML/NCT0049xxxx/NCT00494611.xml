  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are more than 140,000 new cases of colon cancer diagnosed each year, and over 60,000
      Americans die from colon cancer annually. To date, surgical resection remains the mainstay of
      treatment for colon cancer. However, between 35% and 45% of patients, despite colon surgery,
      retain unseen tumor cells in the bloodstream or in small clumps in the liver or other
      tissues. It is for this reason that postoperative chemotherapy (anti-tumor drugs) is
      recommended and given to some patients after surgery. Conventional chemotherapy is usually
      started no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after the colon cancer has been resected.

      Despite surgery and conventional chemotherapy, a significant number of patients develop
      cancer recurrences and many go on to die from the cancer. For this reason, investigators
      continue to look for new cancer treatments and approaches. The study under consideration
      proposes to give colon cancer patients an anti-cancer therapy for 3 weeks before and for 3
      weeks after undergoing operation to remove the colon cancer. This time period is referred to
      as the &quot;perioperative period.&quot; Presently, around the world, doctors do not administer any
      type of anti-cancer therapy during the perioperative period. It is the belief of the
      investigators carrying out this study that this period may be an ideal time to fight the
      tumor and that treatment given during this time may improve survival and reduce cancer
      recurrence rates. Patients who choose to receive this biologic anti-cancer treatment
      immediately before and after surgery can also receive conventional chemotherapy at the usual
      time (4-6 weeks after surgery). Thus, this perioperative anti-cancer treatment would not
      interfere with the standard chemotherapy regimens used today.

      The drug that is to be given in this study is called Cetuximab (also known as &quot;Erbitux&quot;).
      This is an anti-cancer drug which has already been approved by the FDA for use in patients
      who have colon cancer. This drug, like all of the other anti-cancer drugs used for treating
      colon cancer, has been given either well after surgery or to patients with very advanced
      disease who have not undergo surgery. What is unique about the St. Luke's Roosevelt study is
      that the drug will be given during the 3 weeks before surgery and for the first 3 weeks after
      the colon resection surgery.

      To summarize, Cetuximab is a humanized antibody to EGFR which has been shown to be effective
      in killing tumor cells in patients with colon cancer.

      In this study the Cetuximab is to be given 1) after the surgery, 2) immediately before the
      operation, or 3) both before and after surgery. Entry into the study means that the operation
      may be delayed for at least 3 weeks in order for the drug to be given. Since many patients
      who do not participate in any research studies wait at least that long for surgery this does
      not constitute a delay. The drug has a safety profile and has been well tolerated, in
      general. However, since thus far it has not been given in the weeks immediately prior to or
      immediately after major surgery there is no safety profile for this drug during the
      perioperative period. The primary goals of this preliminary study are to establish the safety
      of Cetuximab in the perioperative period and to demonstrate that the preoperative doses have
      an actual impact on the tumor cells themselves.

      Cetuximab's tumor growth inhibitory mechanism directly blocks EGFR. After binding to EGFR,
      the antibody blocks signal transduction through the receptor with a subsequent inhibition of
      tumor cell proliferation and MMP expression. We hypothesize that peri-operative weekly
      administration of Cetuximab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to EGF receptor (EGFR), for 3
      weeks immediately prior to surgery and for 3 weeks immediately after colon cancer surgery is
      safe. This drug has been demonstrated to be effective in Stage 4 colon cancer patients and is
      approved for use in colorectal cancer patients. Cetuximab has never been administered in the
      month immediately before or after colon surgery. Establishing the safety of Cetuximab in the
      perioperative setting is the primary objective of this study.

                  the potential risk factors associated with an unintentional pregnancy in this
                  setting. In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to
                  any sexual partner of childbearing potential and should practice an effective
                  method of birth control.)
