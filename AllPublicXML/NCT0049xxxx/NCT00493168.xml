    <textblock>
      The first aim of this study is to determine how often unrecognized myocardial infarction
      occur in patients using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique (known as delayed
      enhancement MRI), as compared to the electrocardiogram. The second aim of this study is to
      determine the severity of coronary heart disease of the patients with unrecognized myocardial
      infarction. The final aim is to determine how the presence of unrecognized myocardial
      infarction detected by the MRI affects lifespan.

      Unrecognized myocardial infarction (MI) is known to constitute a substantial portion of
      lethal coronary heart disease. However, since the diagnosis of unrecognized MI is based on
      the appearance of incidental Q-waves on 12-lead electrocardiography, the syndrome of
      unrecognized non-Q-wave MI has not been described. Delayed-enhancement cardiovascular
      magnetic resonance (DE-CMR) can accurately identify non-Q-wave MI. The aims of this study are
      three-fold: 1. to determine the prevalence of unrecognized non-Q-wave and Q-wave MI, 2. to
      define predictors of unrecognized non-Q-wave MI, 3. to determine the prognostic significance
      of unrecognized non-Q-wave MI.
