  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A poor outcome in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is often related to tunnel
      position. The researchers believe that improving the accuracy of tunnel position will lead to
      an improved outcome in ACL surgery. The researchers' purpose is to perform a controlled study
      on a series of 500 patients in two groups: group I (250 cases) using conventional
      instrumentation and group II (250 cases) using navigation (Surgetics ACL Julliard protocol).

      This study compares the percentage of patients in 2 groups (full success) at 1 year of follow
      up. The results were evaluated on clinical outcome based on the IKDC (International Knee
      Documented Committee, subjective evaluation) form between one group using conventional
      instrumentation and another group using navigation.

      Secondary Aims:

        -  To compare in 2 groups:

             -  Gain of IKDC score at one year (based on pre-operative IKDC score)

             -  Evolution of IKDC subjective (pre-operative, at 12 months)

        -  To compare performances at one year (% class A or B) in terms of initial instability
           measured with laximetry score

        -  Study of the learning curve

        -  Evaluate: lasting quality, complication rate, extra-operative time

        -  Evaluate frequency of thrombovenous complications

        -  Evaluate delay to return to sport
