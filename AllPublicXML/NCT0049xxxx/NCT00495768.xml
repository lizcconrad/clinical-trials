  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an 8-visit
      non-pharmacologic group intervention in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in
      veterans who receive IFN and ribavirin for the treatment of Hepatitis C. We hypothesize that
      over the first 6 months of treatment with IFN and ribavirin for the 45 patients who receive
      the 8-visit intervention early in the course of treatment in addition to usual care
      (experimental group) will have lower scores on the CES-D, a standard depression rating scale,
      than the 45 patients who receive only usual care (control group).

      In this study, subjects will be randomly assigned (by chance, like the flipping of a coin) to
      one of two study groups. Half the subjects will be assigned to a training program, which will
      consist of 8 sessions over a period of 8 weeks in which they will be instructed in cognitive
      therapy ( a method of identifying and &quot;talk back&quot; to one's negative thoughts) and a variety
      of other stress-reducing techniques. The other half will be assigned to a control groups,
      which will no receive instruction in cognitive therapy or the other stress-reducing
      techniques. All subjects, both those in the training program and in the control group, will
      receive the usual care for hepatitis C that all patients in the Hepatology Clinic receive.
      All subjects will also be asked to participate in 6 testing visits over the course of the
      study. The first testing visit will last about 3 hours, which the others will last between 1
      1/2 and 2 hours. Subjects will alo be interviewed by telephone about their personal and
      family medical and psychiatric history. This will take about an hour.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligibility and interest in treatment for chronic HCV (Hepatitis C).

          -  Absence of co-infection of HIV or Hepatitis B.

          -  Age 25-68 years old.

          -  No treatment with IFN (interferon-alpha) in the past 6 months.

          -  Residence within a 3-hour drive of the clinic.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo treatment with PEG-interferon and ribavirin. They
             must be aware of the side effects of treatment and be motivated to self-administer the
             medications and come to regularly scheduled appointments.

          -  Patients with diabetes mellitus must have good glycemic control. Their Hgb A1 c must
             be &lt;8.0%.

          -  Patients must not have an active malignancy.

          -  If patients have a history of severe psychiatric illness or are found to have one by
             screening with the CES-D, a psychiatrist must approve treatment. If the psychiatric
             problem is minor, it can be managed by the primary care physician or hepatitis C
             provider.

          -  Autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosis, or
             sarcoidosis, is a contraindication to treatment.

          -  Active alcohol or intravenous drug use is a contraindication to treatment.

          -  Patients with a seizure disorder muct be seizure-free for 6 months prior to treatment.

          -  Patients with a known history of coronary heart disease are excluded.

          -  Patients with complications of cirrhosis may not be treatment candidates. Those who
             have a platelet count of &lt;50,000, large esophageal varices (grade 3-4), uncontrolled
             ascites, or uncontrolled encephalopathy are excluded.

          -  Patients with severe mental retardation or dementia are excluded because of difficulty
             in self-administration of medication and in tolerating the side effects.

          -  The patient and partner much agree to observe strict contraception to avoid pregnancy,
             since the medication is fetotoxic up to 6 months after treatment completion.
