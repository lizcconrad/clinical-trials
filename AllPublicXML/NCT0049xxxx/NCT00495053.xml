  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a new product that uses human gene
      transfer (called hMaxi-K) when it is given to patients with overactive bladder. Human gene
      transfer is a new type of therapy that is the process of placing genetic material (DNA or
      RNA) into a person. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety parameters
      occurring subsequent to administration of a single intravesical instillation of study drug.

      Three different dose groups of hMaxi-K will be tested in this study consisting of 5000,
      10,000 and 15,000 micrograms. hMaxi-K will be given as a single administration into the
      bladder through a catheter. Each women's participation in the study will last for up to 24
      weeks (followed by an additional 18 month follow-up period).

      The safety parameters to be monitored include: adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms, physical examinations.

      The secondary objectives is to evaluate efficacy of a single intravesical instillation of
      hMaxi-K compared to the control group. Efficacy parameters that will be evaluated are: mean
      number of micturitions per 24 hours, mean number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours,
      mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours, overall maximum bladder capacity, number of
      uninhibited contractions during the cystometry procedure, participant rating of urgency
      score, participant rating of perceived bladder condition severity, participant assessment of
      response to treatment, participant rating of Quality of Life (Kings Health Questionnaire),
      SF-12 Health Survey, International consultation on incontinence questionnaire, weight
      measurement of accidental bladder leaks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy women of 18 years of age or older and non-childbearing potential

          -  clinical symptoms of overactive bladder for 6 months or longer including at least one
             of the following:

               1. frequent urination (that is, having to go to the bathroom 8 or more times per
                  day)

               2. symptoms of urinary urgency, which is experiencing a sudden need to pass urine
                  that is difficult to hold back; or the complaint of waking at night two ore more
                  times to urinate

               3. urge urinary incontinence which is that complaint of leakage of urine that cannot
                  be stopped accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency 5 or more times per
                  week.

          -  Non-response or poor tolerance to previous treatment for symptoms of overactive

          -  Stress urinary incontinence as determined by observation of the participant coughing
             while standing with a full bladder and/or response of 2 or 3 on the following Stress
             Urinary Incontinence question: Do you experience leakage when laughing, coughing,
             lifting heavy objects or other types of discreet, moderately intense activities?
             0=NONE: No leakage 1=MILD: Minimal leakage on rare occasions during these types of
             activities; easily tolerated; do not use pads for this 2=MODERATE: Enough leakage that
             it requires occasional use of pads and may interfere with usual activity &amp; tasks
             3=SEVERE: Extreme leakage and discomfort that stops all activity &amp;/tasks and requires
             use of pads on all occasions
