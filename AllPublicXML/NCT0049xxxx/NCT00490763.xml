  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if men who have a type of prostate
      cancer that has been classified as &quot;low risk&quot; can safely not be treated for the disease.
      Doctors want to know if patients with &quot;low risk&quot; cancer can avoid or postpone therapy and the
      related side effects and still live as long as patients who immediately receive therapy.

      This is an investigational study. There are no medications used in this trial.

      About 1,000 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      You have an early stage of prostate cancer that can be treated effectively with surgery or
      radiation. If you choose to take part in this study, you will be agreeing to receive only
      active surveillance. Active surveillance is an investigational way to manage low-stage small
      volume prostate cancer. While on active surveillance, you will have no treatment for the
      prostate cancer. However, you will have repeated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) tests,
      physical exams, and other testing to detect when the cancer is becoming a greater risk which
      may require you to begin treatment.

      If you agree to participate in this study, you will not have standard therapy for prostate
      cancer. Your diagnosis will be confirmed as being of low risk by tests at MD Anderson. Blood
      will be drawn for PSA tests at the beginning of the study and every 6 months to monitor your
      cancer.

      You will have a biopsy of the prostate at the beginning of the study. Additional prostate
      biopsies will be performed at your first repeat biopsy at Year 1, and when a doctor thinks it
      is necessary.

      You will have digital rectal examination every 6 months to see if your doctor can feel any
      prostate nodules. You will have a transrectal ultrasonography every 12 months to see if your
      doctor can detect any abnormalities in the prostate.

      Additionally, you will fill out 7 surveys at the beginning of the study and again every 6
      months about how you are coping with the disease and the quality of your life. Each survey
      will take 5 to 10 minutes to complete.

      While you are on study, if an exam or test results show that your disease is getting worse,
      you will be given the opportunity to have treatment to remove the cancer. If you do choose to
      receive treatment, you will be taken off study and continue to receive standard follow-up.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Every 12 months, the study staff will review your medical record or you will be called or
      e-mailed and asked how you are doing. If you are called, the call would only last a few
      minutes.

      This is an investigational study. About 1,000 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients will have histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the prostate within six
             months of study entry.

          2. Patients must agree to have repeat extended 11-core multisite biopsy (sextant
             locations, midline, and 2 cores each from the left and right anterior horn) of the
             prostate at study entry. A baseline prostate biopsy is not indicated if a repeat
             biopsy following the extended biopsy scheme (at least 10 biopsy cores) was performed
             at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) within 6 months of
             study entry.

          3. Patients who have clinically localized cancer defined by pathologic and PSA criteria
             to be very low-risk/low-risk, patients with clinically localized cancer [not low-risk]
             who have refused early intervention or chosen active surveillance as a management
             option, and patients with clinically localized cancer who are precluded from local
             therapy because of comorbidities.

          4. Patients must agree to comply with the surveillance schedule.

          5. Non-English speaking patients may participate in the study, but they will not be
             required to complete the surveys.

          6. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active noncutaneous malignancy at any site.

          2. Prior radiation therapy for treatment of the primary tumor.

          3. Planned concomitant immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation
             therapy while on protocol.
