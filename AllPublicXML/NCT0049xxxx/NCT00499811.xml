      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat in treating
      patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphoma and liver dysfunction.
      (closed for accrual as of 04/05/2010) Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Vorinostat may have different effects in
      patients who have changes in their liver function.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetic disposition of vorinostat (SAHA) in patients with metastatic
      or unresectable solid tumors or lymphoma and varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      II. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of vorinostat
      in groups of patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction (mild, moderate, or
      severe).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Document the non-DLTs associated with administration of vorinostat in patients with
      hepatic dysfunction.

      II. Determine the association of the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic dysfunction with
      the observed toxicities, plasma pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of vorinostat
      administration.

      III. Document any antitumor activity associated with vorinostat treatment in patients
      enrolled on this study.

      OUTLINE: This is a parallel-group, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according
      to level of hepatic dysfunction (normal vs mild vs moderate vs severe). (closed for accrual
      as of 04/05/2010)

      PART I: Vorinostat (SAHA) will be administered as a single oral dose on day -6 for all
      patients. Blood samples are obtained periodically on day -6 for pharmacokinetic studies.

      PART II: One week later (day 1), the first course of oral vorinostat will be initiated on a
      continuous daily oral regimen. Each treatment course will consist of 21 days of therapy.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Dose escalation will proceed within each hepatic dysfunction group (except in the normal
      group). Only dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occur during the first cycle of treatment
      will be used to guide dose escalation. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the highest dose
      at which no more than one instance of DLT is observed (among 6 patients treated). Once the
      MTD has been determined for a given hepatic dysfunction group, a maximum of 12 patients will
      be accrued to this dose level.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

    <time_frame>Days -6 and 1 of course 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Wilcoxon test will be used for PK data. Concentrations of vorinostat and 2 metabolites (vorinostat glucuronide and 4-anilino-4-oxobutanoic acid) will be quantitated with a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric method that was developed and validated in our laboratory. Plasma concentration versus time data for vorinostat and metabolites will be analyzed non-compartmentally using the LaGrange function as implemented by the Lagran computer program.</description>

    <measure>MTD of vorinostat based on incidence of DLT</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is the highest dose at which no more than one instance of DLT is observed (among 6 patients treated). The MTDs determined in this study represent a simple summary of the relationship between the dose of vorinostat that can be administered with acceptable toxicity and a patient's level of liver dysfunction. Treatment-related events occurring during the first course of treatment are considered DLTs.</description>

    <measure>Toxicity profile of vorinostat</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The maximum grade of toxicity for each category of interest will be recorded for each patient and the summary results will be tabulated by category, grade. Tabulations will be separate for each liver dysfunction group, and may also be separate for each dose level within a group, if appropriate. For grade 3-4 toxicity, analyses will utilize Fisher's exact test.</description>

    <description>The Child-Pugh Classification and its association with toxicity and PK data will be studies in an exploratory analysis. For grade 3-4 toxicity, analyses will utilize Fisher's exact test; for PK data, the Wilcoxon test will be used. In addition, the correlation between the level(s) of liver dysfunction (bilirubin and/or synthetic (albumin), hepatocellular (bilirubin, ALT, AST) and/or ductal (gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatase) parameters and alterations in the PK of vorinostat will be evaluated with Spearman's test</description>
