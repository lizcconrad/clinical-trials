      Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)
      who have failed a first-line chemotherapeutic regimen containing oxaliplatin and
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with or without bevacizumab, with or without other Investigational
      Medicinal Products (IMPs), will receive CP-4055 200 mg/m2/day intravenously (IV) on Day 1-5
      every four weeks until complete response or disease worsening/progressing.

      This is a multicentre clinical study conducted in the United Kingdom. It is an open label
      study designed to investigate objective response rate (RR), the time to progression (TTP) and
      the duration of tumor response in patients with colorectal cancer when treated with CP-4055.
      The quantitative and qualitative toxicities of the treatment will also be assessed.
