      Primary:

      • To compare the efficacy of nasal fentanyl (NF) to oral transmucosal fentanyl (Actiq®)
      (hereafter Actiq) in the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients.

      Secondary:

        -  To compare patients' general impression and preference of NF and Actiq

        -  To explore the relationship between NF doses and dose of current opioid for breakthrough
           pain (BTP) and the relationship between dose of NF and of background opioid

        -  To assess safety and tolerability of NF

             opioid treatment for background pain.

          -  Minimum three BTP episodes per week and maximum four per day. Life expectancy of at
             least three months.

          -  Chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy (except facial radiotherapy) are allowed.

          -  Randomisation in previous studies with NF, i.e. FT-016-IM, FT-017-IM or FT-018-IM, is
             not allowed.

          -  Previous use of Actiq is accepted.
