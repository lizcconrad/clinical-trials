  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess if
      PRO95780 in combination with two different irinotecan-containing regimens is safe and
      tolerable in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have progressed following,
      or cannot tolerate, first-line therapy with 5-fluorouracil-, oxaliplatin-, and
      bevacizumab-containing regimens. This study will also make a preliminary assessment of the
      anti-tumor activity of PRO95780 in combination with irinotecan and cetuximab or the FOLFIRI
      regimen plus bevacizumab.
