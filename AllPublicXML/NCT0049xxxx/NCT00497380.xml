    <textblock>
      Muscle catabolism is a major problem in cancer patients undergoing surgery as it negatively
      affects post-operative recovery. Recent evidence exists that protein metabolic changes are
      already apparent in cancer before muscle wasting is being present. In line, patients with
      breast cancer, generally characterized by a normal nutritional status, were recently found to
      be arginine deficient. Arginine deficiency in cancer can be explained by: 1) Reduced arginine
      availability, due to exhaustion of endogenous (muscle) sources of arginine 2) Enhanced
      arginine catabolism, due to conversion of arginine by arginase, which is abundant in tumors.
      Protein is the most important endogenous source of arginine. Arginine deficiency will lead to
      a negative feedback loop in cachexia by promoting protein breakdown in an attempt to restore
      plasma arginine levels. We hypothesize that pre-operative arginine supplementation in breast
      cancer patients diminishes the occurrence of muscle wasting after surgery by 1) normalizing
      arginine availability pre-operatively, resulting in conservation of protein, 2) diminishing
      the catabolic effects of surgery by supplying exogenous arginine for the post-operative
      response, 3) enhancing the anabolic capacity to feeding through supplying substrate for
      protein synthesis.

      In the present proposal, the effects of surgery and cancer will be examined by comparing
      subjects undergoing breast surgery because of malignancy vs. prophylactic reasons (aim 1).
      Furthermore, the effects of one-week pre-operative protein feeding with or without enrichment
      with arginine on post-operative protein metabolism (aim 2) will be investigated in the cancer
      group. Variables of interest are: 1. Whole-body and skeletal muscle protein metabolism, whole
      body arginine turnover and de-novo arginine production rate, and the anabolic capacity to
      feeding(assessed by stable isotope methodology). 2. Body weight, muscle mass and functional
      status, score for well-being (assessed by Profile of Mood State and Mini Mental State).

      In the present study, we propose that a nutritional supplement that is high in protein
      content and enhanced in arginine will be more effective than a typical commercial nutritional
      supplement in diminishing the catabolic effects of surgery in subjects with cancer, thereby
      optimizing their quality of life. If this is found to be the case, this would provide the
      basis for reformulating the nutritional composition in accord with the effects of cancer and
      surgery on protein metabolism.
