    <textblock>
      This is a two group randomized design that will compare a novel therapy package (i.e.,
      Research supported treatment intervention, Contingency-based voucher incentives for the male
      partner's drug abstinence, Specialized MI couples counseling) to standard care for helping
      drug using partners of drug dependent pregnant women obtain and maintain drug abstinence.
      Participants will be followed for 22 weeks and have scheduled twice weekly urine sample
      collection and all participants will have follow-up interviews post-study entry.
