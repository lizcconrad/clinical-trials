      The purpose of this exploratory study is to assess the efficacy and safety of nesiritide in
      participants with acute (a quick and severe form of illness in its early stage) heart failure
      (when the heart inadequately pumps blood through the body) including acute exacerbation of
      chronic (lasting a long time) heart failure, administered intravenous (into a vein) bolus (a
      large amount) followed by intravenous infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein
      by way of a needle).

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are
      told which treatments the participants are receiving, &quot;unblinded&quot;), multi-center (when more
      than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), randomized (study
      medication assigned by chance), stepwise, bolus plus intravenous infusion, fixed-flexible
      (arbitrary dose titration [slow increase in drug dosage, guided by participant's responses])
      study. The study consists of 3 periods: Observation period (from the time of obtaining
      consent to the start of study treatment), Treatment period, and Follow-up period (from 24
      hours after the initiation of study treatment [discontinuation] to 30 days after the
      initiation of study treatment). The participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the
      following 3 treatment groups: 2+0.005 group, 1+0.01 group and 2+0.01 group. The treatment
      period consists of treatment with bolus injection (over 1 minute) followed by intravenous
      infusion (over 24 hours: Period 1 [fixed-dose period] of 3 hours and Period 2 [flexible-dose
      period] of 21 hours).The study will be conducted stepwise and hence, initially participants
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following 2 groups: 1+0.01 group and 2+0.005 group.
      Participants will receive nesiritide at an initial dose of 0.005 or 0.01 microgram per
      kilogram per minute (mcg/kg/min), and the dose escalation of 0.005 mcg/kg/min per dose will
      be conducted every 3 hours up to maximum of 0.03 mcg/kg/min in Period 2. Safety data of at
      least 5 participants will be assessed for each group, and after confirming the safety of 2
      groups, the participants will be assigned to third group of nesiritide 2 microgram per
      kilogram (mcg/kg) +0.01 mcg/kg/min. Then participants will be followed up to a maximum of 30
      days after the initiation of study treatment, in follow-up period. Participants will
      primarily be evaluated for the effect of nesiritide on hemodynamic parameters such as
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), or if it is unmeasurable then it will be
      complemented with pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure (PADP). Participants' safety will
      also be monitored throughout the study.

        <description>The PCWP was a measured hemodynamic parameter.

        <description>The CO was a measured cardiopulmonary hemodynamic parameter. It is the volume of blood expelled by the ventricles of the heart with each beat. It was calculated as the product of stroke volume (output of either ventricle per heartbeat) and the number of beats per minute. Cardiac output is commonly measured by the thermodilution technique.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Cardiac Output (CO) at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 24 Hour</title>
          <description>The CO was a measured cardiopulmonary hemodynamic parameter. It is the volume of blood expelled by the ventricles of the heart with each beat. It was calculated as the product of stroke volume (output of either ventricle per heartbeat) and the number of beats per minute. Cardiac output is commonly measured by the thermodilution technique.</description>
          <population>The PPS included participants who met the eligibility criteria, received at least 1 dose of study medication and had one efficacy assessment after randomization except those who had significant protocol deviations. Here, n=the participants evaluated for this measure at a particular time point.</population>

        <description>The SV was a calculated hemodynamic parameter and the calculation was done on the basis of the measured hemodynamic parameters. Stroke volume is the volume of blood ejected from a ventricle at each beat of the heart, equal to the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume. SV was calculated by dividing CO and heart rate (HR).</description>

        <description>The SVI was a calculated hemodynamic parameter and the calculation was done on the basis of the measured hemodynamic parameters. Stroke volume is the volume of blood ejected from a ventricle at each beat of the heart, equal to the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume. The stroke volume index is a method of relating the stroke volume to the size of the person by dividing the stroke volume by the body surface area (BSA).</description>

        <description>Assessment of Dyspnea (difficult or labored breathing) was done using Borg scale.

        <description>The urinary volume was measured because nesiritide has a diuretic effect. Measurement of hour urine was done in the observation period and treatment period. 1-hour urine before treatment initiation was measured in the observation period. In the treatment period, 1-hour urine for period 1 and 3-hour urine for period 2 was measured. Urinary volume was recorded for participants without urethral catheterization having spontaneous micturition when needed.</description>
