  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non-randomized, non-comparative Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the
      PK profile, safety and tolerability of intravenous ( i.v.) daptomycin. Non-infected subjects
      with end stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal
      dialysis (CAPD) will be enrolled in this in-patient study.
