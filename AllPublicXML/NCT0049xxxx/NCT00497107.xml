    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing UFT/LV
      and UFT/LV + PSK in patients with histological stage IIIa/IIIb colorectal cancer who have
      undergone curative surgery without residual cancer using 3-year disease free survival (DFS)
      as the primary endpoint, and also to analyze the 3-year overall survival (OS), compliance,
      adverse events, quality of life (QOL) and relationship with tumor factors.

      To conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing chemotherapy using UFT/LV and
      immunochemotherapy using UFT/LV combined with PSK in patients with histological stage IIIa
      and IIIb colorectal cancer (adenocarcinoma) who have undergone curative surgery without
      residual cancer (R0) using 3-year disease-free survival rate as primary endpoint, and also to
      analyze the 3-year overall survival, compliance, adverse events, QOL and relationship with
      tumor factors.
