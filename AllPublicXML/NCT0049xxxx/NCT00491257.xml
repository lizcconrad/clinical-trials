      This study is designed to generate clinical data as outlined in the Note for Guidance on
      harmonization requirements for influenza vaccine marketing authorization by the European
      Medicines Agency.

      The objectives of the trial are:

        -  To determine immunogenicity, of the inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccine Northern
           Hemisphere (NH) 2007-2008 formulation in terms of the requirements of the Committee for
           Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) Note for Guidance (NfG) CPMP/BWP/214/96.

        -  To describe the safety of the inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccine, NH 2007-2008
           formulation.
