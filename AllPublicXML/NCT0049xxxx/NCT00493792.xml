      A prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial is proposed to compare Stryker Orthopaedics
      N2Vac Polyethylene to their X3 Polyethylene when used with the Triathlon Posterior Stabilized
      (PS) total knee system.

      This is a fixed-bearing knee intended for use in patients undergoing cemented total knee
      arthroplasty. The devices to be used are both FDA approved via 510k clearance.

      A total of 572 cases (286 per group) will be entered. Each patient will be assessed
      pre-operatively and post-operatively at three months and two, five, seven and ten years. The
      primary endpoint will be the revision rate at ten years. The result for these will be
      analyzed using an unconditional test of equivalence between two independent binomials.
      Chi-square analysis will be used to compare the instance of mortality, revision surgery, deep
      vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, neurovascular complication, and infection. Other outcome
      measures incorporated in the Knee Society Clinical rating scale will undergo appropriate
      generalized linear regression for the type of outcome involved. The primary aim of the study
      is to compare the survivorship of two types of polyethylene (conventional N2Vac and highly
      cross-linked X3) used in a fixed-bearing total knee system in patients undergoing cemented
      total knee arthroplasty. These results will be measured through radiographs at each
      post-operative interval with an independent radiograph review being performed after all
      patients have reached 7 and 10 year follow-up. Secondary results will also be collected and
      will focus on disease-specific (Knee Society Scores), global (SF-12 v1), and outcome
      measures. Radiographic results consisting of standing anteroposterior, lateral and Merchant
      views of the surgical knee will be recorded and analyzed. Completion of the initial
      investigation will occur at the 10-year interval after the last enrolled.
