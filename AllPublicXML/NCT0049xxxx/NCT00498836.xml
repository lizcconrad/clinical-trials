      Patients with metastatic malignant melanoma will receive CP-4055 200 mg/m2/day intravenously
      (IV) on Day 1-5 every four weeks and sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. (twice daily) every day until
      complete response or disease worsening/progressing.

      This is a multicentre clinical study conducted in the USA and in Europe. It is an open label
      study designed to investigate objective tumor response, the time to progression (TTP) and the
      duration of tumor response in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma when treated with
      CP-4055 in combination with sorafenib (Nexavar®). The safety and tolerability of the
      treatment will also be assessed.
