  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

      Assess whether CL (caused by Leishmaniasis major) lesions treated with WR279396 improved the
      cosmetic outcome compared with no treatment (natural healing)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Evaluate the cosmetic outcome of CL lesions treated with &quot;vehicle&quot; compared with no
           treatment (natural healing)

        2. Evaluate the cosmetic outcome of CL lesions treated with &quot;vehicle&quot; compared with
           WR279396

             -  To determine whether CL lesions treated with vehicle improves the cosmetic outcome
                (compared with natural healing)

             -  To determine whether CL lesions treated with vehicle alone provides a cosmetic
                outcome similar to WR279396

    <time_frame>Day 360 or greater</time_frame>
    <description>The primary cosmetic outcome measure is the Clinical Scar Rating, based on a modified Vancouver Scar Score (mVSS). The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of persons judged to have either a &quot;superior (no scar)&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot; rating (see below).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Included are volunteers who participated in WRAIR 813 (HSRRB Log # 9768.1) and those
             who participated in another CL study in/around the WRAIR 813 study site who had been
             assigned to a &quot;no-treatment&quot; (natural healing) arm. All volunteers will have had
             documented CL in the past that were treated with WR279396, vehicle, or no treatment
             (natural history), have signed informed consent, and are willing to comply with study
             assessments; age range: 5 to 75 years old.

          -  For study subjects who were enrolled in WRAIR 813 in 2004 (WR279396 or vehicle
             treated):

               -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject or guardian

               -  Willing to meet the requirements of the single clinic visit

               -  Prior data in the clinical site data base documenting a diagnosis of CL

               -  Each lesion for inclusion in this study conforms to WRAIR 813: ³ 1 cm in diameter
                  and was primarily ulcerative (i.e., not verrucous or nodular)

               -  The index lesion and others to be scored were proven parasitologically by Giemsa
                  slide smear

               -  CL scars documented to be &gt; 360 days old (clock starts at time of diagnosis)

               -  No treatment of the lesions other than that received in the previous protocol

          -  Study subjects from the earlier studies to serve as &quot;no treatment&quot; controls:

               -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject or guardian

               -  Willing to meet the requirements of the single clinic visit

               -  Same age range as WRAIR 813: 5-75 years old at time of diagnosis

               -  Prior data in the clinical site data base documenting a diagnosis of CL, and that
                  the volunteer was assigned to the &quot;no treatment&quot; group

               -  Each lesion for inclusion in this study will conform to WRAIR 813: at the time of
                  diagnosis, ≥1 cm in diameter and described as primarily ulcerative (i.e., not
                  verrucous or nodular)

               -  At least 1 lesion that was proven parasitologically by Giemsa slide smear for
                  inclusion in the earlier study.

               -  CL scars documented to be &gt; 360 days old (clock starts at time of diagnosis)

               -  Never received any treatment of the lesions (natural healing) or applied any
                  medication, such as herbal medication

               -  Lesions present on the trunk or extremities, to match the WRAIR 813 study
                  volunteers (no facial lesions were treated in the 2004 study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential volunteers without a prior documented diagnosis of CL
