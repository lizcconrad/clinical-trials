      Purpose of the study:

      The purpose of this study is to make sorafenib available for patients with advanced Renal
      Cell Carcinoma, who have failed prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (i.e. requiring
      second line treatment), and who do not have access to or are not eligible for other clinical
      trials with sorafenib and who may benefit from treatment with sorafenib.

      Patients will be treated orally with 400 mg bid sorafenib on a continuous basis and as a
      single agent. Patients may continue treatment until Disease Progression, intolerable
      toxicity, the patients chooses to withdraw consent or the patient is unlikely to benefit any
      further from treatment.

      Overall, participation in the study will help determine the following:

        -  Find out if patients receiving Sorafenib will live longer

        -  Find out if Sorafenib helps to slow the worsening of kidney cancer

        -  Find out if Sorafenib has an effect on the tumours

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must provide written informed consent prior to receiving BAY 43-9006

          -  The male or female patient must be at least 18 years of age

          -  The patient must have advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma

          -  The patient must have failed at least one prior systemic established therapy for
             advanced RCC (e. g. IL-2, IFN-a), or must have been unable to tolerate systemic
             therapy for advanced RCC, or is deemed by the Investigator to be unsuited for systemic
             therapy for advanced RCC

          -  A patient, who has received prior systemic and local therapies, must have completely
             recovered from acute toxicity (i. e. resolved back to CTCAE Grade 1 or less, or is
             considered as not going to resolve), if any, prior to study entry

          -  The patient must be, in the Investigator's opinion, reasonably likely to benefit from
             treatment with BAY 43-9006 as a single agent

          -  The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             of 0-2

          -  The patient will not require other systemic anti-cancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy
             (including monoclonal antibodies) or hormonal therapy, except for bisphosphonates
             while taking BAY 43-9006

          -  Both male and female patients must use adequate barrier birth control methods (oral
             contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, intrauterine devices, condoms,
             sterilization) during their participation in the protocol. The birth control methods
             must be used for 4 weeks for female patients and for 3 months for male patients after
             discontinuation of treatment with sorafenib

          -  For patients, who have had major surgery, the wound must be completely healed prior to
             receiving BAY 43-9006 treatment (4 weeks)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in or have previously participated in any other
             sorafenib trial

             study)

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test performed within seven days of the start of study drug (please
