  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of our study is that metabolic and hemodynamic improvements following
      gastric bypass surgery are mediated by downregulation of inflammation-related adipokines
      produced by the intra-abdominal adipose tissue such as Visfatin.

      Central obesity represents a major risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular complications. Obesity is often associated with insulin resistance and
      abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines. Adipose tissue and especially omentum
      (adipocytes and resident macrophages) release several cytokines. Visfatin corresponds to a
      protein identified previously as pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), a 52-kilodalton
      cytokine expressed in lymphocytes. [1] Visfatin exerted insulin-mimetic effects in cultured
      cells and lowered plasma glucose levels in mice. Mice heterozygous for a targeted mutation in
      the visfatin gene had modestly higher levels of plasma glucose relative to wild-type
      littermates. Surprisingly, visfatin binds to and activates the insulin receptor.

      Adipose tissue protein and mRNA expression of Visfatin (PBEF) has not been investigated in a
      single study design with regard to the relationship to fat distribution, insulin resistance
      and other metabolic risk factors, especially in morbidly obese individual undergoing weight
      loss surgery. Therefore, we propose the following specific aims: Investigate the protein and
      mRNA expression of Visfatin (PBEF) in the peripheral (subcutaneous) and visceral (omentum)
      adipose tissues of morbidly obese subjects and their relationships to the changes in body
      composition, fat distribution, insulin sensitivity and time-dependent reversal of
      co-morbidities following gastric bypass surgery.
