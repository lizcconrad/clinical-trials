  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve blocks provide many advantages for patients (excellent pain control and
      reduction in nausea) undergoing upper and lower limb surgery however several commonly
      occurring complications can produce annoying but sometimes serious adverse effects. The
      interscalene brachial plexus block (ISBPB) is one such technique, commonly performed for
      shoulder surgery, but also produces paralysis of the diaphragm, Horner's syndrome and
      sometimes vocal cord paralysis with standard volumes of local anesthetic. This threat of
      these side effects limits the use of ISBPB in many patients who would particularly benefit
      e.g. patients with lung disease. Recently the use of ultrasound guidance is allowing
      practitioners to place smaller volumes of local anesthetic with much greater accuracy. This
      can potentially avoid anesthetizing important adjacent nerves to the target structure. If
      ultrasound-guided techniques with smaller volumes of local anesthetic could be demonstrated
      to reduce the incidence of complications without reducing effectiveness this would be very
      beneficial for patients.This will be the first randomized, double blind study to evaluate if
      an ultrasound-guided ISBPB with low volumes of local anesthetic can reduce complications for
      patients whilst maintaining quality of anesthesia and pain relief in the intra-operative and
      postoperative period.
