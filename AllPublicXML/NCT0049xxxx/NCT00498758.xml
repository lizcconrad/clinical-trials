      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits of a biomechanical wedge system - The
      APOS system, for improving the stability of gait, mobility and quality of life in Parkinson's
      disease patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a biomechanical wedge system was developed for gait and balance training among
      patients suffering from gait disorders. The APOS system (APOS Medical &amp; Sports Technologies
      Ltd, Hertzeliya, Israel) applies special semispherical shoes, with individually adjusted
      implants, to improve age- and disease-related loss in muscle strength and neuromuscular
      control. The semispherical rubber devices that are placed on the soles of the shoes at the
      hind-foot and mid-foot can be moved medially, laterally, forwards and backwards. The system
      can be individually adjusted in order to optimally balance loading and re-train postural
      control during gait. An additional advantage of this treatment approach is the extraordinary
      compliance. The system is easily adjusted, maintained, and allows safe gait training.

      After randomization, all subjects will be fitted with the APOS system, These shoes alter the
      dynamic balance during all gait cycle phases, adjusting the center of gravity and training
      postural control.

      The precise location of the two wedges is adjusted individually by expert trainers using
      standardized protocols. Subjects in the intervention group will receive a proper wedge;
      subjects in the sham group will receive an almost flat wedge that lacks the proper
      biomechanical characteristics. However, both shoes and wedges will look similar. All subjects
      will be instructed to start gradually, with a goal of reaching 30 minutes of in-home walking
      while wearing the special training shoes. As an extra pre-caution, all subjects will be asked
      to walk with the shoes only in the presence of a caregiver, spouse or other family member
      during the first month. Before moving to more independent training, subjects will be checked
      for safety.
