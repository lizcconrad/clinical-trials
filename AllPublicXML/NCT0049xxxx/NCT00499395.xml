      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET imaging, may be effective
      in detecting residual disease after radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases in patients
      with colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET imaging to see how well it
      works for early detection of residual disease in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation
      of liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the sensitivity and specificity of fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET imaging in
           detecting residual disease within 48 hours after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver
           metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the findings on day 7 after RFA using FDG-PET imaging in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET imaging at baseline. They then undergo
      percutaneous laparoscopic or intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Patients then
      undergo further FDG-PET scans within 48 hours and 7 days after RFA. FDG-PET images are
      evaluated for residual disease, including focal FDG uptake at the site of ablation. Beginning
      1 month after RFA, patients undergo contrast-enhanced MRI for routine post-ablation
      follow-up. MRI scans are performed at 1, 4, 7, 12, 18, and 24 months after completion of RFA.

    <description>All patients will undergo pre RFA PET prior to ablation for intra and extrahepatic staging and to assess FDG avidity of the lesions. When evaluating patients with liver metastases, we routinely obtain a dedicated liver PET study (Liver View) after the whole body PET. Patients will undergo two post RFA PET scans as part of this project: PET # 1) within 32 hours after RFA. The patients having percutaneous RFA will undergo PET on the same day after the clinical studies at the PET facility are completed; this will be within 8 hours after RFA. In case of laparoscopic and intra-operative RFA, PET will be performed on the following day after the clinical studies are completed; this will be within 32 hours after RFA. PET # 2) on day seven after RFA</description>
