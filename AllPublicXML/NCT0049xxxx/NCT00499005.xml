      Intramuscular carbetocin is as effective as intramuscular syntometrine for the prevention of
      postpartum haemorrhage

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum haemorrhage(PPH)or excessive bleeding at or after childbirth is a potentially life
      threatening complication and is one of the major contributors to maternal mortality and
      morbidity worldwide (Lewis 2001).Among the various agents that have been studied in addition
      to the routine oxytocin and syntometrine (which has adverse effects),oxytocin agonist
      (carbetocin) appears to be the most promising for this indication(Chong 2004).

      Carbetocin is a licensed medication for the use of prevention of postpartum haemorrhage in
      Singapore and many other countries. It is a long-acting synthetic octapeptide analogue of
      oxytocin with agonist properties.The clinical and pharmacological properties of carbetocin
      are similar to those of naturally occurring oxytocin. Like oxytocin, carbetocin binds to
      oxytocin receptors present on the smooth musculature of the uterus, resulting in rhythmic
      contractions of the uterus, increased frequency of existing contractions, and increased
      uterine tone. In pharmacokinetic studies, intravenous injections of carbetocin produced
      tetanic uterine contractions within two minutes, lasting six minutes, followed by rhythmic
      contractions for a further hour.Intramuscular injection produced tetanic contractions in less
      than two minutes, lasting about 11 minutes, and followed by rhythmic contractions for an
      additional two hours. The prolonged duration of activity after intramuscular compared with
      the intravenous carbetocin was significant(Hunter 1992). In comparison to oxytocin,
      carbetocin induces a prolonged uterine response when administered postpartum, in terms of
      both amplitude and frequency of contractions.

      The potential advantage of intramuscular carbetocin over intramuscular oxytocin is its longer
      duration of action. Its relative lack of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side-effects
      should also prove advantageous compared to syntometrine and other ergot alkaloids.
