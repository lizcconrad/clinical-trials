        Inclusion Criteria (The following are general criteria; more specific criteria are included
        in the study protocol):

          -  Approved and listed for cardiac transplantation.

          -  Patient for whom LVAD implantation is planned as a clinically indicated bridge to
             cardiac transplantation.

        Exclusion Criteria(The following are general criteria; more specific criteria are included
        in the study protocol):

          -  Presence of heart conditions that would contraindicate LVAD implantation by adversely
             affecting patient survival or LVAD function.

          -  Primary coagulopathy or platelet disorder; contraindication to anticoagulant or
             anti-platelet agents.

          -  Presence of any mechanical circulatory support other than intra-aortic balloon pump.
