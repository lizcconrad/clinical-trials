      Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood-onset
      neuropsychiatric disorder (7.5% in Taiwan) with great impact on individual, family, and
      society. The diagnosis of ADHD is mainly based on clinical interview of parents and children
      with assistance of teachers' reports. Self-administered rating scales are useful for
      screening, assistance of diagnosis, and measurement of symptom changes over time or due to
      treatment effect. The goals of this study are to establish the norms and psychometric
      properties of the Chinese version of teacher and parent forms of the Swanson, Nolan, and
      Pelham, version IV (SNAP-IV) and the teacher, parent, and student forms of the Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for future studies on ADHD in Taiwanese populations.

      Subjects and Methods: This is a cross-sectional, school-based survey with a multi-stage
      sampling method. The participants include a school-based sample of 3534 first to eighth
      graders was recruited from four areas: Taipei City, Taoyuan County, Tainan City and Chiayi
      County. Among them, 200students will be reassessed at 2-week interval for the test-retest
      reliability study. The instruments comprise the Chinese version of Child Behavioral Checklist
      (CBCL), SDQ, SNAP-IV, and Adult ADHD Rating Scale. The informants include student
      participants older than 10 years old, their parents, and teachers. The main statistical
      methods include Pearson correlation, intraclass correlation, Chronbach's Î± for internal
      consistency, and mixed model to address lack of independence within the same classes and
      schools.

      Anticipated Goals: We expect that this study will reach the following objectives:

        1. to obtain the primitive information about the prevalence of ADHD symptoms and
           emotional/behavioral problems among children and adolescents in Taipei and Yun-Ling;

        2. to enhance the awareness of school teachers and counselors about ADHD and other
           behavioral/emotional problems among students;

        3. to establish psychometric properties of the Chinese versions of SNAP-IV and SDQ for
           future use in clinical, school, and research settings.
