    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, phase II study testing ITF2357 in a population of very
      high-risk relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.

      The patients will receive 50 mg ITF2357 four times a day at 6-hour intervals in fed
      conditions for 28 consecutive days unless evidence of progressive disease, presence of
      unacceptable adverse events or patient's request to discontinue treatment occurs.

      Decision regarding the continuation of ITF2357 will be made on:

        -  the basis of tumor reassessment upon completion of cycle defined as above and not later
           than 7 days and

        -  the occurred toxicity (if any). If complete response or partial response or
           stabilization of disease after first cycle, without concomitant relevant toxicities is
           observed, the treatment may continue as long as there is no evidence of progressive
           disease or appearance of unacceptable adverse events. In any case the treatment shall
           not exceed 84 days of drug intake overall (i.e. 12 weeks).

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis and patients will be followed regularly
      with physical and laboratory tests, as specified in the protocol; in case of hospitalization,
      the treatment will be continued or interrupted according to the Investigators' decision.

      The study will accrue 23 patients evaluable for efficacy and the anticipated duration of the
      study is about 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes involved in the remodeling of chromatin, and have a
      key role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In addition, the activity of
      non-histone proteins can be regulated through HDAC-mediated hypoacetylation. In recent years,
      inhibition of HDACs has emerged as a potential strategy to reverse aberrant epigenetic
      changes associated with cancer, and several classes of HDAC inhibitors have been found to
      have potent and specific anticancer activities in preclinical studies.

      Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a relatively uncommon lymphoma histotype, with an incidence in
      Italy of approximately 1700 new cases per year (approximately 12% of all lymphomas).
      Combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy cures approximately 70 percent of
      advanced-stage HL. Fifty percent of the failing patients can be salvaged by second line
      chemotherapy (mainly high-dose regimens), while the remaining patients eventually die by
      disease progression. The development of an effective salvage regimen for this
      refractory/resistant population represents a true unmet medical need.

      The use in the latter patient subset of HDAC inhibitors, like ITF2357, is supported by
      several considerations. Namely: (1) a chemically related HDACi hydroxamate has shown activity
      in this clinical condition; (2) the drug markedly inhibits the production of several
      cytokines, and cytokine production in HL granuloma has a defined role in the pathogenesis of
      HL; (3) an effective treatment for refractory/relapsed HL is presently lacking; (4) ITF2357,
      up to 200 mg daily per os, has shown a favorable toxicity profile. All the above mentioned
      arguments represent a strong rationale prompting the use of ITF2357 in this patient
      population.
