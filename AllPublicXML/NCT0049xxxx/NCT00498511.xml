  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy are recommended in men and
      post-menopausal women with iron deficiency anemia. Due to lack of data on the yield of these
      endoscopies in young men, they are currently investigated as older men. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate prospectively the prevalence of various gastrointestinal lesions in young men
      with iron deficiency anemia. Our hypothesis is that the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in
      young anemic men without gastrointestinal symptoms is very low, especially if a potential
      lesion is detected during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Therefore, this study will try to
      identify predicting factors regarding the yield of both endoscopies. Another purpose is to
      evaluate the outcome of patients with negative endoscopic results, during a follow-up of two
      years.
