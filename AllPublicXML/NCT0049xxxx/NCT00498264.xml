  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a syndrome expressed by chronic widespread body pain which leads to
      reduced physical function and frequent use of health care services. Exercise training is
      commonly recommended as a treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supervised resistance muscular exercise
      (RME) and walking program (WP) are effective in the treatment of FMS on decrease of pain.

      The practical of the RME reduces the pain of participants with FMS.

      This study will evaluate and compare the effectiveness of a supervised resistance muscular
      exercise (RME) , walking program (WP)and control group (just observation) in women with FMS
      during 16 weeks, on decrease of pain.

      Participants will undergo an assessment including medical some questionnaires to assess their
      FMS symptoms at baseline, after 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 28 weeks.
