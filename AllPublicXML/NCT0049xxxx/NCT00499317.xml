  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a condition with several causes
      of which some remain unknown. It is believed that some types of CP may be genetic or passed
      down (inherited) from one generation to the next.

      In this study, we are collecting genetic material and medical information to try to determine
      if there are genetic factors may play a role in CP/CPPS. We will be collecting DNA (from
      Saliva) and urine from each participant. Individuals and families with CP/CPPS will be
      enrolled. Family members of an individual with CP/CPPS are eligible whether or not they also
      experience CP/CPPS symptoms.

      To further describe the phenotype of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome
      (CP/CPPS) and to correlate the phenotypic information with the genotypic findings utilizing
      linkage analysis, whole exome sequencing and candidate gene studies. Each individual
      participant will be required to give a DNA sample (via Saliva) and a urine sample and answer
      2 questionnaires. All samples will be stored.
