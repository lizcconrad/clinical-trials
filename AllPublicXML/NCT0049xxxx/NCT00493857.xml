    <textblock>
      This study will determine if nimotuzumab provides a benefit in this type of cancer when given
      in combination with irinotecan.

      The study will test:

        -  How long any good effects last.

        -  How bad any side effects are.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      The primary goal is to assess the Objective Response Rate (ORR) that the combination of
      irinotecan and nimotuzumab will produce in patients with irinotecan-refractory metastatic
      colorectal cancer

      Secondary:

        -  To assess the incidence of Grade 2 or greater acneiform rash or infusion reaction,
           allergic reaction or anaphylactoid reaction AEs in patients with irinotecan-refractory
           metastatic colorectal cancer following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules;

        -  To assess Progression-Free Survival (PFS), defined as time from date of randomization
           until date of disease progression (clinical or radiological) or death due to any cause,
           for the two nimotuzumab schedules;

        -  To assess the rates and durations of Stable Disease (SD) following weekly or 2-weekly
           nimotuzumab schedules;

        -  To assess the Time to Disease Progression (TTP) following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab
           schedules;

        -  To evaluate ORR in patients who are identified as having &quot;primary&quot; irinotecan resistance
           following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules;

        -  To evaluate Overall Survival (OS) following weekly or 2-weekly nimotuzumab schedules;

        -  To compare the two dosing schedules of nimotuzumab with respect to objective response
           rates and safety;

        -  To evaluate the overall safety and toxicity profiles of these two dose regimens of
           nimotuzumab;

        -  To evaluate trough levels and accumulation of nimotuzumab in serum of patients receiving
           the drug on weekly or 2-weekly regimens.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient will receive nimotuzumab every 2 weeks plus irinotecan. Nimotuzumab will be given
      at a dose of 400 mg once every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Irinotecan will be given at the same
      dose and schedule as the last dose and schedule given during the most recent pre-study
      irinotecan containing therapy. If the tumour does not show signs of further growth after 12
      weeks of treatment, the patient will continue receiving nimotuzumab 400 mg every 2 weeks for
      up to 18 months or as long as they are getting a benefit from the drug.
