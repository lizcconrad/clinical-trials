             others.

          -  Subject's psychotic symptoms have not improved with a therapeutic dose of
             antipsychotic treatment over the last 2 years.

          -  The subject is experiencing his/her first episode of schizophrenia.

          -  The subject has another psychotic disorder or has a history of autistic disorder or

        In addition to the criteria described above, subjects will be evaluated at screening to

        specific measures of the subject's health, including psychosis (mental health -the extent
        to which subject is unable to think clearly), heart condition, and pregnancy status.
        Patients may be excluded from the study based on these assessments (and specifically if it
