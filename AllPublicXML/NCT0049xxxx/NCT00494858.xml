      This study will compare the effectiveness of two types of cognitive behavioral therapy in
      treating adult women with the dysregulated subtype of bulimia nervosa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bulimia nervosa (BN) is a common eating disorder that is characterized by periods of bingeing
      and purging. People with the dysregulated subtype of BN experience behavioral impulsivity;
      disruption of cognitive, affective, behavioral, and neurophysiological processes
      (dysregulation); interpersonal dysfunction; and poor treatment response. To date, no
      therapies have been tested for this specific population, and it is unknown whether therapy
      that directly focuses on treating BN symptoms or one that addresses both eating and
      personality disorder symptoms is more effective. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which
      concentrates on modifying patients' behaviors and ways of thinking, has been effective in
      treating BN. This study will compare the effectiveness of two types of CBT, focused and
      broad, in treating adult women with the dysregulated subtype of BN.

      Participants in this single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive 20 sessions of
      either broad (enhanced) or focused CBT. Participants will meet with a therapist once or twice
      weekly until 20 sessions have occurred. Broad CBT will address symptoms of BN, as well as
      those of the personality disorder. Focused CBT will concentrate only on BN symptoms. Before
      treatment begins, participants will complete a set of questionnaires pertaining to their
      experiences with BN, depression, anxiety, and interpersonal relationships. The questionnaires
      will be used throughout the study to assess participants' progress. Participants will also
      attend a clinical interview lasting approximately 3.5 hours. Questions will concern BN, other
      eating disorder symptoms, depression, anxiety, and interpersonal relationships. Blood samples
      and vital signs will also be taken at the time of the clinical interview and as needed later
      in the treatment process.
