      Ulcerative colitis is a systemic disease we assume that extra intestinal involvement as we
      describein our study( Fireman Z, Osipov A, Kivity S, Kopelman Y, Sternberg A Fireman E:
      Assessment of pulmonary involvement in Crohnâ€™s disease by induced sputum. Am J Gastroenterol
      2000;95(30):730-734. )

      Twenty Ulcerative colitis patients and 20 control subjects (all nonsmokers) without
      respiratory symptoms will be tested. The induce sputum by 20' inhalation of 3.5% saline using
      ultrasonic nebulizer. Samples will studied by differential counts of 200 cells on cytopreps
      stained by Giemsa. T-lymphocyte subset analyses were done by FACS using three monoclonal
      antibodies: CD3 = total T cells, CD4 = T helper cells, and CD8 = T suppressor-cytotoxic
      cells. CD4/CD8 &gt;2.5 was considered abnormal.
