      This research study is testing a new treatment of cancer of the head and neck.

      Purpose

      This research study is being done to:

        1. Test the safety of the experimental cancer vaccine made of dendritic cells. An
           experimental vaccine is one that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration
           (FDA).

        2. To learn what effects (good and bad) the vaccine will have on you and your head and neck
           cancer.

        3. To learn if the vaccine will stimulate your body's white blood cells, which are part of
           your immune system (your body's natural defense system).

    <textblock>
      White blood cells are part of the body's defense system. Sometimes when you have cancer, your
      body does not know that the cancer cells are making you sick. We hope to teach your white
      blood cells to find and destroy your cancer cells with a vaccine. The vaccine will be made
      from a special kind of blood cell called a dendritic cell. This is the cell that will carry
      the information about your cancer to your white blood cells in your body.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in patients with unresectable recurrent
             disease or distant metastasis or patients who fail conventional radiation therapy
             and/or chemotherapy and refuse surgical salvage.

          -  Presence of cervical metastasis that is able to be accessed for injection

          -  Biopsy accessible tumor (metastatic or primary)

          -  &gt;18 years of age.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained ≤14 days prior to registration:

               -  ANC ≥1500

               -  PLT ≥100,000

               -  Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤3 x UNL

               -  AST ≤3 x UNL

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 x UNL

          -  Life expectancy ≥6 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2.

          -  No chemotherapy for prior 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Nursing women.

          -  Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate
             contraception (condoms, diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine
             device {IUD}, abstinence.)

          -  Known HIV infection.

          -  Concurrent use of systemic immunosuppressants.

          -  Other immunocompromising condition that in the opinion of the physician renders the
             patient a poor candidate for this trial.

          -  Other active cancer requiring therapy to control the disease.

          -  Unwillingness to return for follow-up evaluations over a period of up to 2 years
             following completion of protocol therapy.

          -  Other intercurrent medical problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             make participation in the study hazardous for the patient

          -  Patients in whom the otolaryngologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist
             can not agree on a consensus node to treat.

          -  Patients with CNS metastasis or involvement of sites where an inflammatory response
             would constitute an immediately life threatening situation.
