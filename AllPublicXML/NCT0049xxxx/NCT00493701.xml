    <textblock>
      In the past 3 years we have identified a &quot;thrifty-phenotype&quot; characterized in lean men by an
      inability to adapt rapidly to a high fat diet and associated with a low maximal VO2 and high
      fasting insulin. We hypothesize that the individuals with the &quot;thrifty phenotype&quot; are at
      higher risk for becoming obese, and that exercise may be effective in overcoming this
      problem.

      Several questions remain to be answered regarding the &quot;thrifty&quot; phenotype. First, given the
      large interindividual differences, how can we identify those at the highest risk? What are
      the distinguishing biochemical, endocrine and environmental characteristics of individuals
      that store fat when exposed to high fat diets? This is important because if these individuals
      can be easily identified, then dietary interventions can be targeted to this &quot;at-risk&quot;
      population.

      Second, what is different about the individual with the &quot;thrifty phenotype&quot;? Are there
      cellular pathways that are dysregulated in the skeletal muscle of these individuals when
      compared to controls? Is the defect intrinsic, i.e. a diminished ability to conserve glucose
      and oxidize fat in skeletal muscle or alternately, is the phenotype due to environmental, and
      dietary factors such as inactivity and energy excess?

      To answer these questions, we have planned a three-year project that aims to:

        -  Characterize the biochemical, endocrine, anthropometric and environmental
           characteristics of individuals with the &quot;thrifty&quot; phenotype.

        -  Identify the signaling pathways in skeletal muscle that are dysregulated in individuals
           with the &quot;thrifty&quot; phenotype through mRNA expression profiling in skeletal tissue.

        -  Determine the role of environmental factors such as inactivity and caloric intake vs.
           intrinsic (genetic) factors in the &quot;thrifty&quot; phenotype.
