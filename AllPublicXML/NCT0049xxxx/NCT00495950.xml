      The goal of this study is to measure the amount of limb swelling (lymphedema) that sometimes
      occurs after melanoma treatment, and to find out how people feel and react to the diagnosis
      and treatment of melanoma.

      If you choose to take part in this study, you will have measurements taken of your arms or
      legs using a Perometer and a bioimpedance machine. The Perometer is a machine that painlessly
      measures the fluid in your limb using two-directional infrared lights. These lights are
      located in the frame of the machine that encircles the arm or leg during the measurement. The
      bioimpedance is a machine that measures the fluid in your arm or leg by passing a very small
      current through the body similar to an electrocardiogram (EKG). These very small currents are
      located in electrodes that are placed on the hands and feet during the measurement. Both
      machines are able to pick up changes in limb size.

      You will also be asked to complete a set of questionnaires relating to any symptoms that you
      may experience in your limbs and/or trunk (chest, stomach, and hip areas) during and
      following your standard cancer treatment.

      Additional questionnaires, along with your limb measurements, will be done at your
      regularly-scheduled follow-up clinic visits, 3-6 months, 9-12 months, 15-18 months, 21-24
      months and 27- 30 months. You will complete the additional questionnaires using a laptop
      computer or a hardcopy. The measurements and questionnaires will take 45-60 minutes to
      complete each time.

      Some of the data from this study may be sent to the University of Missouri for analysis. The
      data that is sent will not have any personal identifiers. Researchers at University of
      Missouri will not be able to link the data to the protected health information or personal
      identity of any individual participant.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 350 patients will take part in this study. All
      patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
