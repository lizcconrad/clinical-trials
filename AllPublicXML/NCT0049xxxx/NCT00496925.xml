    <textblock>
      We examine the usage of Dopamine blockers in OCD patients. We want to examine their frequency
      of usage, compare the course of the disease between those who receive and those who do not
      receive Dopamine blockers, and efficacy of the treatment.

      The study will be done in two stages: 1. Collecting information the usage of Dopamine
      blockers from 150 OCD patients' files. 2. interviewing 60-70 patients to see the difference
      those who receive and those who do not receive Dopamine blockers in their current severity of
      disease.
