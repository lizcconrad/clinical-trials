  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many younger men are diagnosed with prostate cancer. These patients are often choosing
      radiation therapy as their primary treatment. The effect of this therapy on fertility will
      have a direct impact on their decision about therapeutic options and fertility preservation.
      The researchers hypothesize that when patients are treated with radiation for localized
      prostate cancer, infertility can occur due to direct damage to seminiferous tubules affecting
      sperm quality.

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignant disease among men. Many young men are diagnosed
      with localized prostate cancer. Some of these men are choosing to manage their prostate
      cancer with radiation therapy. The radiation therapy delivers minimal dose exposure to
      adjacent organs. We hypothesize that when patients are treated with radiation therapy for
      localized prostate cancer, decreased fertility can occur due to damage of seminiferous
      tubules, which may affect sperm quality. This study will assess the impact of radiation
      therapy on semen and seminal fluid.
