    <textblock>
      Coronary-stent implantation is commonly performed for treatment of acute myocardial
      infarction (MI). Drug eluting stents (DES) among selected patients have been shown to reduce
      target lesion revascularization (TLR) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
      However, there is no studies comparing titanium-nitride-oxide (TITANOX) coated stent with
      paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) in acute MI.

      Study Design and Patient Population

      The TITAX AMI (Titanium-Nitride-Oxide Coated stents versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents In Acute
      Myocardial Infarction) trial is a prospective, randomized and a multicenter trial conducted
      from December 2005 to November 2006 in six Finnish hospitals. The study was conducted
      according to the declaration of Helsinki and written informed consent was obtained from all
      patients. This protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of the coordinating centre
      Satakunta Central Hospital and the participating hospitals.

      Patients &gt; 18 years of age presenting with acute MI (NSTEMI or STEMI) were eligible for this
      trial. Exclusion criteria included unprotected left main disease, ostial or restenotic
      lesions, contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel or heparins, life expectancy of less than
      12 months and if a stent longer than 28 mm was needed. According to the trial protocol,
      randomization was performed after visualization of the culprit lesion or a totally occluded
      infarct-related vessel during coronary angiography. Using sealed envelopes, patients were
      randomly assigned to the groups in a 1:1 ratio in each participating center.
