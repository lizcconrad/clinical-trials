  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find out if Interferon-beta can recover its effectiveness in patients with
      Multiple Sclerosis who have previously developed neutralizing antibodies to Interferon-Beta.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open Label, non-comparative Phase IV trial. Eligible Patients will
      receive treatment with Interferon-beta-1a (AVONEX) 30mcg I.M. once weekly for up to 12
      months.

      In the wash-out period prior to commencing treatment with AVONEX, patients will receive
      treatment with intermittent Methylprednisolone 500 mg PO Daily for three consecutive days at
      monthly intervals.

      The patients will be examined clinically and laboratory tests will be performed at screening
      (month -1) and after 3, 9, and 15 months.

      Neutralizing antibody(NAb)titres and Binding antibody(BAb)titres as well as MxA protein
      levels will be evaluated at screening/baseline (month -1/0) and after 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15
      months.
