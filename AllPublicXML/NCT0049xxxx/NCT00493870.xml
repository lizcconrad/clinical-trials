  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good and bad) TC or TAC has
      on early stage HER2- breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both TAC (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) and TC (docetaxel and
      cyclophosphamide) are established adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early stage breast
      cancer. TAC, however, due to the inclusion of the anthracycline doxorubicin, carries a high
      risk of hematologic and cardiotoxic adverse effects. Substantial evidence supports the
      concept that early stage HER2-negative breast cancers will benefit similarly from
      anthracycline-based adjuvant and non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

      Further, approximately 0 to 9% of HER2-negative breast cancers have alterations in the TOP2A
      gene, which may predict for benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

      We hypothesize that 6 cycles of TC versus 6 cycles of TAC will have similar efficacy in the
      treatment of early stage HER2-negative breast cancer and that TC will have less toxicity. If
      this hypothesis were upheld and the anthracycline doxorubicin could be eliminated from the
      regimen while obtaining similar efficacy in this population of patients, it would not only be
      an important advance in the understanding of the biology of cancer, but it would also be of
      significant clinical benefit to women with breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A woman will be eligible for inclusion in this study if she meets all of the following
        criteria:

          -  Has HER2 nonamplified disease, confirmed by FISH

          -  Has known menopausal status (see Section 7.3 for criteria)

          -  Has operable, histologically confirmed, Stage I, IIA, IIB, or IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC
             invasive carcinoma of the breast. Bilateral synchronous breast cancer is allowable
             provided that 1 primary meets the inclusion criteria.

          -  Meets 1 of the 3 following criteria:

               -  T1-3N1-3M0 if ER positive or negative

               -  T1N0M0 if ER and PR negative

          -  Has complete surgical resection of the primary breast tumor: either lumpectomy or
             mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection, with clear margins
             for both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)

          -  Has had no prior chemotherapy unless &gt;5 years ago

          -  Has an ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-1

             menarche and 1 year postmenopause])

          -  If fertile, patient has agreed to use an acceptable method of birth control (barrier
             contraceptive only) to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a period

          -  Has adequate tumor specimen available for FISH analysis of TOP2A status (See Appendix
             VI).

          -  In an obese patient to whom the Treating Physician would not be comfortable
             administering full doses of study drugs as calculated by the BSA. Obese patients will
             be treated based on actual body weight. Obese patients treated with full doses based
