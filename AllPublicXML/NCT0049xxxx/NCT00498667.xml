  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective analysis will be performed regarding the usefulness of PET/CT performed
      following 2 cycle of chemotherapy in evaluation of progression, free survival and overall
      survival of patients with aggressive non Hodgkin Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who were treated for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with adriamycin containing
      regimen, CHOP and High dose CHOP with or without rituximab were evaluated post 2 cycles of
      chemotherapy to rule out disease progression . Currently a retrospective evaluation of PET/CT
      as a predictive value for progression free survival and overall survival is evaluated
