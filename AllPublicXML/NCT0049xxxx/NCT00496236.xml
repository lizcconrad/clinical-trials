      This study is looking at the safety and tolerability of TNFeradeä Biologic combined with
      conventional once daily radiation therapy in elderly or frail patients with new onset locally
      advanced head and neck tumors.

          -  Patients &gt; 18 years of age unsuitable for concurrent chemotherapy or surgery due to:

          -  Renal failure, or

          -  Severe cardiopulmonary disease, or

          -  Other end-organ dysfunction that precludes the use of chemotherapy but does not
             preclude the administration of TNFerade™ Biologic or cetuximab

          -  Tumor that is unresectable or inoperable and not amenable to regular concurrent
             chemoradiotherapy

             (T4N0-1M0) will also be considered for enrollment. Therapy is given with curative
             intent.

          -  History of malignancy in the last 2 years except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
             bladder, non-melanomatous skin cancer, or localized early stage prostate cancer, with
             patients continually disease free, or cancers that are not felt to influence treatment
             for head and neck cancer and life expectancy of patient

          -  Overt systemic metastatic disease

          -  Previous radiation or chemotherapy for malignancy of the head and neck

          -  Clinical evidence of active infection of any type

          -  pregnant or lactating women

          -  Experimental medications within the last 4 weeks prior to Day 1
