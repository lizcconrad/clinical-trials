  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to test intersubject variability and establish the qualitative
      features of normal VRI images and the range of normality of the VRI quantitative lung data
      values that may be used to differentiate normal from abnormal breath sound distribution. Our
      hypothesis was that VRI breath sound images of healthy subjects are similar in a qualitative
      and quantitative manner.

  <detailed_description>

      Computerized analyses have shown that normal lung sounds have distinctive characteristic that
      can be differentiated from abnormal lung sounds.However, technical issues and complicated
      display modes have restricted the use of computerized lung sound analyses in the clinical
      environment.

      The VRI provides dynamic gray-scale images and quantitative lung data showing the breath
      sound distribution of healthy individuals. Typical features that are discerned by trained
      raters and quantitative lung data may serve as a reference for comparison to abnormal breath
      sound images.
