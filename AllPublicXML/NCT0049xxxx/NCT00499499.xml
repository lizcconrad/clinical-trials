  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate E7107 in patients with solid tumors. This is an
      open label, dose-escalation study of E7107. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the single
      agent will be established by determining the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities during
      the first three weeks of therapy (Cycle 1). Patients in this study will be treated at
      multiple dose levels, starting at 0.6 mg/m^2. Patients will receive E7107 as a 30-minute
      intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 every 21 Days.

    <description>E7107 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a starting dose of 0.6 mg/m^2 to the first cohort of patients. The same dose will be given on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Dose escalation will not occur until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. The selection of subsequent dose levels will be performed according to an accelerated design.</description>

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria outlined below in order to be eligible to
        participate in the study.

          1. Patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumors who have
             progressed after receiving approved therapies for their disease and for whom no
             effective therapies are available.

          2. Surgery and radiotherapy must have been completed at least four weeks prior to study
             entry, and prior chemotherapy and other anti-cancer therapy, excluding bisphosphonates
             at a steady dose level, must have been discontinued 2 to 3 weeks previously. All acute
             toxicities related to these treatments must have resolved.

          3. Aged ≥ 18 years

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1.

          5. Written informed consent prior to any study specific screening procedures, which will
             include mandatory consent to provide a blood sample specifically for pharmacogenomic
             analysis, with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time
             without prejudice. Tumor biopsy for pharmacogenomic (PG) analysis will be voluntary.

          6. Willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.

          7. Anticipated life expectancy &gt; three months.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with the following characteristics will not be eligible for the study.

          1. Symptomatic or progressive brain tumors or brain or leptomeningeal (CNS) metastases
             requiring clinical intervention, except if they have completed local therapy and have
             discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least two weeks
             before starting treatment with E7107.

          2. Any of the following laboratory parameters:
