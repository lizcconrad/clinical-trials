      Specific Aim

        1. To verify the differentially expressed genes and pathways between normal and OSA
           patients, and OSA patients before and after CPAP treatment.

           Genes with changes in expression of more than two-fold between normal and OSA patients
           as well as OSA patients before and after CPAP treatment were thought as confirmed and
           were selected for further validation study.

        2. To correlate the confirmed genes with the clinical presentations and CPAP effects in
           another 50 OSAS subjects to validate the altered gene expressions and pathways involved.

           To investigate the correlation of genes confirmed from RT-PCR (identified gene), another
           50 OSAS subjects are included in the study. We analyze the correlation between
           identified gene and the clinical manifestations and CPAP effect in these 50 OSAS
           patients.

        3. To establish a cell model to investigate the differentially expressed genes and the
           putative biological pathways involved in OSA syndrome.

      To investigate the functions of genes identified in the first and second year (gene of
      interest), we establish a cell model with human monocyte cell line U937. We investigate the
      function of gene of interest through overexpress or knockdown.

      Objectives The objectives of this project are to confirm the gene profiled from comparing
      normal and OSA patients as well as OSA patients before and after CPAP treatment, to
      investigate the correlation between altered gene expression and clinical presentations and
      CPAP effects of the OSAS and to identify and confirm corresponding pathway. This study will
      enhance our understanding of the individual constitution on widely different clinical
      characteristics and therapeutic variations. All these efforts will also help us to interpret
      its molecular mechanisms and develop prediction and diagnosis strategies of OSAS. The
      long-term objectives are to develop therapeutic strategy other than CPAP of OSAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized with recurrent collapse of upper
      airway during sleep and resulted in hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, which resulted in
      cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders and neurocognitive dysfunctions. The
      cardiovascular complications attributed to OSAS included hypertension, coronary artery
      disease, heart failure and stroke. The mechanisms responsible for developments of
      cardiovascular sequelae included repeated episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia, exaggerated
      negative intrathoracic pressure and bursts of sympathetic activity provoking surges in blood
      pressure and heart rate. Increase of inflammatory mediators, which included C-reactive
      protein, oxidative stress, adhesion molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor and
      proinflammatory cytokines, were thought to involve in the developments of cardiovascular
      diseases in patients with OSAS.

      To clarify the exact mechanisms of OSAS and the linkage to cardiovascular complications, in
      our previous study, we used oligo microarray to genome-wide profile the gene expression
      patterns in OSAS patients and the changes of gene expressions before and after four-week CPAP
      treatment. The oligo-microarray data were processed with CRSD database and two-way
      hierarchical clustering method. The results showed the gene expression patterns were
      different between control subjects and OSA patients and CPAP treatment also altered the gene
      expression patterns. Totally 27 genes and four pathways were identified as target genes and
      pathways from comparing the gene pattern changes before and after CPAP treatment, which
      included apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, cell adhesion and activation and metabolism.
      To continue analyzing the gene pattern changes before and after CPAP treatment, we propose
      this three-year project to achieve the following goals: (1) To verify the differentially
      expressed genes and pathways between normal and OSA patients, and OSA patients before and
      after CPAP treatment. (2) To correlate the confirmed genes with the clinical presentations
      and CPAP effects in another 50 OSAS subjects to validate the altered gene expressions and
      pathways involved. (3) To establish a cell model to investigate the differentially expressed
      genes and the putative biological pathways involved in OSA syndrome. The information obtained
      by this approach is very useful to understand the pathogenic mechanism of OSA that leads to
      systemic complications and further therapeutic intervention may therefore be possible.

        From patients who were referred to sleep lab for suspect sleep apnea, we selected 50 male
        patients with age&gt; 18 y/o. with severe OSAS, which were confirmed with by overnight PSG.
        All were free from neurologic events, chronic pulmonary disease, active infection and
        substance abuse. Female patients and patients under 18 y/o were excluded. All 50 subjects
        were treated with 4-week CPAP. All study subjects were admitted, on the day of baseline
        measurement and four weeks after CPAP use, for clinical evaluation, blood sampling and PSG.
        And all anti-hypertensive therapy was remained unchanged during the 4-week follow-up
        period. Changes of parameters, before and after CPAP treatment, were compared between two
        groups.
