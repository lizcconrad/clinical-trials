  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prevent excess increases in blood pressure in children by providing two servings of dairy
      foods as snacks daily at school. We hypothesize that children who receive the two dairy
      snacks will exhibit significantly less of an increase in blood pressure over six months as
      compared to control children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the impact of dairy foods on blood pressure;
      however, we will also evaluate the effect of the intervention on body weight and composition.
      Specifically, we will evaluate change in body mass index (BMI, kg/m2], waist circumference in
      all subjects and body composition by bioelectrical impedance (BIA) in a subset. We
      hypothesize that children receiving the dairy snacks will exhibit less increase in BMI and
      body fat than control subjects. We are studying a group of children at high risk for elevated
      blood lipids and glucose intolerance due to their racial/ethnic makeup and high prevalence of
      overweight and obesity. Thus, we will evaluate the impact of the intervention on blood
      lipids, glucose and insulin in a subset of subjects.

      We hypothesize that children receiving the dairy foods will exhibit improvements in their
      lipids, glucose and insulin as compared to control children. We also plan to determine their
      eating habits through a 24 hour dietary recall at the beginning, middle and end of the study,
      with 2 additional recalls for the subset at each time point. Dietary behavior and self
      efficacy will be analyzed before and after the intervention through a questionnaire. Physical
      activity levels will be assessed by a short physical activity questionnaire on all students
      and through the utilization of accelerometers in the subset. Our control schools will undergo
      the same testing, but will not receive any intervention.

    <description>2 servings of dairy products as snacks at school to third, fourth, and fifth grade students each day for 24 weeks. The serving size of each dairy snack is based on its calcium content with the goal of adding an extra 300 mg of calcium to the intervention group's daily intake.</description>
