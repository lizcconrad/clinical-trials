      The aim of the study is valuation of quality of life (QL) in children with asthma and
      analysis of the factors that can have influence on it. The clinical problems included into
      the aim are to evaluate:

        -  the correlation between the QL and asthma control

        -  the utility of the Polish Version of PAQLQ(S) by Juniper, especially the understanding
           of each question and it's answers The results of this study can be very helpful in the
           future in developing a questionnaires to use in Polish Primary Care, according to which
           the investigators would be able to see whether the asthma in our patients is being well
           controlled.

      Quality of Life in people with asthma is strictly relevant with the correct treatment of the
      disease, that is why the correct screening of patient's quality of life, especially in
      children, is so important.

      Exploring the quality of life (QL), we use different types of questionnaires to obtain a
      quantitative result, which we can interpret using a compatible key for it. Pediatric Asthma
      Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities (PAQLQ(S)) by Juniper is a
      reliable measure of the influence of asthma on QL in children. The Polish Version of the
      questionnaire is a strict translation of the english one, however it is not completely
      validated, which in practice can evince in difficulties in understanding the meaning of the
      applied questions, probably because of the difference in the habits of both populations.
