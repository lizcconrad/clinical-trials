  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults who sustain brain damage due to stroke, traumatic injury or surgery may develop
      difficulty finding words. This study compares the effectiveness of two behavior-based
      programs to improve picture naming ability in these individuals.

    <textblock>
      Difficulty finding words is common in patients with aphasia subsequent to left hemisphere
      stroke. This study will compare two cognitive therapies for the treatment of acquired word
      finding difficulties. The therapies use different types of cues. All participants will
      receive both therapies. Participants in this study will undergo a comprehensive and detailed
      assessment of language and other cognitive skills. The two treatments will be compared for
      their efficacy.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A type of anomia rehabilitation paradigm in which the situation surrounding the performance of the desired task (i.e., picture naming) is controlled to prevent errors. The intervention involves providing maximal auditory cues to prevent errors in picture naming.</description>

    <intervention_name>Errorful training condition</intervention_name>
    <description>Errorful training condition: Participant saw a picture and named it without any cues. If an error was produced, the cue with the least amount of information was provided (e.g. for &quot;pumpkin&quot;, &quot;pu&quot;). Cues with increasing information were provided until the picture was correctly named (e.g. for &quot;pumpkin&quot;: &quot;pump&quot;, &quot;pumpki&quot;, then &quot;pumpkin&quot;). Once the correct name was provided, the trial ended.</description>

    <intervention_name>Errorless training condition</intervention_name>
    <description>Errorless learning (EL) condition: Participant saw a picture with its name, and repeated the word. The participant continued to name the picture as the auditory cues provided less and less of the word (e.g. for &quot;banana&quot; she would hear &quot;banan&quot;, &quot;bana&quot; then &quot;ba&quot; and finally no cue). If an error was produced at any stage, the whole word was presented, the participant repeated it, and the trial ended.</description>
