  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether a combined dietary and exercise
      intervention, added to standard care, reduces the expected frequency of insulin resistance in
      renal (kidney) transplant recipients on tacrolimus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study
      following participants forward in time), single-arm, multi-center (conducted in more than 1
      center), interventional pilot study of the effects of a combined dietary and exercise
      intervention on glucose metabolism. The duration of this study will be 6 months and will
      include following visits: Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24. Dietary compliance will be
      evaluated with a 3-day food record and during weekly telephone conversations and face-to-face
      visits with a dietician. Exercise compliance will be measured using an exercise log presented
      to the co-ordinator at the end of each month. Primarily, participants with insulin resistance
      will be assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) of greater than
      1 at 6 months. Participants' safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Insulin Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with insulin resistance as defined by a Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) greater than 1. HOMA uses fasting glucose and insulin (or C-peptide) to assess beta-cell function and IR. HOMA-IR is used to estimate insulin resistance. HOMA-IR is calculated by equation: HOMA-IR=fasting plasma insulin (milliunit [mU] per liter [L]) * fasting plasma glucose (millimole per liter [mmol per L]) divided by 22.5.</description>

    <description>This SF-36 standardize survey evaluates participants health by 8 aspects of functional health and well-being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. These 8 aspects can also be summarized as Physical Component Scores (PCS) and Mental Component Scores (MCS).
