      This Phase II study randomized R-ACVBP and R-CHOP as induction treatment in patients from 18
      to 59 with DLBCL CD20+ lymphoma and 2 or 3 adverse prognostic factors of the age-adjusted
      IPI. The consolidation treatment is allocated according to the response to induction
      treatment assessed by PET after the 2nd and 4th induction cycles.

      1) Induction Arm A: 4 cycles of R-ACVBP, 2 weeks interval. After the 3rd cycle, if PET 2+
      (fixing), collection of peripheral blood stem cell progenitors will be organized at the time
      of hematological recovery under support with G-CSF.

      The consolidation treatment will depend on results of PET evaluation after cycle 2 (PET2) and
      cycle 4 (PET4).

        -  Consolidation 1A (in case of PET 2- PET 4 -):

             -  High-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue; 2 cycles spaced out 14 days.

             -  Rituximab-Ifosfamide-Etoposide : 4 cycles spaced out 14 days

             -  Cytarabine sub-cutaneous, during 4 days; 2 cycles spaced out 14 days.

        -  Consolidation 2 A (in case of PET 2+ PET4 -):

             -  2 cycles high-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue

             -  High dose with Z- BEAM conditioning regimen followed by autologous transplant.

        -  Salvage(in case of PET 4 +):

      The patient will be treated with a salvage regimen, after a biopsy of the residual mass
      whenever possible.

      2) Induction arm B: 4 cycles of R-CHOP, 2 weeks interval. After the 3rd cycle, if PET 2+
      (fixing), collection of peripheral blood stem cell progenitors will be organized at the time
      of hematological recovery under support with G-CSF.

      The consolidation treatment will depend on results of PET evaluation after cycle 2 (PET2) and
      cycle 4 (PET4).

        -  Consolidation 1B(in case of PET 2- PET 4 -):

           4 additional cycles of R-CHOP, 2-weeks interval

        -  Consolidation 2 B(in case of PET 2+ PET 4 -):

             -  2 cycles high-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue

             -  High dose with Z- BEAM conditioning regimen followed by autologous transplant

        -  Salvage(in case of PET 4 +):

      The patient will be treated with a salvage regimen, after a biopsy of the residual mass
      whenever possible
