    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      Sirolimus-eluting stent CYPHERTM and/or updated version in reducing angiographic in-stent
      late loss in de novo native coronary lesions of diabetic patients as compared to the bare
      metal Bx SONIC balloon-expandable stent.

      The secondary objective is to assess cost-effectiveness expressed in incremental cost/life
      year gained or cost/quality adjusted life year gained at different time points (8 months, 1
      year).

      This is a multicenter (11 centers), prospective, randomized single blind study. This study
      has a 2-arm design assessing the safety and effectiveness of the Sirolimus-eluting stent
      CYPHERTM and/or updated version to the bare metal Bx SONICTM stent. A total of 250 patients
      will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. Patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be either randomized to the Sirolimus-eluting stent or the bare
      metal Bx SONIC stent. The investigator cannot be blind because the outer appearance of the
      system for the implant of the Sirolimus-eluting stent differs from that of the bare metal
      stent and will therefore immediately be recognized by the surgeon. However the patient will
      not know which stent will be implanted. Patients will be followed at 30 days, 9 and 12 months
      post-procedure, with all patients undergoing repeat angiography at 8 months. Additionally,
      medical costs associated with the index hospitalization and length of stay, and repeat
      hospitalizations and costs associated with other relevant medical resource use during the 1
      year follow-up period will be collected and analyzed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be ≥ 18 years of age;

          2. Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7days of
             enrollment and utilize reliable birth control for eight months after enrollment;

          3. Patients with IDDM (Type I) treated for at least 3 months with documented HbA1c, or
             NIDDM (Type II) treated with oral antidiabetics for at least 3 months;

          4. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald
             Classification B&amp;C, I-II) OR patients with documented silent ischemia OR patient with
             previous (&gt;24 hours) myocardial infarction with documented residual ischemia and/or
             viable myocardium;

          5. Single or double stent treatment of de novo lesion in a major coronary artery in
             patients with single or multi-vessel disease; patients with multi-vessel disease can
             be included only if a maximum of two vessels require treatment with a maximum of three
             lesions in total, no more than two lesions per vessels. The two lesions in a single
             vessel must be &gt;10 mm apart (visual estimate) and must be treated with the assigned
             stent.

          6. Target vessel diameter at the lesion site is ≥ 2.50mm and ≤ 3.5mm in diameter (visual
             estimate);

          2. Unprotected left main coronary disease with ≥50% stenosis;

          9. Pretreatment with devices other than balloon angioplasty;

         10. Target lesion has excessive tortuousity or angulation (&gt;45°) which makes it unsuitable
             for stent delivery and deployment;

         11. Target lesion involves bifurcation including a diseased side branch ≥2 mm in diameter
             (either stenosis of both main vessel and major branch or stenosis of just major
             branch) that would require side branch stenting;
