    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded, dose escalation study of patupilone in combination with RAD001 in
      subjects with advanced cancer to find the maximum tolerated dose of each drug. The purpose of
      this study is to see what doses of RAD001 and patupilone are safe to use when the two drugs
      are used at the same time. Other goals in this study are to learn about the effect of RAD 001
      and patupilone on tumor growth; to find out what amount of RAD001 is present in the blood
      when it is combined with patupilone; to learn about proteins in the blood that may predict or
      show an effect of RAD001 or patupilone and to learn if any changes are seen in the tumor with
      the type of test called a PET scan.Subjects will be assigned to a dosing group. The dose of
      patupilone and RAD001 a subject gets depends on when they enter onto this study. The initial
      subjects in the study will take the lowest doses of RAD001 and patupilone. At least 3
      subjects will be treated in each dosing group starting with the smallest dose. If there are
      few or easy to handle side effects, the next group of at least 3 people to enter in the study
      will get the next higher dose. This continues until the highest dose of the study drug is
      found that does not cause serious or hard to treat side effects. Both the subjects and the
      study doctor will know which dose is assigned. In this study, RAD001 will be given as tablets
      to take with water. RAD001 will be taken for either 7, 14, or 21 days of each 21 day cycle
      depending on which dosing group is assigned. If taking RAD 001 and patupilone on the same
      day, then RAD 001 will be taken with water however prior to receiving patupilone.Patupilone
      will be given by an intravenous injection (through a vein) for 20 minutes on Days 1 or day 6
      of the 21-day cycle. The patupilone dose will be based on height and weight. Blood tests
      (approximately 1-3 teaspoons) will be done every week. Every six weeks a CT scan or MRI will
      be done to assess the tumor size. Subjects will continue to receive RAD001 and patupilone as
      long as the tumor is stable or shrinking, and not having too many side effects from
      treatment.

      Primary Endpoint To identify the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of the combination of
      patupilone and RAD001

      Secondary Endpoints To assess the toxicity of patupilone and RAD001 To determine if
      concentrations of RAD001 are elevated in the presence of patupilone To evaluate tumor
      response using standard imaging modalities (CT scan, x-ray, bone scan) To develop
      pharmacodynamic markers that may predict or indicate response to mTOR inhibition or
      patupilone treatment.

    <description>RAD001 will be taken orally starting at a dose of 30 mg every week for the first cohort of patients, one hour prior to administration of patupilone. Patupilone will then be administered as an infusion, starting at 5 mg/m2 for the first cohort of patients. The dosage and scheduling of RAD001 and patupilone during each 21-day cycle will vary according to cohort assignment</description>
