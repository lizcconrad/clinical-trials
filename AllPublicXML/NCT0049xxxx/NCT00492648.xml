  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and immunogenicity of the GSK324332A vaccine has been evaluated up to Month 12
      post-vaccination in the primary study. In the extension studies presented here, the
      persistence of the cellular and humoral immune responses will be evaluated 30 and 42 months
      after the first vaccination in young and elderly adults who received the GSK324332A vaccine.
      This protocol posting deals only with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at
      Months 30 and 42. No new recruitment will be done in these extension phases of the primary
      study. No vaccines are administered in this phase of the study.

      All subjects in these extension phases of the study were previously vaccinated with the
      investigational herpes zoster vaccine GSK1437173A. The Protocol Posting has been updated in
      order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
