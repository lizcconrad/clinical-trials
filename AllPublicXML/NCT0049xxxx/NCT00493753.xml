      The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate whether acupuncture is safe and acceptable to
      people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Twenty-four SLE patients were assigned
      randomly to receive either 10 sessions of acupuncture, 10 sessions of a minimal-needling
      control intervention, or their usual medical care alone. It was hypothesized that acupuncture
      would be safe for people with SLE, and that participants would be able to complete their
      assigned treatment within 5 to 6 weeks.
