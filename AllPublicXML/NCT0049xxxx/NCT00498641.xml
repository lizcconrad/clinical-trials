    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of perceptual learning with patching on improving visual acuity and
      contrast sensitivity in payient with anisometropic amblyopia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with anisometropic amblyopia were randomized to patching or perceptual learning
      group. Corrected amblyopic logMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity function were
      measured at four-weekly intervals until visual acuity stabilized or amblyopia resolved.
      Improvement in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and the resolution of amblyopia were
      compared between groups.
