    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of loading doses versus
      standard dose of intravenous Bondronat in reducing pain in patients with lung cancer and bone
      metastatic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with lung cancer and bone metastatic disease may experience moderate or severe bone
      pain. Some researches have reported that loading doses Bondronat (6mg Bondronat on three
      consecutive days) had great efficacy in reducing pain in patients with malignant bone disease
      without unacceptable toxicities. So,we designed this clinical trial to compare the efficacy
      and safety profiles between loading doses Bondronat and standard dose Bondronat.Enrolled
      patients will receive an intravenous infusion of either 6mg Bondronat on three consecutive
      days or 6mg Bondronat on one day. The targeted sample size is 120 individuals. Primary
      outcome measures will be bone pain response ( ≥ 25% decrease in mean pain score with a
      maximum of 15% increase in mean analgesic consumption). Secondary outcome measures will be
      efficacy including ECOG Performance status, analgesic consumption, bone markers, and safety
      profiles including AE and laboratory parameters.
