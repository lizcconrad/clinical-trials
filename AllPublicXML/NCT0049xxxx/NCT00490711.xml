        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically verified epithelial ovarian cancer

          -  FIGO stage III-IV

          -  Patients with measurable disease. RECIST criteria with GCIG modifications will be used
             for response and for progression assessment.

          -  Lesions serving as measurable disease must have the longest diameter of greater than
             or equal to 20 mm as measured with conventional techniques or greater than or equal to
             10 mm with spiral CT scan. Lesions measured by physical examination must have a
             longest diameter of greater than or equal to 20 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (borderline tumors)

          -  Non-epithelial ovarian or mixed epithelial. non epithelial tumors (e.g. mixed
             Mullerian tumors)

          -  Time between definitive surgery and enrollment into the study is greater than 6 weeks

          -  Patients who have received previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy
