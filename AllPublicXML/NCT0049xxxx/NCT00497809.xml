      The overall purpose of this study is to assess the dose response, efficacy, and safety of
      three different dose levels of AVI 014 (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) in
      breast cancer patients at high (&gt;20%) risk for chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia.

      Filgrastim is a recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) developed in the mid 1980s, and was
      approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in chemotherapy
      induced neutropenia in 1991 under the trade name Neupogen®. Filgrastim was first approved in
      the EU in Germany in 2001 under the same trade name. Filgrastim is a non glycosylated
      protein, produced in E. coli bacteria transfected with rhG-CSF copy deoxyribonucleic acid
      (cDNA). Filgrastim differs from native human G CSF only in the addition of an N terminal
      methionine required for expression in a bacterial host. In 2002, a pegylated filgrastim with
      extended duration of action relative to the naked filgrastim was approved by the FDA and the
      EU Commission under the trade name Neulasta.

      AviGenics has generated transgenic hens carrying rhG CSF cDNA, which express a glycosylated
      form of rhG-CSF protein in their egg white. The purified rhG-CSF is biologically active, as
      assessed by its in vitro binding and cell proliferation activities, and has been fully
      characterized by AviGenics. AviGenics intends to develop this product to treat
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

      The overall goal of this study is to assess dose response, efficacy, and safety of three
      different dose levels of AVI-014 (G-CSF) in breast cancer patients at high (&gt;20%) risk for
      chemotherapy induced severe neutropenia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to understand and voluntarily provide written informed consent before screening,
             following an explanation of the nature and purpose of this study.

          -  Women, aged 18 years and older

          -  Histologically confirmed breast cancer, undergoing one of a variety of chemotherapy
             regimens, or with other risk factors that could lead to a &gt;20% risk of developing
             severe neutropenia. Patients receiving chemotherapy regimens with high-risk for severe
             neutropenia are eligible; eligibility of patients receiving intermediate-risk
             chemotherapy regimens must be discussed with the Medical Monitor for the presence of
             additional patient-specific risk factors.

          -  Must be receiving first-line adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for localized breast
             cancer or first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. It is recommended that
             patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu)-positive breast
             cancer should be receiving Herceptin® (trastuzumab), if approved and available for
             this indication.

             or genomic screening study) during the past 30 days, or are likely to simultaneously
             participate in another therapeutic clinical study.

          -  History of, or known current problems with, substance abuse, or any medical,
