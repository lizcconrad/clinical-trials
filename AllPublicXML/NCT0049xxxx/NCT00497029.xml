  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of a risk-based dental caries
      prevention program conducted by dental personnel at an urban pediatric primary care clinic
      serving largely low-income residents of Baltimore, Maryland, and to appraise this program as
      a model for similar urban pediatric settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A demonstration caries prevention trial lasting 26 months was conducted with a total of 219
      children aged 6 to 27 months of age. The “prevention” group consisting of children 6-15
      months of age at their initial visit were compared at the end of the trial with a
      “comparison” group at their initial visit. The comparison group was 12 months older than the
      enrollment age of the prevention group (18-27 months) and had not received previous routine
      professional dental care. Interventions were dental examination and periodic recalls,
      caries-risk assessments, monitoring of oral mutans streptococci (MS) levels, application of
      5.0% sodium fluoride varnish to teeth, dental health counseling to care-givers, referral for
      dental treatment if indicated and periodic recalls.

      Outcome measures were: 1) number of decayed, missing, filled primary tooth surfaces, 2)
      number of pre-carious lesions, 3) counts of oral MS and 3) care-giver responses to a
      questionnaire about the child’s diet and home care.

      Prevention group children at the last recall experienced fewer mean carious dental surfaces
      (0.1 vs. 1.29, p&lt;0.014) and over 8-fold less MS (p&lt;0.013) than comparison group subjects at
      the initial visit. The number of precarious lesions, however, were not significantly
      different. In the absence of carious or precarious lesions, oral levels of MS was a reliable
      indicator of caries risk status, particularly for low risk subjects (sensitivity, 0.64;
      specificity, 0.98). Caregiver reports of dietary practices and presence or absence of visible
      dental plaque also served as caries-risk determinants.
