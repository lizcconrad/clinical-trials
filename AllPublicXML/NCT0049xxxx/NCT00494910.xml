  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of group counseling for cancer patients:
      Meaning-Centered counseling and Supportive counseling. Many cancer patients seek counseling
      to help with the emotional burden of their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with
      cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. &quot;Meaning-Centered&quot; group counseling
      is intended to teach cancer patients how to maintain or even increase a sense of meaning and
      purpose in their lives, despite cancer. &quot;Supportive&quot; group counseling is intended to help you
      cope with cancer by giving you a place to express your feelings and get support from other
      cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of
      counseling approaches for cancer patients.

      To conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of Meaning-Centered Group
      Psychotherapy (MCGP) versus a standardized Supportive Group Psychotherapy (SGP) in reducing
      psychological distress (depression and anxiety), end-of-life despair (hopelessness, desire
      for hastened death, and suicidal ideation), and improving spiritual well-being and overall
      quality of life in a sample patients with advanced cancer.

      To assess the relative impact of Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy on different aspects of
      spiritual well-being (e.g., a sense of meaning and purpose versus spirituality linked to
      religious faith).

      To examine clinical and demographic variables that may correspond to differential responses
      to Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy (e.g., potential mediating and moderating influences
      such as illness severity, religion and religiosity, level of education, race/ethnicity, level
      of pre-intervention social support, presence of pain and physical symptom burden).
