      Background. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) recently has become an accepted method for
      treatment of patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, who are at an increased risk
      for surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The reported rates of neurological complications
      of CAS substantially decreased during the past years, and the routine use of cerebral
      protection devices and low profile catheter systems have further increased the procedure´s
      safety. In the early 90's large surgical trials in North America and Europe (NASCET, ECST and
      ACAS) demonstrated superiority of CEA compared to best medical treatment for symptomatic and
      asymptomatic patients. Provided that the ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing CAS
      and CEA confirm equivalence between the these methods, CAS similar to CEA is applicable to
      symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high grade carotid stenosis. However, particularly
      in asymptomatic patients, the indication for revascularisation remains debatable. Protected
      CAS is associated with a very low rate of neurological complications, which are below the AHA
      recommendation for treating asymptomatic patients (3%). However, the introduction of new
      vascular protective medications like statins and clopidogrel during the recent years
      substantially improved the spectrum of best medical treatment, and the findings of NASCET,
      ECST and ACAS with respect to best medical treatment may therefore not be applicable any
      more.

      Study hypothesis and aims. Given the low frequency of spontaneous neurological complications,
      the preferable therapeutic approach to patients with asymptomatic high grade ( &gt; 80%) carotid
      artery stenoses is currently unknown. Modern best medical treatment may manage to stabilize
      the atherosclerotic plaque, while CAS has the potential of resolving the carotid stenosis.
      Comparative data, however, are not available as yet. We hypothesized that protected CAS has a
      beneficial effect on occurrence of ipsilateral neurological complications and major adverse
      cardiac events in high-risk patients with asymptomatic &gt; 80% internal carotid artery
      stenosis. Therefore, the aim of the present randomized controlled trial was to analyze
      neurological and cardiovascular outcome of patients treated with elective CAS plus best
      medical treatment compared to best medical treatment only.

      SYNOPSIS

      BACKGROUND:

      The preferable treatment - whether revascularization or conservative - of asymptomatic
      high-risk patients with &gt; 80% internal carotid artery stenosis (NASCET criteria) is currently
      unknown.

      STUDY HYPOTHESIS:

      We hypothesized that protected carotid artery stenting (CAS) plus best medical treatment is
      associated with reduced rates of ipsilateral neurological complications and major adverse
      cardiac events in high-risk patients with asymptomatic &gt; 80% internal carotid artery stenosis
      compared to best medical treatment only.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with 1:1 random assignment between two
      treatment modalities including 300 patients within an scheduled inclusion period of 18
      months. The primary and secondary study endpoints are evaluated for an initial two year
      follow-up period after randomization. Secondary follow-up will be performed for 1, 1.5, 3, 5
      and 10 years post randomization.

    <description>Using retrograde transfemoral access an overview aortic angiogram is established. A stiff wire is then placed in the external carotid or distal common carotid artery to introduce a long hydrophilic sheath into the common carotid artery. The stenosis is then crossed with a Filter wire. For stent implantation Monorail Carotid Wallstents or the Monorail Nitinol Stent of Boston Scientific are used. Road map or overlay technique with a magnification of 20 to 28 inch is used to localize the stenosis during the procedure. Finally a control angiogram is performed to ensure correct placement of the stent. After successful completion of the procedure, the arterial access site is closed using a standard closure device.</description>
