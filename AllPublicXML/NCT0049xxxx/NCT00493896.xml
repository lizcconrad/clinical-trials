      This is a pilot study to evaluate safety of fondaparinux and enoxaparin in terms of bleeding
      and development of thrombocytopenia in the medical ICU population. We expect the null
      hypothesis to be proven true. One hundred subjects will be enrolled in this prospective,
      randomized, double-blind (concealed allocation) pilot study of consecutive medical ICU
      patients to one of two pharmacologic VTE prophylaxix treatment arms. (1) Primary endpoints
      include hemoglobin, hematocrit, &amp; platelet counts. blood product utilization, bleeding
      complications (any), Steady State Functional Factor Xa activity (for post hoc analysis),
      non-study pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (when estimated CLcr &lt; 30ml/min), and days not
      treated with study drug or treated with alternative agent Secondary/ Additional Data to be
      collected include patient demographics, primary &amp; secondary diagnoses, central venous access,
      and sequential compression device utilization.
