  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Urinary Urge Incontinence (UUI) is the involuntary urine loss associated with a strong
           sensation to void.

        -  UUI usually associated with reduced bladder capacity.

        -  The pathophysiology is unclear.

        -  Pelvic floor muscle dysfunction and detrusor instability have been suggested as possible
           mechanisms.

        -  Standard treatment includes anticholinergic medication and behavior modification.

        -  The study aims to compare the long term effectiveness of 4 different approaches to the
           treatment of women with Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI):

             1. Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation (includes muscle training+behavioral
                intervention+bladder training)

             2. Pelvic Floor muscle training alone

             3. Bladder Training alone

             4. Drug treatment with Tolterodine.

        -  Study variables will include: impairment ratings, quality of life, and
           cost-effectiveness.

        -  This study addresses three issues:

             1. The long term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the various treatment options.

             2. To identify the factors involved in determining the effectiveness of drug or
                behavioral therapy.

             3. The pathophysiology of UUI. By subdividing the rehabilitation group into 3 arms, we
                hope to shed light on the mechanism of dysfunction. A better response in one group
                will help localize the problem to pelvic floor muscles or to detrusor instability.

      The study has 3 phases: Before treatment (phase I), immediately after 3 months of treatment
      (phase II), and 1 year post-entry (phase III)

      Women with UUI will be divided randomly into one of the four treatment groups. Every subject
      will participate in 4 visits. The drug group treatment consists of administration of
      tolterodine SR 4 mg daily for 3 months. Subjects who assigned to the pelvic floor
      rehabilitation, pelvic floor muscle training, and bladder training groups will be treated via
      4 visits to a physical therapist, who is trained in the procedures. The chief researcher (RK)
      will be blinded to the treatment groups and will perform the outcome measures in all phases.

      Study variables will include impairment ratings, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness

    <description>Women were prescribed a 3 month supply of Tolterodine SR 4 mg (Detrusitol SR 4 mg, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Israel LTD) . After the randomization she needs to get the first prescription from her doctor, and followed this protocol every three weeks. Her doctor how already knows this research were explained how to take the drug. After finished this protocol she get the money she pay after sending the receipts and the empty boxes.</description>

    <description>The Bladder training protocol aims o to increase the time interval between voids, either by a mandatory or self-adjustable schedule, so that incontinence is ultimately avoided and continence regained. It is generally comprised of three components: 1) patient education that includes information about bladder and how continence is usually maintained, 2) scheduled voiding- a 'timetable for voiding' which may fixed or flexible to suit the participant's rate of increase in interval between voids, commonly the aim is to achieve an interval of three to four hours between voids and 3) positive reinforcement- - psychological support and encouragement is generally considered important and usually provided by health care professional . Frequency volume chart (FVC) records the time and volumes of voided for 24 hours by the women between the appointments. Four visits in 3 months with pelvic floor physical therapist, who is trained in the procedure, for educate and schedule voiding regimen.</description>

    <description>The Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) protocol based on National Institute for health and clinical excellence (NICE clinical guideline 40, 2006), that the PFMT programs should comprise at least eight contractions performed three times per day, and the trial of supervised PFMT of at least 3 months' duration . Each appointment the women maid three sets of eight to 12 slow maximal contractions sustained for 6-8 second, and asked to made this protocol every day, and taught to contract these muscle to suppress urge filling. Four visits in 3 months with pelvic floor physical therapist, who is trained in the procedure, for reinforced pelvic floor muscles.</description>
