      The study hypothesizes that early housing after hospitalization with case management
      integrated into the health and housing systems, will results in decreased use of costly
      health services (i.e., hospitalizations and Emergency Room visits) with no negative affect on
      health. To address this hypothesis the investigators implemented a Randomized controlled
      trial of 407 homeless adults with chronic medical illness in Chicago. Eligible homeless
      adults were enrolled during a hospitalization to intervention - Early housing with case
      management - or usual care - usual case management and housing options. The investigators
      followed the sample for 18 months with assessments at baseline, 1,3,6,9,12 and 18 months are
      enrollment. Study measures include Quality of Life, Health service use, Alcohol and Substance
      Use, housing and social and demographic characteristics.
