  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I/II study of the safety of escalating doses of
      single-agent PRO131921 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have relapsed
      after or were refractory to treatment with a purine nucleoside analogue-containing regimen.
      The trial will enroll in two phases: a Phase I dose-escalation portion and a Phase II
      expanded treatment cohort, with enrollment of additional patients in order to expand safety
      experience and collect preliminary anti-leukemia activity data.
