        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must give their written informed consent before any procedure related to the

             response predictive factors, or must be intolerant to immunotherapeutic treatment.

               -  ALT and AST &lt; 2.5 times the superior limit of normality (&lt; 5 times the superior

                  receiving anticoagulants, strict monitoring will be carried out, with evaluations
                  on a weekly basis, at least, until the INR is stable, referring to a
                  determination previous to dose administration, according to local standard care.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy superior to 12 weeks, at least.
