      The goal of this research study is to establish chimerism and avoid graft-versus-host disease
      in patients who need a heart transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the present time, heart transplant recipients must take anti-rejection medication to
      prevent rejection of the donated heart. Even with this medication, chronic rejection is the
      most common cause of late graft loss. The anti-rejection agents themselves are significantly
      toxic, with side effects including kidney damage, infection and an increased incidence of
      cancer. The goal of this study is to allow the patient to develop &quot;tolerance&quot; to the
      transplanted heart while maintaining a competent immune system. Tolerance enables the
      transplant recipient's body to recognize the transplanted organ as self rather than foreign
      tissue. The recipient will not try to reject the donor heart and the need for anti-rejection
      medication could be dramatically decreased or eliminated entirely. To accomplish this,
      patients in this study will receive specially treated bone marrow taken from their heart
      donor. Bone marrow transplant has been shown in animal studies and in humans to induce
      tolerance following organ transplant.

      Two factors limit the application of donor marrow transplant to induce tolerance: 1)
      preparing the patient for transplant (conditioning); and 2) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
      Traditional conditioning destroys the recipient's immune system and requires that the marrow
      transplant be successful because the patient is unable to fight off infection if the donor
      cells do not survive. GVHD occurs when donor immune cells recognize the recipient's cells as
      foreign tissue and attack them. Severe GVHD can result in death. This study utilizes a new
      approach to conditioning which leaves the patient's immune system intact. The transplant
      product is depleted of GVHD-producing cells but retains tolerance-promoting facilitating
      cells, which are intended to ensure the donor and recipient cells coexists peacefully, a
      state called mixed chimerism. The toxicity of conditioning and transplantation is
      significantly reduced.

      In this study, we will determine the appropriate cell dose to safely establish mixed
      chimerism following partial conditioning in heart transplant recipients. The study takes a
      gradual approach to increasing the cell dose to achieve mixed chimerism. We believe this
      study will provide a breakthrough in the approach to heart transplantation. Our goal is to
      evaluate the potential of safely establishing mixed chimerism to induce tolerance following
      heart transplant and reduce or eliminate the need for anti-rejection therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be between the ages of 18 and 70 years and meet the institution's
             criteria for cardiac transplantation.

          -  Subjects must have acceptable negative results for infectious disease markers done
             within two weeks of the bone marrow infusion.

          -  Subject is receiving a first cardiac transplant.

          -  Subjects receiving a multi-organ transplant (i.e., heart/kidney) may be included at
             the discretion of the PI and investigators.

        Note: These multi-organ subjects will have identical criteria with the exception of
        adequate function of the affected organ to be transplanted (i.e., kidney). They are
        included in the total of thirty subjects to be transplanted.

          -  Subject's panel reactive antibody (PRA) is &lt;40. If the patient is plasmapheresed prior
             to the heart transplant, then the pre-transplant PRA will not be a consideration for
             inclusion/exclusion.

          -  Subject must have a negative crossmatch with the donor.

          -  Women who are of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine
             test within 48 hours) before TBI and agree to use reliable contraception for one year
             following transplant.

          -  Subject is able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically active bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infection

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Previous radiation therapy at a dose that would preclude TBI

          -  Subject is unable to give informed consent

          -  If the procedures associated with the study (i.e., delivering TBI) would significantly
             extend the cold ischemia time of the heart, the protocol will be abandoned and the
             patient will receive a conventional heart transplant.
