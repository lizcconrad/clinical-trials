  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has not been a great deal of research involving Haitian American adolescents and HIV
      risk reduction. The purpose of the study is to learn better ways to teach teenagers about
      living healthy by educating these children about how to make good choices about things like
      eating healthy, exercise, and sexual behavior. The primary focus of the proposed study is to
      understand the mechanisms of adopting safer sex practices among Haitian American (H-A)
      adolescents. We will enroll 160 male and 160 female participants to achieve the target sample
      of 272 participants at the 12-month follow-up time point.

      The primary focus of the study is to understand the mechanisms of adopting safer sex
      practices among Haitian American (H-A) adolescents. We replicated a Cognitive-Behavioral HIV
      transmission risk reduction (CB-HIV-TRR) intervention entitled &quot;Becoming A Responsible Teen&quot;
      (BART, St. Lawrence, et al, 1995; St. Lawrence, 1998). This approach, which emphasizes
      building skills and self-efficacy in the process of risk reduction, was demonstrated to be
      highly effective with African American male and female adolescents in Mississippi. In a
      meta-analysis of published CB-HIV-RR intervention outcome studies (Kalichman, et al., 1996),
      the BART intervention was shown to have produced the highest effect not only for the
      published studies with adolescents, but also for HIV prevention interventions of all other
      populations studied. Based on its promising effects, the BART intervention has been
      officially designed as one of only four HIV risk &quot;Programs that Work&quot; by CDC Division of
      Adolescent and School Health (DASH). CDC designates programs as such based on reviewing
      programs in the literature using rigorous criteria. The proposed work focused on delineating
      theoretically important conditions associated with HIV transmission risk reduction (HIV-TRR)
      to address issues of mechanism of action and generalizability, respectively. Specifically,
      this 5 year study evaluates the effects of a version of the BART intervention that has been
      adapted to be appropriate to Haitian adolescents in Miami) as compared to a standard care
      (SC) condition among 160 male and 160 female high risk Haitian adolescents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The adolescent reports being at high risk for HIV transmission by virtue of having
             ever engaged in risky sexual behavior.

          2. The adolescent is available for the full duration of the study with no anticipated
             circumstances impeding study participation (e.g., jail term, out-of-town, etc.).

          3. The adolescent is fluent in spoken English required to complete our assessment battery
             and participate in group interventions. Because all of the adolescent are in or have
             been in the English speaking Public School system they virtually all are fluent in
             English.

          4. The adolescent is willing to assent for participation in the study.

          5. The adolescent has an identifiable parent or parent-figure (i.e., a number of
             adolescents will have sisters, aunts, or grandmothers who function as their primary
             caretaker) who is the legal guardian for the adolescent and who is willing to sign the
             informed consent. A bilingual assessor who is fluent in Creole will be available to
             parents that speak limited English and the consent forms for the parents will be in
             Creole.

          6. The adolescent is assessed not to be harmful to self or others using the relevant
             sections of the POSIT-HRS and Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI).

          7. The adolescent has no evidence of psychiatric impairments (e.g., psychosis) that might
             compromise the participants' ability to comprehend and participate in the assessment
             and intervention processes.

          8. The child's guardian will be invited to complete a questionnaire regarding
             communication with their teenager about sex and their guardian's level of
             acculturation.
