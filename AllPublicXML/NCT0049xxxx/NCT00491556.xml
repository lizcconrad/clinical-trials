      This study proposes to evaluate a pre-DHHS guideline of HAART initiation and then
      de-intensification management strategy in adolescents with mild immunosuppression and compare
      changes in CD4% from baseline to week 48 and then during de-intensification.

      This is a randomized, proof of concept study of youth 18- 24 years of age with confirmed HIV
      after age 9 with CD4+ T cells above 350 cells/mm3 who are randomized 3:1 to begin HAART
      consisting of TDF/FTC/ATV/r (preferred), AZT/3TC/ATV/r, or other recommended NRTI backbone
      with ATV/r upon entry or to begin treatment under current DHHS guidelines. Subjects in the
      experimental group who achieve virologic control by week 24 and maintain good control through
      48 weeks will then de-intensify to ATV/r alone and will be followed for two years. Subjects
      randomized to the standard care arm will begin HAART with TDF/FTC/ATV/r (preferred),
      AZT/3TC/ATV/r, or other recommended ATV/r based HAART regimen according to current DHHS
      standard of care.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Age 18 yrs and 0 days to 24 yrs and 364 days;

          2. CD4+ T cells &gt; 350/mm3 and HIV RNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ml as determined by two consecutive
             measures within 6 months of entry with the second measure being collected at
             pre-entry;

          3. Infected after age 9. HIV-1 infection should be documented by any licensed ELISA test
             kit and confirmed by Western blot, HIV-1 culture, HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA, or
             a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA at any time prior to entry; Note:
             Subjects who are in acute seroconversion as evidenced by being ELISA negative
             (antibody negative) and DNA PCR or HIV-1 RNA positive or who are ELISA positive but
             Western Blot indeterminate are not eligible.

          4. Subjects must be naïve to ARV medications except for women who have received HAART for
             prevention of maternal to child transmission (MTCT) that meet the following criteria:
             HAART (defined as three medications from two classes) given for no more than six
             months for prevention of MTCT, Evidence of viral suppression on the HAART regimen
             defined as a plasma RNA level below the level of detection for the assay used by the
             site either during the third trimester or around the time of delivery, A minimum of
             six months since HAART exposure for prevention of MTCT, and Exposure to HAART for a
             single pregnancy only; Note: Prior treatment with Trizivir for prevention of MCTC is
             also permitted as long as viral suppression is documented at the time of delivery or
             in the last trimester, whichever is most recent.

          5. HIV genotype without major resistance mutations to ATV/r. The following genotypic
             mutations exclude subjects from participation in ATN 061: Major ATV mutations I50L;
             I84V; N88D/S, Major PI mutations including: D30N; V32I; L33I/F/V; M46I/L; I47V/A;
             G48V; I50V/L; I54V/L/A/M/T/S; L76V; V82A/F/T/S/L; L90M, Any major PI mutation as
             defined by the most current IAS-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Figures that would
             adversely affect a subject's future PI choices, Major RT mutations: Q151M and 69
             insertion complex; Decisions regarding the selection of an NRTI backbone for subjects
             with NRTI resistance mutations other than those described above will be made by the
             site PI in consultation with the protocol chair or his designee. Whenever possible and
             not otherwise contraindicated, NRTI choices should be congruent with the
             protocol-specified preferred regimens. The site PI must provide a copy of the genotype
             analysis along with their proposed regimen for review; Note: Subjects who cannot go
             onto either FTC/TDF or AZT/3TC must have the regimen approved by the protocol team
             following pre-entry screening and prior to study entry. Note: All HIV-1 genotype
             profiles with ANY resistance mutations must be evaluated by a physician specializing
             in the care of HIV-infected patients prior to final determination of subject
             eligibility. Polymorphism mutations should NOT be reported since their clinical
             significance is unknown. All other (major and minor) mutations should be appropriately
             categorized and reported as indicated by the case report form. In circumstances where
             there are numerous such mutations or other concerns present, consultation with the
             protocol team by the evaluating physician via the ATN QNS is highly encouraged.

          6. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault
             equation: For men, (140 - age in years) x (body weight in kg) ÷ (serum creatinine in
             mg/dL x 72) = CrCl (mL/min)*;*For women, multiply the result by 0.85 = CrCl (mL/min);

          7. For females with child-bearing potential, agreement to use one effective birth control
             method and willing to postpone pregnancy for the duration of the study (See Section
             9.3 - criteria for class C drugs should be followed); and

          8. Able to provide written informed consent/assent.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Pregnancy;

          2. On systemic immunosuppressive therapy or immune modulating therapy (short courses (&lt;14
             days) of prednisone for reactive airway disease [RAD] are permitted but not within 30
             days prior to study entry);

          3. Any history of an AIDS-defining illness (note: a history of a CD4 + T cell count below
             200 cells/mm3 is not an exclusion criterion as long as all other inclusion/exclusion
             criteria are met);

          4. Currently breast feeding;

          5. Current treatment for active serious systemic bacterial infections;

          6. Active hepatitis B infection as defined by Hepatitis B Ag positive;

          7. Treatment with immune modulators including IL-2, intravenous gammaglobulin, and
             therapeutic or other experimental vaccines including HIV-1 vaccine given for primary
             prevention at any time;

          8. History of cardiac conduction abnormalities including one or more of the following:
             Symptomatic heart block, Third-degree heart block, even if asymptomatic,
             Pre-excitation syndromes, Heart Rate &lt;40 bpm, Ventricular pause length &gt;3 seconds, QTc
             &gt; 500 msec, and Cardiomyopathy;

          9. Disallowed Medications (see Section 5.3.2);

         10. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site personnel,
             would interfere with adherence to the study;

         11. History of chronic renal insufficiency or Grade 3 or greater serum creatinine; and

         12. Any confirmed grade 3 or greater laboratory value at pre-entry (with the exception of
             grade 3 or greater lipids or platelets).

Duration: Subjects in the experimental group who achieve virologic control by week 24 and maintain good control through 48 weeks will then de-intensify to ATV/r alone and will be followed for an additional two years.</description>

          <title>Standard Care Arm</title>
          <description>Subjects randomized to the standard care arm will begin HAART with TDF/FTC/ATV/r (preferred), AZT/3TC/ATV/r, or other recommended ATV/r based HAART regimen according to current DHHS standard of care and will be followed for a total of three years. Under these guidelines and under current clinical standards, subjects on the standard care arm will begin therapy when the CD4+ T cell count drops below 350 cells/mm3 or other clinical criteria necessitating treatment as determined by the site clinician occur.
Standard Care: Progression: Subjects on the standard care arm will begin therapy when the CD4+ T cell count drops below 350 cells/mm3 or other clinical criteria necessitating treatment as determined by the site clinician occur. Treatment: HAART with TDF/FTC/ATV/r (preferred), AZT/3TC/ATV/r, or other recommended ATV/r based HAART regimen according to current DHHS standard of care. Duration: three years.</description>
