      The primary objective of the study is to provide treatment with Ipilimumab to subjects who
      have serious or immediately life-threatening unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, who
      have no alternative treatment options, and whose physicians believe, based upon available
      data on benefit and risk, that it is appropriate to administer Ipilimumab at a dose of 3
      mg/kg induction (with re-induction, if eligible), or for eligible subjects previously
      enrolled in Ipilimumab studies CA184-042, CA184-078, CA184-087, MDX010-16, or MDX010-20.
