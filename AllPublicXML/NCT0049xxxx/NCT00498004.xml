    <textblock>

      Prolactin related adverse events are closely related to patient's perception on their illness
      and quality of life . Poor subjective wellbeing induced by prolactin elevation after
      antipsychotic drug treatment can complicate the clinical outcomes of treatment.Quetiapine has
      negligible effects on the elevation of prolactin and does not produce hyperprolactinemia
      related adverse events such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea that may disturb quality of life in
      famel patient. In this Randomized, Open Label, 8-week Study, the impact of quetiapine and
      risperidone on quality of life in female patients with schizophrenia will be compared.

    <description>The dose of quetiapine will be titrated over 4 days to 300mg/day (50mg at day 1, 100mg at day 2, 200mg at day 3 and 300mg at day 4) and thereafter flexible dose will be administered depending on the clinical state. The dose of risperidone will be titrated as following 2mg at day 1 and 4mg at day 4 and thereafter flexible dose will be administered depending on the clinical state. The dosage of drugs should be 400-800mg/day of quetiapine and 4-6mg/day of risperidone between 6 and 8 weeks of trial.</description>
