  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Borg Dyspnea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Bord dyspnea score is a 10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced during the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The Borg dyspnea score was assessed immediately following the 6MWT. Scores ranged from 0 (for no shortness of breath) to 10 (for greatest shortness of breath ever experienced).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea-Fatigue Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The dyspnea-fatigue index was assessed at Baseline, Weeks 1, 4, 8 ans 12. Each of the three components of the dyspnea-fatigue index were rated on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being the worst condition and 4 being the best condition for each component. The dyspnea-fatigue index is computed by summing the three component scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NYHA Functional Class</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from Baseline in NYHA Functional Class will be summarized and compared between treatment groups at Weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Worsening</measure>
    <time_frame>Twelve Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical worsening was defined as worsening PAH resulting in death, transplant, hospitalization, necessity to unblind for rescue therapy, or an inability to physically perform the walk assessment. Incidence of clinical worsening and the time from Baseline to clinical worsening will be compared between treatment groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Combined Walk and Borg Dyspnea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The intent of the Six-Minute Walk Test is to determine how much patients can do during the course of carrying out activities of daily living. However, the capacity of patients to function is determined not only by what they can do when they exert themselves to the fullest, but also by how they feel when they are carrying out their usual activities of daily living. It is therefore important not only to look at the distance traversed during the unencouraged 6-minute walk but also the symptoms experienced at the end of the effort. To do so, walk distances and Borg Scores from the Week 12 Six-Minute Walk Test were simultaneously compared between treatment groups.</description>
