  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effects in HIV patients of
      supplementation (4-20 fl. oz. daily) with ProAlgaZyme, a novel fermentation product of a
      freshwater algae ecosystem, on markers of immune status, dyslipidemia, inflammation and
      oxidative stress alone or in combination with HAART (highly-active antiretroviral therapy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection and interventions such as HAART (highly-active antiretroviral therapy) are
      associated with dyslipidemia and increased markers of inflammatory and oxidative stress.
      These effects can hasten the progression towards AIDS and present serious cardiovascular
      complications. Therapeutic agents that can provide immune support with minimal side effects
      and/or reduce the adverse effects of HAART are in high demand worldwide. Such agents may help
      HIV patients to live a better quality of life, and may potentially improve the compliance
      with traditional therapies including HAART. This study is a single-center open-label design
      to evaluate the safety of ProAlgaZyme novel algae infusion and its effects in varying dosages
      on markers of immune status, dyslipidemia, inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with
      HIV or HIV/HBV co-infection, who may also be taking HAART.
