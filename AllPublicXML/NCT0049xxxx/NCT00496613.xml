  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how chemotherapy affects an individual's
      thinking abilities (cognition). Some research has shown that chemotherapy can cause changes
      in cognition in breast cancer survivors. However, it is not clear why this change occurs. In
      this study, the investigators will look to see if damage to DNA is related to these changes
      in cognition. Specifically, the investigators want to see 1) if women who have been treated
      with chemotherapy have more DNA damage than healthy women; and 2) if DNA damage is related to
      cognitive problems in breast cancer survivors and healthy women.

      The primary objective of this proposal is to obtain preliminary data regarding the
      association between DNA damage and cognitive functioning in breast cancer survivors.
      Specifically, we predict that:

        1. Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy will have higher
           levels of DNA damage as measured by the Comet assay as compared to age and education
           matched survivors treated with hormonal therapy only and healthy controls.

        2. Survivors who meet criteria for cognitive impairment will have higher levels of DNA
           damage as compared to cancer survivors who do not meet criteria for cognitive impairment
           and healthy controls.
