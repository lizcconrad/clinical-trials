  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to collect information on patients who had or are
      going to have laparoscopy performed at M. D. Anderson. Researchers want to use this
      information to learn the effects of laparoscopic surgery on patients over time.

      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age,
      race, medical and surgical history, and type of cancer) will be collected. Information about
      the type of surgical procedure performed on you, your care during and after your surgery, any
      problems related to your surgery, and details about your follow-up care will be entered into
      a research database. This information will be collected from patients seen at M. D. Anderson
      since January 1, 1990. It will be used for future research studies.

      The research database will be updated, after about 1 year, to include information on your
      disease outcome, treatment, and/or follow-up care. This information will be collected from
      your medical record, if possible. If it is not in your medical record, you may again be
      contacted so that researchers can learn this information.

      Your participation in this study will continue up to 5 years after your laparoscopic
      procedure.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 1,000 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
