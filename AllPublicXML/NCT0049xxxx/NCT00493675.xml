    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sphincterotomy and temporary stenting is a routine treatment for post
      cholecystectomy cystic duct leakage. The draw back is that the plastic stent need to be
      removed later in a second intervention. Our studies with animal models have demonstrated that
      biodegradable biliary stent is at least as good as conventional plastic stent to heal that
      kind of leakage. In this pilot study the biodegradable biliary stent is inserted
      endoscopically to patients with confirmed cystic duct leakage to demonstrate the efficacy in
      human setting.
