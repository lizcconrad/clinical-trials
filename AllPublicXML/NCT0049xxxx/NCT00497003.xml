  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the two different beta blockers metoprolol
      and carvedilol on endothelial function in patients with either type two diabetes or chronic
      heart failure.

      Hypothesis: 1* Carvedilol compared to metoprolol has a favourable effect on endothelial
      function.

      2* Carvedilol compared to metoprolol has a favourable effect on insulin stimulated
      endothelial function.

      The study is conducted as an open parallel group study. Endothelial function and insulin
      stimulated endothelial function was evaluated before and after a two months treatment period
      with either of the two beta blockers.

    <textblock>
      Endothelial function is deteriorated in patients with type 2 diabetes and in patients with
      chronic heart failure. Treatment with carvedilol improves survival in patients with chronic
      heart failure compared to treatment with metoprolol. Carvedilol improves metabolic glucose
      control in patients with diabetes compared to metoprolol.Carvedilol compared to metoprolol
      also decreases the number of patients with new onset diabetes among patients with chronic
      heart failure. The mechanism behind these findings has not been fully understood.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate if carvedilol compared to metoprolol has a
      favourable effect on endothelial function and insulin stimulated endothelial function, in
      groups of patients with either diabetes or chronic heart failure.
