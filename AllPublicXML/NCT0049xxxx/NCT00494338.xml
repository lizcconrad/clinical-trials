      A multi-center controlled, non-comparative open Phase II trial of docetaxel and celecoxib in
      patients with metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer where efficacy is measured by
      PSA response defined as a 50% reduction in PSA maintained on two consecutive evaluations at
      least 4 weeks apart.
