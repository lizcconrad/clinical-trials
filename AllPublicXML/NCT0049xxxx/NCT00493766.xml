  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, two-arm, open-label, multicenter phase IA/IB study of LBH589 (oral
      formulation) alone and in combination with docetaxel in patients with progressing hormone
      refractory prostate cancer. This study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      LBH589 as a single agent and in combination with docetaxel and prednisone 5 mg two times a
      day , and to characterize the safety, tolerability, biologic activity and pharmacokinetic
      profile

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Patients must have metastatic disease with at least one measurable soft tissue lesion

             (MRI) and/or detectable lesion(s) on bone scintigraphy scan. Patients with only
             elevated prostate specific antegen (PSA) levels are not eligible for entry.

          -  Patients who have undergone medical castration must continue Luteinizing
             hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist therapy during study treatment

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with prior or concurrent brain metastases

          -  Impaired cardiac, gastrointestinal, kidney, or liver function

          -  Use of therapeutic androgens
