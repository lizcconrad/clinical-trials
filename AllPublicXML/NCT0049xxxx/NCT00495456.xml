  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is considerable, despite many advances in
      diagnosis, clinical management and drug therapy. The World Health Organization estimates 30%
      of global deaths are attributable to CVD and whilst mortality rates in developed countries
      are falling, it remains the largest single cause of death (WHO, 2007). Nineteen out of every
      100 deaths in Australia are attributed to CVD, with an annual cost of $1.47 billion (AIHW,
      2006).

      Assessing the risk of future cardiovascular events is traditionally based on a number of
      'risk-factors' determined by observational clinical studies such as the Framingham cohort.
      Recent evidence however invalidates their use in both the highest and lowest risk groups and
      raises questions about applying such methods in changing risk-behaviour. A considerable
      number of new risk markers have surfaced in recent years (including various biomarkers, pulse
      wave velocity and measures of arterial function). Unfortunately their long-term predictive
      capacity is largely unknown, particularly when compared with existing risk factors.

      The aims of this study are to provide objective longitudinal data for a wide variety of risk
      markers both in current use and in development. Participants of current on-going clinical
      studies at will be approached to lengthen their observation period for the purposes of
      determining long-term clinical outcomes.

      Standard clinical observations and data obtained within the participant's enrolled studies
      will be collated into an electronic database. All existing and future studies must have
      individual approval from an appropriate ethics committee with signed consent. The baseline
      studies and follow-up assessments of this cohort will be correlated with cardiovascular
      events, hospitalizations and mortality. In addition, volunteers can be directed to
      appropriate clinical studies in CVD, thereby enhancing recruitment, encouraging good quality
      clinical studies and advancing knowledge of cardiovascular disease prevention.
