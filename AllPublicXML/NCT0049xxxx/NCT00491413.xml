  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythropoietin (Epo) is a hormone normally found in the body that may protect brain cells
      from damage due to lack of oxygen. This study will evaluate the safety of high-dose Epo in
      infants who did not get enough oxygen during birth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Damage to the central nervous system as a result of oxygen deprivation at birth is a major
      cause of life-long mental and developmental handicaps. When there is not enough oxygen in the
      blood (hypoxemia) the brain is deprived of oxygen. Some brain cells respond by producing Epo.
      Epo then binds to oxygen-deprived brain cells. This binding triggers chemical reactions
      within the brain cell that prevent cell death. Epo also reduces inflammation around the brain
      cells and acts as an antioxidant. In animal studies, recombinant Epo (rEpo) administration,
      even up to six hours after oxygen deprivation, reduced subsequent brain injury by 50% to 70%.

      Epo has been used by neonatologists to stimulate erythropoiesis (red blood cell production)
      and reduce the incidence of blood transfusions. Doses of rEpo required for protection of
      brain cells are considerably higher than those traditionally used by neonatologists.

      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biologic effect, and safety of high dose Epo
      in neonates with brain injury due to hypoxemia.

      Within six hours of birth, each eligible infant will receive one dose of rEpo intravenously.
      Any infants who require a lumbar puncture during the first week of life will have levels of
      natural Epo and rEpo in their spinal fluid measured. Blood tests will be used to measure the
      antioxidant effect of Epo and the impact on red blood cell production. Neurodevelopmental
      outcome will be measured at 6 and 12 months of age.
