      Primary Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not combined quantitative diffusion and
      fat MR imaging techniques can differentiate between benign and malignant vertebral fractures.

    <textblock>
      Researchers believe that they may be able to use MRI scans to tell if fractures of the bones
      in the spine are due to cancer. They believe this can be done by looking at MRIs of diffusion
      (the random motion of molecules) and fat. For benign and malignant processes, either
      diffusion or fat, or both of them, can be different, because the cell density (which affects
      diffusion) and bone marrow content (which affects fat) are expected to be different.

      All patients in this study will have already been scheduled for MRI exams of the spine at
      UTMDACC.

      You will have one extra MRI sequence done to look for relative fat, and a second extra MRI
      sequence done to look for the diffusion. The extra time required for the study should be less
      than 10 minutes, and the total imaging time should fall within a standard MRI time slot.

      Available data from your medical record, including imaging data, will be used to set up
      guidelines and clear examples for checking spinal fractures.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 48 patients will take part in the study. All
      will be enrolled at UTMDACC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients with suspected vertebral compression fractures scheduled a standard of care MRI
        of the spine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are contraindicated for MRI (such as due to metal implants, cardiac
             pacemaker).

          2. Patients who are unable to give informed consent

          3. Patients who are younger than 18 years of age since the disease (osteoporosis) is not
             present in children.
