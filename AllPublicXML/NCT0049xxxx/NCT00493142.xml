  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a pre-operative home rehabilitation
      exercise program designed for knee replacements is more effective than pre-operative usual
      care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with lower levels of function prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) attain lower
      functional endpoints after surgery. Therapeutic exercise improves function in patients with
      arthritis of the knee, yet little evidence has examined the impact of pre-operative exercise
      for TKA.

      Single blinded randomized clinical trial comparing a pre-operative home exercise program to
      pre-operative usual care for patients who are waiting for TKA.Comparison group is usual care
      within the health region which does not include pre-operative rehabilitation program.

      Primary outcome: WOMAC function subscale. Secondary outcomes: 1) quality of life; 2)
      ambulation; 3) self-efficacy; 4) anxiety; 5) patient satisfaction; 6) cost-effectiveness of
      this intervention.

      Total Enrollment: 230 patients

      If the intervention improves function prior to surgery, results will be clinically applicable
      for patients waiting for surgery
