  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Originally thought to be a rare occurrence, BCVI are now diagnosed in approximately 1% of
      blunt trauma patients. Initially BCVI were thought to have unavoidable devastating neurologic
      outcomes. But early reports suggested anticoagulation might decrease these events. If
      untreated, carotid artery injuries (CAI) have a stoke rate up to 50% depending on injury
      grade, with increasing stroke rates correlating with increasing grades of injury. Current
      studies report early treatment with antithrombotics - either heparin or anti-platelet agents
      - in patients with BCVI markedly reduces stroke rates and resultant neurologic morbidity. As
      reports of bleeding complications have altered heparin protocols in these patients, the use
      of antiplatelet agents is attractive. Although heparin has been has been proposed as the gold
      standard treatment due to its initial empiric use, no comparative studies of antithrombotic
      agents has been performed.

      In sum, Grade I-III blunt carotid and vertebral arterial injuries (BCVI) have the potential
      for stroke, and should be treated. Heparin has not been shown to clearly improve healing
      rates compared with antiplatelet therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      systemic anticoagulation alters the course of Grade I-III BCVI compared with antiplatelet
      therapy. The investigators study hypothesis is that Grade I-III BCVI will heal or progress to
      pseudoaneurysm formation, independent of systemic antithrombotic regimen, and that the
      combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is equally efficacious in preventing neurologic
      symptoms compared to systemic heparin associated with Grade I-III BCVI.
