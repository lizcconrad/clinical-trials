  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the effect of growth hormone on lipid-content of muscle and
      liver as well as visceral fat mass in relation to insulin sensitivity.

      In addition, hormonal regulation and free fatty availability is assessed during a physical
      exercise at 50-60% VO2max.

      Finally, the value of physical exercise in diagnosing growth hormone deficiency is
      investigated.

      Hypothesis: 1) Lipid content of muscle and liver change with physical exercise and exercise
      capacity and free fatty availability will influence these changes. 2)Growth hormone
      replacement therapy will predominantly reduce visceral fat mass and increase free fatty
      availability.

      3)Free fatty availability during exercise will be reduced in growth hormone deficient
      patients 4)Physical exercise may be an alternative way to diagnose growth hormone deficiency

      Using the two-step hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique hepatic and peripheral
      insulin sensitivity is assessed.

      Lipid depots (skeletal muscle and liver) are measured by MR-spectroscopy, visceral fat mass
      by MR-imaging.

      Exercise capacity ist measured on a treadmill. Counterregulatory hormones, glucose and free
      fatty acids are measured during a 2h physical exercise at 50-60 VO2max Identical
      investigations are performed in adult growth hormone (GH) deficient patients before and after
      six months GH replacement therapy, in sedentary matched control subjects and in endurance
      trained athletes.
