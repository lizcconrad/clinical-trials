The CDLM questionnaire is as a questionnaire to report on patient's ability to carry out each of six different morning activities (score ranging from 0 &quot;not performed&quot; to 1&quot;performed&quot;) and rank the difficulty of performing each of those activities (score ranging from 0 &quot;so difficult that the activity could not be carried out by the patient on their own&quot; to 5 &quot;activity was not at all difficult to carry out&quot;. Total score for each morning activity range from 0-6. Total score for whole CDLM questionnaire range from 0-36.</description>

        <description>Daily diary record. Change in average values from run-in to the full treatment period.
The GCSQ consisted of two questions that required the patient to rate shortness of breath and feelings of chest tightness. The patients recorded their response on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), the total score being calculated as the average score of the two questions.</description>

The CDLM questionnaire is as a questionnaire to report on patient’s ability to carry out each of six different morning activities (score ranging from 0 “not performed” to 1”performed”) and rank the difficulty of performing each of those activities (score ranging from 0 “so difficult that the activity could not be carried out by the patient on their own” to 5 “activity was not at all difficult to carry out”. Total score for each morning activity range from 0-6. Total score for whole CDLM questionnaire range from 0-36.</description>
