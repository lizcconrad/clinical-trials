  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate efficacy and safety of vildagliptin in patients with low baseline
      levels starting at an HbA1C level of 6.5% to support convenient early intervention with
      combination therapies. In parallel, morning and evening dosing will be evaluated in this
      patient population for the first time.
