      The purpose of this study is to learn whether or not the drug called oxytocin is helpful in
      improving mood and social functioning in adults with autism.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by abnormalities in speech and
      communication, impaired social functioning, and repetitive behaviors and restricted
      interests. A number of researchers have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be
      implicated in the etiology of autism.

      Given the likely possibility of dysregulated oxytocin in autism, the goal of this pilot study
      is to investigate the long-term therapeutic effects of oxytocin in the treatment of autism.
      One practical issue with oxytocin is that it does not exist in a pill form. Only the
      intravenous form is available in the United States and this form may or may not pass the
      blood-brain barrier. In addition, intravenous oxytocin is not practical for treatment
      studies. One alternative is intranasal oxytocin; this form of administration is known to pass
      the blood-brain barrier, and it is easy for participants to self-administer. Although not
      available in the United States, we are in the process of receiving an Investigational New
      Drug exemption for its use and can import it from Europe.

      Thus, this pilot investigation will explore daily intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of
      autism. Also, there are very few, if any, outcome measures to assess social functioning in
      the &quot;real world&quot; in the context of clinical trials; yet, this is a major target for
      intervention, especially in autism. Thus, a final goal of this study will be to explore the
      use of Event Contingent Recording to index changes in social functioning and affect. Event
      Contingent Recording is a methodology developed by personality/social psychologists, which
      allows participants to report on symptoms, affect, and behavior close in time to experience.
      In addition, to enabling more sensitive assessments, this methodology allows for the
      assessment of more diverse (e.g., at home versus work) and more detailed measurements of mood
      and behavior.

      Finally, a portion of this study aims to perform gene expression profiling using fresh whole
      blood to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying oxytocin therapy and oxytocin efficacy
      in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The systemic effects of
      oxytocin therapy and the molecular basis for a positive treatment response to oxytocin are
      not well understood. An understanding of the former may help predict those persons who may
      suffer side-effects from treatment and the latter may help provide easily accessible
      peripheral biomarkers that could predict treatment response.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Improvement - Social</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Improvement - Social is a well validated measure employing a 7-point scale of clinical global impression of improvement ( 1- very much improved, 2 - much improved, 3 - minimally improved, 4 - no change, 5 - minimally worse, 6 - much worse, 7 - very much worse) that the clinician fills out after considering all the available information on the participant including the parent history, the examination in clinic, reports from the school and other sources. Therefore the score is filtered through the judgment of the clinician evaluator.
The Week 6 Improvement Ratings were used to categorize patients as clinically improved (≤2) or not (&gt;2). Sixteen of the 19 patients (84%) had data at Week 6. For the remaining three subjects, Week 6 ratings were imputed using expectation-maximization methods and the earlier Clinical Global Impression ratings. In all three cases the imputed ratings were &gt;2 and the patients were classified as not improved.</description>

    <measure>Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised was developed to capture the breadth of repetitive behaviors that are specific to autism and is a parent report measure. In particular, it consists of 43-items that tap six repetitive behavior subtypes: Stereotyped, Self-injurious, Compulsive, Ritualistic, Sameness, and Restricted Interests.
Two scores were calculated (higher-order vs. lower-order repetitive behaviors) in an effort to decrease the number of variables analyzed. This is based on previous factor analysis that produced these two factors: higher order (ritualistic, sameness, compulsive and restricted subscales) and lower order (stereotypy and self-injury).
The higher order behaviors have 29 items that can be endorsed with a maximum score of 87 and a minimum score of 0
The lower order behaviors have 14 items that can be endorsed, with a maximum score of 42 and a minimum score of 0
In both cases, a lower score represents a positive response.</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy, Paralanguage Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy is a measure of emotion recognition across multiple modalities. It consists of five subtests: the Adult Facial Expression Test, the Child Facial Expression Test, the Adult Paralanguage Test, the Child Paralanguage Test, and the Adult Posture Test. The Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy has established reliability and validity for children as young as 3 and adults as old as 100. The subtests of the test vary on four basic core emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, and the test provides measures of both high intensity and low intensity emotional reactions. We utilized both the Child Paralanguage and Adult Paralanguage Tests, therefore the minimum score that can be obtained is 0 and the maximum is 48. A higher score represents a positive response.</description>

    <measure>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale is a clinician-rated questionnaire measuring the time spent, distress, interference, resistance, and control in relation to obsessions and compulsions based on a 5-point scale. This scale has excellent reliability and validity and is used as the gold standard to measure treatment challenges in all Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder clinical trials. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Compulsion Subscale has been shown to be a reliable and valid scale in Autism Spectrum Disorder, and in measuring change in treatment studies of autism. The minimum score that can be obtained is 0 and the maximum score is 20. A lower score represents a positive response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Responsiveness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale has been developed to measure autism related symptoms and focuses more on social function than social cognition. The Social Responsiveness Scale has been modified for adults by and we have obtained permission to use the adult scale, although it is not commercially available yet. The Social Responsiveness Scale measures social behaviors such as social awareness, information processing, and social motivation and yields a quantitative score that has been useful in endophenotype studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The minimum score that can be obtained is a 0 and the maximum raw score for subscales is 66, maximum total raw score is 153. A lower score represents a positive response.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Improvement - Social</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Improvement - Social is a well validated measure employing a 7-point scale of clinical global impression of improvement ( 1- very much improved, 2 - much improved, 3 - minimally improved, 4 - no change, 5 - minimally worse, 6 - much worse, 7 - very much worse) that the clinician fills out after considering all the available information on the participant including the parent history, the examination in clinic, reports from the school and other sources. Therefore the score is filtered through the judgment of the clinician evaluator.
The Week 6 Improvement Ratings were used to categorize patients as clinically improved (≤2) or not (&gt;2). Sixteen of the 19 patients (84%) had data at Week 6. For the remaining three subjects, Week 6 ratings were imputed using expectation-maximization methods and the earlier Clinical Global Impression ratings. In all three cases the imputed ratings were &gt;2 and the patients were classified as not improved.</description>

        <title>Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised</title>
        <description>The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised was developed to capture the breadth of repetitive behaviors that are specific to autism and is a parent report measure. In particular, it consists of 43-items that tap six repetitive behavior subtypes: Stereotyped, Self-injurious, Compulsive, Ritualistic, Sameness, and Restricted Interests.
Two scores were calculated (higher-order vs. lower-order repetitive behaviors) in an effort to decrease the number of variables analyzed. This is based on previous factor analysis that produced these two factors: higher order (ritualistic, sameness, compulsive and restricted subscales) and lower order (stereotypy and self-injury).
The higher order behaviors have 29 items that can be endorsed with a maximum score of 87 and a minimum score of 0
The lower order behaviors have 14 items that can be endorsed, with a maximum score of 42 and a minimum score of 0
In both cases, a lower score represents a positive response.</description>

        <description>The Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy is a measure of emotion recognition across multiple modalities. It consists of five subtests: the Adult Facial Expression Test, the Child Facial Expression Test, the Adult Paralanguage Test, the Child Paralanguage Test, and the Adult Posture Test. The Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy has established reliability and validity for children as young as 3 and adults as old as 100. The subtests of the test vary on four basic core emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, and the test provides measures of both high intensity and low intensity emotional reactions. We utilized both the Child Paralanguage and Adult Paralanguage Tests, therefore the minimum score that can be obtained is 0 and the maximum is 48. A higher score represents a positive response.</description>
