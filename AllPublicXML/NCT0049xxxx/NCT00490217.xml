    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a severe complication of ascites in cirrhotic
      patients. Under clinical experience, this condition seems to be more uncommon in Finland. The
      aim of this study was to measure the incidence of SBP in consecutive patients with ascites
      requiring hospitalization in a Finnish University Hospital.

    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a complication of liver cirrhosis with high
      mortality and low survival rates. The incidence of SBP is reported to range from 11-35% in
      patients with ascites requiring hospitalization. Under clinical experience, the incidence of
      SBP in Finland seems to be lower than reported elsewhere. Alcohol is the dominant etiologic
      factor of liver cirrhosis in Finland (90%), which might be a factor affecting the incidence
      of SBP. The aim of this study is to measure the incidence of SBP in Finland. We included
      consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic paracentesis for ascites in Tampere University
      Hospital during 2/1994 - 12/1998 and 1/2005 - 3/2007. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was
      diagnosed when the ascitic fluid contained over 250 polymorphonuclear cells / mm^3 regardless
      of culture and with no evidence of intra-abdominal source of infection e.g. an abscess or a
      perforation.
