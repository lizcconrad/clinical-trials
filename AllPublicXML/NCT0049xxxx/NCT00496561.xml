      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of specific immunotherapy (SIT) to dust mites on
      clinical symptoms, reliever drugs usage, inhaled glucocorticosteroid usage, quality of life,
      lung function, chosen markers of inflammation, induction of regulatory lymphocytes, bronchial
      hyperreactivity with methacholine, and presence and type of allergy after two years of SIT in
      children with asthma.
