  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate hemoglobin stability in subjects who had received
      darbepoetin alfa for a minimum of 3 months prior to study entry who were then converted to
      epoetin alfa at the same dosing frequency to maintain a hemoglobin level of 12 plus or minus
      1 g/dL (range 11-13- g/dL).

      This was a prospective, multicenter study in subjects with chronic kidney disease. The study
      was designed to address hemoglobin stability after drug conversion to epoetin alfa in
      subjects previously receiving darbepoetin alfa therapy.

      The study was to enroll approximately 180 subjects with chronic kidney disease. Eligible
      subjects were those with chronic kidney disease who were receiving darbepoetin alfa every
      two, three, or four weeks for a period of 3 months or more and who had a stable hemoglobin
      (Hb) level at study entry of 12 g/dL (plus or minus 1 g/dL (11-13 g/dL). Subjects receiving
      darbepoetin alfa every 2, 3 or 4 weeks were switched over to epoetin alfa which they received
      at the same dosing frequency ( every 2, 3 or 4 weeks) upon study entry and throughout the 24
      week study period. Clinical safety was assessed for the occurrence and severity of adverse
      events. Blood tests (Complete Blood Count, platelets, reticulocyte count, iron, were assessed
      at pre-determined intervals throughout the study. Vital signs (e.g. Blood pressure) were
      checked at each visit. Subjects received epoetin alfa at the same dosing frequency that they
      had previously received darbepoetin alfa. Subjects received 20,000 Units (U) epoetin alfa
      subcutaneously (SC) every two weeks; 30,000 U epoetin alfa SC every 3 weeks; or 40,000 U
      epoetin alfa SC every 4 weeks.
