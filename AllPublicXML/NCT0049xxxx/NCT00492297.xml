  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a new type of anti-cancer drug, known as BAY
      43-9006, can be given safely and with good effect in combination with dacarbazine (DTIC).
      DTIC is the current standard chemotherapy drug given for melanoma that has spread through the
      body. Although this drug can be effective on its own and is generally well tolerated, not all
      patients will benefit, so there is a need to test new drugs and drug combinations for
      treating melanoma.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Best Response</measure>
    <time_frame>during or within 30 days after active therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Best Overall Response (BOR): Best tumor response achieved during or within 30 days after active therapy confirmed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR): The disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD was defined as steady state of disease, PD was defined as an increase of at least 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>from start of treatment until progression or death before progression (median 259 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free Survival (PFS) was the time from the first dose of combination therapy to disease progression (radiological or clinical, whichever is earlier) or death (if death occurs before progression is documented). PFS for subjects without tumor progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last tumor evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Progression-free Survival at Specific Time-points</measure>
    <time_frame>from start of treatment until progression or death before progression after 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free Survival (PFS) was the time from the first dose of combination therapy to disease progression (radiological or clinical, whichever is earlier) or death (if death occurs before progression is documented). PFS for subjects without tumor progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last tumor evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>from start of treatment until death (median 259 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival was the number of days from the date that combination treatment started until the date of death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>from confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) until Progressive Disease (PD) (median 259 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Response was assessed in subjects who showed a Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR). It was defined as the time from the first documented objective response to Progressive Disease (PD), or death if before documented progression. Duration of response for subjects who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis was censored at the date of last tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Complete Response</measure>
    <time_frame>from confirmed CR until PD (median 259 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of complete response was the number of days from the date that a complete response was first documented to the date that recurrent or progressive disease was first objectively documented (if patient progressed then censored=no) or to last observation (if patient did not progress then censored=yes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Partial Response</measure>
    <time_frame>from confirmed PR until PD (median 259 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of partial response was the number of days from the date that a partial response was first documented to the date that recurrent or progressive disease was first objectively documented (if patient progressed then censored=no) or to last observation (if patient did not progress then censored=yes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control (DC)</measure>
    <time_frame>after start of treatment, at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>DC was defined as the total number of subjects whose best response was not progressive disease (PD) (total number of CRs + total number of PRs + total number of Stable Diseases (SD)). The DC at specific time points could also be calculated as the total number of subjects whose response was not PD at that time point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>from start of therapy to PD, only in non-responders (median 259 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Stable Disease (DSD), defined as the time from the first documented objective evidence of Stable Disease (SD) to disease progression (DP) or death if death occurred before DP, was assessed in subjects who showed SD as best response. DSD for subjects who had not progressed or died was censored at the date of last tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response</measure>
    <time_frame>start of therapy to confirmed CR or PR (median 259 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Response in subjects who achieved an objective response (PR or CR with confirmation) was measured from the date of starting study combination treatment until the earliest date that the response was first documented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until progression (median 259 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Progression was the number of days from the start of therapy to progression (if patient progressed then censored=no) or to the last observation at which the patient was known to have not progressed, that is, the last observation with a best response of CR, PR, or SD.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study had a 2-stage Simon optimal design consisting of 30 subjects in the first stage and 52 subjects in the second stage for a planned total of 82 subjects. Actually a total of 96 subjects were enrolled and 83 were treated; 32 in the 1st stage and 51 in the second stage. The study was conducted at 8 centers in the UK and 4 centers in France.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 96 enrolled subjects, 13 were screening failures. The reasons for screening failure were violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria (12) and death due to Progressive Disease (PD) (1). The remaining 83 subjects all received at least one dose of sorafenib and dacarbazine.</pre_assignment_details>

Subjects withdrawn from Sorafenib but with optional standard treatment entered Active Follow-up (AFU) period, which was 30(+4) days for subjects who had PD at the end of treatment; or until PD was documented for subjects who had complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at the end of treatment up to 97 weeks . Once subject progressed went into survival only follow-up which continued until death occurred up to 172 weeks.</description>

        <description>Best Overall Response (BOR): Best tumor response achieved during or within 30 days after active therapy confirmed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR): The disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD was defined as steady state of disease, PD was defined as an increase of at least 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>
