      The purpose of the study is to assess whether spinal anesthesia is or not superior to the
      standard general anesthesia for fit patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy under regional anesthesia alone has been reported only
      occasionally in the past; all these reports included patients unfit to receive general
      anesthesia, mainly patients with severe chronic obstructive airway disease. Regional
      anesthesia has been used for laparoscopy in fit patients almost exclusively in combination
      with general anesthesia, in order to extend the analgesic effect during the early
      postoperative period. Surprisingly, in the era of minimally invasive medicine, regional
      anesthesia has not gained popularity, and has not been routinely used as a sole method of
      anesthesia in laparoscopic procedures. It is generally accepted that all laparoscopic
      procedures are merely a change in access and still require general anesthetic; hence the
      difference from conventional surgery is likely to be small. This statement is predominantly
      based on the assumption that laparoscopy necessitates endotracheal intubation to prevent
      aspiration and respiratory embarrassment secondary to the induction of CO2 pneumoperitoneum
      which in turn is not well tolerated in a patient who is awake during the procedure. However,
      it is surprising that regional anesthesia has been successfully used for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy in patients unfit to have the procedure under general anesthesia, but has not
      been tested in fit patients, in whom any presumed risk would be, theoretically, much lower.
      We have recently shown in a pilot study the feasibility to perform successfully and safely
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy with low pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum under spinal anesthesia
      alone, in fit patients with symptomatic gallstone disease. We have also noticed that spinal
      anesthesia results in exceptionally minimal postoperative pain. After this pilot study, we
      designed a controlled randomized trial in order to compare spinal anesthesia with the
      standard general anesthesia for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in fit patients.
