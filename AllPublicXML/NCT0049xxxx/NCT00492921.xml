      RATIONALE: High-dose cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for acute
      graft-versus-host disease that did not respond to steroid therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects, best dose, and how well high-dose
      cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with acute graft-versus-host disease that did not
      respond to steroid therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with
           steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen at 28 days post-treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide once daily for 1-4 days beginning on day 1 and
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood
      counts recover.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) ≥ clinical grade II,
             that is steroid refractory

               -  Steroid refractory GVHD is defined as GVHD that has progressed (increasing in
                  grading) despite 49 hours of treatment with methylprednisolone of ≥ 2.0 mg/kg OR
                  GVHD that has failed to improve (no change in grading stage) despite 4 days of
                  treatment with methylprednisolone of ≥ 2.0 mg/kg

          -  Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using either bone marrow,
             peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood OR prior donor lymphocyte infusion required

          -  Evidence of myeloid engraftment

          -  No chronic GVHD

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2 OR Karnofsky PS 60-100%

          -  ANC &gt; 500/mm³

          -  Not pregnant or nursing

          -  No mechanical ventilation

          -  No active bleeding (excluding gastrointestinal bleeding) or history of hemorrhagic
             cystitis

          -  No other uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, the following:

               -  Ongoing or active infection

               -  Medical condition precluding patient from stopping azoles (e.g., fluconazole,
                  itraconazole, or voriconazole) or other adequate antifungal therapy during
                  cyclophosphamide administration

               -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure

               -  Unstable angina pectoris

               -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would preclude compliance
