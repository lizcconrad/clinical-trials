    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune system response to recombinant
      thrombin when used to control bleeding in spinal and vascular surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, open-label, single-group, multisite safety and immunogenicity study of
      recombinant thrombin (rThrombin) in participants who are at least 18 years of age and
      undergoing spinal or vascular surgery. Eligible participants will receive topical rThrombin
      during surgery and complete a 1-month follow-up visit.
