  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether hyperbaric oxygen treatment improves
      neurological function in patients who exhibit white matter hyperintensities on MRI
      examination.

      The secondary goal of this study is to determine if it is possible using MRI to discern a
      difference in perfusion of central nervous system tissue in regions of white matter
      hyperintensities after hyperbaric oxygen administration as compared to hyperbaric air.

      Consecutively enrolled patients will be assigned to hyperbaric oxygen or hyperbaric air by
      random number. Physicians supervising the hyperbaric treatments and the treating technicians,
      the evaluating neurologist, and the interpreter of the MRIs will be blinded regarding patient
      treatment status. All patients who receive placebo will be offered treatment with hyperbaric
      oxygen.
