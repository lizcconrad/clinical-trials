  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individual and/ or system orientated
      interventions can help the problem of people with schizophrenia dropping out of their drug
      treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50% of people with schizophrenia do not take the prescribed medication leading to repeating
      relapses with loss of social and cognitive skills.

      The individual intervention is based on &quot;Motivational Interviewing&quot; by Miller and
      &quot;Concordance Strategies&quot; by R. Gray.It is a cognitive behavioral therapy.

      The system orientated intervention is building on principles from quality assurance and
      clinical risk managing. It seeks to improve the quality in the medical treatment by use of
      standards, monitoring, audit and root cause analysis,and thereby trying to find weak points
      in the system and subsequently improve the common practice.

    <description>Principles in this intervention come from &quot;Clinical Risk Managing&quot; and quality assurance. It focuses on daily problems in drug handling, including dropping out of drug therapy, by looking at the system as a whole.Some cases, where patients dropped out of drug therapy will be carefully analysed in order to identify week points in the system, and subsequently alter the instructions for drug therapy, information, reminders and so on.</description>
