      The objective of this randomized control trial is to compare the effectiveness of Stress
      Inoculation Training (SIT), a well researched psychological treatment for Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD), to that of the non-specific standard care provided in primary care
      settings, called Supportive Counseling (SC), on individuals who were exposed to the September
      11, 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, or the immediate aftermath of this attack. Both
      SIT and SC interventions will each be provided in one 2-hour session with eight weeks of
      daily systematic web-based follow up to promote self-help. The primary hypothesis of this
      study is that SIT will reduce the level of PTSD in participants relative to SCand to the
      pre-treatment levels.

      Because resources are often scarce in the aftermath of disasters, a useful mental health
      intervention is one that is effective, feasible, rapidly available, and efficiently delivered
      to the largest proportion of affected individuals possible. In terms of treating PTSD in
      other trauma contexts, there is considerable evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      procedures are effective at reducing the array of PTSD symptoms. Overall, the available
      evidence points to the theoretical and empirical justification for using Prolonged Exposure
      (PE) and Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), two components of CBT, with patients presenting
      with PTSD. A practical limitation of available studies is that they are limited to
      individually administered therapy contexts that typically require between 8 and 12 sessions
      delivered in a specialty mental health care-setting. The labor-intensive nature of these
      therapies represents a significant obstacle to provision of therapy to potentially thousands
      of individuals suffering PTSD in the context of mass violence events.

      The major aim of this project is to evaluate an abbreviated format of SIT that aims to
      provide effective self/stress-management skills to individuals with PTSD. The rationale
      behind this intervention is that with appropriate and intensive therapist input during a
      single session of therapy, supplemented systematically with self-paced and self-directed
      homework, promoted, prompted, and monitored via a specialized web-site and augmented by
      therapist feedback and guidance delivered via the web, primary care patients with PTSD
      stemming from mass violence can benefit from the strategies that have demonstrated efficacy
      in reducing PTSD symptoms. Survivors of the Pentagon attack on 9/11 who present at primary
      care clinics that serve the Pengaton are randomly assigned to SIT or a supportive counseling
      control group. Patients’ compliance and symptoms are monitored on the web and via clinical
      interview.
