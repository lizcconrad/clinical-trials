      Common cold medicines are often formulated as a hot drink yet there is no evidence in the
      public domain that presenting the medicine as a hot drink has any impact on symptom severity.

      Common cold medicines are often formulated as a hot drink and usually contain paracetamol and
      a decongestant such as phenylephrine but it is the 'hot drink' formulation that is often an
      attraction to the patient in deciding on which formulation of a cold medicine to purchase and
      use. Hot drinks have been used to relieve the symptoms of acute respiratory infections such
      as colds and flu for hundreds of years and are found in the traditional medicines of
      countries throughout the world. The idea of using a hot drink to treat colds and flu appears
      to originate from a perceived link between exposure to cold and chilling and the onset of a
      respiratory infection. In order to combat the cold exposure many traditional remedies use a
      warming and soothing drink or application of a warming ointment . Despite the widespread
      folklore that hot drinks are an effective treatment for colds and flu, and the use of hot
      drink formulations for many current common cold medicines, there appears to be no evidence
      base in the medical literature supporting the efficacy of this common treatment for common
      cold. The aim of the present study is to obtain new knowledge about the effects of hot drinks
      on nasal airway resistance and other symptoms of common cold.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged over 18 years.

          -  Has given informed consent.

          -  Is suffering from common cold/flu like illness

          -  Indicates they are suffering from at least three common cold symptoms (runny nose,
             sneezing, blocked nose, sore throat, cough) and scores at least 2 symptoms as moderate
             on four point ordinal scale of (0=not present, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will not be enrolled in the study if any of the following criteria are met:

          -  The subject is unwilling to sign the consent form.

          -  The subject has a clinically significant cardiovascular, endocrinological,
             neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal disease or any other disease that is
             considered by the investigator as a reason for exclusion.

          -  The subject has a severe nasal septal deviation or other condition that could cause
             nasal obstruction such as the presence of nasal polyps.

          -  The subject has had nasal surgery in the past that in the opinion of the investigator
             may influence symptom scores or nasal airway resistance

          -  The subject has ingested any alcohol within the previous 12 hours or more than 4 units
             of alcohol in the previous 24 hours

          -  The subject is a drug or alcohol abuser

          -  The subject is taking any prescribed medication other than for contraception

          -  The subject has had common cold for more than 7 days

          -  The subject has recently taken a common cold medicine that in the opinion of the
             investigator may influence symptom scores or nasal airway resistance (analgesics,
             nasal decongestants, cough medicines)

          -  The subject has ingested any hot food or drink within the previous hour
