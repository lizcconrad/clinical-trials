  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate, after radiological progression, efficacy in patients
      treated with Sorafenib at a dose of 600 mg bid compared to that in patients treated with best
      supportive care.

      Primary efficacy objective is progression free survival from randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with advanced/inoperable HCC not eligible for radical or loco-regional therapies
        Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks at screening
        Histologically or cytologically documented HCC

        At least one tumor lesion that meets both of the following criteria:

          1. The lesion is measurable as per RECIST criteria, and

          2. The lesion has not been subject to previous loco-regional therapy (such as radiation
             therapy, TACE, TAE, PEI, RFA, or cryoablation) Patients previously treated with
             loco-regional treatments are eligible provided that previously treated lesions are not
             selected as target lesions. Local therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to
             the baseline scan ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2 Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh class A or B
             Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C

        The following laboratory parameters:

          -  Platelet count ≥ 60 x 109 /L

             such as Coumadin or heparin will be allowed to participate provided that no prior
             evidence of underlying abnormality in these parameters exists.

        Written informed consent prior to any study specific screening procedures with the

        without prejudice.
