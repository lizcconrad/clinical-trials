      To determine whether screening of pregnant women with history of previous preterm delivery or
      with premature contractions for bacterial vaginosis using VS-SENSE, and treatment of positive
      women will reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm birth.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, comparative, and prospective study. Pregnant women, pregnancy week 26
      to 36+6, between the ages 18-45, who were hospitalized in the high risk department, with
      history of previous preterm delivery and/or with premature contractions. Patient with
      premature ruptured membrane will be excluded.

      In the hospital pregnant women with history of previous preterm delivery or with premature
      contractions, (participants) will be examined by speculum with no lubricant, The clinician
      will use the VS-SENSE to sample vaginal secretions and will immediately observe and record
      the color obtained.Should the VS-SENSE produce positive results the physician will consider
      giving clindamycin treatment.
