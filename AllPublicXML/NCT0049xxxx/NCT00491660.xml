  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of death among all nosocomial
      infections in ventilated patients. Once intubated, the risk of pneumonia in hospitalized
      patients is increased 3-10 fold; almost 90% of hospital-acquired pneumonia occurs in
      intubated patients. Each episode of VAP is associated with 7-9 days of additional hospital
      stay with an estimated increase in cost of care that exceeds $40,000. In an effort to control
      VAP, several studies were conducted including oral and gastric decontamination with
      antibiotics, rotation of the bed, and local instillation of antibiotics via endotracheal
      tube. Despite such efforts, VAP is still a major complication for intubated patients.

      The effect of gravity on bacterial colonization of the endotracheal tube was recently
      explored in an animal study that was conducted at the United States National Institutes of
      Health. The study demonstrated a significantly lower tracheal colonization and decreased
      alveolar contamination in ventilated sheep when positioned on their side allowing for
      tracheal drainage by gravity. Such findings have not been validated in clinical practice and
      the need for clinical trials studying the effect of lateral positioning have been demanded.
      Therefore, we aimed our randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that intubated
      infants who are positioned on their side are at lower risk for contracting microbes in their
      trachea when compared to those in a supine position.

      Subjects were to be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

        1. Supine group, in which infants are maintained on their back at all times. The
           endotracheal tube is held upright in vertical position at all times. The bed is kept
           horizontal without any angle or tilt.

        2. Lateral group. Infants are maintained on their side while the back supported with a
           rolled towel. The endotracheal tube is maintained to rest horizontally on the bed.
