  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether ramelteon, once daily (QD), can facilitate the
      discontinuation of zolpidem in subjects with chronic insomnia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 to 70 million adults in the United States alone are affected by insomnia.
      Daytime symptoms of insomnia include tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and
      irritability. Recent epidemiologic research focusing on the quality of life has identified
      significant insomnia-related morbidities that relate to work productivity, health care
      utilization, and risk of depression. Insomnia is associated with diminished work output,
      absenteeism, and greater rates of accidents.

      Zolpidem is the most commonly prescribed hypnotic in the United States for patients suffering
      from insomnia.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether ramelteon therapy can facilitate the
      discontinuation of benzodiazepine therapy in long term users. Subject participation in this
      study is anticipated to be about 17 weeks.

      Subjects were screened and enrolled in a 4-week placebo run-in period, may have been
      randomized to a 10-week double-blind treatment period, and may have completed with a 2-week
      open-label treatment period. In the double-blind treatment period, subjects were randomized
      to one of two treatments: either ramelteon 8 mg tablets taken orally once-daily with
      concomitant current zolpidem therapy or to placebo-matching tablets once daily with
      concomitant current zolpidem therapy. Subjects incrementally reduced zolpidem therapy by
      dose, frequency, or both for up to 10 weeks. Only those subjects who completed the
      double-blind treatment period and had achieved a 50% reduction in zolpidem therapy during the
      double-blind treatment period participated in the open-label treatment period in which 8 mg
      ramelteon was administered. Zolpidem consumed during the open-label treatment period was
      recorded.

    <description>Participants reduced zolpidem incrementally from Week 3 to Week 10 of the double-blind treatment period (DBTP). A participant who did not take any zolpidem during the last 7 days of the DBTP was defined as having completely discontinued zolpidem by that time point. The number of subjects who discontinued zolpidem at the end of the DBTP was summarized.</description>

        <description>Participants reduced zolpidem incrementally from Week 3 to Week 10 of the double-blind treatment period (DBTP). A participant who did not take any zolpidem during the last 7 days of the DBTP was defined as having completely discontinued zolpidem by that time point. The number of subjects who discontinued zolpidem at the end of the DBTP was summarized.</description>
