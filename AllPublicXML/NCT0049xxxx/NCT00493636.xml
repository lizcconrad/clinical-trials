    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to compare progression-free survival in patients treated with
      sorafenib and gemcitabine/capecitabine versus patients treated with placebo and
      gemcitabine/capecitabine for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed
      during or following treatment with a bevacizumab-containing regimen.

    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to date of first documented disease progression (i.e., the date on which a radiologic procedure or clinical evaluation was performed) or the date of death due to any cause, if before progression, assessed up to 39 months.</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>The overall tumor burden at baseline will be compared with subsequent measurements up to the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to any cause, if before progression, assessed up to 39 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate was defined as the proportion of participants experiencing complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as best overall response. Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of LD of target lesions to be PR nor increase of &gt;=20%; Progressive Disease (PD) is the increase in existing lesions or new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Period measured from the first documentation of complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death is objectively documented.</time_frame>

Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of LD of target lesions to be PR nor increase of &gt;=20%; Progressive Disease (PD) is the increase in existing lesions or new lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>The overall tumor burden at baseline will be compared with subsequent measurements up to the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to any cause, if before progression, assessed up to 39 months.</time_frame>
