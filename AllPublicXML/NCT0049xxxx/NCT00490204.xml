    <measure>Change in the total nasal symptom score (TNSS) during the total treatment period from the baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS is a sum of the nasal symptom score for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching. Each symptom is scored on a scale from 0 to 3; the range of sums for TNSS is 0 to 12. The symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3; a larger score indicates more severe symptoms. The Baseline value is defined as the average TNSS over the last 3 consecutive days prior to Day 1. For total treatment period, the average TNSS for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the total treatment period, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the score at Baseline minus the mean score for the total treatment period.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 or DC</time_frame>
    <description>Rhinoscopy was assessed by the investigator by scoring swelling of inferior conchal mucosa scored as 0 (none), 1 (possible to see center of the middle turbinate), 2 (between 1 and 3), or 3 (impossible to see middle turbinate); color of inferior conchal mucosa scored as 0 (normal), 1 (pink), 2 (red), or 3 (pale); aqueous secretion volume (vol) scored as 0 (none), 1 (small amount adhered), 2 (between 1 and 3), or 3 (filled).</description>
