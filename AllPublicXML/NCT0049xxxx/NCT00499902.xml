  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a safe and effective bolus dose of
      intra-arterial/intra-thrombus alfimeprase in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) 3 to 9 hours from
      symptom onset.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently approved drug therapy for AIS is limited by the need to treat within 3 hours of
      symptom onset. Alfimeprase acts to degrade fibrin directly and is inactivated locally by
      circulating alpha-2 macroglobulin. This study will determine whether treatment with
      alfimeprase facilitates rapid restoration of arterial blood flow with avoidance of
      symptomatic hemorrhagic conversion in subjects with AIS within 3 to 9 hours of symptom onset.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    CO Phase 2 data did not show sufficient improvement in cath opening at higher
    dose/concentration evaluated. Nuvelo ended further clinical dev of alfimeprase.
