        Over a period of 4.5 years, between 1/1/2000 and 30/6/2005, there were totally 58 new cases
        in our renal transplantation clinic. 36 of them were male, 22 of them were female (Male to
        female ratio is 1.64:1). All were single-organ recipients. Majority of them (57/58 or
        98.3%) were receiving their first renal transplantation, the only exception was a women
        receiving her second renal transplantation during the study period. Majority (57/48 or
        98.3%) of them were cadaveric renal transplantation (CRT). One living-related renal
        transplantation (LDRT) had been performed in Hong Kong during the study period. Majority of
        the renal transplantation were performed in Mainland China (48/58 or 82.8%), whilst the
        remaining 10 operations (17.2%) were performed in Hong Kong.
