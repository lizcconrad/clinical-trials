  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of the fully human EGFr
      antibody zalutumumab to primary curative radiotherapy increases locoregional control in
      Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy to Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck have been modified during the
      last decades by altered fractionation, the addition of concomitant chemotherapy or
      modification of hypoxia. By these modifications the locoregional control, disease-specific
      survival or overall survival have been increased but the price have been increased morbidity.

      The addition of antibodies against the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFR-I) may further
      increase the control and survival of patients with Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and
      Neck when combined with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.

      The aim of the present study is to determine whether

        1. The addition af the EGFr-I zalutumumab increases locoregional control in Squamous Cell
           Carcinomas of the Head and Neck

        2. Whether disease-specific survival or overall survival is improved by addition of
           zalutumumab

        3. Whether the addition of zalutumumab to primary curative radiotherapy or
           chemoradiotherapy is feasible and tolerable

        4. Acute and late toxicity to the treatment.
