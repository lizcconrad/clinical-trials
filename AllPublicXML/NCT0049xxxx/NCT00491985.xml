      This is an open, randomized, multicenter clinical trial.

      Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety profiles during the 21 days following each primary and booster
           injection.

        -  To describe the immune response 21 days after each primary and booster injection of each
           formulation.

        -  To describe the antibody persistence after the first vaccination
