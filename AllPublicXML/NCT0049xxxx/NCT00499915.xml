  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants have a significantly increased risk for developing respiratory illnesses
      and asthma. Secondhand smoke (SHS) also is clearly associated with increased breathing
      problems in children, thus exposure to smoke makes it substantially more likely for a
      premature infant to develop wheezing. The overall goal of this study is to test whether
      comprehensive asthma education combined with a home-based secondhand smoke reduction program
      can reduce exposure to smoke and prevent respiratory illness among premature infants. Our
      hypotheses are:

        -  More premature infants whose families receive asthma education combined with a SHS
           reduction intervention will live in smoke-free environments compared to infants
           receiving only asthma education (control group).

        -  Caregivers receiving the SHS reduction program will have higher rates of quit attempts
           and less relapse into smoking compared to caregivers in the control group.

        -  Infants whose families receive the combined intervention will experience less
           respiratory illness compared to infants in the control group.
