  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the pharmacokinetic profile of V1512 is similar
      or better than existing medications for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of V1512 effervescent tablet has been evaluated in healthy volunteers,
      however not fully in PD patients. This study aims to evaluate the PK profiles in PD patients
      of different dosing schedules of V1512 effervescent tablet compared to the profiles after
      standard L-dopa/carbidopa (Sinemet) over the course of the day. Two dosing schedules have
      been chosen to evaluate a possible relation between dosing interval and 'ON' time, with and
      without associated dyskinesia. Similar dosing schedules with the comparator Sinemet are
      commonly employed in the treatment of fluctuating PD patients. Patients assigned to cohort 3
      will also take a dose of entacapone concomitantly with each dose of V1512 or Sinemet, thereby
      allowing the kinetics and dynamics of.V1512 and Sinemet to be compared in the presence of
      COMT inhibition.

      Safety and tolerability of the dosing regimens in patients will also be assessed further in
      this double-blind study
