    <textblock>
      This study will hope to show that the treatment of the patient's perennial allergic rhinitis
      (PAR) using Nasonex® (mometasone furoate nasal spray) will result in improvement of the nasal
      symptoms of PAR and of nighttime sleep-disordered breathing, thereby resulting in improved
      sleep quality, less daytime sleepiness, improved daytime functioning, and improved quality of
      life.

          1. Must be 18 to 45 years of age, of either sex, and any race.

          2. Must have at least a 2-year history of PAR.

          3. Must be skin test positive for the usual allergens associated with PAR within the
             previous 12 months with regular exposure to at least one of the allergens to which the
             subject is allergic.

          4. Must be sufficiently symptomatic at the Screening Visit (Visit 1), Qualification Visit
             (Visit 2), and Baseline Visit (Visit 4) with a minimal level of PRIOR (reflective)
             total symptom score, total nasal symptoms score, and total non-nasal symptoms score in
             order to qualify.

          5. At the Qualification Visit 2, subjects must have a score of at least 2 with the
             Interference with Sleep severity rating score for at least 3 of the 7 nights prior to
             the Qualification visit.

          6. At the Baseline Visit 4 subjects must have a score of at least 2 with the Interference
             with Sleep severity rating score for at least 1 of the 3 nights prior to the Baseline
             Visit.

          7. Must have an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of &gt;=5, but not more than 30, during the first
             screening polysomnographic evaluation and to proceed to the second polysomnographic
             evaluation.

          8. At the Baseline Visit (Visit 4), the subjects must complete the NRQLQ, PQSI, ESS,
             WPAI-AS.

          9. Must complete the PVT within 1 hour of bedtime and 1 hour of arising on the nights
             when the PSGs are done.

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential (including women who are less than 1 year

             stopping the medication. Women who are postmenopausal for &gt;1 year (ie, women who have
             experienced 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea) will be exempted from the use of
