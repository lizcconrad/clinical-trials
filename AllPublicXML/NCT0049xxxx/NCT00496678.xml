  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The University of Rochester, Department of Family Medicine, funded by the National Cancer
      Institute will train community health workers to guide patients through the cancer care
      system. The project will help to teach patients how to communicate more effectively with
      their health care team in order to understand the treatment options available to them.
      Although not widely available, it is believed patient navigation programs are beneficial.

      This research study will evaluate how well this tool works, especially among those who
      experience disparities in health care. The goal is to determine if having a trained navigator
      shortens the time between an abnormal test result and a definitive diagnosis and between a
      definitive diagnosis and completion of treatment for breast and colorectal cancer patients.
      The project also will evaluate whether navigation improves the ability to communicate with
      the doctor, patient satisfaction with care and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Racial and ethnic minority groups and low-income persons experience significantly higher
      cancer mortality rates than other Americans. These disparities are due to at least two
      factors: (1) delays in follow-up of abnormal cancer screening results and (2) suboptimal
      management of diagnosed cancer. Patient navigation represents a promising means for
      addressing disparities by improving cancer related management for minority and other
      underserved populations. However, patient navigation for cancer has yet to be evaluated
      through a well-designed randomized controlled trial. Furthermore, patient navigation is
      likely to prove most effective and sustainable when it is integrated into primary care and
      helps patients be more active in their care. This combination of patient empowerment and
      enablement is referred to as &quot;activation.&quot; The aim of this project is to evaluate the
      effectiveness and costs of such a program in a rigorous manner so that the results can be
      generalized and the program can be widely disseminated and implemented. we will develop,
      implement, and evaluate a primary care-based, patient navigation-activation program using
      specially-trained community health workers (CHWs). We propose to investigate the effect of
      this intervention on timing and quality of cancer-related care. Secondary aims examine the
      impact of navigation on disparities in care, improvement in patient activation and total
      costs. Project findings will inform national policy regarding patient navigation for cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Receive care at a participating practice

          2. Have received a positive breast or colorectal cancer screening test requiring
             follow-up on a different day

          3. Have been newly diagnosed with breast or colorectal cancer

          4. Have received notification by the provider of an abnormal breast or colorectal
             screening result

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cognitively impaired

          2. Institutionalized (nursing home, incarcerated)

          3. Children &lt;18

          4. Actively involved in cancer treatment at time of presentation

          5. Currently or previously navigated with (a) navigation documented in the medical record
             or (b) patient can articulate that they are in a navigation program or case management
             program for cancer

          6. History of prior invasive cancer, lymphoma, or leukemia except non-melanoma (basal or
             squamous of the skin) cancer or CIN (Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).

          7. Prior cancer that has been treatedâ€”The rationale for excluding patients with any prior
             cancers that have been treated is that patient familiarity with the treatment process
             in general would make care easier even without a navigator.

          8. Women who are pregnant at time of enrollment.
