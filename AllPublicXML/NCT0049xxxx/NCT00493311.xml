  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A research study to determine if acetaminophen (APAP) given intravenously (IV-a liquid given
      through a needle into a vein in your arm) is safe and effective in controlling fever when
      compared to placebo. Acetaminophen given this way is the investigational part of this study.

             of admission to Clinic until Study Completion

        Inclusion Criteria (Pre-Randomization) To be eligible for entry into the Study, Subjects
        must meet each of the following criteria prior to Randomization:

          -  Be free of evidence of infection based upon clinical assessment and blood (Complete
             Blood Count-CBC) and urine testing

          -  Have an average baseline oral temperature that is equal to or below 37 ºC (98.6 ºF)
             and does not vary more than 0.4 ºC (0.7 ºF) from lowest to highest on three
             assessments performed during a 30 minute period

          -  Not develop a medically significant allergic or exaggerated systemic response to
             administration of a test dose of reference standard endotoxin

          -  Develop a core temperature of at least 38.6 ºC (101.5 ºF) after intravenous reference
             standard endotoxin dosed per Study guidelines and have a fever response to endotoxin

             the Investigator's judgment could compromise the Subject's welfare, ability to
             communicate with the Study staff, complete Study activities, or would otherwise
             contraindicate Study participation.

          -  Has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to receiving endotoxin that in the
             Investigator's clinical judgment merits discontinuation from further Study
             participation

          -  Has known hypersensitivity to acetaminophen, the inactive ingredients (excipients) of
             the Intravenous(IV) acetaminophen formulation or the Rescue Medications (ibuprofen,
             aspirin and ketorolac)

          -  Has known or suspected recent history of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence as
             defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)
             criteria

          -  Has a history of nasal polyps, angioedema, significant or actively treated
             bronchospastic disease, or any other significant medical condition that
             contraindicates participation in the Study or receiving endotoxin, Study Medication,
             or Rescue Medication

          -  Has an active infection or other disease or condition that may cause abnormal
             alterations in body temperature, or has worked the night shift on a regular basis for
             the last 3 months prior to Screening

          -  Has impaired liver function, e.g. Alanine aminotransferases (ALT) greater than or
             equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal, bilirubin greater than 3.0, active hepatic
             disease, or evidence of clinically significant liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis or
             hepatitis)

          -  Has participated in another clinical Study (investigational or marketed product)
             within 30 days of Screening
