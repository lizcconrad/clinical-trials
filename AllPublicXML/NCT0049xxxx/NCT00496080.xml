    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Doppler guided
      uterine artery occlusion (D-UAO) for the reduction of fibroid associated bleeding.

      The GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE D-UAO Instruments are single-use disposable instruments consisting of
      a GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE Uterine Stabilizer, a GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDEM Introducer Sheath, a
      GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE Doppler Clamp, and a GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE Coupler.

    <time_frame>Study completion</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants without any subsequent surgical procedure intended to manage fibroid symptoms performed. Potential procedures included surgical hysterectomy or dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) for treatment of menorrhagia; uterine artery embolization (UAE) or laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion; endometrial resection or ablation; myomectomy or myolysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBLAC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with a 50% or greater reduction in PBLAC score from baseline at 12 mo and a PBLAC score of less than 250. PBLAC is a simple validated semiquantitative method of measuring total menstrual blood loss using a pictorial representation of blood loss, where higher scores indicate more blood loss. This hybrid endpoint combined the reduction in PBLAC score with the total PBLAC score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Improvement in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants categorized as &quot;better&quot; in the total UFS-QOL questionnaire, indicating an overall improvement in health-related quality of life. On this scale, higher scores are indicative of better quality of life, with a maximum(best)score of 100 and a minimum (worst)score of 0. &quot;Better&quot; was defined as a change of +12 or more from baseline at 12 mo.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in Fibroid Bulk</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with a minimum 15% decrease in fibroid bulk based on independent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) review from baseline at 12 mo.
Note: As per protocol, MRIs were planned only for subjects 1 - 40, 81 - 120, and 161-200.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Improvement in Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality of Life (UFS-QOL) Symptom Severity Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants categorized as &quot;better&quot; in the UFS-QOL sympton severity questionnaire, indicating an overall improvement in fibroid related symptoms. On this scale, higher scores are indicative of increasing symptom distress, with a maximum(worst)score of 100 and a minimum (best)score of 0. &quot;Better&quot; was defined as a change of -11 or less from baseline at 12 mo.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Study was terminated early because 6 mo interim analysis of parallel European study showed that device was not meeting the primary endpoint. Target enrollment was 200 subjects, but results are based on 87 subjects who were treated with the device.</limitations_and_caveats>
