  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD1152
      when given as a continuous 2-hour infusion every week and every 2 weeks in patients with
      advanced solid malignancies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Efficacy seen in the solid tumour patient population was not sufficient to continue research
    with AZD1152 monotherapy in solid tumors at that time.
