      (1) to compare the differences of neural activation of pathological worry between
      pre-treatment GAD patients and normal subjects; (2) to measure the differences of brain
      activation on worry in GAD patients before and after duloxetine treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit 20 GAD patients and 20 healthy controls. Both patients and controls
      receive a medical and psychiatric screening procedure at visit 1 and are asked to complete
      three self-rating questionnaires and one health questionnaire at visit 1. All qualified
      participants will receive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline.

      The patients will begin treatment with duloxetine 30 mg/day at visit 2 and will be titrated
      to 60 mg/day at visit 3 (2 week since drug dispensed). The dosage will be maintained on 60
      mg/day for 6 more weeks. During the period, the patients will receive periodic evaluations at
      visit 2 (0 week drug dispensed), 3 (2 week since drug dispensed), 4 (4 weeks since drug
      dispensed), and 5 (8 weeks since drug dispensed). The patients will receive fMRI examination
      at baseline and at the end of the 8-week treatment.
