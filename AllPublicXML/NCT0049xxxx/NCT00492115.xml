  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB), also called sleep apnea, experience nighttime
      disrupted sleep and, because they stop breathing for short periods during the night, do not
      get sufficient oxygen to their brains. This can frequently result in daytime impairments
      including difficulties with memory. The state-of-the-art treatment for SDB is Continuous
      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Many non-demented SDB patients who are successfully treated
      with CPAP show improvement in memory and other cognitive functions. Data have shown that
      patients with Parkinson's disease have a high rate of SDB. Patients with Parkinson's disease
      also often have problems with memory. This study will test the effects of treating SDB among
      patients with Parkinson's disease and SDB. Specifically, the study will test the effect of
      CPAP treatment on SDB and sleep; the effect of CPAP treatment on daytime sleepiness,
      cognition, overall quality of life and mood; the effect of CPAP treatment on the frequency of
      symptoms of REM behavior disorder and restless legs syndrome; the effect of continued CPAP
      use (beyond the six weeks of the study) on SDB, sleep, cognition, mood and quality of life;
      whether the study-partner feels that CPAP improves the patient's sleep, mood and overall
      functioning; whether study-partners feel that their own sleep, mood and overall functioning
      improve as the patient's sleep improves both during the 6-week protocol and at follow-up for
      those opting to continue using CPAP.

      This study will examine the effect of three weeks vs. six weeks of CPAP treatment on
      cognitive functioning and sleep in patients with Parkinson's disease and sleep apnea. It is
      designed as a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of CPAP. As a comparison
      group, half the patients will first be randomly assigned to three weeks of shamCPAP, followed
      by three weeks of therapeutic CPAP treatment. Sleep, functional outcome and mood
      questionnaires and a repeatable neuropsychological test battery, chosen to be sensitive to
      the type of changes we expect to find in memory and cognitive function, will be administered
      before the start of treatment, after three weeks, and after six weeks of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of dementia due to Parkinson's disease (according to the fourth
             edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (code 294.1)

          -  MMSE score between 18 and 26, inclusive; cognitive symptoms must occur at least one
             year after the diagnosis of PDD

          -  Apnea hypopnea index &gt;10 (i.e., 10 apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep)

          -  Over the age of 50 years

          -  Stable health

          -  Fluent English speaking

             inhibitors, psychotropic medications, memory enhancers, health food supplements, etc.
             as long as they have been stable on the same dose for at least two months prior to

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current treatment for sleep apnea (to avoid discontinuing already established
             treatment for sleep apnea and any carry over confounding effect of treatment on
             cognition).

          -  Use of medications known to influence sleep (i.e. sedative hypnotics, narcotics) if
             the dose cannot remain stable for the duration of the study.

             regular use of bronchodilators, steroids, history of carbon dioxide retention, waking
             hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg or SpO2 &lt;92 % by pulse oximetry), or use of supplemental
             oxygen.

          -  Symptomatic coronary or cerebral vascular disease (history of myocardial infarction,
             angina, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks), history of life-threatening
             arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or current alcohol or drug abuse

             evaluation or treatment with CPAP.
