  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mantle Cell Lymphoma is a sub-type of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma which is generally considered
      incurable with current therapy. Our goal is to accrue 59 patients who receive an autologous
      vaccine against their individual lymphoma after undergoing stem cell transplantation. Our
      hope is that vaccination will prolong the time which patients will stay in remission from
      their disease.

    <description>Patients will initially receive three 'priming' CpG-MCL vaccinations in 21 days at 4-7 day intervals, followed by collection of &quot;primed&quot; T-Cells. Subsequently, within 72 hours of autologous hematopoetic cell transplant (AHCT)(standard of care procedure), the patient will receive his/her CpG-MCL vaccine and reinfusion of primed T cells (&quot;immunotransplant&quot;). At &gt;/= 3 months after AHCT, when medically feasible, the patient will receive the final CpG-MCL vaccine. Regular follow-up research analysis of molecular residual disease will continue for 3 years or until disease progression.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (at time of enrollment):

          -  Patients must be newly diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma, have an accessible disease
             site for excisional biopsy or have sufficient peripheral blood tumor to leukapherese
             at least 1.5 x 109 lymphoma cells in a single session.

          -  By standard clinical criteria, be medically appropriate to receive rituximab and
             standard induction chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy with AHCT.

          -  Patients must be HIV negative.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2 or Karnofsky performance scale 50-100%.

          -  Patients must be capable of signing an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently taking immunosuppressive medications.

          -  Patients with severe psychological or medical illness.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  At the discretion of the principal investigator if he/she feels that the patient is
             unable to safely complete the study. Specifically, patients must be considered
             medically eligible to undergo standard high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
             transplantation.
