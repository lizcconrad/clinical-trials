  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We previously hypothesized that the excess of Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) at the level of
      ovarian selectable follicles could be involved in the follicular arrest of Polycystic Ovary
      Syndrome (PCOS), mainly through inhibition of FSH effect on aromatase expression.In this
      study, we plan to investigate whether a drop in the serum AMH level would be concomitant to
      the appearance of a dominant follicle induced by administration of mild amounts of exogenous
      FSH in women with PCOS.

    <textblock>
      Women with PCOS (Rotterdam definition) whom anovulation is resistant to clomiphene citrate
      will receive recombinant FSH using the low-dose step-up protocol during only one cycle. Serum
      levels of estradiol, AMH, LH, FSH, inhibin B and ultrasound (U/S) parameters will be assessed
      twice a week until 3 days after appearance of &gt; 1 dominant follicle(s).The starting dose of
      recFSH will be 50 IU/day. In the absence of criteria for dominance (see below) after 14 days
      at 50 IU/day, recFSH dose will be increased by 25 IU/day every 7 days until dominance is
      achieved. Dominance will be defined by the appearance of at least one follicle &gt;10 mm growing
      at least 2 mm/day and serum E2&gt; 100 pg/L. Ultrsound examination will performed with a 7-MHz
      transvaginal transducer (Sonoline Elegra, Siemens), in real time, according to a standardized
      protocol.Serum AMH levels will be assessed using the second-generation enzyme immunoassay
      AMH-EIA.
