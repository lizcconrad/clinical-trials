      The primary objective of the first phase is to determine the safety, the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of TNFerade in combination with the previously studied
      combination of Fluorouracil (5FU), Hydroxyurea (HU) and standard daily radiotherapy in
      patients with recurrent head and neck cancer (RHNC). All chemoradiotherapy is administered on
      a &quot;week-on/week-off&quot; schedule. The primary objective of the second phase II is to determine
      the locoregional control rate at 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Head and neck cancer

          -  Patients must have a locoregional tumor amenable to reirradiation with curative
             intent.

          -  disease, or the majority of disease, should be accessible to injection via direct
             intratumoral injection

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  History of malignancy (other than head and neck cancer) in the last 2 years except
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or bladder, non-melanomatous skin cancer, or localized
             early stage prostate cancer, with patients continually disease free, or cancers that
             are not felt to influence treatment for head and neck cancer and life expectancy of
             patient

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents currently or within the
             4 weeks prior to study Day 1

          -  Chronic treatment for greater than 6 months with steroids

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

             thrombophilia, or evidence of DVT / thromboembolic event upon enrollment

          -  Patients receiving hormone replacement therapy or hormonal contraceptives within two
             weeks of day 1

          -  Patients who have undergone surgery within the last 1 month prior to day 1
