  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pilonidal disease is a common problem with no ideal treatment. This is a prospective
      study that will evaluate the results of surgical pore excision, curettage, and injection of a
      regenerative tissue matrix, Cymetra, on patients with chronic pilonidal disease.

  <detailed_description>

      In addition, the study will evaluate the credibility and reproducibility of results within
      other surgeons trained to perform the procedure. Data collection will focus on post-operative
      wound failure, infection ratwes, analgesic requirements, time lost from work or school, wound
      care requirements, and 6 month recurrence rates. These outcomes will be compared to outcomes
      using conventional pilonidal surgical intervention using published data.
