      Our aim in this study is to investigate the potential role of serum ProCT as an early
      diagnostic marker and later prognostic indicator for VAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a bacterial infection that develops after 48 hours or
      more of intubation, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Rapid identification of
      VAP is required to improve survival and to reduce avoidable treatment-associated side
      effects. Procalcitonin (ProCT), a blood test, is a reasonably specific marker of bacterial
      infection and its level increases early in sepsis. In this study, a ProCT serum level will be
      measured in 50 patients with clinically suspected VAP. We aim to show that the ProCT level
      will be high early in VAP and will stay high in patients with poor prognosis. This will help
      to address the potential role of ProCT as part of early diagnosis and management of VAP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In the preceding 24 h, the appearance of a new opacity or opacities on chest X-ray when
        compared to previous, and two of the following:

          1. white blood cell count &gt; 12 or &lt; 5 x 10^9 cells/L,

          2. temperature &gt; 38°C or &lt; 35°C, or

          3. purulent secretions.endotracheal samples must be collected by
             bronchoscope/bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative culture or endotracheal
             aspiration with quantitative culture (when available) or qualitative culture from each
             patient to be enrolled in the study. This is a routine procedure done in every case of
             suspected VAP and is considered to be the standard of care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known underlying chronic inflammatory condition of the lung (e.g., sarcoidosis,
             vasculitis)

          2. Thyroid cancer patients

          3. neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.5 x 10^9 cells/L

          4. Concomitant AIDS

          5. Solid organ transplantation with severe immunosuppression

          6. New Antibiotic use for more than 18 hrs before blood sample collection

          7. Severe pancreatitis

          8. Attending physician does not agree with enrollment into the study.
