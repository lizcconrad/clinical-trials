    <textblock>
      The purpise of this study was to determine the effect of low-dose (4 Gy) total skin electron
      beam therapy as a second-line treatment of stage IB-II mycosis fungoides.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment modalities are usually not curative and having treatment options suitable
      for the long-term control therefore essential. Electron beam therapy is generally applied to
      the skin in total doses of 30-36 Gy over a 8-10 week period.Due to the potential risk of
      toxicity including bone marrow supression, no more than 2-3 courses in a life time are
      generally recommended. In the current study we explored the possibility of using lower
      radiation doses for total skin electron beam therapy for long-term disease control.
