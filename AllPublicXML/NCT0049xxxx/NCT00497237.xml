  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a serious global health problem. People of all ages in countries throughout the
      world are affected by this chronic airway disorder that can be severe and sometimes fatal.
      The prevalence of asthma is increasing everywhere, especially among children.According to
      international guidelines, once control of asthma is achieved and maintained for at least 3
      months, a gradual reduction of the maintenance therapy should be tried in order to identify
      the minimum therapy required to maintain control. This will help reduce the risk of side
      effects and enhance patient adherence to the treatment plan.

      Reduction of therapy in patients on combination therapy should begin with a reduction in the
      dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid.1 The present study is designed to evaluate if patients
      with controlled asthma treated with FP 1000 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily can be stepped
      down. Stepping-down will be attempted with two medications: a new combination of extrafine
      beclomethasone dipropionate 400 mcg + formoterol 24 mcg daily (test medication, Foster™) and,
      alternatively, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily(reference
      medication) without losing asthma control.If this hypothesis will be confirmed, the present
      study will demonstrate that asthma control can be maintained with less than half the dose of
      inhaled corticosteroid and with less medical costs.

      Given the aims of this study, the population to be monitored includes adult patients with
      moderate persistent asthma, which can be defined controlled according to the current
      guidelines under standard stabilised treatment. The intended treatment duration is therefore
      designed to ensure that good control of asthma is firmly achieved before stepping down the
      treatment (8 weeks run-in period), but also that the condition of the patients are followed
      long enough (24 weeks comparative treatment period) to ensure that a new stable condition is
      also obtained and properly monitored.
