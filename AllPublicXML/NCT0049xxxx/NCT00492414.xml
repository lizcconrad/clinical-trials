      Panic disorder(PD)is a disabling psychiatric condition associated with significant impairment
      in psychosocial, occupational functioning and quality of life, as mentioned by mogotsi et al.
      So, most patients with panic disorder suffers from the consequences of the impairment in
      occupational function. This impairment is not only individual problem, but also social one.
      Since productivity is very important item required to employees, lost productive time among
      workers with psychiatric illness should be reduced by the proper management. But few data
      were reported in this field by now.
