    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and risk factors for falls in older adults are significant public health issues.
      In order to evaluate an appropriate role for chiropractic in managing these problems in the
      population, this pilot cohort study will take multiple measurements, both self-reported and
      functional, on a sample of older adults with chronic spine-related pain who are recruited
      from the local community and receive chiropractic care in the Cleveland Chiropractic College
      health center over a four-week period.
