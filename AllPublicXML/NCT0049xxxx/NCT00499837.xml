  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder in which mucus-secreting glands in the lungs
      produce considerable quantity of thick, sticky secretions that clog the airways, promote
      bacterial growth and lead to chronic obstruction, inflammation and destruction of the
      airways.

      The purpose of this study is to collect data about the resolution of the chronic inflammatory
      state in addition to assure the safety of the therapy in CF patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In CF patients the unregulated inflammatory response overwhelms the normal protease
      (elastase)/antiprotease (AAT) balance, leading to the accumulation of elastase in the lung,
      destruction of the lung architecture, severe pulmonary dysfunction, and ultimately death.

      Administration of AAT is to address the elastase/antiprotease imbalance in order to prevent
      destruction of the lung tissue and reduce the inflammatory dysregulation that causes
      pulmonary dysfunction.
