  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the validity of the prediction model in reducing the
      rate of CPAP titration failure and in achieving a shorter time to optimal pressure

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to derive the most effective pressure, CPAP titration is performed in the sleep
      laboratory during which the pressure is gradually increased until apneas and hypopneas are
      abolished in all sleep stages and in all body positions. The technique is however time
      consuming and labor intensive. Furthermore, the duration of the study may not be sufficient
      to attain this goal because of patient's poor ability to sleep in this environment or due to
      difficulty in attaining an appropriate pressure. A predictive algorithm based on demographic,
      anthropometric, and polysomnographic data was developed to facilitate the selection of a
      starting pressure during the overnight titration study. Yet, the performance of this model
      was inconsistent when validated by other centers. One of the potential reasons for the lack
      of reproducibility is the complex relation of behavioral processes with nonlinear attributes.
      In areas of complex interactions, the artificial neural network (ANN) has been found to be a
      more appropriate alternative to linear, parametric statistical tools due to its inherent
      property of seeking information embedded in relations among variables thought to be
      independent.
