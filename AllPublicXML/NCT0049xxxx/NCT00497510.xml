    <textblock>
      Fall prevention in older adults is a significant public health issue that all health care
      providers must address. At this time, chiropractors, the most commonly used complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners, have not been systematically involved in either
      interventions for or research related to fall prevention and risk factor reduction. However,
      it is possible that body-based CAM practitioners such as chiropractors might make important
      contributions to decreasing fall risk through affecting musculoskeletal function and managing
      chronic pain, factors which may affect balance, an important risk factor for falls.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 65 or older

          2. Able to stand steadily without assistance on one leg for no more than 5 seconds
             (determined by averaging the time for both legs)

          3. Able to attend all scheduled sessions (by self-report.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-ambulatory (that is, wheelchair bound); this precludes required balance testing;
             however, potential patients requiring assistive devices such as canes and walkers are
             not excluded.

          2. received chiropractic care, physical therapy or any other manual care procedure within
             the past three months (by self report)

          3. began an exercise program targeting balance and/or lower body strength within past
             month (by self report)

          4. contraindications to CMT or mild-exertion exercise, as determined by the clinician
             through physical exam and x-rays (if indicated). Contraindications included but are
             not limited to: unstable or severe medical condition; severe osteoporosis, fracture or
             other osseous abnormalities; &quot;high cardiovascular risk&quot;, ie.e. persons with known
             cardiovascular, pulmonary or metabolic disease, or one or more major signs/symptoms
             suggestive of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease

          5. absence of indications for CMT, as determined by the clinician through history,
             physical exam, orthopedic tests, and static and motion palpation. Indications for CMT
             include identification of decreased or increased joint mobility usually accompanied by
             tenderness and muscle tension and spasm.

          6. unable to understand English or Spanish adequately to complete study forms and
             questionnaires, since for this study we do not have study personnel fluent in other
             languages.
