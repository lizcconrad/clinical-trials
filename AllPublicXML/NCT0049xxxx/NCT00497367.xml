      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of use in humans of the
      TAXUS Petal Paclitaxel-Eluting Bifurcation Coronary Stent System in the treatment of de novo
      lesions in native coronary arteries involving a major side branch. The TAXUS® Petal™ is an
      investigational device with an indication of improving coronary artery luminal diameter while
      maintaining side branch access in subjects with symptomatic ischemic disease due to discrete
      atherosclerotic bifurcation lesions

      To assess the safety and feasibility of use in humans of the TAXUS Petal Paclitaxel-Eluting
      Bifurcation Coronary Stent System (TAXUS® Petal™) for the treatment of de novo
      atherosclerotic bifurcation lesions (by visual estimate):

        -  Phase 1:

             -  Main branch: 3.0 to 3.5 mm RVD and lesion length ≤20 mm

             -  Side branch: 2.5 to 3.5 mm RVD and lesion length ≤14 mm

        -  Phase 2:

             -  Main branch: 3.0 to 3.5 mm RVD and lesion length ≤28 mm

             -  Side branch: 2.25 to 3.5 mm RVD and lesion length ≤14 mm

      Bifurcation main branch (MB) lesion length will be measured from the proximal shoulder of the
      most proximal lesion to the distal shoulder of the most distal lesion. Bifurcation side
      branch (SB) lesion length will be measured from the proximal shoulder of the side branch (if
      the ostium is disease-free) or the side branch ostium (if the disease continues into the main
      branch) to the distal side branch shoulder of the most distal lesion. At follow-up, the
      entire stented region will be used to determine MLD and %DS.
