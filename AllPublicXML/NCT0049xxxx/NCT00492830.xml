    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient will be eligible for study participation only if all of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. The patient has given informed consent.

          2. The patient is willing and able to abide by the protocol.

          3. The patient is at least 18 years old.

          4. The patient has advanced cancer and is not eligible for treatment or no effective
             treatment exists.

          5. Significant toxicities resulting from prior therapy must have recovered.

          6. If the patient is a female of childbearing potential, she is using an
             acceptable/effective method of contraception.

          7. If the patient is a female, she has had a negative serum pregnancy test within the
             past 30 days.

          8. The patient has adequate ability to perform activities of daily living.

          9. The patient has adequate organ function as assessed by laboratory tests

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will not be eligible for study participation if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. The patient weighs more than 264 lbs.

          2. The patient has had a major surgical procedure, or significant injury within the past
             28 days or there is an anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of
             the study.

          3. The patient has received treatment for their cancer, including radiation (minimal
             amount of localized radiation may be allowed), within the past 28 days.

          4. The patient has known brain tumors.

          5. The patient experienced blood clots within six months prior to study start.

          6. The patient has a non-healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture.

          7. The patient received recent thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapy.

          8. The patient has an unstable medical condition or significant comorbid pathophysiology
             (e.g. active infection, poorly controlled diabetes, unstable angina, severe heart
             failure) that would interfere with his/her participation in the study.

          9. The patient enrolled, or plans to enroll, in a concurrent treatment protocol with
             another investigational product.

         10. The patient is receiving, or plans to receive, an anti-cancer therapy during the study
             with the exception of patients receiving chronic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
             (LHRH) agonists.
