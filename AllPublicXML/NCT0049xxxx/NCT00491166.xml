  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-sponsored trial (IST), an open-label pilot study, assessing the
      safety and biologic activity of bromfenac in subjects with diffuse DME refractory to laser.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten subjects will be enrolled in this study, which will be conducted at Ophthalmic
      Consultants of Boston, Boston, MA. All subjects must be diagnosed with diffuse DME that is
      either refractory to laser photocoagulation or in patients who have refused laser.

      Consented subjects will be screened to determine eligibility. Eligibility will be determined
      by the Investigator, a retinal specialist. Only one eye will be chosen as the “study eye.”
      Only the study eye will receive bromfenac drops during the study.

      Eligible subjects will self-administer bromfenac two times per day (BID) for three months
      (treatment period). Subjects will have monthly examinations during the treatment period,
      followed by follow up visits at Month 4 and Month 6.
