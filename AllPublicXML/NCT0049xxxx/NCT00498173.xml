      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in treating children with attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms associated with autistic disorder, Asperger's
      syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a developmental disorder that can cause severe and pervasive impairment in
      thinking, feeling, language, and the ability to relate to others. It is usually first
      diagnosed in early childhood. Children with autism demonstrate repetitive behaviors or
      interests and deficits in social interaction, verbal communication, and nonverbal
      communication. In addition, they often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as
      certain sounds or the way objects look. Some symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, are also associated
      with autism. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to
      treat ADHD. It works differently, however, than stimulant drugs and may help to reduce ADHD
      symptoms in children with autism. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine
      in treating children with ADHD symptoms associated with autism.

      Potential participants will first attend a screening visit, which will include a psychiatric
      diagnostic interview, a practice session for swallowing pill capsules, a physical exam, an
      electrocardiogram (ECG), a blood test, and an assessment of pubertal stage. Females of
      childbearing age will also undergo a urine pregnancy test. In an initial double-blind study
      phase, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or
      placebo for 8 weeks. A baseline visit will include several rating scales, observations, and
      an interview to assess adaptive functioning. These measures and procedures will be used to
      keep track of symptoms, side effects, and behavior that could change during the study.
      Children who are assigned to placebo and do not notice an improvement in their ADHD symptoms
      will be given the opportunity to receive atomoxetine at the end of 8 weeks. Study visits will
      occur once a week for 4 weeks, and then every other week for the remainder of the 8 weeks.
      During these visits, many of the baseline questionnaires and interviews will be repeated. At
      the Week 8 visit, the physical exam, ECG, blood tests, and some baseline questionnaires will
      also be repeated. All children who respond well to atomoxetine may continue taking the drug
      for an additional 10 months. During this time, participants will report to the clinic once a
      month for the first 4 months, then once at the end of 7 months, and finally once at the end
      of 10 months. The same measures and procedures that were done during the 8-week phase will be
      done during the 10-month phase of this study.

    <measure>ADHD Rating Scale (ADHDRS)-Home Version Total Score (Randomized Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) is an 18-item scale directly derived from DSM-IV criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with established reliability, validity and sensitivity to change. The ADHD-RS-IV is investigator-administered biweekly during the 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. The scale consists of 2 subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items). If 3 or more items are skipped, the clinician should use extreme caution in interpreting the scale. Results from this rating scale alone should not be used to make a diagnosis. The total score can range form 0 to 54, with a higher score indicating greater severity. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) (Randomized Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a 58-item questionnaire with 5 subscales derived by factor analysis: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, and Inappropriate. It has been extensively used in psychopharmacological studies of autism and assesses many symptoms that are either central to autism (Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, and Inappropriate Speech) or frequently a target of treatment (Irritability). Each item of the 58-item scale is scored on a 4-point scale (0=never a problem to 3=severe problem). The interpretation of the tool and its sub-scales is that a greater number of items, indicates greater severity. The range of scores per subscale are: Social Withdrawal/Lethargy 0-48; Stereotypy 0-21; Irritability 0-45; Hyperactivity 0-48; Inappropriate Speech 0-12. Parent ratings occur every 2 weeks during the study. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

    <measure>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Randomized Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is completed by the parent in order to assess whether additional improvements in social functioning occur with atomoxetine, as observed in our pilot study. This 65-item questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. The SRS is a standardized measure of the core symptoms of autism. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale. The score of each item is summed to create a total score. Total score results as follows: 0-62: within normal limits; 63-79 mild range of impairment; 80-108: moderate range of impairment; 109-149: severe range of impairment. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) Composite Score (Randomized Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS) is used to assess adaptive functioning in four domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. This is a well-standardized open-ended interview used to assess the overall functioning of children and adults. This measure is especially important for subjects with PDDs given that their intellectual level is not always comparable to their adaptive functioning. The Vineland Maladaptive Behavior subscales will be included with these measures as these have been shown to be responsive to drug effects in other clinical trials in this population. The VABS will be done at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. The composite score represents a standard score (mean = 100 and standard deviation of 15; range = 20-160) on which higher scores indicate a higher level of adaptive functioning. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Randomized Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is assessed with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0). This instrument is well-validated and widely used for measuring health-related quality of life in children and adolescents. It also appears to be a valid instrument for use with children with psychiatric disorders. The Generic Core scales include 23 items. The health related and family functioning scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The Family Impact module will be included to assess any change in family functioning. This will be completed at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, 5-Item Total (Randomized Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Since the ABC does not have items which directly assess anxiety, the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is administered at week 8 during the study as an exploratory measure. The PARS is a clinician-rated instrument that assesses anxiety symptoms that are commonly associated with social anxiety, separation anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders. Scaled score ranges form 0-25 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

    <measure>Odds of Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale, Very Much or Much Improved (1 or 2) (Randomized Phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions Global Improvement (CGI-I) is designed to take into account all factors to arrive at an assessment of response to treatment. The CGI-I scale ranges from 1 to 7 (1=very much improved; 2= much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse), with lower scores indicating improvement (1=very much improved and 2=much improved). Participants with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 were classified as improved. Odds of improvement at 8 weeks were estimated using a repeated measures logistic regression model adjusting for baseline severity, study stratum, and site. The CGI-I was administered biweekly during the study. The CGI was focused on the target symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.</description>

          <title>Tanner Stage 3 or Greater</title>
          <description>Tanner stage (1-5) was used to characterize physical development in children, adolescents, and to stratify randomization.The stage was based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitalia, and development of pubic hair. Tanner stage increases as the child develops. Randomization lists for each of the four strata defined by pubertal status (prepubertal [Tanner Stage I or 2] vs. postpubertal [Tanner Stage 3-5]) and gender (male vs. female) were utilized.</description>

          <title>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite Score</title>
          <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition is a measure of adaptive behavior in children, adolescents and adults. The composite score has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (range = 20 to 160). Higher scores suggest a higher level of adaptive functioning. A rise in standard scores from Baseline to the Final Visit indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>ADHD Rating Scale (ADHDRS)-Home Version Total Score (Randomized Phase)</title>
        <description>The ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) is an 18-item scale directly derived from DSM-IV criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with established reliability, validity and sensitivity to change. The ADHD-RS-IV is investigator-administered biweekly during the 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. The scale consists of 2 subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items). If 3 or more items are skipped, the clinician should use extreme caution in interpreting the scale. Results from this rating scale alone should not be used to make a diagnosis. The total score can range form 0 to 54, with a higher score indicating greater severity. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

        <title>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) (Randomized Phase)</title>
        <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a 58-item questionnaire with 5 subscales derived by factor analysis: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, and Inappropriate. It has been extensively used in psychopharmacological studies of autism and assesses many symptoms that are either central to autism (Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, and Inappropriate Speech) or frequently a target of treatment (Irritability). Each item of the 58-item scale is scored on a 4-point scale (0=never a problem to 3=severe problem). The interpretation of the tool and its sub-scales is that a greater number of items, indicates greater severity. The range of scores per subscale are: Social Withdrawal/Lethargy 0-48; Stereotypy 0-21; Irritability 0-45; Hyperactivity 0-48; Inappropriate Speech 0-12. Parent ratings occur every 2 weeks during the study. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

        <title>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Randomized Phase)</title>
        <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is completed by the parent in order to assess whether additional improvements in social functioning occur with atomoxetine, as observed in our pilot study. This 65-item questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. The SRS is a standardized measure of the core symptoms of autism. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale. The score of each item is summed to create a total score. Total score results as follows: 0-62: within normal limits; 63-79 mild range of impairment; 80-108: moderate range of impairment; 109-149: severe range of impairment. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

        <title>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) Composite Score (Randomized Phase)</title>
        <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS) is used to assess adaptive functioning in four domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. This is a well-standardized open-ended interview used to assess the overall functioning of children and adults. This measure is especially important for subjects with PDDs given that their intellectual level is not always comparable to their adaptive functioning. The Vineland Maladaptive Behavior subscales will be included with these measures as these have been shown to be responsive to drug effects in other clinical trials in this population. The VABS will be done at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. The composite score represents a standard score (mean = 100 and standard deviation of 15; range = 20-160) on which higher scores indicate a higher level of adaptive functioning. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

        <title>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, 5-Item Total (Randomized Phase)</title>
        <description>Since the ABC does not have items which directly assess anxiety, the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is administered at week 8 during the study as an exploratory measure. The PARS is a clinician-rated instrument that assesses anxiety symptoms that are commonly associated with social anxiety, separation anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders. Scaled score ranges form 0-25 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms. Estimates are adjusted for baseline score, study stratum, and site, which were set at their sample means.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Global Impressions Global Improvement (CGI-I) is designed to take into account all factors to arrive at an assessment of response to treatment. The CGI-I scale ranges from 1 to 7 (1=very much improved; 2= much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse), with lower scores indicating improvement (1=very much improved and 2=much improved). Participants with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 were classified as improved. Odds of improvement at 8 weeks were estimated using a repeated measures logistic regression model adjusting for baseline severity, study stratum, and site. The CGI-I was administered biweekly during the study. The CGI was focused on the target symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.</description>

        <title>Change in ADHD Rating Scale (ADHDRS)-Home Version Total Score (Open-label Trial)</title>
        <description>The ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) is an 18-item scale directly derived from DSM-IV criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with established reliability, validity and sensitivity to change. The ADHD-RS-IV is investigator-administered biweekly during the 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. The scale consists of 2 subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items). If 3 or more items are skipped, the clinician should use extreme caution in interpreting the scale. Results from this rating scale alone should not be used to make a diagnosis. The total score can range form 0 to 54, with a higher score indicating greater severity. Change will be determined from the start of the open-label trial to 8 weeks post-start.</description>

        <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a 58-item questionnaire with 5 subscales derived by factor analysis: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, and Inappropriate. It has been extensively used in psychopharmacological studies of autism and assesses many symptoms that are either central to autism (Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, and Inappropriate Speech) or frequently a target of treatment Irritability). Each item of the 58-item scale is scored on a 4-point scale (0=never a problem to 3=severe problem). The interpretation of the tool and its sub-scales is that a greater number of items, indicates greater severity. The range of scores per subscale are: Social Withdrawal/Lethargy 0-48; Stereotypy 0-21; Irritability 0-45; Hyperactivity 0-48; Inappropriate Speech 0-12. Parent ratings occur every 2 weeks during the study. Change will be determined from the start of the open-label trial to 8 weeks post-start.</description>

        <title>Change in Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Open-label Trial)</title>
        <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is completed by the parent in order to assess whether additional improvements in social functioning occur with atomoxetine, as observed in our pilot study. This 65-item questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. The SRS is a standardized measure of the core symptoms of autism. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale. The score of each item is summed to create a total score. Total score results as follows: 0-62: within normal limits; 63-79 mild range of impairment; 80-108: moderate range of impairment; 109-149: severe range of impairment. This 65-item questionnaire will be completed at the start of and at the end of 8 weeks of the open-label trial.</description>

        <title>Change in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) Composite Score (Open-label Trial)</title>
        <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS) is used to assess adaptive functioning in four domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. This is a well-standardized open-ended interview used to assess the overall functioning of children and adults. This measure is especially important for subjects with PDDs given that their intellectual level is not always comparable to their adaptive functioning. The Vineland Maladaptive Behavior subscales will be included with these measures as these have been shown to be responsive to drug effects in other clinical trials in this population. The composite score represents a standard score (mean = 100 and standard deviation of 15; range = 20-160) on which higher scores indicate a higher level of adaptive functioning. Change will be determined from the start of the open-label phase to 8 weeks</description>

        <title>Change in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Open-label Trial)</title>
        <description>Quality of life is assessed with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0). This instrument is well-validated and widely used for measuring health-related quality of life in children and adolescents. It also appears to be a valid instrument for use with children with psychiatric disorders. The Generic Core scales include 23 items. The health related and family functioning scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The Family Impact module will be included to assess any change in family functioning. This will be completed at the start of the open-label trial and at the end of 8 weeks. Change will be determined from the start of the open-label trial to 8 weeks post-start.</description>

        <description>Since the ABC does not have items which directly assess anxiety, the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is administered at week 8 during the study as an exploratory measure. The PARS is a clinician-rated instrument that assesses anxiety symptoms that are commonly associated with social anxiety, separation anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders. Scaled score ranges form 0-25 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.Change will be determined from the start of the open-label trial to 8 weeks post-start.</description>
