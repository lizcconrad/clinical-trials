  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung disease that is caused by
      cigarette smoking or by breathing in other lung irritants, including pollution, dust, or
      chemicals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of zileuton, a
      medication that is used to control asthma symptoms, at reducing the length of a hospital stay
      for adults who are hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation, or worsening of COPD symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a disease in which the lung airways are partly damaged and obstructed, making it
      difficult to breathe. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.
      Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus production, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest
      tightness. Treatment usually includes inhaled bronchodilator or steroid medications that work
      by relaxing the muscles around the lung airways and reducing inflammation. Zileuton, a
      medication that is used to prevent asthma symptoms, may be beneficial in treating people who
      experience COPD exacerbations. Zileuton works by blocking the formation of substances that
      cause inflammation, fluid retention, and constriction in the lungs. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of zileuton at reducing the length of a hospital stay for
      adults who are hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation.

      This study will enroll adults who are admitted to the hospital due to severe COPD symptoms.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either zileuton or placebo four times a day
      for up to 14 days. While in the hospital, lung function testing and urine collection will
      occur. Study visits will occur at Days 14 and 30, and will include lung function testing, a
      medical history review, and a study drug adverse effects review.

    <description>Admission will begin at the time the subject has been admitted to an inpatient service. Length of Stay (LOS) will be recorded in days. The LOS will be based on the number of days spent in an acute medical ward or in the ICU. Subjects that are admitted and discharged in the same 24 hour period will be recorded as a LOS of 1 day, as will subjects discharged in the ensuing 24 hour period. LOS's greater than 10 days will be truncated to 10 days.</description>

The SGRQ was asked with respect to the last one month as validated for acute exacerbations of COPD by Doll et al.
Scale from 0 (no disability) to 100 (maximum disability).
The SGRQ total score summarizes the impact of airway specific disease on overall health status. Scores range from zero (no impairment) to 100 (maximum impairment). Scores were calculated using the SGRQ scoring Algorithm.</description>
