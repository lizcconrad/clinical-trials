  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will include healthy volunteers, COPD patients and asthmatic patients who
      will breathe He/O2 78:22, He/O2 65:35 and medical air consecutively in a randomised order.

  <detailed_description>

      Two types of measurements will be performed with each of the three evaluated gases:

        -  pulmonary function measurements at rest to establish the resistance to airflow in a
           reproducible way, including the measurements of Inspiratory Capacity (IC), Forced
           Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Expiratory Flows (FEF) at different lung
           volumes (25 to 75% of the vital capacity), and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC),

        -  Tidal Volume (TV) measured at rest and during light cycling exercise. The results of
           this study should be useful to evaluate the extent of influence on gas concentration,
           since none of the previous trials have been performed with He/O2 65:35, as well as the
           extent of influence on the lung disease, since none of the previous trials have been
           performed with asthmatic patients at various disease stages.

      The working hypothesis is that when using He/O2 mixtures 78:22 and 65:35, the flow resistance
      decreases as compared to medical air because low density helium replaces nitrogen, thus
      resulting in a lower workload of breathing for asthmatic and COPD patients. For patients with
      reduced pulmonary function, this difference might result in greater Inspiratory Capacity.

      That is why Inspiratory Capacity will be measured as primary efficacy criterion, but also
      Tidal Volume and other pulmonary function parameters on 3 types of subjects/patients :

        -  healthy volunteers,

        -  patients with moderate and severe persistent asthma,

        -  patients with moderate and severe COPD.
