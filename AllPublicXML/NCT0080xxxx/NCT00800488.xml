      The primary objective is to study the value of serum procalcitonin as a predictive marker for
      severe bacterial infection in febrile infants.

      2200 febrile infants aged less than 3 months will prospectively be included. All infants will
      have a measure of Procalcitonin concentrations. Comparison of the mean value of Procalcitonin
      concentration in infants with and without serious Bacterial infection.

      Evaluation of the area under the ROC for Procalcitonin concentration.

      Serious bacterial infections are often difficult to detect in infant with fever without
      source. Procalcitonin is a better blood marker of infection than White blood cell count and
      possibly than C-reactive protein. This could lead to a reduction in antibiotic prescription.
      Our objective is to evaluate the impact of Procalcitonin result on antibiotic prescription in
      children 1 to 3 month old with fever without source and our hypothesis is that it will lower
      the antibiotic prescription rate.
