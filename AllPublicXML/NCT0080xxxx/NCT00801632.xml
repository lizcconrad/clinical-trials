  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In small initial studies, combined kidney and bone marrow transplants from the same donor
      have permitted some individuals to stop taking anti-rejection medicines without rejecting
      their transplant. This clinical trial will study this method in a greater number of people to
      determine if it is indeed effective and safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receiving an organ or tissue transplant must take special medicines known as
      &quot;immunosuppressive drugs&quot; in order to prevent the immune system from rejecting the
      transplant. These drugs can be very effective, but they leave the patient at an increased
      risk of serious infections and certain types of cancer. New methods of preventing transplant
      rejection are needed.

      Researchers have found that transplanting both bone marrow and a kidney from the same donor
      can create what is called &quot;mixed chimerism.&quot; This means that the transplant recipient has a
      mixture of the donor and recipient's immune systems. It is believed that this mixture of
      immune cells can prevent rejection of the kidney. In a small prior study, performing a kidney
      transplant together with a bone marrow transplant from the same donor allowed 4 of 5 patients
      to stop taking immunosuppressive drugs altogether, without rejecting their transplant. This
      clinical trial will study more patients to confirm if the technique is safe and effective.

      Patients eligible for this study must be candidates for a living kidney transplant, and have
      an eligible donor identified. The transplant recipient and donor must both consent to
      participate in this study. Transplant recipients enrolled in the study will receive both
      kidney and bone marrow transplants from the same living donor. Prior to the transplant
      procedure, the transplant recipient will undergo a &quot;conditioning regimen&quot; that prepares their
      immune system for the recipient's immune (bone marrow) cells. This conditioning regimen is a
      combination of chemotherapy, radiation, immunosuppressive drugs and specialized medications
      called rituximab and MEDI-507. MEDI-507 is an investigational medication that has not been
      approved by the FDA. After the transplant procedure, transplant recipients will be prescribed
      steroids for several weeks and immunosuppressive drugs. After 2 months, the dose of the
      immunosuppressive drugs will slowly be decreased to zero in patients whose immune system and
      kidney function meet certain criteria.

      Transplant recipients enrolled into the study will be hospitalized for 1 week prior to the
      transplant procedure. After the transplant, patients will remain in the hospital until the
      doctor feels they are well enough to go home. Recipients will receive approximately monthly
      checkups over a period of 2 years after transplant, plus a checkup at 2 ½, 3, 3 ½ , 4, and 5
      years after transplant. Checkups will include physical exams, and blood and urine tests to
      assess immune system and kidney function. At four of these checkups, a kidney biopsy will be
      requested.

      Transplant donors enrolled in the study will attend a screening visit, which will include a
      physical exam, blood tests and chest x-ray. Eligible donors will be admitted to the hospital
      for 3-5 days, where bone marrow will be collected prior to removal of the kidney. Transplant
      donors may be asked at a later date to donate additional blood samples for research purposes.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Acute Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>Transplantation until study completion or participant termination (up to five years)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who experience an acute rejection. Acute rejection is defined as a biopsy with findings of Banff score of grade IA or higher. The Banff classification is as follows: grade IA is &gt;25% of parenchyma affected and foci of moderate tubulitis; Grade IB is &gt;25% of parenchyma affected and foci of severe tubulitis; Grade IIA is mild to moderate intimal arteritis; Grade IIB is severe intimal arteritis comprising &gt;25% of the luminal area; Grade III is &quot;transmural&quot; arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells with accompanying lymphocytic inflammation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Renal Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Transplantation until study completion or participant termination (up to five years)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in renal function as seen in serum creatinine values from baseline until study completion or participant termination. Baseline is defined as the lowest serum creatinine collected during stabilization period or in the four weeks following the end of the stabilization period. The stabilization period is defined as four consecutive creatinine values close in value (not differing more than 0.3 mg/dL). Higher results indicate poorer kidney function, as creatinine is removed from the body by the kidneys.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Graft Survival Through 156 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Transplantation until week 156</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with graft survival from transplantation through 156 weeks. Participants who terminated from the study prior to Week 156 without meeting the event were excluded. Graft survival is defined as the time to week 156 or graft loss. Graft loss is defined as the day on which a graft is deemed irreversibly nonfunctional and dialysis is begun, a transplantectomy is performed, or the participant is re-transplanted, whichever comes first. Six consecutive weeks of dialysis are required for the diagnosis of graft loss, though the date of graft loss will be defined as the date of first dialysis.</description>

The stabilization period is defined as 4 consecutive creatinine values close in value (not differing more than 0.3). A normal result is 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL for men and 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL for women. Higher results indicate poorer kidney function, as creatinine is removed from the body by the kidneys.</description>

Prednisone was started at 2 mg/kg/day on day 4 and tapered off by day 20. A steroid pulse (methylprednisolone 500 mg) was given on days 10, 11, and 12. Tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg twice a day, adjusted to trough level of 10-15 ng/mL) was given starting on day -1. When the subject met weaning criteria, tacrolimus was tapered over a period of no less than 8 weeks beginning 60 days post-transplant.</description>

          <title>Change in Renal Function</title>
          <description>Change in renal function as seen in serum creatinine values from baseline until study completion or participant termination. Baseline is defined as the lowest serum creatinine collected during stabilization period or in the four weeks following the end of the stabilization period. The stabilization period is defined as four consecutive creatinine values close in value (not differing more than 0.3 mg/dL). Higher results indicate poorer kidney function, as creatinine is removed from the body by the kidneys.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Graft Survival Through 156 Weeks</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with graft survival from transplantation through 156 weeks. Participants who terminated from the study prior to Week 156 without meeting the event were excluded. Graft survival is defined as the time to week 156 or graft loss. Graft loss is defined as the day on which a graft is deemed irreversibly nonfunctional and dialysis is begun, a transplantectomy is performed, or the participant is re-transplanted, whichever comes first. Six consecutive weeks of dialysis are required for the diagnosis of graft loss, though the date of graft loss will be defined as the date of first dialysis.</description>

Thymic irradiation (700 cGy) was given on day -1. Recipients underwent surgical transplantation of a donor kidney on day 0. During kidney transplant, bone marrow cells donated by the same donor as the kidney were given through a plastic tube placed in a vein in the chest, underneath the collarbone. Prednisone was started at 2 mg/kg/day on day 4 and tapered off by day 20. A steroid pulse (methylprednisolone 500 mg) was given on days 10, 11, and 12. Tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg twice a day, adjusted to trough level of 10-15 ng/mL) was given starting on day -1. When the subject met weaning criteria, tacrolimus was tapered over a period of no less than 8 weeks beginning 60 days post-transplant.</description>
