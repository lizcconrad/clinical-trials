  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose the present study with the following aims:

        -  to determine whether early patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) treatment with ibuprofen
           treatment at the onset of clinical symptoms is superior to late ibuprofen treatment only
           when symptoms of a hemodynamically significant PDA are present in the evolution of
           bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) defined as duration of supplemental oxygen exposure
           during the first 28 days

        -  to determine whether early PDA treatment with ibuprofen will be superior to late
           treatment with ibuprofen in efficacy of PDA closure, need for rescue therapy, need for
           PDA ligation and incidence of major complications of prematurity.

      Hypothesis: Early pharmacologic closure of PDA with ibuprofen will improve respiratory course
      and reduce BPD as reflected by a reduction in duration of supplemental oxygen during the
      first 28 days of age vs. late pharmacologic treatment with ibuprofen.

      Outcome variables: The primary outcome of this study is the number of days spent on
      supplemental oxygen by each infant during the first 28 days.

      Other outcomes to be determined between groups include:

        -  Mortality

        -  Other respiratory variables: total days on supplemental oxygen, days on mechanical
           ventilation, oxygen dependence at 36 weeks post menstrual age, age at final extubation.

        -  Other respiratory complications: pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, need
           for high frequency ventilation, pulmonary hypertension

        -  Efficacy of PDA closure: number of courses of medication required, need for ligation

        -  Other neonatal complications: intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular
           leukomalacia (PVL), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
           intestinal perforation, sepsis, renal dysfunction (oliguria, elevated creatinine)

        -  Time to achieving full enteral feedings, time to regain birth weight, weight at
           discharge.

        -  Length of hospital stay

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment was initiated on 01/02/08; the final patient was recruited on 7/26/10. Patients were enrolled at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Study was terminated early due to lack of availability of IV ibuprofen due to manufacturer's recall.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>179 subjects had consents obtained. Of these, 6 consents were withdrawn and 68 enrolled subjects were not randomized because they met exclusion criterion before randomization: hemodynamically significant PDA (n=10), absence of PDA (n=55) and other reasons (n=3).
Therefore 105 enrolled subjects were randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms.</pre_assignment_details>
