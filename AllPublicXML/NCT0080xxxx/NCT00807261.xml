    <description>Drug and schedule
Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV over 10 mg/m2/min (D1, D8)
Docetaxel 35 mg/m2 IV (D1, D8) .. every 21 days
Dose modification
Treatment should be delayed if the ANC&lt;1,500/ mm3, or if the platelet count &lt;75,000/mm3 on the first day of the next cycle.
Gemcitabine &amp; docetaxel are omitted on day 8, when ANC is less than 1000/mm3 or platelet count is less than 50,000/mm3; it is reduced by 25% if the ANC is between 1,000 and 1,500/mm3 or the platelet count is between 50,000 and 75,000/mm3 Study design Treatment should consist of at least 2 cycles unless rapid disease progression or unacceptable toxicities occur after one cycle of chemotherapy.
Patients with response or no change will receive 2 additional cycles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic, unresectable soft tissue sarcoma or
             bone sarcoma with the exception of certain histopathologic subtypes of sarcomas
             recognized by experts to derive no benefit from conventional chemotherapy (e.g.,
             alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, chordoma, desmoid
             tumors)

          -  Bone sarcoma patients must have visceral metastatic disease (e.g., metastatic to lung
             or liver)

          -  Patients who were previously treated with anthracycline- and/or ifosfamide- containing
             chemotherapy, as a first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease, or adjuvant therapy
             Patients may have had up to 2 prior chemotherapies within 4 weeks of starting the
             study treatment

          -  unidimensional measurable lesions

          -  Age ≥ 16 years

          -  Life expectancy of more than 3 months

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (ANC≥1,500/mm3, and platelet count ≥100,000/mm3)

          -  Adequate kidney function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL)

          -  Adequate liver function (bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dl and transaminase level ≤ 3 times the
             upper normal limit, or &lt; 5 times for patients with liver metastasis, serum alkaline
             phosphatase &lt; 2.5 times the upper normal limit, or &lt; 5 times if liver metastases were
             present or &lt; 10 times if bone metastases were present).

          -  Adequate cardiac function (Ejection fraction ≥ 50% by echoCG or MUGA scan)

          -  All patients are fully informed about the nature and purpose of this study and should
             give informed consent before the start of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients

          -  Patients with resectable lung metastasis

          -  Presence or history of CNS metastasis

          -  Prior history of other cancer within past 5 years, asides from basal cell and squamous
             cell carcinoma of skin, and carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix

          -  Any preexisting medical condition of sufficient severity to prevent full compliance
             with the study.
