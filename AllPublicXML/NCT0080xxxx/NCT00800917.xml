      This trial is an investigator initiated, open label phase II study, where patient with
      recurrent primary GBM will be considered for the study. Only patients with recurrence after
      Temozolomide and VEGF-directed therapy with Bevacizumab will be considered for the study.
      Patients will receive temsirolimus 25 mg IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 and
      bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV over 30-90 minutes on day 8 and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A
      safety analysis will be performed when the first 10 patients have received minimum 4 cycles
      (8 weeks). The study will then be stopped:

      If DLT is observed in &gt; 2/10 patients, Occurrence of any serious adverse events not described
      in the SPC of each agents, If partial remission is not observed in at least 1/10 patients
