    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the
      drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the
      body over time; explores what the body does to the drug) of tapentadol prolonged release
      (JNS024PR, PR) in participants with moderate to severe cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and
      spreads in the body until it kills) pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      multi-centric (conducted in more than one center), non-comparative, optional dose-titration
      study of tapentadol PR in Japanese participants with cancer pain. This study will consist of
      Screening period (3 to 7 days), Dose adjustment period (3 to 14 days), Fixed dose period (5
      days) and Follow-up period (7 days). Tapentadol PR will be administered orally (taken by
      mouth; to be swallowed) twice daily before meal. For participants previously using opioids,
      the initial dose of tapentadol PR will be selected depending on the daily dose of opioid at
      the completion of Screening period. For opioid-naive (moderate to severe cancer pain that is
      not controlled adequately with non-opioid medications) participants, the initial dose of
      tapentadol PR will be 25 milligram (mg) twice daily. Participants will receive the same dose
      of tapentadol PR for the first 2 days of the dose adjustment period and from Day 3, the dose
      can be titrated as per the Investigator's discretion up to Day 14. After that participants
      will receive fixed dose regimen for 5 days at the same dose as that used at the end of the
      dose adjustment period. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by sustained pain control for
      the 5 day fixed dose phase. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Pain Control for 5 Day Fixed Dose Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15 up to Day 19</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with sustained pain control for 5 day fixed dose phase were the participants who completed 5 day maintenance period, whose mean Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score during the fixed dose phase and which was assessed immediately before giving each dose was less than 4 and the number of rescue doses per day for fixed dose phase was 2 or less. Pain intensity scores were recorded 0 to 30 minutes before dose on 11 point NRS where 0 = no pain and 10 = severest pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Dose Adjustment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 up to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who achieved dose adjustment included those participants whose dose was adjusted during the titration period period and entered the fixed dose maintenance period. Titration period (3-14 days) was the duration between start of treatment to the day before the initial dose in the maintenance period. Maintenance period (15-19 days) was the duration between the first dose and the final assessment in the maintenance period.</description>

    <measure>Pain Assessment Using 24-hour Numerical Rating Scores (NRS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Average of Day -1 and Day 0 morning scores), Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity scores were measured on 11 point NRS, where 0 = no pain and 10 = severest pain imaginable. The pain intensity at Baseline was the average of scores on two consecutive morning doses (Day -1 and Day 0) and on Day 20 only a single observation was recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Assessment Using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 19</time_frame>
    <description>Pain VAS assesses the pain intensity experienced by the participant on a 100 millimeter (mm) VAS, where responses range from a response of no pain (score of 0 mm) to severest pain imaginable (score of 100 mm). The participant indicated the pain by marking the applicable place with slash (/) and the investigator then measured the length from left edge to the slash.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rescue Doses</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19</time_frame>
    <description>The immediate release (IR) oral opioids were used as rescue doses in the participants with lack of efficacy or to have relief from severe pain. In case of opioid-switching participants rescue doses were continued without any change in the preceding doses or the type throughout the study. The IR morphine HCl was used as the rescue dose for opioid-naive participants. The upper limit of rescue doses was specified for each daily dose of tapentadol PR. There was no change in the dose of rescue medication during maintenance period for opioid-naive participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Because of Any Adverse Event (AE) or Lack of Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 7 days after last dose of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The AE is an undesirable or unwanted consequence that occurred during the course of the clinical trial, but not necessarily because of study drug.The AEs included the onset of new symptoms, worsening of the frequency or severity of the symptom compared with Baseline, and abnormal findings including abnormal laboratory test values in the diagnostic examination. The participants who discontinued because of lack of efficacy were those in which satisfactory analgesia was not maintained.</description>

Treatment period comprises of Titration and Maintenance period. Titration period (3-14 days) was duration between start of treatment to day before initial dose in the maintenance period. Treatment was initiated with tapentadol prolonged release (PR) 25 milligram (mg) oral tablet twice daily. Dose was increased or decreased as per Investigator‚Äôs discretion up to Day 14. Maximum dose limit was 500 mg per day. Participants were then assigned to the treatment in the maintenance period (15-19 days). The maintenance period was duration between the first dose and the final assessment in the maintenance period.

            <description>Opioid-naive participants were defined as those who had moderate to severe cancer pain that was not controlled sufficiently with non-opioid medications. Treatment period comprises of Titration and Maintenance period. Titration period (3-14 days) was duration between start of treatment to day before initial dose in the maintenance period. Treatment was initiated with tapentadol prolonged release (PR) 25 milligram (mg) oral tablet twice daily. Dose was increased or decreased as per Investigator‚Äôs discretion up to Day 14. Maximum dose limit was 500 mg per day. Participants were then assigned to the treatment in the maintenance period (15-19 days). The maintenance period was duration between the first dose and the final assessment in the maintenance period. Participants received tapentadol PR oral tablet twice daily for 5 days at the same dose used on last day of titration period.</description>

Treatment period comprised of Titration and Maintenance period. Titration period (3-14 days) was duration between start of treatment to day before initial dose in maintenance period. Initial dose of tapentadol PR was selected according to daily dose of opioid (morphine sustained release [SR] preparation, oxycodone hydrochloride [HCl] SR tablet or fentanyl patch). Equivalent dose of tapentadol PR oral tablet twice daily given depending on daily dose of opioid at completion of Screening period. Maximum dose limit was 500 mg per day. Participants were then assigned to treatment in maintenance period (15-19 days). Maintenance period was defined as duration between first dose and final assessment in maintenance period. Participants received tapentadol PR oral tablet twice daily for 5 days at same dose used on last day of titration period.</description>
