      It is now well known that cardiovascular risks are increased in patients with obstructive
      sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Also a link has already been demonstrated between OSAS and
      hypertension.

      Nowadays, the most efficient treatment of the OSAS is the continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (cPAP). Several studies have also shown that cPAP could reduce arterial blood pressure in
      OSAS patients. But level of blood pressure (BP), drug treatment were not equal between groups
      and it`s difficult to single out independent role of cPAP.

      Our study has the objective to compare the effects of cPAP on hypertension in OSAS patients.
      After 3-9 weeks of antihypertensive treatment (valsartan and amlodipine) those one who
      reached target level of BP will be randomized either in the group &quot;treatment by cPAP&quot; or in
      the group &quot;treatment by cham-cPAP&quot; for 3 weeks and then we`ll perform cross-over.
