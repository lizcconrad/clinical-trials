  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves research to test how Vyvanse (study drug) affects sleep in 24 children
      aged 6 to 12 years who have ADHD. Vyvanse is approved by the FDA for the treatment ADHD of in
      children aged 6 to 12 years. The experimental part of this study is to determine how Vyvanse
      affects sleep.

      Treatment with psychostimulants has been associated with sleep disturbances, including both
      sleep onset and maintenance problems, in children with ADHD. This analysis evaluated the
      effect of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) on sleep in children with ADHD.

      This single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial enrolled children
      aged 6-12 years with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD. The study included a screening period,
      1-week washout, 3-week open-label LDX dose optimization phase, and a 4-week double-blind
      treatment phase in which subjects were randomized to placebo or active LDX treatment at 30,
      50, or 70 mg/d. Polysomnograph and actigraph measures as well as assessments of subjective
      sleep parameters were performed in all subjects prior to treatment and reassessed after
      treatment with either LDX or placebo.
