      multiple intravenous doses of ANZ-521 in patients with chronic Hepatitis C virus.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Double-Blind clinical trial will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of ANZ-521, an investigational product that is a
      weakened form (attenuated) of Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria that is commonly
      found in the environment. ANZ-521 has been altered in the lab to reduce its ability to cause
      disease, while maintaining stimulation of the immune system. ANZ-521 has also been
      genetically modified with recombinant DNA to encode consensus sequence antigens called NS5B
      polymerase and NS3 proteinase that correspond to viral proteins found on the virus causing
      Hepatitis C. It is hoped that ANZ-521 will stimulate an immune response to the Hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) in the liver, thereby demonstrating an effective therapy for individuals with
      chronic HCV infection.

      The purpose of this first clinical trial with ANZ-521 is to identify an appropriate dose of
      the investigational agent for later clinical studies and to explore safety when given to
      consenting adults with HCV. Immunological response to ANZ-521 in study participants will also
      be measured. Patients who choose to enter the study must meet all study entry criteria. The
      first part of the study (Part A) will enroll subjects who have received prior treatment with
      standard of care therapy for HCV. The second part of the study (Part B) will enroll subjects
      who have not previously received standard of care therapy for HCV or were intolerant to
      standard of care. Qualifying study patients will be assigned to receive one of at least 2
      dose levels of ANZ-521 or placebo. Each patient may receive up to 3 intravenous
      administrations (28 days apart) of ANZ-521 or placebo at their assigned dose level.
