  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the UK, leading to 34 000 deaths each
      year (22% of cancer deaths). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common histology,
      accounting for approximately 80% of cases and most present with advanced, stage IIIb or IV
      disease. The recommended treatment for advanced disease is a doublet platinum-based
      chemotherapy, although the survival benefits are modest. Even among those fit enough for
      chemotherapy, the response rate is only 20-40%, and median survival averages 9-10 months with
      the newer platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen (Schiller et al, 2002; Rudd et al, 2005;
      Lee et al, 2007). Only 11% of patients went on to survive 2 years when treated with the newer
      gemcitabine/carboplatin regimen established by the London Lung Cancer Group (Rudd et al,
      2005; Lee et al, 2007). New strategies are needed to further improve the prognosis of this
      disease.

      TRIAL OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective

      The trial will have two main objectives:

        -  To detect an improvement in survival for ERCC1+ve patients treated with a non-platinum
           chemotherapy compared to platinum-based treatment.

        -  To establish non-inferiority or improvement in survival for ERCC1-ve patients treated
           with a platinum-based chemotherapy compared to non-platinum treatment.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To examine progression-free survival, response rate and quality of life between the two
           treatment regimens, according to ERCC1 status.

        -  To investigate whether the treatment effect differs according to histology (squamous vs.
           nonsquamous);gender (males vs. females); performance status

        -  To undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis based on all patients, and according to ERCC1
           status.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Histological confirmation of non-squamous NSCLC

          2. Have a tissue biopsy available for sending to the central laboratory to determine
             ERCC1 status

          3. Presentation with stage IIIb (not amenable to curative treatment) or IV disease -
             staging scans must be no more than 28 days prior to registration. Patients with
             relapsed NSCLC must not have received prior chemotherapy or biological therapy
             (previous surgery or radical radiotherapy allowed)

          4. At least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumours

          5. Either sex, at least 18 years of age

          6. ECOG performance status 0-1

          7. Estimated life expectancy of at least 8 weeks

          8. Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by the following (assessed within 14 days
             of registration):

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 × 109/L

               -  Platelet count ≥100 × 109/L

               -  Haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL

          9. Adequate liver function as evidenced by the following (assessed within 14 days of
             registration):

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤3 × ULN or ≤5 × ULN is acceptable with liver
                  metastases

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤3 × ULN

         10. Adequate renal function as evidenced by the following (assessed within 14 days of
             registration):

             - GFR &gt; 60ml/min as measured by creatinine clearance through EDTA. Alternatively, the
             Cockcroft and Gault formula may be used to estimate GFR, but if &lt; 60 ml/min then EDTA
             should be performed.

         11. Previous palliative radiotherapy to non-target metastatic lesions is allowed for pain

         12. Patients with stable brain metastases will be allowed to enrol. Stable brain
             metastases being defined as no progression of brain metastases 28 days after treatment
             as documented by a CT scan/MRI of the brain. Patients with incidentally discovered
             asymptomatic brain metastases may be enrolled and treated with trial chemotherapy

             who receive aprepitant (anti-emetic) must be willing to use an alternative or back-up
             method to hormonal contraceptives as aprepitant may reduce their efficacy. Female

             to participate in the trial

          3. Presence of uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases thought to require
             immediate radiotherapy

             or pleural effusions) that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior
             to trial entry

          5. Yellow fever vaccination received within the 30 days previous to study entry

          6. Unable to interrupt aspirin or other NSAIDs (for pemetrexed arms of the trial)
