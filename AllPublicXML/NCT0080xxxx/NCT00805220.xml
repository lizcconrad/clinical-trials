  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The elderly are the fastest growing proportion of the population. Ageism implies a decline of
      physical functions affecting functional and safe ambulation. Based on the ICF model
      intervening in walking capacity could have favourable impact on quality of life of frail
      elders. Over ground walking training is indicated as a possible exercise. However, to achieve
      positive results on walking capacity, an exercise-dose response is needed. A more intensive
      way of promoting walking training is to add skiing poles while walking, a technique called
      Nordic Walking (NW). This study will be the first to compare NW with usual walking training.
      It aims to estimate for frail elderly the relative efficacy in improving functional walking
      capacity of two gait training strategies: NW and usual walking training and explore its
      impact on fear of falling. This study hypothesized that participants receiving Nordic Walking
      will walk longer, faster and fear less. NW if proven effective will positively impact on the
      functional capacities and quality of life of frail elders and provide an more intense method
      of walking training.

      This is a single blind, randomized, pilot trial designed to estimate the amount of change
      between two programs. Subjects will be randomized and stratified by setting into one of two
      groups, over ground walking training with poles (Nordic Walking) or traditional over ground
      walking training (without poles). Randomization will be computer generated using
      randomization scheme from the website Randomization.com at http://www.randomization.com Basic
      descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the participants and compare the two
      groups at baseline. Paired t-test will be used to estimate the efficacy of each intervention.
      Effects size of each interventions and its ratio will be calculated. Group-specific change
      score will be calculated to explore the impact of prognostic variables (age, gender, number
      of comorbities, baseline gait speed) on change of an outcome (with or without poles).

    <description>Walking training with and without poles will be twice a week. The sessions last 20 minutes each and consist of walking, stretching and mobility exercises. This will last 8 weeks in a total of 16 sessions. A therapist will closely monitor your exercises and modify them according to your needs and comfort</description>
