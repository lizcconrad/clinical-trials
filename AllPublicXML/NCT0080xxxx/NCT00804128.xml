      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as contrast-enhanced MRI, may help find and diagnose
      ductal carcinoma in situ.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying contrast-enhanced MRI in women with
      ductal breast carcinoma in situ and in healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To compare ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-optimized MRI with standard clinical MRI, in
           terms of conspicuity of DCIS lesion, agreement of disease extent with biopsy, and
           overall image quality (i.e., artifact level, uniformity of fat suppression, contrast to
           noise ratio and signal to noise ratio), in women with DCIS of the breast.

        -  To compare two DCIS-optimized MRIs for variability in enhancement levels for DCIS.

        -  To examine the effect of the menstrual cycle on the variability of background
           enhancement levels in healthy volunteers.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard clinical contrast-enhanced MRI over approximately 30-45
           minutes. No more than 3 days later, patients undergo ductal carcinoma in situ
           (DCIS)-optimized contrast-enhanced MRI.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo DCIS-optimized contrast-enhanced MRI over approximately 30-45
           minutes. No more than 3 days later, patients undergo a second DCIS-optimized
           contrast-enhanced MRI.

      Healthy volunteers undergo DCIS-optimized contrast-enhanced MRI as in arm II.
