  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 20% to 40% of all patients with cancer , with an incidence 10 times
      higher than that of primary malignant brain tumors. Patients with brain metastases have a
      poor prognosis with a median survival of 1-2 months with corticosteroids and 5-7 months with
      whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Local control achieved with WBRT in patients with otherwise
      controlled systemic disease remains at issue. A single high dose of radiation delivered with
      high precision to the target lesion (Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)), is considered standard
      care in salvage of recurrent lesions after WBRT. SRS can destroy tumour with very little
      damage to surrounding tissue. Research suggests that delivering radiotherapy in a number of
      smaller doses is more beneficial than receiving all of the radiotherapy in a single dose.
      Brain metastases are well suited for SRS as they are often small, radiographically
      well-circumscribed, pseudospherical tumors that are noninfiltrative.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With increasing volume of tumor, the dose of radiosurgery that can be safely delivered to
      recurrent oligo-metastases in the brain must be reduced. However, reducing the dose of
      radiosurgery also compromises local control. There is mounting evidence of a local control
      benefit to a hypofractionated approach in radiation delivery for brain metastases compared
      with single fraction radiosurgery. Here we propose a novel therapeutic strategy that builds
      on this concept whereby time between each delivered fraction will enable us to measure and
      adapt to response, with the objective of reducing irradiated volumes and improving outcomes.
      In general, the treatment of malignant tumors benefits from fractionation of the dose due to
      a number of radiobiological properties (redistribution, reoxygenation, repair) that
      distinguish, and select against, malignant lesions in the fractionation process.
      Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) is a method of delivering a highly
      conformal dose distribution in a few treatment sessions using a relocatable stereotactic
      frame. HSRT may be an attractive alternative to SRS because it may 1) improve patient comfort
      by removing the invasive nature of SRS frames, 2) confer a radiobiologic advantage over
      single fraction treatment.

    <description>Patients will be initially administered 8 Gy RT (level). The dose at each level will be increase by 2 Gy up to level 4. If ≥ 2 of the patients in a dose cohort encounter a DLT, then that dose level will be declared the maximum administered dose. An additional 3 patients will then be entered at the previous dose level and provided no more than one patient experiences a DLT, that level will be declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Up to 6 more patients can be treated at the given dose level while awaiting the results of 6 months of follow-up.</description>
