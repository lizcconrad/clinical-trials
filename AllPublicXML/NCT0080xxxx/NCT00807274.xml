      Impaired kidney function is associated with a poor outcome in patients with heart failure but
      it is not known of this is the case for patients who have been born with their heart
      condition (congenital heart disease). This study aims to investigate how frequently patients
      with congenital heart disease have kidney disease and whither this does have an impact on
      their outcome. The hypothesis is that kidney dysfunction will be common in these patients and
      may have an impact on long-term health and life-expectancy.

      Renal dysfunction is a recognised independent prognosticator in patients with chronic heart
      failure. Indeed it has been suggested that the clinical impact of renal dysfunction may be
      greater than that of left ventricular ejection fraction per se.

      The role of renal function has also been investigated in small sub-groups of patients with
      adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) for example peri-operatively. It is not however known
      if renal dysfunction has the same prevalence and significance as when present to patient with
      acquired heart failure. The hypothesis of the study is that renal dysfunction, both overt and
      sub-clinical, will be commonly detected in patients with congenital heart disease. The study
      proposes that renal dysfunction will be associated with hospitalisation for heart failure and
      fluid overload and will also identify patients at an increased risk of worsening clinical
      status.

      Comparisons: Baseline renal function (creatinine, glomerular filtration rate by equation and
      clearance testing), quantification of urinalysis, baseline neurohormones. Follow-up data
      regarding clinical endpoints including new arrhythmia, functional deterioration, and
      hospitalisation.
