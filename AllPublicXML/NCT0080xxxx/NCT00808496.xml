  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory arthritis is a major cause of permanent joint damage. Joint damage causes
      functional disability and physical deformity. Many inflammatory arthritis patients develop
      permanent joint damage within the first two years of disease. Early, aggressive treatment
      with drugs called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is known to reduce how
      quickly this damage occurs. Sometimes, however, even when patients' symptoms are under
      control, the disease continues to cause joint damage.

      This study will determine if magnetic resonance imaging (also known as 'MRI') conducted every
      six months provides arthritis specialists with information to help them better treat
      peripheral inflammatory arthritis patients over the first two years of care. The effect of
      MRI will be compared to 1) the use of x-ray every six months; and, 2) the frequency at which
      these tests are usually used. The study will also determine if differences in treatment
      between the three groups result in differences in the well-being of patients.

      A total of 186 patients with early signs of inflammatory arthritis will be studied. All
      participants will have an MRI and x-ray conducted every six months. One-third of participants
      (62 in total) will only have MRI information sent to their arthritis specialist (MRI group);
      62 will have x-ray information sent (X-ray group); and, the remaining 62 will have x-ray
      information sent only when ordered by the arthritis specialist (Usual Care group). Negative
      disease progression reports will be sent to the arthritis specialist unless intervention
      allocation-specific disease progression is detected. In which case, a report blinded to
      imaging modality will be sent indicating the detection of disease progression relative to the
      last timepoint of progression, or baseline, as applicable. At any point in the study, the
      arthritis specialist can request a clinical MRI or x-ray for any participant.

      Neither the participants nor their doctors will know to which group they are assigned. A
      computer program will randomly assign participants to one of the three groups using a
      technique called minimization. This technique accounts for differences between participants
      that are known to effect disease progression and treatment decisions. Using this technique,
      participants with similar disease will be evenly distributed between the three groups.

      The results of this study will have a direct impact on care for new inflammatory arthritis
      patients. It will determine the benefits, if any, of regular monitoring of disease
      progression with MRI or x-ray. Using tests proven to help treatment decision-making,
      arthritis specialists will improve the care provided to new inflammatory arthritis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a double-blinded randomized-controlled trial to determine if biannual
      monitoring of inflammatory arthritis disease progression with 1.0T peripheral magnetic
      resonance imaging (pMRI) of the 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal joints of the worst-effected
      or dominant hand at baseline compared to conventional radiography of both hands and wrists,
      or standard of care, alters the frequency of pharmacological treatment escalation at two
      years. A sample size of 186 (62 per group) is required to determine mean differences in the
      rate of pharmacological treatment escalation between the three groups with 90% power at a 5%
      level of significance, assuming a 5% spontaneous remission rate, 15% missing data, and 5%
      annual attrition.
