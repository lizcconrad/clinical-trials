    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The number of micturitions was measured by the 3-day bladder diary completed for the 3 consecutive days preceding each clinic visit. The mean number of micturitions per 24 hours was calculated as the sum of all micturitions recorded in the diary divided by the number of days the diary was completed at that visit. Change=mean at observation minus mean at baseline. Negative change, more specifically (ie), a decrease in number of micturitions relative to baseline=improvement.</description>

(range: 0=none to 6=a large amount); Overall, how much does leaking urine interfere with your everyday life? (range: 0=not at all to 10=a great deal). Score range=0 (low bother from urine leakage) to 21 (maximum bother). Negative change (decrease) from baseline in score value=reduced level of bother.</description>

Percentage of participants reporting satisfaction included those with categorical responses of 'very satisfied' and 'somewhat satisfied'.</description>

    <description>KHQ: Self-administered questionnaire containing 21 questions scored in 9 domains (general health perception, incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep/energy, severity of urinary symptoms). Each domain was a categorical scale that was converted to a numeric score. All domains transformed to a range of 0 to 100, where 0=best outcome/response and 100=worst outcome/response. Change=mean score at Week 12 minus mean score at baseline, negative change from baseline=improvement.</description>

        <description>The number of micturitions was measured by the 3-day bladder diary completed for the 3 consecutive days preceding each clinic visit. The mean number of micturitions per 24 hours was calculated as the sum of all micturitions recorded in the diary divided by the number of days the diary was completed at that visit. Change=mean at observation minus mean at baseline. Negative change, more specifically (ie), a decrease in number of micturitions relative to baseline=improvement.</description>

        <description>NUEs were defined as those with a USS rating of &gt;=3 in the diary, occurring between the time the participant goes to bed and the time he/she arises to start the next day.

Mean number of NUEs per 24 hours was calculated as total number of NUEs divided by total number of diary days collected at that visit. Change=mean at observation minus mean at baseline. Negative change, ie, decrease in number of NUEs relative to baseline=improvement.</description>

        <description>ICIQ-SF: self-administered questionnaire for assessment and quantification of incontinence and its impact on quality of life. ICIQ score=sum of the responses to 3 questions: How often do you leak urine? (range: 0=never to 5=all the time); How much urine do you usually leak? (range: 0=none to 6=a large amount); Overall, how much does leaking urine interfere with your everyday life? (range: 0=not at all to 10=a great deal). Score range=0 (low bother from urine leakage) to 21 (maximum bother). Negative change (decrease) from baseline in score value=reduced level of bother.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) Score at Week 12</title>
          <description>ICIQ-SF: self-administered questionnaire for assessment and quantification of incontinence and its impact on quality of life. ICIQ score=sum of the responses to 3 questions: How often do you leak urine? (range: 0=never to 5=all the time); How much urine do you usually leak? (range: 0=none to 6=a large amount); Overall, how much does leaking urine interfere with your everyday life? (range: 0=not at all to 10=a great deal). Score range=0 (low bother from urine leakage) to 21 (maximum bother). Negative change (decrease) from baseline in score value=reduced level of bother.</description>
