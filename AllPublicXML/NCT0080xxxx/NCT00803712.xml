    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>First participant was enrolled on 19 February 2009 and last participant completed the study on 5 July 2011. 313 participants were enrolled from 82 study centers in US, Europe, Canada, Australia and Russia.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Once participants were determined to be eligible for the study, they entered a pre-randomization wash-out phase of 4 weeks (if receiving vitamin D at the time of enrollment). Four enrolled participants did not complete the pre-randomization wash-out phase and were not randomized into the study.</pre_assignment_details>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results aftercompletion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This was an open-label study and neither investigators nor subjects were blinded to treatment modality. Cinacalcet was dosed by forced titration. Active vitamin D administration was at the discretion of the investigator in each treatment arm.</limitations_and_caveats>
