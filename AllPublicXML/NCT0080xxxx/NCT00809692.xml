      A critical first step to address the &quot;pharmacodynamic information gap&quot; in pediatrics resides
      with the development of methods capable of accurately measuring the time dependent effects of
      xenobiotic exposure in a manner sufficient to enable an integrative analysis of drug action
      which incorporates both pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic determinants. The proposed study
      will evaluate laser Doppler flowimetry, a necessary initial step in developing an &quot;ideal&quot;
      pharmacodynamic surrogate endpoint that ultimately could be used in infants, children and
      adolescents to fully characterize the impact of development on the pharmacokinetic (PK) /
      pharmacodynamic (PD) / pharmacogenetic (PG) determinants of drug effect for agents capable of
      modulating the cellular response to histamine.

      The overall goal of this research is to develop and validate non-invasive approaches suitable
      for use in pediatrics that are sufficient to directly evaluate genotype-phenotype
      associations as determinants of the concentration-effect profile of drugs capable of altering
      microvascular function. The specific goal of this project will be to assess whether
      microvascular blood flow determined by a previously validated laser Doppler technique can be
      used as a reliable surrogate endpoint capable of functionally discriminating the effects of
      polymorphisms in the genes which are quantitatively important for histamine
      biotransformation. The investigators hypothesize that microvascular blood flow velocity can
      be used as a valid surrogate marker to discriminate the functional consequences of allelic
      variants in the enzymes primarily responsible for the biotransformation of histamine.

      The project includes two parts:

        1. Validation of histamine iontophoresis (with measurement of microvascular blood flow by
           laser Doppler flowimetry) in a pediatric cohort as a pharmacologic provocation test
           capable of reliably characterizing the normal physiologic response of the cutaneous
           microvasculature to this xenobiotic addressed by a study in 50 children with a diagnosis
           of allergic disease or other &quot;allergic&quot; conditions where treatment with antihistamines
           represents the medical &quot;standard of care&quot;. Subjects will concomitantly (on contralateral
           extremities) receive histamine challenges by the &quot;gold standard&quot; cutaneous prick test
           (time dependent response assessed by serial assessment of wheal and flare reactions) and
           by a previously described iontophoresis technique (time dependent response by serial
           assessment of microvascular blood flow using a validated laser Doppler
           technique).Additionally, DNA will be isolated from these subjects for genotyping as
           described in part 2).

        2. Assessment of microvascular response to histamine challenge as a surrogate marker
           capable of functionally discriminating genotype-phenotype associations for
           polymorphically expressed genes that are quantitatively important in regulating the
           biotransformation and pharmacologic inactivation of histamine addressed first by
           genotyping 150 additional subjects who have an established diagnosis of allergic disease
           where treatment with antihistamines represents the medical &quot;standard of care&quot;. Genotype
           data for candidate genes of primary interest, histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT) and
           diamine oxidase (DAO), will thus be available from a total of 200 subjects. Based upon
           known genotype-phenotype associations for HNMT (the enzyme primarily responsible for
           histamine biotransformation), two cohorts of subjects will be selected from those
           studied using an extreme discordant phenotype approach: subjects predicted, based upon
           genotype, to have reduced HMNT activity (i.e., those with 1 or 0 functional alleles) and
           subjects predicted to have normal enzyme activity (i.e., those with two functional
           alleles). These study participants will then receive a transcutaneous histamine
           challenge delivered by iontophoresis, followed by repeated assessment of microvascular
           reactivity reflected by time-averaged measurement of blood flow velocity using an
           established laser Doppler technique. Statistical analysis of blood flow velocity and
           other parameters from the laser Doppler assessment will be used as the primary outcome
           measurement for comparison of the two study cohorts with respect to expression of HNMT
           and DAO and the functional consequences thereof, using histamine response as the
           surrogate assessment of phenotype.
