    <measure>Change From Baseline in Assessment of Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) for SBP and DBP at Week 6/Final Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks/Final Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulatory BP measurements were obtained from 24 participants(in addition to the BP measurements obtained by the cuff technique) participating in the exploratory 24-hour ABPM sub-study. BP was monitored by a 24 hour Ambulatory BP device provided by a central vendor.</description>

    <description>Ambulatory BP measurements were obtained from 24 participants (in addition to the BP measurements obtained by the cuff technique) participating in the exploratory 24-hour ABPM sub-study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Assessment of ABPM for SBP and DBP Pressure at Week 6/Final Visit (Sensitivity Analysis Excluding One Participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks/Final Visit</time_frame>
    <description>A summary of ABPM 24-hour averages for SBP and DBP are presented in this Outcome Measure. One of the participant in the Naproxen ABPM Arm had clinically implausible high BP values at Baseline. Due to the low number of participants in each Arm (12 and 11) these values had a significant impact on the mean baseline values for the Naproxen Arm. As a result, an additional sensitivity analysis was conducted, excluding this participant (Participant ID 10031002).</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a phase 4, 6-week, randomized double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled trial in participants with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). A total of 221 participants were screened into the study in 32 investigator sites.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 101 participants were randomized to treatment with Celecoxib and 100 participants to treatment with Naproxen. Of these randomized, 100 participants received treatment with Celecoxib and 98 participants received treatment with Naproxen. Three participants were randomized but did not receive any treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Ambulatory BP measurements were obtained from 24 participants (in addition to the BP measurements obtained by the cuff technique) participating in the exploratory 24-hour ABPM sub-study. A summary of ABPM 24-hour averages for heart rate is presented in this Outcome Measure.</description>

        <population>Safety population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication. For one participant in Naproxen Arm the device failed to collect 11 out of 24 readings at Week 6 and this participant was not included in analysis.

        <description>A summary of ABPM 24-hour averages for SBP and DBP are presented in this Outcome Measure. One of the participant in the Naproxen ABPM Arm had clinically implausible high BP values at Baseline. Due to the low number of participants in each Arm (12 and 11) these values had a significant impact on the mean baseline values for the Naproxen Arm. As a result, an additional sensitivity analysis was conducted, excluding this participant (Participant ID 10031002).</description>
