  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is still the most common gynecologic cancer. There was no obvious increase of
      the survival over years. The risk of recurrence after radical surgery has increased with
      positive lymph nodes, positive surgical margins, positive lymphatic vascular space and deep
      invasion of the cervical stroma. In recent years, the role of chemotherapy for cervical
      cancer has been gradually recognized. But as a adjuvant therapy post-surgery, if chemotherapy
      can improve the overall survival rate of patients with adverse pathological prognostic
      factors is inconclusive.

      In this study, in order to investigate the effect and adverse reaction of chemotherapy as the
      adjuvant therapy post-surgery on patients with adverse pathological prognostic factors, nine
      hundred and ninety patients will be randomly divided into three groups, comparing
      radiotherapy alone, concurrent chemoradiation and sequence chemotherapy and radiotherapy (2
      cycles chemotherapy of Paclitaxel and Cisplatin before and after the irradiation). The
      investigators aim to find out the best therapeutic regimen with lowest adverse reaction for
      cervical cancer with adverse pathological prognostic factors. To guide clinical treatment
      options.

      After radical surgery, patients with stage IB1 to IIA2 cervical cancer who had one or more
      following pathological factors were recruited: lymph node metastases (LNM), positive
      parametrium or margins (PPM), lymphatic vascular space involvement (LVSI), deep invasion of
      cervical stromal (DIS). Eligible patients were randomized to three groups. Group A underwent
      50 GY RT alone. Group B received concurrent weekly cisplatin and RT. Group C received
      paclitaxel and bolus cisplatin every three weeks for two cycles before RT, followed by two
      cycles.

      We have recruited 800 patients till November 2014.
