  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the proposed study are to determine whether culturally diverse community
      residents with diabetes are willing to participate in our community health worker
      intervention using randomized controlled trial (RCT) methods and to explore and document
      effective processes and protocols for RCT methods in these communities. The investigators
      will examine retention rates, identify reasons for attrition through interviews and focus
      groups, and determine strategies for improving recruitment, retention, and intervention
      methods. As a secondary objective, the investigators will explore the potential impacts of
      the intervention for improving healthy lifestyles, diabetes self-management, and selected
      health outcomes of participants.
