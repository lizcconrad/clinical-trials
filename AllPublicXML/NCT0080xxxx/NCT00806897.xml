      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this observational study is to gain practical
      experience with once daily Levemir® administration in type 2 diabetes patients who were
      previously treated with NPH insulins (e.g. Protaphane®) as basal insulin as part of their IIT
      under normal clinical practice conditions in Lithuania
