      The purpose of this study is to investigate patient's usability, preference and blood glucose
      control for the new prefilled disposable insulin lispro mixture (Humalog Mix 25 injection
      KwikPen®). For that purpose, randomized open-label, 2-period direct comparative crossover
      study is planned in comparison with insulin aspart mixture (Novo Rapid 30 Mix injection
      FlexPen®).

      -  Concomitant drugs The treatment with other insulin preparation is prohibited during the
           study period. As to the drugs except insulin that have been used for the treatment of
           diabetes and its complication since the time before the study, the content should not be
           changed during the study in principle unless the complication is cured. If any new
           complication occurs during the study period, an appropriate treatment is given by the
           judgment of investigator.

        -  Compliance with treatment method The investigator gives sufficient explanation on the
           following contents to the patient.

             -  To inject the prescribed volume of insulin at the prescribed time.

             -  To observe the appointed date for the next visit.

        -  Termination of assessment The study is discontinued if any of the following events
           occurs after the start of study.

             -  Important protocol violation

             -  When continued treatment is judged difficult due to the onset of an adverse event

             -  Death

             -  When the follow-up of patient becomes impossible

             -  Other than the above, when the investigator judges it necessary to discontinue the
                study
