  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory process is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. Prader-Willi syndrome
      (PWS) is a genetic model of syndromic obesity. Adiponectin is an adipokine with potent
      anti-inflammatory properties, and its effect is mediated through adiponectin receptors 1
      (adipoR1) and 2 (adipoR2).

      Objective of this study is to compare the expression of adipoR1, adipoR2, and adiponectin in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in PWS children and obese control and to correlate
      receptor expression with insulin sensitivity and obesity-related parameters.
