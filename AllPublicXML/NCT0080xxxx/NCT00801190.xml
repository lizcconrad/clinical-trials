    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to determine if there is a bleeding risk associated with the
      use of starch-containing fluids during cardiac surgery. The specific purpose of this study
      will be to examine, in a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled fashion, the
      effects of colloid (HES 130/0.4) vs. crystalloid (Ringer's Lactate) on bleeding in patients
      undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery. The primary end point of this trial
      will be chest tube output at 24 hours. In addition, a range of secondary end points focusing
      on transfusion parameters, as well as other important end-organ outcomes, will be determined.
