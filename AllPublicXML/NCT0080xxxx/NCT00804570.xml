  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary objective of this study is to test whether LY2196044 can reduce the number of
      heavy drinking days per month in people with alcohol dependence. Each subject will undergo a
      screening and assessment period (including medication washout) prior to randomization into a
      16 week double blind treatment period.

    <measure>Percentage of Heavy Drinking Days at Week 16 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Timeline Followback Method assesses the subject's daily drinking by means of a calendar that covers a specific time period and was used to assess the number of heavy drinking days.

        <description>The Timeline Followback Method assesses the subject’s daily drinking by means of a calendar that covers a specific time period and was used to assess the number of heavy drinking days. Heavy drinking is defined as ≥4 drinks/day for women and ≥5 drinks/day for men. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, gender, family history, treatment*visit, gender*family history, baseline, and baseline*visit.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Drinks Per Heavy Drinking Day at Week 16 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The Timeline Followback Method assesses the subject’s daily drinking by means of a calendar that covers a specific time period and was used to assess the number of drinks consumed on heavy drinking days. Heavy drinking is defined as ≥4 drinks/day for women and ≥5 drinks/day for men. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, gender, family history, treatment*visit, gender*family history, baseline, and baseline*visit. An unstructured covariance structure was used.</description>

        <description>DrInC is a self-administered, 50-item questionnaire designed to measure adverse consequences of alcohol abuse in 5 areas: Interpersonal, Physical, Social, Impulsive, and Intrapersonal. DrInC-2R provides a measurement since the last interview. Total scores range from 0-150, and higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, gender, family history, baseline, gender*family history, treatment*visit, baseline*visit. Subject was treated as a random effect. An unstructured covariance structure was used.</description>

          <title>Ratio of Geometric Means Over Baseline in Percent Carbohydrate-Deficient Transferrin (%CDT) Level at Week 16 Endpoint</title>
          <description>Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) and %CDT will be used as biochemical markers of alcohol consumption. A combination of GGT and %CDT improves the sensitivity of detecting excessive alcohol consumption as compared to either marker alone, or other traditional markers. Elevated levels indicate heavy alcoholism. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, gender, family history, baseline, gender*family history, treatment*visit, baseline*visit. An unstructured covariance structure was used.</description>

It includes 3 items on a scale of 1-10: own desire to stop drinking (1=no desire to quit); own expectation of success in quitting (1=lowest expectation of success); how difficult to quit and remain abstinent (1=lowest amount of difficulty); and their goal related to alcohol use (scale of 1-7: 1=having no goal, up to total abstinence at 6 [7 was none of 6 above]).

          <title>Change From Baseline in Thoughts About Abstinence Scale at Week 16 Endpoint</title>
          <description>Thoughts About Abstinence Scale was to measure participant's commitment to abstinence. It includes 3 items on a scale of 1-10: own desire to stop drinking (1=no desire to quit); own expectation of success in quitting (1=lowest expectation of success); how difficult to quit and remain abstinent (1=lowest amount of difficulty); and their goal related to alcohol use (scale of 1-7: 1=having no goal, up to total abstinence at 6 [7 was none of 6 above]). Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for treatment, pooled investigator, gender, family history, baseline, gender*family history.</description>

        <description>Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report instrument that assesses the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction in daily life activities. The domains include: social relationships, living or house situation, and physical health. Total scores range from 14-70. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for treatment, pooled investigator, gender, family history, visit, baseline, gender*family history, treatment*visit, baseline*visit.
