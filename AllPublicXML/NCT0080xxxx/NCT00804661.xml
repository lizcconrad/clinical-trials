      The aim of the study is to identify the parameters that are associated with nocturnal
      hypoventilation in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Included patients will undergo a
      nocturnal evaluation of their gas exchange and sleep quality by actigraphy during their
      annual check up. The aim is thus to identify which parameters (such as lung function
      parameters) are associated with nocturnal hypercapnia or hypoxemia and/or poor sleep quality

      Background In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), respiratory disease is characterised by a
      progressive and ineluctable decline in lung function. Sleep-disordered breathing may occur at
      an early stage of lung disease and may impair quality of life. Oxygen therapy or noninvasive
      positive pressure ventilation may improve nocturnal hypoxemia and hypercapnia.Risk factors
      for nocturnal hypercapnia or hypoxemia are not well identified in patients with CF.

      Type of study : prospective, transversal, open

      Methods :

      During the annual check up, a sleep study will be performed with a nocturnal recording of a
      least 6 hours of pulse oximetry (SaO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO2) by the
      SENTEC device and wrist movements by means of actigraphy. The results of the sleep study will
      be correlated to·

        -  clinical scores which evaluate sleep quality (such as the PITTSBURG Sleep Quality
           Score).·

        -  respiratory function parameters : lung volumes, forced expiratory of the respiratory
           muscles: maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and the sniff nasal inspiratory
           pressure.·

        -  nutritional state with the body mass index z-score·

        -  the presence of arterial pulmonary hypertension on an echocardiography·

        -  infectious status (colonisation by Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and
           the CFTR genotype.

      Expected results This study should be able to document abnormal nocturnal gas exchange and
      sleep-disordered breathing in patients with CF in a stable state. The identification of
      parameters associated with nocturnal hypoventilation and/or poor sleep quality will help to
      screen those patients who will need a sleep study and treatment such as oxygen therapy or
      noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
