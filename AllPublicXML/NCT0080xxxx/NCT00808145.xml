      This study will look at the safety and efficacy of treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
      in patients who have not yet received systemic chemotherapy. Previous local treatment of
      hepatic lesions is permitted The treatment will use a combination of three FDA approved
      chemotherapy drugs, Gemcitabine, Cisplatin and Sorafenib. Sorafenib is FDA approved for the
      treatment of hepatocellular cancer, gemcitabine and cisplatin are not approved for the
      treatment of hepatocellular cancer.

      This study will look at the effectiveness and safety of combining gemcitabine, cisplatin and
      sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced
      disease who are chemo naive. Sorafenib has shown an increase in median survival but only
      tumor shrinkage by RECIST criteria. Since much of the morbidity and mortality of this disease
      occurs due to continued tumor growth in an already compromised liver, decreasing the size of
      the tumors might have significant impact on survival. The addition of traditional cytoxic
      agents might cause measureable tumor response and add to the survival benefit already seen
      with sorafenib. Gemcitabine and cisplatin are agents commonly used for systemic treatment of
      this disease and have demonstrated some effectiveness in disease control rate and median time
      to progression. Gemcitabine/Cisplatin have been used safely in combination with sorafenib in
      patients with lung cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatocellular carcinoma: diagnosed histologically, cytologically, or clinically by a
             rising AFP &gt; 500 ng/ml in the setting of cirrhosis and a radiographically compatible
             lesion.

          -  No prior systemic therapy; local therapy such as chemoembolization, radiofrequency
             ablation or cryoablation is allowed.

          -  Measurable disease &gt; 1 cm by CT or MRI. Lesions which have received local therapy do
             not qualify as measurable target lesions.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1

          -  Child-Pugh status A and B

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,250/mm3

               -  Platelet count ≥ 80,000/mm3

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dl
