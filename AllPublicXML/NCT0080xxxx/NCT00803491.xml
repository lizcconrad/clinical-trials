  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial including 200 subjects with rheumatic diseases. Subjects will be
      randomized to either a self-promoting problem based learning (PBL) program or a control group
      with traditional care. The hypothesis is that a PBL program will improve health-related
      quality of life, empowerment and self-care ability.
