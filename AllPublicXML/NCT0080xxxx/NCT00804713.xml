  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and potential impact of
      using a targeted testing approach and 2 interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) to screen for
      latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) among military recruits. The current policy of
      universal application of the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) to screen for LTBI may result
      in many TST reactions among recruits who are at low risk for LTBI. The central hypothesis is
      that targeted testing by use of the questionnaire will reduce unnecessary testing of low-risk
      recruits without affecting the identification of higher-risk recruits. The secondary
      hypothesis is that many discordant results between the TST and IGRA may be explained by
      cross-reactivity to non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) with the TST.

    <measure>TST Induration Will be Interpreted Relative to Risk, in Accordance With Published CDC Guidelines.</measure>
    <time_frame>48-72 hrs post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Risk stratification and test result. Risk was stratified by the use of risk factors identified by questionnaire according to the 5, 10 and 15 mm criteria (CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Recommendations and Reports 2000. Targeted Testing for Latent Tuberculosis Infection.)
The number of 1803 is used here because that is the number for which valid results were available for all 4 tests.
The number presented in each category is the number of participants that had positive results.
We are only presented a risk stratified interpretation for the TST (not the QFT, T-spot, and BST) because that is the only test for which this methodology is accepted in scientific and medical use. It is also the only test for which we had pre-specified the use of this methodology in the protocol.</description>
