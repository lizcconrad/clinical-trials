      This is the first study to be conducted in humans for RTI-336, a new chemical entity, with
      evaluations focusing on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RTI-336 following
      administration of single, oral doses. RTI-336 is a novel dopamine transporter inhibitor of
      the 3-phenyltropane class, and is currently being developed by RTI International as a
      potential pharmacotherapy to treat cocaine dependence. Data from this study will be used to
      plan and define dose ranges for subsequent studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine abuse has been an epidemic in the United States since the mid- to late-1970s. It is
      hypothesized that a medication to treat cocaine addiction should have some, but not all, of
      the behavioral pharmacological properties of cocaine. Substantial evidence links the euphoric
      highs and addictive properties of cocaine to the inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT)
      in the brain. Cocaine binds quickly and potently to this transporter and blocks the
      presynaptic uptake of dopamine, resulting in subjective highs and reinforcing effects in both
      preclinical studies and humans. Compounds that mimic the DAT-binding properties of cocaine
      that are less stimulating and act with a slower receptor onset and offset may prove useful as
      treatment for cocaine dependence. The 3-phenyltropane analog, RTI-336, is a potent and
      selective DAT inhibitor that has demonstrated desirable pharmacological properties in
      preclinical species and is an appropriate compound to test for its potential as a medication
      to treat cocaine dependence.

      This is the first study to be conducted in humans for RTI-336, a new chemical entity, with
      evaluations focusing on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RTI-336 following
      administration of single, oral doses, with the possibility of identifying the maximum
      tolerated dose in humans. Data from this study will be used to plan for and define dose
      ranges for subsequent studies.
