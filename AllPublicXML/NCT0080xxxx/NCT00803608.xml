      recurrence of plantar MTH ulcers in men and women, 18 years of age or older at the time of
      consent with clinical diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or type 2 who have had at least
      one recently healed plantar MTH foot ulcer (&gt;1 week but &lt;12 weeks since heeling) and have

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women, 18 years of age or older at the time of consent;

          2. Clinical diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus ;

          3. At least one recently healed plantar MTH-related foot ulcer (&gt;1 week but 4 months
             since heeling), based on medical records or if these cannot be obtained to the
             subject's best recollection OR current or recurring hemorrhage into callus under at
             least one MTH in a patient with a prior MTH related plantar ulcer that has been
             documented in the medical record;

          4. Barefoot plantar pressure in the area of the previous MTH-related ulcer or at the area
             of current hemorrhagic callus &gt;450 kPa;

          5. Loss of Protective Sensation (refer to Section 7.2.6);

          6. Community ambulator defined as having the ability or potential for ambulation outside
             in the community including the ability to traverse low-level environmental barriers
             such as curbs, stairs, or uneven surfaces, or better by subject report;

          7. Ability to give consent;

          8. In the opinion of the site PI the subject is willing and able to comply with the
             scheduled visits, treatment plan, and other trial procedures for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a current ulcer (see Section 7.1.1) below the malleoli, in the opinion of
             the site PI;

          2. Partial foot amputation greater than of two metatarsal heads or rays per foot; toe
             amputations with the metatarsal heads left in place are permissible; complete foot
             amputation on one side (i.e. ambulation with a prosthesis) is permissible;

          3. Charcot process that is active in the opinion of the site PI (requires immobilization
             beyond use of footwear that would be available through the study);

          4. A prior ulcer on the plantar aspect of the heel within the last year, to the subject's
             best recollection that in the opinion of the site PI has high probability of recurring
             in the study footwear;

          5. A prior ulcer on the weightbearing aspect of any toe within the last year, to the
             subject's best recollection that in the opinion of the site PI has high probability of
             recurring in the study footwear;

          6. A prior ulcer on the plantar aspect of the foot associated with a mid-foot prominence
             at any time in the past, to the subject's best recollection that in the opinion of the
             site PI has high probability of recurring in the study footwear;

          7. A prior ulcer on the plantar aspect of the foot associated with a mid-foot prominence
             at any time in the past, if the associated plantar pressure is &gt;450kPa

          8. Barefoot plantar pressure in the mid-foot that exceeds forefoot peak plantar pressure;

          9. Need for an ankle-foot orthoses in the opinion of the site PI or another provider;

         10. Need for more complex intervention, i.e. the site PI's decision is that the study
             footwear would not be adequate for the subject's needs, e.g. a rigid outsole or custom
             molded shoes are deemed necessary.
