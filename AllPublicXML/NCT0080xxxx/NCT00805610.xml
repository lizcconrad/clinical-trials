  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators research will examine the safety and efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation
      in the patient with acute liver failure without history of chronic disease. The investigators
      will study the effectiveness in providing a bridge of support for patient survival until
      whole organ transplantation is possible. This support may also be a bridge to recovery; by
      allowing the native liver to recover so that orthotopic liver transplant is not necessary.

      The investigators will also study the safety and efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation in
      the patient with chronic liver disease. Underlying etiologies of chronic disease may arise
      from cirrhosis, fibrosis or inherited metabolic disorders. The investigators will examine
      cell transplantation in end-stage patients not eligible for whole organ transplant. These
      patients may benefit with an amelioration of symptoms that will allow other therapeutic
      treatments.

      The investigators study will also examine the ability of transplanted hepatocytes to treat
      inherited metabolic diseases (ex., Crigler-Najjar Disease, Familial Hypercholesterolemia,
      Urea Cycle Disorders). Cell transplant may also act as a 'bridge' to whole organ transplant
      or improve function, permitting easier disease control through traditional therapy.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria are specific to the classification of liver disease, i.e.,
             fulminant or non-fulminant or metabolic disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any systemic infection

          -  Unstable coronary artery disease

          -  HIV infection

          -  Preformed antibodies to class antigens that are present on all available donor samples
             (Only cells from an ABO-compatible donor with no HLA Class I antigen to which the
             recipient has preformed antibodies will be selected for transplant.)

          -  Hepatopulmonary disease (Room air Pa02 â‰¤ 60 mmHg)

          -  Testing positive for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg)
             or Hepatitis B Virus by DNA and unable to receive or pay for Hepatitis B treatment.

          -  Any current or anticipated contraindication for the use of tacrolimus and
             cyclosporine, methylprednisolone or prednisone.

          -  Female patients who are breast feeding

          -  Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient
             unsuitable for participation in this trial.
