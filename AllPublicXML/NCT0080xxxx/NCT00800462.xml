    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of two M3 receptors antagonists (Trospium Chloride and Darifenacin Hydrobromide) with
      one standard drug (Oxybutynin Chloride) for treatment of overactive bladder in individuals
      with spinal cord injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients, between 18 and 75 years of age. Female patients of
             childbearing potential* must have a negative urine pregnancy test result on the day of
             Screening Visit and practice a reliable method of contraception**

             *A female is considered of childbearing potential unless she is:

               -  Postmenopausal for at least 12 months prior to study drug administration;

               -  Without a uterus and/or both ovaries; or

               -  Has been surgically sterilized for at least 6 months prior to study drug
                  administration.

                  **Reliable methods of contraception include:

               -  Hormonal methods or intrauterine device in use at least 30 days prior to study
                  drug administration;

               -  Barrier methods plus spermicidal in use at least 14 days prior to study drug
                  administration; or

               -  Sexual abstinence as a lifestyle.

          2. Patients with a neurogenic bladder and detrusor overactivity secondary to a spinal
             cord injury.

               -  Patients with urinary incontinence (minimum of one occurrence per day) despite
                  current treatment. [NOTE: Bladder emptying may be accomplished with straining,
                  intermittent catheterization (IC), spontaneous micturition or leakage episodes.]

          3. Patients with serum creatinine within normal limits and normal renal function

          4. Patients on a stable dose (minimum one month) of concomitant medication for Neurogenic
             detrusor overactivity

          5. Patients must have adequate cognitive function to understand the requirements of the
             study, including completing questionnaires and signing a written Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients who are pregnant (positive urine pregnancy test), planning to become
             pregnant during the study period, breast-feeding, or who are of childbearing potential
             and not practicing a reliable method of birth control.

          2. Patients with a history of transurethral sphincterotomy, bladder neck or prostatic
             resection, previous bladder surgery including myomectomy or augmentation cystoplasty.

          3. Patients with chronic indwelling catheters.

          4. Patients with, in the opinion of the Investigator, unstable or stable multiple
             sclerosis.

          5. Patients with known, uncontrolled systemic disease.

          6. Patients with evidence of recent alcohol/drug abuse.

          7. Patients with urinary retention, gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or
             uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma.

          8. Patients with contraindications to Trosec™, Enablex™ and Uromax®.

          9. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have a significant condition or
             situation that may put the patient at significant risk, confound the study results, or
             interfere significantly with the patient's participation in the study.

         10. Patients with a history of poor cooperation, non-compliance, or unreliability.

         11. Patients currently participating in an investigational drug study or who have
             participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days of the Screening Visit.

         12. Patients administered anticholinergics and/or antispasmodic drugs during the course of
             the study.

         13. Patient with hepatic insufficiency.

         14. Patient has been administered intravesical botulinum toxin within 6 months prior to
             the Screening Visit and/or is expected to receive intravesical botulinum toxin during
             the course of the study.

         15. Patient has any medical condition that would interfere with the interpretation of the
             study results or the conduct of the study.
