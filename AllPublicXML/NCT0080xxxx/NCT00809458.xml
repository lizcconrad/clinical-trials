  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if vitamin E can help treat prostate cancer. Vitamin
      E acts primarily as an anti-oxidant. By decreasing the oxidation in the cancer cell, the
      tumor cells may die. Vitamin E is a commonly used vitamin that has not been approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration for use in this type of cancer or for any known cancer. This
      study will test the hypothesis that vitamin E, in the setting of an oxidative stress such as
      smoking, can reduce prostate cancer related biomarkers in patients with localized prostate
      cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.

      - Prostate Cancer

      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in American men. It was estimated that nearly
      235,000 men in the United States would be diagnosed with prostate cancer and nearly 27,000
      men would die. The treatment of localized prostate cancer includes surgery, radiation
      therapy, or watchful waiting. The relative benefits of these approaches is unclear and
      treatment choices are individualized and often patient driven. There is currently no proven
      benefit to receiving preoperative hormonal therapy for patients undergoing radical
      prostatectomy. As opposed to patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy, for
      patients undergoing brachytherapy pre treatment hormonal therapy is used in approximately 40%
      of patients. Thus, these patients offer a unique opportunity to test novel agents in the
      neoadjuvant setting.

      - Vitamin E

      The term vitamin E was introduced by Evans and Bishop to describe a dietary factor important
      for reproduction in rats. Natural vitamin E includes two groups of closely related
      fat-soluble compounds, the tocopherols and tocotrienols. Eight analogous compounds are widely
      distributed in nature. Rich, natural sources of vitamin E are edible plant oils. Distinct
      biological effects of different forms of vitamin E can be distinguished at a molecular level.
      Vitamin E is the major hydrophobic chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation
      of free radical reactions in the lipid components of membranes, vacuoles and plasma
      lipoproteins.

      As an antioxidant, vitamin E acts in cell membranes where it prevents the propagation of free
      radical reactions. Non-radical oxidation products are formed by the reaction between
      alpha-tocopheryl radical and other free radicals, which are conjugated to glucuronic acid and
      excreted through the bile or urine. Vitamin E is transported in plasma lipoproteins.

      Most studies of the safety of vitamin E supplementation have lasted for several months or
      less, so there is little evidence for the long-term safety of vitamin E supplementation. The
      Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has set an upper tolerable intake level
      (UL) for vitamin E at 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) for any form of supplementary alpha-tocopherol per
      day. Based for the most part on the result of animal studies, the Food and Nutrition Board
      decided that because vitamin E can act as an anticoagulant and may increase the risk of
      bleeding problems this is the highest dose unlikely to result in bleeding problems
      (http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamin.asp).

      The dose of vitamin E used in the Selenium and vitamin E prostate cancer prevention trial
      (the SELECT trial) was 400 IU per day and thus this is the dose chosen for this study.

    <description>Patients will take one 400 IU tablet of vitamin E or a placebo daily. Patients will continue on this treatment from the time of randomization to the day before surgery or the brachytherapy procedure. This is expected to be between 4 to 6 weeks. The patient will continue with his regular medications. The vitamin E will be supplied by the clinical trial through the UNM CRTC pharmacy.</description>

        <description>PSA levels will be measured as a sensitive marker of anti-androgenic activity that is a critical endpoint to be measured in this study. PSA blood levels will be determined at the initiation and completion of Vitamin E supplementation from blood obtained at these time points. A clinical reference laboratory will perform blood PSA analysis and will be compared with plasma cholesterol levels as a relative control.</description>

Vitamin E: Patients will take one 400 IU tablet of vitamin E or a placebo daily. Patients will continue on this treatment from the time of randomization to the day before surgery or the brachytherapy procedure. This is expected to be between 4 to 6 weeks.
