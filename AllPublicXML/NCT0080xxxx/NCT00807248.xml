      To compare the efficacy of escitalopram fixed dose 20 mg/day in combination with fixed doses

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). Definitions of severity are provided at 2-point intervals. The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MADRS</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). Definitions of severity are provided at 2-point intervals. The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change from baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a patient-rated scale designed to screen for anxiety and depressive states in medical patients. It consists of two sub-scales: the D-scale measures depression and the A-scale measures anxiety. Each sub-scale contains 7 items, and each item is rated from 0 (absent) to 3 (maximum severity). The score of each sub-scale ranges from 0 to 21, and are analysed separately. The total HADS score ranges from 0 to 42.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change from baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is both a brief screening measure of insomnia and an outcomes measure for use in treatment research. It is a brief self-report instrument measuring the patient's perception of his or her insomnia, and it comprises 7 items. Each item is rated on a 0-4 scale and the total score ranges from 0 to 28. 0 = no symptoms and 28 = severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS): Family Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change from baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS comprises self-rated items designed to measure impairment. The patient rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities and (3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired on a 10-point visual analogue scales, on which 0 = normal functioning and 10 = severe functional impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SDS: Work Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change from baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS comprises self-rated items designed to measure impairment. The patient rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities and (3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired on a 10-point visual analogue scales, on which 0 = normal functioning and 10 = severe functional impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SDS: Social Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change from baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS comprises self-rated items designed to measure impairment. The patient rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities and (3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired on a 10-point visual analogue scales, on which 0 = normal functioning and 10 = severe functional impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change from baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (Normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Global Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I provides the clinician's impression of the patient's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the patient's condition relative to a baseline on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>

          <description>The MADRS is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). Definitions of severity are provided at 2-point intervals. The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

          <description>The HADS is a patient-rated scale designed to screen for anxiety and depressive states in medical patients. It consists of two sub-scales: the D-scale measures depression and the A-scale measures anxiety. Each sub-scale contains 7 items, and each item is rated from 0 (absent) to 3 (maximum severity). The score of each sub-scale ranges from 0 to 21, and are analysed separately. The total HADS score ranges from 0 to 42.</description>

        <description>The MADRS is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). Definitions of severity are provided at 2-point intervals. The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

        <description>The HADS is a patient-rated scale designed to screen for anxiety and depressive states in medical patients. It consists of two sub-scales: the D-scale measures depression and the A-scale measures anxiety. Each sub-scale contains 7 items, and each item is rated from 0 (absent) to 3 (maximum severity). The score of each sub-scale ranges from 0 to 21, and are analysed separately. The total HADS score ranges from 0 to 42.</description>

        <description>The ISI is both a brief screening measure of insomnia and an outcomes measure for use in treatment research. It is a brief self-report instrument measuring the patient’s perception of his or her insomnia, and it comprises 7 items. Each item is rated on a 0-4 scale and the total score ranges from 0 to 28. 0 = no symptoms and 28 = severe symptoms.</description>
