      Purpose: To determine the efficacy of treatment with latanoprost in combination with
      pilocarpine versus timolol or timolol/dorzolamide fixed combination (Timoptic or Cosopt) in
      eyes with XFS and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).

      Methods: This is a randomized, open-label study to test the hypothesis that improving both
      pressure-dependent and pressure-independent aqueous outflow and minimizing iridolenticular
      friction will interfere with the progression of XFS, allow improvement in trabecular
      function, and be more effective over time than simply reducing aqueous formation.
      Randomization was performed across the centers, per patient rather than per eye to avoid any
      crossover effect caused by aqueous suppressants. Group I was treated with latanoprost and
      pilocarpine, both in the evening, and Group II with Timolol or Cosopt b.i.d. Only one eye per
      patient was randomized. Patients were followed for 2 years with assessment of IOP, visual
      field progression, tonographic outflow coefficient and trabecular pigmentation at the 6:00
      and 12:00 position.

      Purpose: To compare the effect of treatment with latanoprost plus pilocarpine vs timolol or
      fixed combination timolol/dorzolamide (T/D) in eyes with exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and
      elevated IOP.

      Methods: A randomized, prospective, international, 12-center, two-year, open-label clinical
      trial was conducted. XFS patients aged 50-80 years with untreated IOP ≥22 mmHg and open
      angles with or without mild to moderate glaucomatous damage were included. One eligible eye
      per patient was randomly assigned to latanoprost and pilocarpine qhs to increase aqueous
      outflow and inhibit pupillary movement (group I), or to decrease aqueous production with
      timolol or T/D bid as needed for IOP control (group II). IOP, tonographic outflow facility,
      and trabecular pigmentation were measured every 6 months.

      Results: 277 (146 male) patients (mean age 69.1±6.8 yr, range 50-80 yr)` were enrolled
      between October 2000 and July 2003. XFS was unilateral in 118 (42.6%) and bilateral in 159
      (57.4%) patients. Baseline TM pigmentation at the 6:00 angle was significantly associated
      with IOP (p=0.01). IOP reduction was 1.3 mmHg greater in Group I (n=145) than in Group II
      (n=132) (p=0.0003). Mean increase in outflow facility in Group I was 0.005 µl/mmHg/min vs 0
      μl/mmHg/min in Group II (p&lt;0.001). TM pigmentation at the 6:00 position at 24 months
      decreased from baseline more frequently in Group I than in Group II [34(26%) vs 20(16%)] and
      increased from baseline more frequently in Group II than in Group I [31(25%) vs 24(18%)].

      Conclusions: Subjects in Group I had lower IOP, improved outflow facility and decreased TM
      pigmentation. Initial therapy to increase aqueous outflow and interfere with dispersion of
      exfoliation material and iris pigment by inhibiting pupillary movement is preferable to
      reducing aqueous secretion, which may be deleterious as primary treatment in this disorder.
