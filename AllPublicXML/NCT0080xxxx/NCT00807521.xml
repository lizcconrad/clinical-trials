  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stress response as induced by myocardial cellular damage during cardiac surgery may lead
      to myocardial stunning and apoptosis, and could therefore impair postoperative patient
      recovery. Surgical trauma typically induces the liberation of cytokines. Some of these
      cytokines are strongly associated with the initiation of intracellular proapoptotic pathways
      through activation of tyrosine kinases and integrins. The latter are known for their
      deteriorating effects on cardiac function and are strongly involved in cardiac remodeling.
      Dexamethasone is typically administered prior to cardiac surgery in order to especially
      reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines. It has however never been investigated
      whether this additionally reduces proapoptotic signaling in the human heart, thereby
      eliminating risk factors for the induction of cardiac dysfunction. In the present study, the
      investigators therefore aim to investigate whether dexamethasone inhibits proapoptotic
      pathways in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Furthermore, the investigators would like to
      elucidate whether this proposed effect of dexamethasone is related to the reduction of the
      stress response in the heart or indirectly by suppression of cytokine release. For this
      purpose the investigators will obtain cardiac biopsies and plasma from patients, who are
      randomly assigned to placebo or dexamethasone treatment and undergo on and off-pump coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.
