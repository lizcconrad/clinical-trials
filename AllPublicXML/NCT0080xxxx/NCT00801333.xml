      Induced pluripotent stem cells potentially may be useful in the future as an unlimited source
      of cells for transplantation.

      The major goal of the project is to develop human iPS cells from various types of cell
      cultures or lines from existing collections. The IPS cells will be developed for modeling
      diseases, for developing the technology that may eventually allow the use of IPS cells for
      transplantation therapy, and for basic research.

      The potential to reprogram somatic cells into an embryonic state raises multiple basic
      research questions related both to the process of reprogramming and the properties of iPS
      cells. We will use various approaches to study the molecular mechanisms and processes that
      occur during reprogramming. We will use various experimental systems to characterize and
      study the properties of the iPS cells, their biology, developmental potential, capability to
      give rise to functional differentiated progeny etc.

      We will induce the differentiation of the iPS cells towards specific cell lineages and the
      progeny can be used to study the pathogenesis of diseases. They will be used for developing
      new therapeutic approaches and for high throughput screening of factors for potential toxic
      or therapeutic effects.

      All samples will be non-identified.
