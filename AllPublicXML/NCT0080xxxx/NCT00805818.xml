  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NNZ-2566 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury frequently results in persistent problems with
      memory, attention span, mood and more complex brain functioning such as planning and
      organizing. There are currently no drugs available to reduce the brain damage or the
      persisting symptoms that result from TBI. The longer term goal of this study is to provide
      physicians with a safe and effective treatment for TBI.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-penetrating TBI.

          -  Male.

          -  Age 18-70 years.

          -  Admission to hospital.

          -  Post resuscitation GCS 4-12.

          -  Have at least one reactive pupil.

          -  Randomization within 7 hours of injury with the ability to receive investigational
             product within 8 hours of injury.

          -  Hemodynamically stable after resuscitation (systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;100 mm Hg).

          -  Willing to undergo all neuropsychological and activities of daily living (ADL) testing
             (i.e. understand English, able to read, write, have sufficient motor dexterity and, be
             available for follow-up visits at 4-6 weeks and 12-14 weeks post injury).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Penetrating brain injury.

          -  Spinal cord injury.

          -  Presence or known history of prior cerebral injury requiring hospitalization that
             would, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with or bias the assessment of
             efficacy.

          -  Non-traumatic brain injury.

          -  Known history of any medical or psychiatric disorder, or any severe concomitant

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the previous 4 weeks.

               -  A marked baseline prolongation of corrected QT/QTc interval &gt;450 ms.

               -  History of risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g. heart failure, hypokalemia
                  (serum potassium at screening (&lt;3.0 mmol/L)or family history of long QT
                  syndrome).
