  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the initial safety and clinical feasibility of neuromodulation therapy in treating
      patients with documented overactive bladder. The specific aim is improved urinary frequency
      and urgency after 12 weeks of treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty to Forty patients with documented overactive bladder will receive 30 minutes of
      treatment one day a week for 12 weeks. Treatment will consist of stimulating the posterior
      tibial nerve in the area of the ankle with a pulsed electromagnetic field. Study treatments
      will be administered by a commercially available MagPro R30, with a cooled figure eight coil,
      and a surface electrode placed over the afferent pathway of the sacral nerve.

      The specific aim is improved urinary frequency and urgency after 12 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary goals.

        -  To estimate the extent to which the device will decrease the number of episodes of
           involuntary urine loss due to frequency/urgency in comparison to historical controls.

        -  To evaluate the potential of the device for improving patient quality of life as
           measured by a clinically validated scale, such as the Incontinence Quality of Life
           Instrument (I-QOL) or equivalent

        -  To periodically employ a micturition diary to record variables such as day/night
           urgency/frequency episodes, number of voids per day, severity of leaks, number of
           absorbent products used per day, etc.

    <description>Study treatments will be administered by a commercially available MagPro R30, with a cooled figure eight coil. The figure eight coil is placed directly over the posterior tibial nerve and the MagPro R30 will be activated. The coil will stimulate the posterior tibial nerve at 20 pulses per second for a 30 minute session.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is &gt; 18 years old.

          -  The patient has â‰¥ 6 month history of documented overactive bladder.

          -  The patient has failed other conventional therapy (i.e.- Kegel exercises, biofeedback
             methodology, etc.).

          -  The patient is free of mechanical urethral obstruction as documented by cystoscopy or
             pressure flow criteria.

          -  The patient demonstrates an understanding of neuromodulation therapy, its benefits,
             and its potential risks.

          -  The patient is willing and able to keep accurate records of their voiding on the
             provided voiding diaries.

          -  The patient is willing and able to comply with the Study Protocol.

          -  The patient agrees to and is capable of answering a quality of life questionnaire.

          -  The patient has normal functioning of the upper urinary tract.

          -  The patient has an intact peripheral neurosensory system.

          -  If the patient is/was on pharmacologic treatment for urgency/frequency syndrome, a
             10-day washout period prior to treatment must be completed.

          -  The patient has sufficient outlet resistance at the urinary sphincter (i.e.- the

             terminated from the study.) Warning: The effects of neuromodulation on a developing
             fetus are unknown

             procedure or confound study results, including but not limited to patients with nerve
             damage, pacemakers or implantable defibrillators.

          -  The patient is unable or unwilling to sign informed consent.

          -  The patient is on pharmacologic treatment that could affect bladder function.
