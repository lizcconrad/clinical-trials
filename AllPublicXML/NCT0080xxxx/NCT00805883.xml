      This is a clinical research study designed to measure the effectiveness of focal Interstitial
      Laser Thermal Therapy (ILTT) at killing prostate tumours. Patients with &quot;low risk&quot; prostate
      cancer (Trans Rectal US Guided Biopsy positive) will undergo an MRI scan to try to localize
      the tumour. If the MRI detects the tumour they will then undergo a perineal ablative
      procedure (ILTT) under general anaesthetic. Seven days following ILTT they will come back to
      the hospital for a Radical Retoropubic Prostatectomy (RRP) procedure, which is the removal of
      a prostate gland through a surgical incision. After removal, the prostate will undergo
      further analysis to determine the exact location of cancer and evaluate the extent of cancer
      death caused by ILTT.

          -  Prostate cancer clinical stage T1c and T2a

          -  Prostate MRI must confirm area suspicious for cancer in the sector of the positive
             biopsy;

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to give informed consent;

          -  Patients with foci location in the apex of the prostate or isolated transition zone
