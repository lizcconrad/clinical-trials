  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the 70-day study period, eligible patients visited the study clinic every 2 weeks (total
      of 6 visits) and received a 28-day course of aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI). The
      Quality of Life-Bronchiectasis (QOL-B) questionnaire was completed at several time points
      during the study, in additional to pulmonary function testing and other standard procedures.

    <measure>Reliability of the Respiratory Domain of the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bronchiectasis (QOL-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -14 to Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Test-retest reliability is a measure of the stability or reproducibility of a measure over a period of time during which status on the underlying construct has not changed, and is measured by the intraclass correlation of scores obtained at 2 time points within that period. Test-retest reliability of respiratory symptoms was calculated for response at Day -14 and Day 0. Reliability of the participants' QOL-B responses was assessed from an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). A score of ≥ 0.70 would indicate strong reliability.
The QOL-B respiratory symptoms score was transformed onto a scale of 0-100, with higher scores representing a better quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Convergent Validity of the Respiratory Domain of the QOL-B</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -14</time_frame>
    <description>Convergent validity was assessed at Day -14 by examining the correlations between relevant QOL-B domains and other indicators of health status: a bronchiectasis severity score based on high-resolution computerised tomography (HRCT) scan results, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) percent predicted, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) results, and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) symptoms scores. Correlations with absolute values of 0.30 to 0.50 indicated moderate evidence of convergent validity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responsiveness of the Respiratory Domain of the QOL-B as Assessed by the Anchor-based Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) Following Categorization of Level of Change Using the Global Rating of Change Questionnaire (GRCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The anchor-based method measured the participant's perception of change at Day 28 using the GRCQ, which assesses improving/worsening symptoms. Distribution of ratings was categorized as no change (-1 to 1), minimal change (≥ 1.1 to &lt; 3.1 or ≤ -1.1 to &gt; -3.1), moderate change (≥ 3.1 to &lt; 5.1 or ≤ -3.1 to &gt; -5.1) or large change (≥ 5.1, ≤ -5.1). The GRCQ evaluated change in respiratory symptoms on a visual analog scale from -7 (worsening) to +7 (improvement). The following algorithm was used to obtain the mean change:
If the corresponding GRCQ score was in the &quot;no change&quot; group, then change from baseline QOL-B = Observed QOL-B change from baseline score; if &gt; 1, then change from baseline QOL-B score = Observed QOL-B change from baseline score; if &lt; -1, the change from baseline QOL-B score = (-1) * Observed QOL-B change from baseline score.
Then the mean change from baseline of QOL-B respiratory symptoms score of the minimal change category group is the anchor-based MCID.</description>

        <title>Reliability of the Respiratory Domain of the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bronchiectasis (QOL-B)</title>
        <description>Test-retest reliability is a measure of the stability or reproducibility of a measure over a period of time during which status on the underlying construct has not changed, and is measured by the intraclass correlation of scores obtained at 2 time points within that period. Test-retest reliability of respiratory symptoms was calculated for response at Day -14 and Day 0. Reliability of the participants' QOL-B responses was assessed from an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). A score of ≥ 0.70 would indicate strong reliability.
The QOL-B respiratory symptoms score was transformed onto a scale of 0-100, with higher scores representing a better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Responsiveness of the Respiratory Domain of the QOL-B as Assessed by the Anchor-based Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) Following Categorization of Level of Change Using the Global Rating of Change Questionnaire (GRCQ)</title>
        <description>The anchor-based method measured the participant's perception of change at Day 28 using the GRCQ, which assesses improving/worsening symptoms. Distribution of ratings was categorized as no change (-1 to 1), minimal change (≥ 1.1 to &lt; 3.1 or ≤ -1.1 to &gt; -3.1), moderate change (≥ 3.1 to &lt; 5.1 or ≤ -3.1 to &gt; -5.1) or large change (≥ 5.1, ≤ -5.1). The GRCQ evaluated change in respiratory symptoms on a visual analog scale from -7 (worsening) to +7 (improvement). The following algorithm was used to obtain the mean change:
If the corresponding GRCQ score was in the “no change” group, then change from baseline QOL-B = Observed QOL-B change from baseline score; if &gt; 1, then change from baseline QOL-B score = Observed QOL-B change from baseline score; if &lt; -1, the change from baseline QOL-B score = (-1) * Observed QOL-B change from baseline score.
Then the mean change from baseline of QOL-B respiratory symptoms score of the minimal change category group is the anchor-based MCID.</description>
