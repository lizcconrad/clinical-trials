  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As medicine advances, many lives can be saved in the intensive care unit. However, when
      multiple organ failure occurs, the mortality rate of patients increases dramatically.
      Therefore, the major goal in the intensive care unit is to prevent the occurrence of multiple
      organ failure. The sepsis protocol and early goal directed treatment have great effects to
      reduce development of multiple organ failure and to decrease the mortality rate. However,
      sometime the condition of patient deteriorated in spite of both the mean blood pressure and
      mixed venous oxygen saturation are normal. Some experts recognize that there might be
      microcirculatory dysfunction of tissue or organ. The dysfunction of microcirculation might
      due to vasoconstriction or microthrombosis. Vasoconstriction might result from systemic
      inflammation, reactive oxygen species, or dysfunction of synthesis of NO (nitric oxide).
      Microthrombosis might result from systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species, imbalance
      of coagulatory system, or damage of endothelial cell.

      In clinical practice, the oxidative stress is related to circulatory shock, sepsis, acute
      lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This study tries to investigate the
      relation between oxidative stress and microcirculation. Furthermore, the investigators will
      try to investigate the correlation between the severity of oxidative stress and
      microcirculatory dysfunction and the severity of disease and prognosis. The investigators
      hope this study will help them to figure out the picture of disease progression of patients.
      It may conduct further study to modulate the oxidative stress, to improve the
      microcirculatory function, and finally to improve the outcome of patients.
