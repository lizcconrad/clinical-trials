  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized, controlled trial that compares Behavioral Activation (BA),
      to Usual VA Care (UC) as early psychotherapeutic interventions for OIF/OEF veterans with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or PTSD and major depressive disorder (PTSD/MDD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sizable proportion of soldiers involved in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts are
      experiencing mental health and adjustment problems on their return, including posttraumatic
      stress disorder and depression (Hoge et al., 2004). Both PTSD and depression can be chronic
      and debilitating disorders, associated with impairments in social, occupational, and physical
      functioning, as well as high health care utilization (Katon, Unutzer, &amp; Simon, 2004; Stein et
      al., 2005).

      Although empirically supported treatments exist for established PTSD and depression, much
      less is known about effective early interventions for these conditions. Exploration of early
      intervention options is necessary, particularly in the case of the new veteran population, as
      such interventions could address social, occupational and physical impairments before they
      become too intractable. Also, successful early interventions could curtail high health care
      utilization dramatically across time. The development of such early interventions for PTSD
      and depression must also take into account any specifications of accessibility and
      acceptability that are particular to the OIF/OEF veteran population.

      The present study is a randomized, controlled trial that compares Behavioral Activation (BA),
      to Usual VA Care (UC) as early interventions for OIF/OEF veterans with posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD), or PTSD and major depressive disorder (PTSD/MDD). Participants will be
      recruited from the primary health care setting (to increase acceptability and accessibility
      to the veteran population). Both BA and UC treatment groups will be administered by
      psychotherapists who specialize in the treatment of PTSD. Both groups will be assessed at
      pre-, mid- and two post-treatment time points to determine maintenance of diagnostic change
      over time, health care utilization and treatment satisfaction. This is a dual-site study that
      will be carried out at both the Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC) and the VA Puget Sound
      Health Care Center (VA PSHCS) and coordinated at the PVAMC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to comply with assessment and therapy schedule.

          -  Ability to comply with study regulations.

          -  English fluency.

          -  Must meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD (related to trauma experienced during military
             service). PTSD will be assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV
             (CAPS; Blake, Weathers, Nagy, Kaloupek, Charney &amp; Keane, 2003).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bipolar disorder.

          -  Psychotic disorders.

          -  Substance dependence. Because these conditions warrant alternative treatments.
             Bipolar, psychotic and substance dependence disorders will be assessed using the
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I; First, Spitzer,
             Gibbon &amp; Williams, 2002).

          -  Report active and imminent suicidal intent. If imminent suicidality is present, this
             would suggest that a treatment specifically targeting this intent is indicated.
             Suicidal intent will be assessed using The Brief Assessment for Suicidal Ideation or
             Behavior that was designed for this study.
