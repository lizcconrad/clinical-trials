      The goals of this exploratory study are to 1)examine an investigational oral rinse as an
      adjunctive agent to scaling and root planing in treating chronic periodontitis in a
      periodontitis-susceptible diabetes population, and 2) evaluate its effect on glycemic control
      and biomarkers of systemic inflammation.

      This double-blind prospective pilot study will evaluate the effects of an investigational
      oral rinse as an adjunctive agent to non-surgical periodontal intervention for patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approximately thirty (30) adult (35 years or older) patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus with untreated chronic periodontitis of moderate or worse severity
      will be enrolled in the 6-month study to provide 24 evaluable subjects (12 per group). All
      subjects enrolled in the trial will receive standard periodontal therapy including scaling
      and root planing (SRP). Half will be randomized to receive the investigational oral rinse
      adjunctively twice daily; the other half will receive placebo rinse twice daily. Study
      participants will be treated with either Iocide or placebo rinse for the first 90 days of the
      study only. Follow up examinations will be performed at six months. Evaluation of biological
      markers associated with systemic inflammation and diabetes will be performed at baseline,
      three months, and six months. The primary study outcome is clinical measurement of chronic
      periodontitis (gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical attachment
      level). Secondary outcomes are change in HbA1c and markers of systemic inflammation measured
      by serum C-reactive protein, plasma TNF-a, and IL-6.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have self-reported type 2 diabetes of more than three months duration.

          2. A current HbA1c value between 7.0% and 12%.

          3. Report no change in diabetes-related medications during the three months prior to
             enrollment.

          4. Be at least 35 years of age.

          5. Have at least 16 natural teeth.

          6. Have moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, defined by loss of clinical attachment
             of &gt;5 mm on two seperate teeth, and no treatment within six months.

          7. Able and willing to comply with study requirements including following instructions on
             study treatment and returning for follow-up visits as required by the protocol

          8. Have full understanding of all elements of, and signature and dating of the written
             informed consent prior to the initiation of protocol specified procedures

          9. Females with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before and
