  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence to conclude that part of the cascade leading to heatstroke is
      related to an inflammatory reaction triggered by the heat stress. The reduced ability to
      sustain heat stress - &quot;heat intolerance&quot; is also attributed to over-expression of
      inflammatory cytokines. Acclimation to heat improves human sustainability to heat and is a
      leading protective factor against heat stroke. The investigators hypothesize that the lower
      stress encountered during the process of acclimation to heat will be reflected by an
      over-ride in the expression of anti-inflammatory over the pro-inflammatory cytokines. This,
      in turn will attenuate the pathological cascade leading to heat stroke.

    <description>Dressed in shorts and tennis shoes the subjects will be exposed to exercise-heat stress for 12 consecutive days (excluding Saturday). Daily exposure will last 120 min, under the controlled environmental conditions of 40oC and 40% relative humidity. The exercise will consist of walking on a treadmill at a pace of 5km/h and 2% incline.</description>
