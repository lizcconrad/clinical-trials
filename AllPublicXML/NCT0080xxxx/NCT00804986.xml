  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, multinational, randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients
      with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Patients with inadequate glycemic control using diet
      and exercise alone, or in combination with metformin, will be enrolled. The primary objective
      of this study is to test the hypothesis that LY2428757 given to patients with T2DM
      inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone, or metformin monotherapy, produces a
      significant decrease in the mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to endpoint at 12 weeks
      as compared to placebo. Trial consists of 12 weeks of double-blind treatment and 4-week
      safety follow-up.

    <measure>Percent of Participants Domain Scores Indicating No Problems on European Quality of Life (EuroQol) at Baseline and Week 12 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL Questionnaire - 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score between 1 and 3 is generated for each domain. For each participant, the outcome rating on the 5 domains will be mapped to a single index through an algorithm. The index ranges between 0 and 1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the participant.</description>

        <title>Change in Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) For Appetite and Satiety From Baseline to Week 12 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The VAS scales for appetite (hunger) and satiety (how full) were recorded on a scale with range of possible scores from 0 to 100 represented in millimeters on a 10 centimeter line. For appetite, participant chooses where they think their appetite lies on a 10 centimeter line between two anchors (0 - not at all hungry and 10 - extremely hungry). For satiety, participant chooses where they think their satiety lies on a 10 centimeter line between two anchors (0 - not at all full and 10 - extremely full).

        <title>Change in Total Glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC) From Baseline to Week 12 Endpoint</title>
        <description>An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was used to assess changes in glucose tolerance. The area under the plasma glucose concentration versus time curve was calculated using the linear-trapezoidal method. Area under the curve (AUC) for glucose represents the area that is under the curve of glucose values when they are plotted over time. Larger AUC values represent a greater average glucose value over time. LSMean adjusted for baseline, treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <description>Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQoL) - Lite Version consists of 31 items from 5 subscales: physical functioning, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work as well as a total score. Individual item scoring ranges from 0 (never true) to 4 (always true) with total score range from 0 to 124. Higher scores on the subscales and total score correspond with lower levels of functioning or greater negative effect. LSMean adjusted for baseline, baseline HbA1c (less than 8.5% versus greater than or equal to 8.5%), metformin use, treatment.</description>

          <description>Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQoL) - Lite Version consists of 31 items from 5 subscales: physical functioning, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work as well as a total score. Individual item scoring ranges from 0 (never true) to 4 (always true) with total score range from 0 to 124. Higher scores on the subscales and total score correspond with lower levels of functioning or greater negative effect. LSMean adjusted for baseline, baseline HbA1c (less than 8.5% versus greater than or equal to 8.5%), metformin use, treatment.</description>

        <description>DSC-R assesses the presence and perceived burden of diabetes-related symptoms using the following subscales: hypoglycemic, hyperglycemic, psychological, cardiovascular, neurological, ophthalmological. Participants evaluate symptoms based on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1=not at all troublesome to 5=extremely troublesome. Higher scores indicated greater severity of symptoms within a domain, or poorer perceived health, respectively. LSMean adjusted for baseline, baseline HbA1c (less than 8.5% versus greater than or equal to 8.5%), metformin use, treatment.</description>

        <description>The EuroQoL Questionnaire – 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score between 1 and 3 is generated for each domain. For each participant, the outcome rating on the 5 domains will be mapped to a single index through an algorithm. The index ranges between 0 and 1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the participant.</description>
