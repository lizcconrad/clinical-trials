  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness of ACTH (H.P. Acthar Gel) on the
      lipid profile and proteinuria in participants with MN. ACTH or adrenocorticotrophin is a
      hormone produced by the pituitary gland (a gland at the base of your brain) that is involved
      in stimulating your adrenal glands to secrete a number of steroid products (e.g. cortisol,
      aldosterone, corticosterone, and others) that are important in keeping you alive. The drug
      used in this study has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine
      clinical use in the treatment of patients with proteinuria and patients with idiopathic
      nephrotic syndrome such as idiopathic MN. However, the most adequate dose to use has not been
      adequately assessed. This is the reason for conducting this research study.
