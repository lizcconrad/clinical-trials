  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test metallic markers in the breast tissue after breast
      conserving surgery and to observe the metallic markers' stability in the breast for use as
      tumor bed markers and positioning devices for radiation treatment.

      In order to validate metallic marker placement and stability, patients will have the internal
      metallic markers placed at the time of their last breast surgery (either lumpectomy or
      re-excision for margins) by the surgeon and are permanent. They will undergo routine 3D
      CT-based treatment planning and will receive routine radiation treatment to the whole breast
      or partial breast as determined by the treating physician. Daily images of the breast will be
      obtained throughout treatment using the online portal imaging system. These images will be
      analyzed for the daily position of the metallic markers and compared across the entire course
      of treatment to determine the stability of metallic markers placement and to assess their
      efficacy as positioning devices for image guided radiation therapy.

    <description>To validate that intraparenchymal metallic markers placed in the breast tissue can be used as stable markers throughout a course of radiation treatment for daily image guided localization. Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) will be deemed feasible if the average shift in marker position results in deviations of up to 7 mm from the initial position.</description>

        Research subjects will be recruited from the clinical practice of the Breast Program
        referred for radiation therapy at Moffitt Cancer Center who meets the eligibility criteria.
        This provides a potential pool of about 450 patients over a 12 month period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed stage 0, I or II bilateral or unilateral breast cancer

          -  Any invasive adenocarcinoma or intraductal carcinoma

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¤ 2

          -  Surgical treatment with lumpectomy (partial mastectomy)

          -  Successful placement of intraparenchymal metallic markers at last breast surgery

          -  Pathologic tumor size &lt; 5.0 cm (Microscopic multifocality is allowed if total
             pathologic tumor size is within 5 cm)

          -  Axillary sampling (sentinel node or axillary dissection) performed for axillary nodal
             staging for all invasive cancers. No axillary sampling is required for ductal
             carcinoma in situ)

          -  Negative margins of excision.

          -  Radiation treatment to begin within 8 weeks after last surgery or last dose of
             chemotherapy

          -  Negative post-biopsy mammogram if presented with mammographically detected
             microcalcifications to ensure removal of suspicious calcifications

          -  History of prior cancers is allowed if patient is without evidence of disease at the
             time of study entry

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

             teratogenic. Women of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception
             (abstinence, hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to and during study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant, she should inform the treating

          -  Stage III or IV breast cancer

          -  Pathologic tumor size &gt;/= 5 cm

          -  Positive or unassessed margins of surgical resection

          -  Diffuse calcifications on mammogram pre- or post-operatively
