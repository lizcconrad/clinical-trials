    <textblock>
      The purpose of this substudy is to obtain CGM data from individuals taking exenatide. The CGM
      measurements gathered before starting and during treatment with exenatide IR and/or exenatide
      LAR will help determine the characteristics of glucose control during treatment.

    <time_frame>2 week periods of time - 3 times during study:</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline CGM will be performed from Visit 2 to Visit 3 for approximately 14 days followed by a second CGM period from Visit 3 to Visit 6 for approximately 17 days. At Week 28, two weeks after Visit 14 (Week 26), subjects will be instructed to begin CGM and to continue through Visit 20 (Week 30) for Group A subjects or Visit 22 (Week 32) for Group B subjects. At Week 50, two weeks after Visit 28 (Week 48), subjects will be instructed to begin the final CGM period and to continue monitoring until the next study visit at Visit 29 (Week 52)</description>
