  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical literature has shown that 1 out of 2 patients that are admitted to the hospital as a
      cardiac patient, will be found suffering from sleep breathing disorders. The medical
      literature also shows that there is an advantage of treating the sleep breathing disorders in
      addition to treating the cardiac disease or evaluating the heart failure condition to provide
      better clinical outcomes.this study is evaluating the ability to detect sleep and cardiac
      related breathing disordered.
