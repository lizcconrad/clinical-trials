  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Duplicate Capillary Results Within +/- 15mg/dL or +/- 20% of Laboratory Glucose Method</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with diabetes (or parents/guardians) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) used a new blood glucose monitoring system (BGMS) with subject capillary blood. BGM results were compared to a lab glucose method - Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. BG results were obtained in duplicate from subjects(158 BG results possible). The number of capillary results within +/- 15mg/dL (for reference blood glucose values &lt;75mg/dL) or +/- 20% (for reference blood glucose values &gt;/= 75mg/dL)of the reference results were calculated.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Duplicate Subject BGM Results Within +/- 15mg/dL or +/- 20% of Healthcare Professional Capillary Results</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Duplicate subject Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) results were compared to healthcare professional (HCP) BGMS results (possible number of results = 292). The number of Subject BGM results within +/- 15mg/dL (for reference BG values &lt;75mg/dL) and within +/- 20% (for reference BG values &gt;= 75mg/dL)of the HCP results was calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numbers of BG Results in Zones of the Parkes Error Grid of Clinical Significance of Inaccuracies</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkes Error Grid, developed from a survey of 100 clinicians, plots combinations of BG meter measurements against reference method results. Each (x,y) point on the grid is within a risk category, assigned by the clinicians surveyed. Risk categories (increasing severity): ZoneA: No effect on clinical action; ZoneB: Altered clinical action or little/no effect on clinical outcome; ZoneC: Altered clinical action likely to effect clinical outcome; ZoneD: Altered clinical action could have significant medical risk; ZoneE: Altered clinical action could have dangerous consequences</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Rated as &lt;=2 (Labeling Comprehension)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects or parents/guardians, as applicable, performed meter tasks after reading the User Guide and Quick Reference Guide. The study staff rated the participants on their success at performing the tasks as follows:
Successful in performing tasks correctly without assistance
Successful after study staff prompted participant to review User Guide.
Successful after study staff assisted subject. (Similar to review of a specific function during a Customer Service call.)
Subject did not perform task correctly and study staff intervention was required.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Within Replicate Coefficient of Variation CV (Precision)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The average Coefficient of Variation (CV) was computed by calculating the square of the CV for each pair of Blood Glucose (BG) self-test results, averaging this square value over the number of subjects included in the analysis, and then taking the square root.</description>

             supervision

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemophilia or any other bleeding disorder

          -  Taking prescription anticoagulants (such as Warfarin or heparin) or has clotting
             problems that may prolong bleeding. Taking Plavix or aspirin daily is not excluded

Risk categories (increasing severity): ZoneA: No effect on clinical action; ZoneB: Altered clinical action or little/no effect on clinical outcome; ZoneC: Altered clinical action likely to effect clinical outcome; ZoneD: Altered clinical action could have significant medical risk; ZoneE: Altered clinical action could have dangerous consequences</description>
