      Primary: To compare the analgesic effect over 12 weeks of topical 2PX in stump pain.

      Secondary: To prospectively measure other efficacy and safety variables of topical 2PX in
      stump pain. Exploratory analyses will be performed to measure efficacy and safety variables
      of topical 2PX in phantom pain

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Lower limb amputation at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Amputation must be
             transtibial, transfemoral or through the knee. For patients with transfemoral
             amputation, the point of amputation must be ≥10 cm from the inguinal region.

          -  Presenting with moderate-to-severe stump pain. For the purpose of this study, the
             following criteria must all apply:

               1. Stump pain commencing post amputation and continues at Visit 1 despite continued
                  use of analgesic medication

               2. Stump pain present on a daily basis

               3. Stump pain intensity as Average stump Pain Intensity (AsPI) ≥40 on 100 mm VAS at
                  Screening

               4. Stump pain intensity at the randomisation visit: Mean (over the 7 day run-in
                  period) AsPI rating ≥40 on a 100 mm VAS.

               5. Pain at the site of the extremity amputation. The pain is located mainly in the
                  stump itself. (Patients with concurrent phantom pain may be enrolled in the
                  study.)

               6. Stump pain persists despite proper healing of the stump

          -  Outpatients, aged 18 years and above

          -  Underlying therapy (e.g., rehabilitation procedures, analgesia, physio-therapy, spinal
             cord stimulation (except for topical or subcutaneous local analgesics)) may be
             continued throughout the duration of the study, if the regimen has been stable during
             the 4 weeks immediately prior to Visit 1. If underlying therapy is continued during
             the study the regimen must be maintained for the duration of the study.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with forefoot amputations alone are excluded from participation.

          -  Patients who have received treatment with any topical or subcutaneously administered
             analgesic agent for stump or phantom pain in the 4 weeks prior to study entry (i.e.
             Visit 1).

          -  Underlying therapy (e.g., rehabilitation procedures, analgesia, physio-therapy, spinal
             cord stimulation) is not permitted if the regimen has not been stable in the 4 weeks
             immediately prior to Visit 1.

          -  After the 7 day run-in phase: patients taking any new or changing the dose of any
             underlying analgesic medication (except for rescue medication as defined in this
             protocol).

          -  Patients with open wounds, burns or other non-intact skin at site(s) of study drug
             administration (unhealed stumps).

          -  Patients with significant discomfort from their prosthesis limiting use of the
             prosthesis. Use of a prosthesis is not a requirement for participation in the study.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential unwilling to use adequate contraception
             measures throughout the duration of the study. For the purpose of this study, adequate
             contraception is defined as:

               -  oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; OR

               -  placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); OR

               -  barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository Note: Male
                  sterilization or abstinence are not acceptable methods of birth control and would
                  preclude enrolment in the study.

        Note: For post-menopausal women: less than 12 months since the last spontaneous menstrual
        bleeding will exclude the patient unless they are willing to utilise acceptable methods of
        contraception for the duration of the study.

          -  Breast-feeding/lactating mothers

          -  Any active malignant disease (except basal cell carcinoma; BCC)

          -  Patients who have previously received 2PX.

          -  Patients requiring concomitant administration of strontium ranelate (Protelos®)

          -  Patients who have received an investigational drug or used an investigational device
             within the 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Patients unable to comply with the study assessments

          -  Patients with documented or suspected current alcohol or drug abuse
