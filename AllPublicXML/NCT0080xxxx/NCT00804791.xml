        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent and HIPAA read, signed and dated before conducting any procedures.

          -  Adult volunteers diagnosed with mild to moderate dry eye. Criteria for diagnosis must
             include 2 of the 3 following characteristics: composite symptom score &gt; or = to 5 on
             modified Schein questionnaire; NaFl TFBUT &lt; or = to 7 seconds in either eye; or NaFl
             corneal staining sum score &gt; or = to 3 (using 0-15 point grading system).

          -  Able and willing to follow study instructions. 4) Best-corrected V.A. of 0.6 logMAR or
             better OU.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of ocular or intraocular surgery in either eye w/i the past 6
             months.

          -  History or evidence of serious ocular trauma in either eye w/i the past 6 months.

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the study medications.

          -  History or evidence of epithelial herpes simplex keratitis, vaccinia, active or recent
             varicella viral disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva and/or eyelids, mycobacterial
             infection of the eye, and/or fungal disease of the eye.

          -  Use of concomitant topical ocular medications during the study period.

          -  Patients using systemic medications that may contribute to dry eye may not be enrolled
             unless they have been on a stable dosing regimen for a minimum of 30 days prior to
             Visit 1, and the dosing regimen must remain stable throughout the study period.

          -  Ocular conditions such as conjunctival infections, iritis, or any other ocular
             condition that may preclude the safe admininstration of the test article.

          -  Individuals unwilling to d/c contact lens wear during the study period. CL wear must
             have been d/c at least one week prior to Visit 1.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study w/i 30 days of entering this
             study.

          -  Additionally, any subject may be declared ineligible for a valid medical reason.
