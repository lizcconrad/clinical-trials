    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Asia. The aim of this observational study is to investigate the
      percentage of patients reaching the treatment target on blood glucose control after treatment
      with either human insulin or insulin analogues in type 2 diabetes subjects inadequately
      controlled with two or more oral antidiabetic drugs in China. Further the safety profiles
      will be evaluated.
