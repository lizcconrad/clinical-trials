  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test whether a new model of collaborative care depression
      treatment adapted to the needs and preferences of low-income, urban mothers with perinatal
      depression and to a pediatric clinic setting increases engagement in and adherence to
      perinatal depression treatment.

      This research project consists of two phases that are designed, in sequence, to adapt
      standard collaborative care depression treatment to the unique needs of low-income depressed
      postpartum women and to the pediatric setting where women will receive the treatment. These
      adaptations, in turn, are designed to improve maternal engagement in and adherence to
      depression treatment, the primary outcomes at this early stage of intervention development.
      Phase I is the initial pilot project in which the model will be developed. We will 1) adapt
      standard collaborative care depression models into the Mother-Infant Treatment Team (MITT)
      intervention and develop a procedure manual based on maternal and provider input, 2) pilot
      the MITT intervention with 10 depressed mothers to test the feasibility of implementing the
      model, and 3) evaluate the experiences of participating mothers and providers to revise and
      finalize MITT processes and procedures.

      Phase II will be an open label trial of MITT to determine whether MITT is associated with
      improved maternal engagement and adherence to depression treatment.

      We will pilot MITT with 10 mothers to determine the feasibility of implementing MITT. We will
      collect recruitment and logistical feasibility measures. We will also determine engagement
      and adherence rates to treatment as well as the effort required to engage women in treatment.

      We will determine mothers' and providers' perceptions of their experiences with MITT and will
      use all of this information to revise the MITT protocol in preparation for Phase II.
