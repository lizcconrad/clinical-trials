  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the use of anidulafungin for the
      treatment of serious Candida infection. It is expected that anidulafungin will be at least as
      safe and as effective as the comparator drug, caspofungin.

    <description>Participants had successful global response if there was clinical response of cure/improvement,microbiological eradication/presumed eradication.Clinical cure:resolution of signs/symptoms (s/s) of Candida infection;no additional systemic/oral antifungal treatment needed.Clinical improvement:significant,but incomplete resolution of s/s of Candida infection;no additional systemic/oral antifungal treatment needed.Microbiological eradication/presumed eradication:baseline pathogen not isolated from original site culture,or culture data not available for participant with successful clinical outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>EOT (Day 14 to 42), 2-week follow-up (2 weeks after EOT), 6-week follow-up (6 weeks after EOT)</time_frame>
    <description>A participant had a successful response if there was clinical response of cure and microbiological success (eradication or presumed eradication). Clinical response of cure: resolution of signs and symptoms attributed to Candida infection; no additional systemic or oral antifungal treatment required to complete the course of therapy. Microbiological eradication or presumed eradication: baseline pathogen not isolated from original site culture, or culture data not available for a participant with successful clinical outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>A participant had a successful clinical response if there was clinical response of cure or improvement. Clinical response of cure: resolution of signs and symptoms attributed to Candida infection; no additional systemic or oral antifungal treatment required to complete the course of therapy. Clinical response of improvement: significant, but incomplete resolution of signs and symptoms of Candida infection; no additional systemic or oral antifungal treatment required.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>2-week follow-up (2 weeks after EOT), 6-week follow-up (6 weeks after EOT)</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse was defined as any baseline Candida sp. isolated following eradication (documented or presumed) or culture data not available for participants with a clinical response of failure after a previous response of success. Prophylactic treatment with oral antifungal agents was not sufficient to document a relapse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With New Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>2-week follow-up (2 weeks after EOT), 6-week follow-up (6 weeks after EOT)</time_frame>
    <description>New Infection: participant presenting with clinical failure with the emergence of new Candida sp. at the original site of infection or at a distant site of infection. Clinical failure: no significant improvement in signs and symptoms, or death due to Candida infection. Participants must have had received at least 3 doses of study drug to be classified as a failure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Negative Blood Culture</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6-week follow-up (6 weeks after EOT)</time_frame>
    <description>Negative blood culture referred to absence of Candida sp. in the blood sample of participants who had a positive blood culture at baseline. Time to negative blood culture (days) was calculated as date of first negative blood culture minus first treatment date plus 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With All-cause Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (Day 14 to 42), After EOT to 2-week follow-up (2 weeks after EOT), After 2-week follow-up to 6-week follow-up (6 weeks after EOT)</time_frame>
    <description>All-cause mortality during study therapy and at follow-up visits reported as unique death at EOT, 2 week follow-up and 6 week follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Death</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6-week follow-up (6 weeks after EOT)</time_frame>
