  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of [18F]-ML-10 to serve as an imaging
      tool for the early detection of response of brain metastases to radiation therapy. Such early
      detection may help early identification of responsive and non-responsive lesions. The
      experimental design of the present study aims to evaluate the potential of PET imaging with
      [18F]-ML-10 to address the currently unmet clinical need for very early (within one
      day)assessment of response to therapy. Currently, response assessment is available only after
      several weeks or months after completion of therapy, when tumor shrinkage can be detected by
      anatomical imaging (by MRI). Early detection of tumor response to treatment is now
      widely-recognized as a highly-desirable goal in oncology, and is respectively the target of
      intense research worldwide. In the future, the option to know early upon treatment
      administration, that the treated tumor is a non-responsive, may improve clinical management
      of patients with brain metastases of solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early assessment of the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy is highly desirable and an unmet need
      in clinical oncology. Currently, treatment efficacy is mostly measured by following tumor
      size by anatomical imaging (CT scan or MRI). However, changes in tumor size may be observed
      only after several weeks to several months after completion of treatment. Meanwhile, in cases
      where there is no response, the patient is unnecessarily exposed to treatment's side effects,
      and precious time may be lost before the initiation of an alternative, potentially more
      beneficial line of therapy. Therefore, there is an urgent and serious need for better tools
      for monitoring of tumor response to anti-cancer treatments.

      To address this need, [18F]-ML-10, a novel small molecular-weight probe (MW 205) was
      developed for clinical detection of apoptosis in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET).
      [18F]-ML-10 is a member of the Aposense family of compounds, a novel class of molecular
      probes for molecular imaging of cell death. The proposed indication for which [18F]-ML-10 is
      being developed is for early assessment of response of solid tumors to radiation and
      chemoradiation therapy.

      Previous preclinical and clinical studies have substantiated the safety of [18F]-ML-10, its
      very high stability in vivo, its favorable biodistribution profile, and its efficacy in
      clinical detection of cell death. In preclinical studies, the selective retention of
      [18F]-ML-10 in the focus of the neurovascular cell death in cerebral ischemia was
      demonstrated in respective animal models. [18F]-ML-10 has been examined in two clinical
      trials in Uppsala Imanet, Sweden, and has been found safe in administration to healthy
      subjects and to elderly subjects with acute ischemic cerebral stroke. In these clinical
      trials, [18F]-ML-10 was also found efficacious in the clinical imaging of apoptosis, being
      either physiological apoptosis as observed in the testes in young healthy males, and
      pathological cell death, as observed in the brains of patients with acute ischemic cerebral
      stroke.

      Additional Phase 2 study demonstrated the suitability and safety of 18F-ML-10, designed to
      serve as a PET radiotracer for early detection of cellular apoptosis of brain metastases in
      response to WBRT. The relationship between the early change in 18F-ML-10 uptake by the tumor,
      observed during or upon completion of treatment, and subsequent tumor shrinkage as observed
      by MRI eight weeks after the completion of WBRT, was demonstrated.18F-ML-10 demonstrated a
      good safety profile with no drug-related AEs or any effect on safety parameters.
