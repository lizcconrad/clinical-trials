      The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness and side effects of desloratadine
      (Aerius) in patients with hayfever. Patients took desloratadine once a day for 15 days. At
      the end of therapy, they scored how severe their hayfever symptoms were and how they
      responded to therapy. Side effects were recorded.

             significant disease (other than SAR) that would interfere with study evaluations.

          -  Subjects must understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and

             &gt;=2, and the non-nasal symptom score must be &gt;=2. Subjects may be rescheduled up two
             additional times for the qualifying visit if they do not meet the minimum symptom
             scores.
