  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the GM-K562/leukemia cell vaccine can
      be safely given soon after allogeneic marrow or blood stem cell transplant. The
      GM-K562/leukemia cell vaccine is composed of a cultured cell line that has been genetically
      modified to secrete GM-CSF, a naturally occuring substance in the body that stimulates the
      immune system. The vaccine is a mixture of the GM-K562 cells (radiated to prevent them from
      growing in the participants body) with the participant's previously frozen and killed
      leukemia cells. By mixing the GM-K562 with the leukemia cells, we would like to study whether
      this vaccine combination will stimulate the participant's new immune system to recognize and
      fight against their MDS/AML cancer cells.

      -  Participants will be given the GM-K562/Leukemia call vaccine as in injection under the
           skin a total of six times. The first 3 vaccines will be given weekly and vaccines 4
           through 6 will be given every other week. Therefore, it is expected that the vaccines
           will be completed over a period of 9 weeks.

        -  During the 9 week vaccination period, participants will have physical exams to monitor
           for any side effects or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Bone marrow biopsies will be
           performed a the time of enrollment for this study, 4 weeks after completion of 6
           GM-K562/Leukemia cell vaccines, and 1 year after the participants transplant.

        -  As a way of testing whether the GM-K562/Leukemia cell vaccine is triggering any immune
           response to the participants leukemia, we will be injecting a small amount of leukemia
           cells (after they are killed with radiation) under the participants skin to see if the
           body will generate a reaction to the leukemia cells. This test is called a leukemia cell
           delayed hypersensitivity test (DTH). This test will be performed three times during the
           study, on the weeks of the 1st vaccine, 5th vaccine and 4 weeks after the 6th vaccine.

        -  There are a total of 5 skin biopsies required as part of this study. Biopsies will be
           taken from the vaccination sites 2-3 days after the first and fifth vaccine. Similar
           biopsies will be taken from the DTH sites after the 1st vaccination, 5th vaccination and
           4-6 weeks after the 6th vaccination.
