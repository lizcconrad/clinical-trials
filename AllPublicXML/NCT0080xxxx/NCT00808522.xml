  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether hCG will result in a decrease in breast
      density.

      High breast density has been associated with an increased risk in breast cancer. It has also
      been shown that decreasing density with a drug called tamoxifen has resulted in a decreased
      risk in breast cancer. The investigators are looking at the effect of hCG on breast density
      in people who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer and our theory postulates
      that through the hormonal actions of hCG and tamoxifen there would be a greater reduction in
      breast density in patients who are treated with hCG and tamoxifen versus patients treated
      with tamoxifen alone. Using this data the investigators will be able to hypothesize that the
      treatment of hCG will result in a reduction in breast cancer rates in the population and thus
      make available another drug which can be used to decrease the rates of breast cancer in the
      population

    <textblock>
      Pregnancy has been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. This has been
      reproduced in multiple studies and has been seen in multiple races.

      People have been evaluating different hormones and practices associated with pregnancy to
      determine what factors reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in these patients. These
      pronounced findings have been evaluated in great detail by multiple scientists and one of the
      hormones which we think might be associated with a reduction in breast cancer is hCG. This
      statement has been backed by multiple studies which have looked at the direct effect of hCG
      on the growth and death of breast cancer cells in the lab and in animal models of breast
      cancer.

      We want to determine if hCG is given to patients who are at increased risk of breast cancer
      will result in an accentuated decrease in breast cancer risk above and beyond the effect
      received by conventional breast cancer reducing protocols. Our final outcome in this study
      will be breast density on mammographic evaluation which is considered a marker for breast
      cancer. So our study will evaluate whether or not hCG will have an effect on the mammographic
      breast density.

      After recruitment there will be two groups in our study an intervention group and non
      intervention group. In the intervention group patients would undergo a period of hCG
      injections which would last a total of 60 days and consist of 30 subcutaneous injections. The
      non intervention group will continue their conventional chemoprevention medication. Both
      groups will be followed for teo years and the images, cytology and blood samples will be sent
      to our labs for evaluation.
