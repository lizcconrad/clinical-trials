    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is a current infection during HIV infection. After infectious contact, some
      patients will develop tuberculosis some will only be infected without symptoms, they have
      Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) which can reactivate later.In order to prevent this
      tuberculosis reactivation, LTBI diagnosis screening is preconised in HIV-infected patients.
      This diagnosis is made till now by the tuberculin skin test (TST) but this test is not
      specific of TB. New blood tests (QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB) specific po MTB infection are now sold
      but have not been evaluated in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the evaluation of the theoretic therapeutic impact of
      the use of IGRAS for diagnosis of LTBI in HIV-infected patients

      Principal outcome:

      -Theoretic therapeutic impact evaluation of the use of IGRAS for diagnosis of LTBI in
      HIV-infected patients .

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Medico-economic impact of replacement of TST by IGRAs in LTBI screening in HIV infected
           patients.

        -  Concordance of IGRAs results with TST

        -  Concordance between IGRAs.

        -  Concordance between IGRAs in accordance to CD4 number(&lt; 100, 100 à 200, 200 à 300, &gt; à
           300/mm3).

        -  LTBI prevalence in the study group.

        -  Effective consequences of tests results on therapeutic outcome of the patients LTBI
           criteria and therapeutic recommendations

        -  One or 2 positive IGRAs test: LTBI recommended to be LTBI

        -  1 negative IGRAs test and one undetermined : no LTBI

        -  2 undetermined:

        -  No clinical risk and negative TST: no diagnosis, eventually new test at 3 months or
           after HAART onset.

        -  Clinical risk or TST&gt; 10mm: LTBI recommended to be treated. Therapeutic outcome
           evaluation Effective consequences of IGRA's result on patients outcome at 6 months.

      Analyzed criteria:

      Therapeutic impact:

        -  Patients percentage with different therapeutic outcome based on usual recommendations

        -  Medico-economic impact

        -  Medico-economic impact of both tests as early and late cost - efficacy

        -  Statistics

      Primary criteria:

        -  Percentage of patients for whom therapeutic would have been changed by IGRAs results
           compared to usual diagnosis strategy.

      Secondary criteria:

        -  Concordance of IGRAs with TST

        -  Concordance between both IGRAs.

        -  Taille: 1000 patients

      Timing:

      -inclusions: 2 years
