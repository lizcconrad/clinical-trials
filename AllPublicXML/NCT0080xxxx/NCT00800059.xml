  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that conformal radiation will allow the administration of
      higher doses of external beam radiation to marrow based malignancies than total body
      irradiation (TBI)without increasing the toxicity to normal tissues beyond that induced by
      TBI. Further,the investigators hypothesize that this will result in an improvement in disease
      response and disease control for patients with multiple myeloma. This is a dose escalation
      study of TMI with the primary objective of determining the maximum tolerated dose of TMI when
      followed by aHSCT in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
