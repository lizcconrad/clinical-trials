      This randomized phase III trial studies pelvic radiation therapy to see how well it works
      compared with vaginal implant radiation therapy, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in treating
      patients with high-risk stage I or stage II endometrial cancer. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Implant radiation therapy uses radioactive material
      placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It
      is not yet known whether pelvic radiation therapy alone is more effective than vaginal
      implant radiation therapy, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in treating patients with endometrial
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if treatment with vaginal cuff brachytherapy followed by three cycles of
      chemotherapy reduces the rate of recurrence or death (i.e. increases recurrence-free
      survival) when compared to pelvic radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare survival between the two treatment groups. II. To compare patterns of failure
      between the two treatment groups. III. To compare physical functioning, fatigue and
      neurotoxicity between the two treatment groups.

      IV. To examine associations between primary comorbid illnesses and obesity on survival,
      fatigue and physical functioning.

      V. To evaluate the psychometric properties (such as construct validity, reliability,
      sensitivity to treatment and responsiveness over time) of the Patient-Reported-Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Short form 1, and to evaluate fatigue
      measurement equivalence between women with endometrial cancer and age-matched women from the
      general United States (US) population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of gene expression signatures in early stage endometrial cancer to
      predict recurrence and to explore the association between gene expression signatures in early
      stage endometrial cancer and clinical characteristics and outcome.

      II. To bank whole blood specimens for future research.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo conventional or intensity-modulated pelvic radiation therapy once
      daily, 5 days a week, for 5-6 weeks (total of 25-28 fractions) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stage II disease or stage I disease with
      a confirmed diagnosis of clear cell and/or papillary serous histology may also undergo 1 or 2
      intravaginal (i.e., vaginal cuff) brachytherapy boost treatments.

      ARM II: Patients undergo vaginal cuff brachytherapy comprising 3-5 high-dose rate
      brachytherapy treatments over approximately 2 weeks or 1 or 2 low-dose rate brachytherapy
      treatments over 1-2 days. Beginning within 3 weeks after initiating brachytherapy, patients
      receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on
      day 1. Chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter for up to 5 years.

    <description>Patient reported fatigue as measured with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue). The FACIT-Fatigue contains 13 items. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For the negative items, reversal was performed prior to score calculation. According to the FACIT measurement system, the Fatigue score was the summation of the individual item scores if more than 50% of subscale items were answered. When unanswered items existed, a subscale score was prorated by multiplying the mean of the answered item scores by the number of items in the scale. The FACIT-Fatigue score ranges 0-52 with a large score suggests less fatigue.</description>

    <description>Patient reported quality of life as measured with the Treatment Outcome Index of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for endometrial cancer (FACT-En TOI). The FACT-En TOI is a scale for assessing general QOL of endometrial cancer patients. It consists of three subscales: Physical Well Being (7 items), Functional Well Being (7 items), and Endometrium Cancer subscale (16 items). Each item in the FACT-En TOI was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). . The FACT-En TOI score is calculated as the sum of the subscale scores if more than 80% of the FACT-En TOI items provide valid answers and all of the component subscales have valid scores. The FACT-En TOI score ranges 0-120 with a large score suggests better QOL</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be considered eligible to participate in this trial, all patients must have
             undergone hysterectomy; bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (open or laparoscopic
             approach) is strongly encouraged

          -  Peritoneal cytology should be obtained on entering the peritoneal cavity, as described
             in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Surgical Procedures Manual
             (https://gogmember.gog.org/manuals/pdf/surgman.pdf); pelvic and para-aortic
             lymphadenectomy are optional, but strongly encouraged (as staged patients enrolled on
             GOG-0210-molecular markers in endometrial carcinoma are eligible for this study)

               -  The procedures may be performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy (including
                  robot-assisted) as per the surgeon's preference; the surgeon must record in the
                  operative report whether a lymphadenectomy was performed (see link above to
                  Surgical Procedures Manual) or not; a specific number of lymph nodes removed will
                  not be utilized for eligibility, but the operative report should reflect that the
                  procedure performed was consistent with the procedures described in the GOG
                  Surgical Manual

          -  If either a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or nodal dissection was not performed,
             post-operative pre-treatment computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             is required and must not demonstrate evidence suggestive of metastatic disease
             (adnexa, nodes, intraperitoneal disease); post-operative, pre-treatment CT/MRI must be

        <title>Patient Reported Fatigue</title>
        <description>Patient reported fatigue as measured with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue). The FACIT-Fatigue contains 13 items. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For the negative items, reversal was performed prior to score calculation. According to the FACIT measurement system, the Fatigue score was the summation of the individual item scores if more than 50% of subscale items were answered. When unanswered items existed, a subscale score was prorated by multiplying the mean of the answered item scores by the number of items in the scale. The FACIT-Fatigue score ranges 0-52 with a large score suggests less fatigue.</description>
