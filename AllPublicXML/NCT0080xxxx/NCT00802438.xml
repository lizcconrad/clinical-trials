      A drug (mepolizumab) that reduces allergic inflammation will affect the function of allergy
      cells called eosinophils which are produced by the body in response to allergen exposure.

    <measure>The Primary Endpoint of the Study is the Percent of Eosinophils in the Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid After Segmental Allergen Challenge, Before and After Mepolizumab Administration (Bronchoscopy #2 vs. Bronchoscopy #4).</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after up to 3 months of Mepo.</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of eosinophils was determined in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected from the participant after segmental allergen challenge. This was done via differential cell count using Hema-3 stain. Cell differentials were determined by counting a total of 1000 cells on two cytospin preparations. The percent eosinophils were done before and after administration of mepolizumab for a specified amount of time (up to 3 months of administration).</description>

    <measure>Effect of Mepolizumab on Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid Concentrations of IL-5 Cytokine Before and After Mepolizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after up to 3 months of Mepo</time_frame>
    <description>IL-5 was measured via ELISA on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid before and after mepolizumab administration (up to 3 months of administration). Fluid was prepared in LowCross-Buffer to minimize potential matrix effects. A 1/2 dilution of 1X bronchoalveolar fluid was used for IL-5 detection. Data are expressed as pg/mL and are extrapolated to 1X.</description>

             breath, wheeze or chest tightness,

          -  positive skin-prick test to a House Dust Mite extract,

          -  Forced expiratory volume at one second &gt;70% predicted pre-albuterol, &gt; 80% predicted
             post albuterol

          -  &gt;12% increase in Forced expiratory volume at one second following inhaled albuterol
             (180 Âµg) and/or

          -  airway responsiveness to methacholine (PC20 &lt;8mg/ml).

          -  &gt; 20% immediate drop in FEV1 following inhaled antigen challenge.

          -  Safety laboratory assessments within normal ranges (labs to include complete blood

             count)

             (urine HCG) within 48 hours of the methacholine challenge at Visit 2 and agree to use
             a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study (reliable methods of

             contraceptives or skin absorption contraceptives).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, capable and willing to grant written informed
             consent and cooperate with study procedures and requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors within 1 month of
             screening.

          -  Treatment with Omalizumab (anti-IgE) within 9 months of screening visit

          -  Concomitant use of any other monoclonal antibody

          -  Respiratory infection within 4 weeks of study

          -  Unstable asthma as indicated by self-report of increased symptoms or increased
             beta-agonist use over the previous 2 weeks.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, nursing or have a pregnancy planned during the
             course of study

          -  Current smokers (defined as smoked within the last year) or a former smoker with a
             history of &gt;5 pack years.

          -  Major health problems such as heart disease, type I and II diabetes or lung diseases
             other than asthma. Decisions regarding this criteria will be based upon the judgment
             of the investigator.

          -  Previous malignancy.

          -  Medication other than for asthma, allergies or contraception and that the investigator
             feels may interfere with the conduct of study (e.g. monoamine oxidase inhibitors and
             B-adrenergic antagonists in any form)

          -  Known history of allergic reaction to previous antibody administration.

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody,

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days of entering the study,

          -  History of noncompliance with medical regimens or subjects who are considered
             unreliable.

      <recruitment_details>The recruitment period lasted two years (July 2008 through November 2010. Participants were recruited from our Recruitment Database, through local advertisements and the local allergy/asthma clinics.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After a participant signs a consent form, he/she goes through an extensive screening process that includes 4 research visits to the clinic before being assigned to their treatment. The inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study was long and many subjects screen failed prior to being assigned to a treatment.</pre_assignment_details>
