      This study will use an open-label design to evaluate the safety of NP101. Adult subjects who
      meet the enrollment criteria will be treated with NP101 (sumatriptan succinate iontophoretic
      transdermal patch) for acute migraine attacks over a 12 month period.

      <population>Patients were asked to use study patches to treat migraine episodes with mild to severe headache pain for up to 12 months. The safety population included all subjects who applied at least one NP101 patch.
