    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if cytokines, inflammatory mediators, are increased
      in spinal fluid and blood, correlate with disease activity, and could serve as biomarkers or
      therapeutic targets in children with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS), an autoimmune
      complication of the tumor neuroblastoma.

    <textblock>
      In this translational research, immunological mechanisms that underlie the assault of the
      immune system on the brain in paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) are under
      evaluation. To test our principal hypothesis that there is an imbalance of pro-inflammatory
      (Th1) and anti-inflammatory (Th2) cytokines in OMS, a comprehensive cytokine panel will be
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplexed fluorescent bead-based
      immunoassay detection (LUMINEX 100 Lab MAP system)in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
      400 children. To test the second hypothesis that cytokines could serve as biomarkers of
      disease activity in OMS, cytokine concentrations will be correlated with clinical variables,
      such as disease severity, OMS duration, prior relapses, and remissions, as well as
      immunological variables, such as lymphocyte subset analysis. The cytokine 'biomarker profile'
      could aid decision making for early intervention by identifying children at high risk for
      relapse and poor outcome and allow targeting of the most implicated inflammatory cytokines by
      cytokine therapies. To test our third hypothesis that lack of response to immunotherapy is
      due in part to failure to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines, we will
      make paired pre/post comparisons of the impact of immunotherapies given in the course of
      clinical care [steroids, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg),
      rituximab, chemotherapy, other drugs, combinations] on the cytokine and clinical profile.
      This research could lead to the application of commercially-available cytokines and cytokine
      blockers or to the development of new ones for OMS.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Pediatric case-controls</arm_group_label>
    <description>These are children who underwent lumbar puncture and blood drawing for diagnostic testing for non-inflammatory neurological or non-neurological disorders, and whose samples were retrieved from the clinical lab under a linked Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Pediatric OMS</arm_group_label>
    <description>These are patients treated by the P.I. based on clinical decision making, not a clinical trial (this is an observational study). The types of treatments are varied, and, on the initial evaluation, the patients may be untreated or already tried on various immunotherapies. They range from monotherapy with steroids, ACTH, or IVIg, to disease modifying agents, such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and other chemotherapy, typically adjunctively or as combination therapy.</description>
