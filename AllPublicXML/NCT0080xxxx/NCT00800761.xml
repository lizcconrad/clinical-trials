  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial iron overload is the leading cause of death in patients with beta-thalassemia
      major (TM). Therapy with deferoxamine (DFO) combined with deferiprone (DFP) reduces
      myocardial iron and improves cardiac function. However, the prognosis for TM patients with
      established cardiac disease switched from DFO monotherapy to combined DFP/DFO chelation is
      unknown. Twenty-eight TM patients with cardiac disease were enrolled in a prospective study
      lasting 42Â±6 months. Fifteen (9 high-ferritin and 6 low-ferritin) were placed on DFP/DFO
      (DFP, 75 mg/kg t.i.d.; DFO, 40-50 mg/kg over 8-12 h at night 5-7 d/wk), while 13 (5 high- and
      8 low-ferritin) received DFO alone. No cardiac events were observed among high-ferritin
      patients on combination therapy, whereas 4 cardiac events (p=0.0049), including three deaths,
      occurred in high-ferritin patients on DFO monotherapy. These findings demonstrate that in TM
      patients with well-established cardiac disease combined iron-chelation therapy with DFP/DFO
      is superior to DFO monotherapy.
