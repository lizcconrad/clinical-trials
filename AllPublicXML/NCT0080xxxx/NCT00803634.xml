  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV)
      clevidipine as compared with standard of care IV antihypertensive agents for blood pressure
      (BP) lowering in patients with acute heart failure and elevated BP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was an open-label randomized efficacy and safety pilot trial in patients with
      acute heart failure (AHF) and hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥160 mm Hg)
      requiring parenteral antihypertensive therapy. Eligible patients were randomized to receive
      clevidipine or standard of care (SOC) intravenous antihypertensive treatment in an open-label
      manner in a ratio of 1:1. At the time of randomization, a patient-specific, prespecified SBP
      target range was determined and be recorded, prior to study drug treatment. Information on
      the dosing regimen, use of additional or alternative agents and transition to oral therapy if
      needed is detailed in the study 'ARM' and 'INTERVENTION' sections.

      A Data Safety Monitoring Board was utilized periodically throughout the study to monitor the
      safety of patients. Adverse events were assessed for 7 days post-study randomization or
      hospital discharge, whichever occured first. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed for
      30 days following study randomization. Subjects were contacted by telephone or in person up
      to 5 days after their 30-day time point to determine if any SAEs occurred following study
      drug treatment and to follow up on the Heath Economic assessments.

    <measure>Time to First Achieve Initial Prespecified SBP Target Range and 15% Reduction From Baseline Within First 30 Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Initiation of study drug through the initial 30-minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first achieve the initial pre-specified systolic blood pressure (SBP) target range and a 15% SBP reduction from baseline is the time in minutes between the initiation of study medication and the time the patient first achieved both components. Median time was estimated using Kaplan Meier method. 95% two-sided confidence interval of the median time is from 'Simon and Lee, 1982'. If patients did not reach both components within 30 minutes from the initial treatment with study medication, or another antihypertensive agent was administered, the patient was censored at 30 minutes or the time when another antihypertensive agent is given, whichever came first.</description>

    <measure>SBP Area Under the Curve (AUC) Outside Prespecified Target Range</measure>
    <time_frame>Initiation of study drug through end of monotherapy (up to 96 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The magnitude and duration of SBP excursions was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) for each patient, using the trapezoidal rule, related to time (in minutes) that each patient's SBP was outside the target range. AUC was determined based on data collected from the initiation of study medication through the end of monotherapy treatment up to 96 hours, normalized per hour, and expressed as mmHg × minute/hour.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Falling Below Lower Limit of SBP Target Range Within First 30 Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Initiation of study drug through the initial 30-minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients in whom the SBP fell below the lower limit of the prespecified target range at any time during the first 30 minutes was calculated within each treatment group using the number of mITT patients achieving the endpoint divided by the number of mITT patients and multiplied by 100. Two-tailed 95% CIs were computed for these percentages.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dyspnea (Measured By VAS) at Each Time Point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (immediately prior to study drug administration) through 1 hour after study drug termination</time_frame>
    <description>A validated visual analog scale (VAS) with a horizontal ruler showing increments from 0 to 100 mm with 0 = Best and 100 = Worst was used. The test was asked from the patient's perspective and had to be administered with patient sitting. Relative change in VAS from baseline is the value at each time point minus the baseline value. Relative change from baseline was summarized descriptively (with associated two-tailed 95% CIs of the mean values) at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and at 1, 2, 3 hours and 12 hours, and 1 hour post termination of study drug treatment.</description>

    <measure>Time to Use Other IV Antihypertensives During the Study Drug Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Initiation of study drug through any other concomitant IV antihypertensive agent administered, up to 96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The length of time to use other IV antihypertensive agents was defined as the duration in hours from the initiation of study drug through the time when any other concomitant IV antihypertensive agent was administered, thus, representing the time period without use of any other concomitant IV antihypertensive agent. Median time to use other IV antihypertensive agents was obtained using Kaplan-Meier method. If a patient did not receive any concomitant IV antihypertensive during the 96-hour treatment period, this patient was considered censored at 96 hours. If study drug was stopped less than 96 hours and the patient has no concomitant IV antihypertensive agent, the patient was considered censored when study drug was stopped.</description>

    <description>Clevidipine (0.5 mg/mL in 20% lipid emulsion) was administered intravenously via a single dedicated line to all patients randomized to the clevidipine arm. Clevidipine was infused at an initial rate of 2 mg/h for the first 3 minutes. If blood pressure was not in the target range at 3 minutes, clevidipine was titrated to effect thereafter by doubling the dose every 3 min, per physician discretion and as tolerated by the patient until the desired effect until the SBP target range was attained. Once target range was achieved, the infusion rate could be increased or decreased as needed to maintain blood pressure for minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum duration of 96 hours. The minimum infusion rate was 1 mg/h and maximum infusion rate was 32 mg/h.</description>

    <description>SOC IV antihypertensive agent will be administered for a minimum of 30 min and, if medically warranted, may continue beyond 96 hours at the investigator's discretion. As with clevidipine, the SOC agent was to be administered continuously as monotherapy during the first 30 minutes. Use of an alternative agent(s) was discouraged and was limited to where medically necessary to maintain patient safety. Higher dose titration rates were required to be attempted prior to making the decision to switch to or add on an alternative antihypertensive agent(s). Patients who received an alternative antihypertensive agent with SOC were allowed to continue in the study. If transition to an oral antihypertensive agent was required, it was to be administered per institutional practice.</description>

The minimum infusion rate was 1 mg/h and maximum infusion rate was 32 mg/h.</description>

          <description>The selection of the standard of care (SOC) IV antihypertensive treatment agent was at the discretion of the investigator. The infusion was administered per the institution's treatment practice. Dose titrations were to be performed to the maximum allowed or tolerated dose in order to achieve SBP control within the patient-specified SBP target range within the first 30 minutes. SOC was to be administered for a minimum of 30 minutes and, if medically warranted, could continue beyond 96 hours at the investigator's discretion.</description>

        <description>Time to first achieve the initial pre-specified systolic blood pressure (SBP) target range and a 15% SBP reduction from baseline is the time in minutes between the initiation of study medication and the time the patient first achieved both components. Median time was estimated using Kaplan Meier method. 95% two-sided confidence interval of the median time is from 'Simon and Lee, 1982'. If patients did not reach both components within 30 minutes from the initial treatment with study medication, or another antihypertensive agent was administered, the patient was censored at 30 minutes or the time when another antihypertensive agent is given, whichever came first.</description>

Median time was estimated using Kaplan Meier method. 95% two-sided confidence interval of the median time is from 'Simon and Lee, 1982'. If patients did not reach both components within 30 minutes from the initial treatment with study medication, or another antihypertensive agent was administered, the patient was censored at 30 minutes or the time when another antihypertensive agent is given, whichever came first.</description>

            <description>The selection of the standard of care (SOC) IV antihypertensive treatment agent was at the discretion of the investigator. The infusion was administered per the institution's treatment practice. Dose titrations were to be performed to the maximum allowed or tolerated dose in order to achieve SBP control within the patient-specified SBP target range within the first 30 minutes. SOC was to be administered for a minimum of 30 minutes and, if medically warranted, could continue beyond 96 hours at the investigator's discretion.</description>
