    <measure>Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) is psychometrically and clinically valid and reliable clinician-administered instrument used to assess the severity of RLS. It assesses RLS symptom severity and impact on daily living and is comprised of 10 items, scored on 0 to 4 scale, where lower score indicates lower symptom severity/impact on living. Two subscale scores are symptom severity (6 items) ranging from 0-24 (lower score indicates lower symptom severity) and impact on daily living (3 items) ranging from 0-12 (lower score indicates lower impact on living). Item 3 is unrelated to the other items. The global score is calculated from all 10 items, range from 0 to 40, where lower scores reflect lower severity and better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Augmentation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Augmentation was worsening of RLS symptoms, attributable to a specific long-term therapeutic intervention for RLS. Percentage of participants with augmentation was evaluated by centralized evaluation board using a set of assessment criteria for potential augmentation which included structured interview for diagnosis of augmentation during RLS treatment (SIDA-RLS), augmentation severity rating scale (ASRS), clinical judgment. ASRS measures severity of augmentation and consist of three items to be completed by clinician. Clinician would score participants' answers by comparing post-baseline evaluations to those at baseline. ASRS total score range: 0-24, with higher score indicating more severe augmentation.</description>

        <title>Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Symptom Severity</title>
        <description>International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) is psychometrically and clinically valid and reliable clinician-administered instrument used to assess the severity of RLS. It assesses RLS symptom severity and impact on daily living and is comprised of 10 items, scored on 0 to 4 scale, where lower score indicates lower symptom severity/impact on living. Two subscale scores are symptom severity (6 items) ranging from 0-24 (lower score indicates lower symptom severity) and impact on daily living (3 items) ranging from 0-12 (lower score indicates lower impact on living). Item 3 is unrelated to the other items. The global score is calculated from all 10 items, range from 0 to 40, where lower scores reflect lower severity and better quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
        <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least one post-randomization efficacy assessment on any efficacy scale. Here, the 'N' (number of participants analyzed) is signifying those participants who were evaluable for this measure for each group respectively.</population>

          <description>International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) is psychometrically and clinically valid and reliable clinician-administered instrument used to assess the severity of RLS. It assesses RLS symptom severity and impact on daily living and is comprised of 10 items, scored on 0 to 4 scale, where lower score indicates lower symptom severity/impact on living. Two subscale scores are symptom severity (6 items) ranging from 0-24 (lower score indicates lower symptom severity) and impact on daily living (3 items) ranging from 0-12 (lower score indicates lower impact on living). Item 3 is unrelated to the other items. The global score is calculated from all 10 items, range from 0 to 40, where lower scores reflect lower severity and better quality of life.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least one post-randomization efficacy assessment on any efficacy scale. Here, the 'N' (number of participants analyzed) is signifying those participants who were evaluable for this measure for each group respectively.</population>

        <description>Augmentation was worsening of RLS symptoms, attributable to a specific long-term therapeutic intervention for RLS. Percentage of participants with augmentation was evaluated by centralized evaluation board using a set of assessment criteria for potential augmentation which included structured interview for diagnosis of augmentation during RLS treatment (SIDA-RLS), augmentation severity rating scale (ASRS), clinical judgment. ASRS measures severity of augmentation and consist of three items to be completed by clinician. Clinician would score participants’ answers by comparing post-baseline evaluations to those at baseline. ASRS total score range: 0-24, with higher score indicating more severe augmentation.</description>

It is used to measure sleep quantity and quality and is comprised of 5 items yielding 5 subscale scores: latency (1 item), hours of sleep (1 item), number of awakenings (1 item), total WASO (1 item), quality of sleep (1 item). WASO is time spent awake from sleep onset to final awakening. Total WASO subscale (in minutes): numerical rating completed by the participant 30 minutes after waking; recall period is the night before. Total WASO subscale score ranges from 0-1440 minutes.

        <description>SSQ: Participant-rated instrument used to assess previous night’s sleep profile. It is used to measure sleep quantity and quality and is comprised of 5 items yielding 5 subscale scores: latency (1 item), hours of sleep (1 item), number of awakenings (1 item), total WASO (1 item), quality of sleep (1 item). Latency subscale (in minutes): numerical rating completed by the participant 30 minutes after waking; recall period is the night before. Latency subscale score ranges from 0-840 minutes. Lower value indicates better sleep.</description>

        <description>SSQ: Participant-rated instrument used to assess previous night’s sleep profile. It is used to measure sleep quantity and quality and is comprised of 5 items yielding 5 subscale scores: latency (1 item), hours of sleep (1 item), number of awakenings (1 item), total WASO (1 item), quality of sleep (1 item). Quality of sleep subscale: numerical rating completed by the participant 30 minutes after waking; recall period is the night before. Quality of sleep subscale score ranges from 0-100. Higher score indicates better quality of sleep.</description>

        <description>The RLS-NDI is a participant-rated instrument designed to assess daytime performance as related to RLS and the participant’s previous night’s sleep. The instrument consists of 14 items that encompass 5 domains: tiredness; emotional functioning; social functioning; cognitive functioning; and activities of daily living. There is also 1 global item assessing overall well -being. Each item is scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Total score is the sum of scores from question 1 to 14. The total score ranges from 0 to 140 where higher scores indicate a more severe impact.</description>

          <description>MOS-SS: Participant rated instrument to assess sleep quantity, quality; comprised of 12 items yielding 7 subscale scores: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakening short of breath/ headache, sleep adequacy, somnolence, sleep quantity, optimal sleep, 2 composite index scores: sleep problems Index I, II. Optimal sleep subscale scores range: 0-1; Optimal sleep = 1 if 'Average hours sleep' = 7 or 8, is 0 if 'Average hours sleep' is non-missing and less than 7, and is missing if 'Average hours sleep' is missing. Higher scores reflect better sleep outcomes.</description>

        <title>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) at Week 12</title>
        <description>WPAI: 6 question participant rated questionnaire to determine degree to which SHP affected work productivity while at work and outside of work. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), overall work impairment score combining absenteeism and presenteeism, percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Score range: 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 10 (completely affected/impaired). WPAI outcomes expressed as impairment percentages with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
