      This is a prospective study including patients presenting in aggregate primary lesions
      affected by nodular BCC of the eyelid (all subjects were submitted to incisional biopsy at 2
      mm punch) at the commencement of this study. All were submitted to a local treatment with
      Imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara ®), once daily, 5 days per week for 8-16 weeks (average). All
      subjects were submitted to a new incisional biopsy at 2 mm punch, after 12 weeks of
      treatment, and all of them were monitored monthly up to now.If positive biopsy (residue
      tumor) cases will managed with surgery.
