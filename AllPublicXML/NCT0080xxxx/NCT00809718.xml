      The aim of this study is to study the effect of rifapentine on plasma concentrations of
      raltegravir.

    <textblock>
      Primary Objective

      To compare the pharmacokinetics parameter values (geometric mean Cmin and AUC) of raltegravir
      at 400 mg q12h alone to raltegravir at 400 mg q12h co-administered in combination with
      rifapentine 900 mg once weekly, and to raltegravir at 400 mg q12h co-administered in
      combination with rifapentine 600 mg per day, 5 days per week.

      Secondary Objective

      To assess the tolerability and safety of concomitant administration of raltegravir and
      rifapentine in healthy volunteers.

      Design

      This study is a three-period, one-sequence, open label, pharmacokinetic study of the
      raltegravir-rifapentine interactions in healthy, male and female volunteers. Up to 21
      subjects may be enrolled to achieve the estimated sample size of 16 completing subjects. All
      study medication will be self-administered except on the days of pharmacokinetic sampling.
      All subjects will participate in three sampling periods and be studied in a day clinic or be
      admitted overnight to a hospital.

             hospital on three occasions.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to practice an adequate method of birth
             control during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication.
             Barrier methods of contraception or abstinence from sexual activity are satisfactory
             methods of birth control.

          -  Karnofsky score â‰¥ 90.

               -  Hematocrit &gt; 30 percent (most recent value)

               -  AST &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal

               -  ALT &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal

               -  Bilirubin &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          -  Use of a medication or food that has the potential to alter the concentrations of
             raltegravir or rifapentine, within the 14 days prior to or during the periods of
             pharmacokinetic monitoring.

          -  Known intolerance to raltegravir or rifamycin antibiotics or prior use in the last 30
             days.
