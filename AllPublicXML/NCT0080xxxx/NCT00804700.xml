      The purpose of the study is to compare two different methods of listening to music while
      performing aerobic exercise: synchronous music listening vs. asynchronous music listening.
      Synchronous music listening while exercising is a learned activity where the participant
      moves his or her body in synchrony with the beat of the music, similar to dancing or to
      participating in a group exercise (aerobics) class. Our hypothesis is that synchronous music
      listening reduces the level of perceived exertion to the exercise and motivates the subject
      to exercise more often. This study randomly assigns 46 subjects, age 20-55 years old to
      either a control group of listening to their own favorite music in an asynchronous fashion or
      to an intervention group of listening to prepared music in a synchronous fashion over a six
      week period.

    <description>Subjects will be given a 60 minute lecture on the benefits of regular exercise and how music can enhance the exercise experience. Subjects will be individually instructed how to use the Precor elliptical trainer at the Yates fitness center while listening to music. Subjects are instructed to exercise using the elliptical trainer for periods of 45 -55 minutes at a time as frequently as they like with a minimum frequency of once per week. Subjects will also be encouraged to exercise regularly by walking, jogging or engaging in other forms of physical activity during the intervention period. A fitness attendant will be on hand to supervise their exercise activity, but will not give specific advice how to exercise, other than to make sure they are exercising safely.</description>
