  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are usually used in AMI patients due to its strong anti-lipidemic effect, pleiotropic
      effect and tolerable safety profiles. Generally AMI patients are prescribed many drugs
      concomitantly; there are some risks due to the drug interaction. Especially, statins are
      reported to have many drug interactions, these might influence to therapeutic prognosis and
      safety in AMI patients.

      This study is conducted to administer the non-CYP3A4 metabolized statin, pitavastatin to AMI
      patients over 1 year, and the results will be compared with the other results from the KAMIR
      study which is expected to the large scale of AMI patients using statins be enrolled.
      Finally, from that comparison, we will investigate the influence of the statins metabolism by
      CYP3A4 to the therapeutic prognosis like death, major adverse cardiac events(MACE), and major
      ADR of statins like CK increase, myalgia.
