  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and bad, of two ways to treat
      patients with standard-risk symptomatic multiple myeloma. Patients with standard-risk myeloma
      have myeloma with specific features: levels of 2 blood tests have to be in a specific range
      and there can be no myeloma tumors found outside of the bones or bone marrow, the areas where
      myeloma is usually discovered. In past clinical studies, patients with standard-risk myeloma
      have done well with intensive therapy in the form of stem cell transplant. But multiple
      myeloma is not curable and, although it may respond to standard treatments including stem
      cell transplant, myeloma always recurs.

             sexual contact with females of child bearing potential even if they have had a
             successful vasectomy. See Appendix C: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing
             Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods.

             of the cervix, or presence of myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disease. Patients
             with prior malignancies with a disease-free interval of ≥ 5 years are eligible.

          -  Patients who have had prior malignancies within the past 5 years but are considered to
             be &quot;cured&quot; with a low likelihood of recurrence may be eligible at the discretion of
