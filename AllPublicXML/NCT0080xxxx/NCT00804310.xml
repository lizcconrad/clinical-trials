      RATIONALE: Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving lapatinib together with ixabepilone may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lapatinib given
      together with ixabepilone in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and feasibility of lapatinib ditosylate in combination with
           ixabepilone in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To assess, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To perform laboratory correlative studies on tissue and blood specimens from these
           patients to investigate potential predictors of response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-28 and ixabepilone IV on days
      1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Archival tumor tissue samples are collected for EGFR/HER2 pathway analyses via
      immunohistochemistry, mRNA analysis via RT-PCR, EGFR mutation analyses, Kras and braf
      mutation analysis via sequencing, and RAS mutations via PCR and sequencing. Blood samples are
      also collected periodically for tumor DNA and proteomics, acetylated alpha-tubulin analysis,
      EGFR-HER2 pathway genotypes, and pharmacogenomics.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.

    <description>This intravenous treatment will be performed on an outpatient basis. Ixabepilone (15 - 20mg/m2) will be given weekly for 3 weeks, then one week off, every 28 days (4 weeks). The study doctor will decide how long to keep the participant on this treatment based on how the participant is tolerating the drug and how it is affecting the tumor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have cytologically or histologically proven advanced solid tumors for
             which there is no known standard therapy available or are not eligible for standard
             therapy because of their performance status, or have progressed after standard
             therapy.

          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older

             compliance with study requirements, will be excluded.

          -  History of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications.

          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation, or prior surgical procedures affecting absorption.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with lapatinib. Appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy
             when indicated.

          -  Patients requiring oral anticoagulants are eligible provided there is appropriate
             close INR monitoring in place.
