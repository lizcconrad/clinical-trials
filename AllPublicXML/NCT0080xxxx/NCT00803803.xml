    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation, in which pilocarpine was given in repeated doses, was to
      evaluate: Part I - the effects of different concentrations of pilocarpine hydrochloride on
      intraocular pressure. Part II -the effects on intraocular pressure of glaucomatous patients
      to pilocarpine 2% when given once, twice and four daily. In addition, we studied various
      attributes of the eye which may serve as indicators of responsiveness of individual patients
      to pilocarpine.

    <description>Varying concentration 0.5 to 8% - 22 patients were examined regarding: visual acuity, iris color, pupil size, chamber angle, C/D ratio, visual field (VF), coefficient of aqueous outflow and Goldmann tonometry. After a one month washout period, pilocarpine was used 4 times daily, in concentrations from 0.5 to 8%. The amount of IOP change was compared with various clinical findings</description>

    <description>Varying frequency, once to four times daily - 15 patients were included in a crossover study: IOP was checked daily for 3 days and for 9 hours on fourth day. Pilocarpine was started on day 5 once daily OD and BID OS; on day 9 once daily OD and QID OS; on day 12 QID OD and once daily OS; on day 16 once daily OD and QID OS; and on day 19 QID OD and once daily OS. No medications were used on days 23-25. IOP was measured on days 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22 and 25.</description>
