  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a homeopathic drug proving a homeopathically prepared substance is administered to healthy
      volunteers in order to produce the symptoms specific to that substance and thereby reveal its
      inherent curative powers. During a homeopathic drug proving the goal is to provoke temporary
      symptoms (or &quot;artificial illness&quot;) associated with the homeopathic medication. These symptoms
      are then arranged to form a symptom pattern or 'remedy picture' which is specific to that
      particular homeopathic substance and provides the basis for a better understanding of the
      possible effects of that homeopathic remedy in patients.

      The duration of these homeopathic drug provings are six week per subject (42 days). The
      central investigational tool of the homeopathic drug proving is the journal kept by each
      subject from DAY 1-35. The subject describes the symptoms they experience in their own words
      in the journal daily. During the 7 day run-in phase, the subject notes in their journal their
      current state of health, the daily rhythm of their life, and any other signs or symptoms that
      occur on a daily basis. This will also enhance familiarity with self-observation and the
      recording of signs and symptoms. After completion of this run-in phase an evaluation
      including journal check will occur on DAY 7. During the following 4 weeks (observation
      periods DAY 8-14, 22-28; wash-out period DAY 15-21 and 29 - 35) the subject documents all
      signs or symptoms that occur in his/her journal on a daily basis. During this period, subject
      interviews will take place on DAY 15, DAY 21. DAY 29 and DAY 36. During the 7 day follow up
      (post observation period, DAY 36-42) the subject will be contacted to check if any additional
      symptoms and/or adverse events occurred.
