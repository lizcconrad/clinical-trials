  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some men complain of changes in the shape or dimensions of their penis after undergoing
      radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate) for prostate cancer. Changes in penile
      dimensions include shortening or decreased girth. Changes in shape include a curvature or
      bending of the penis, and/or the appearance of indentation. These changes may be associated
      with formation of scar tissue involving the covering of the erection chambers, known as
      &quot;plaque&quot;. The appearance of indurated plaque and a resultant curvature or indentation is a
      well described medical condition known as &quot;Peyronie's Disease&quot; and may occur in men who did
      or did not undergo radical prostatectomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate these
      changes in penile shape and dimensions.

    <description>At the baseline visit, the patient's co-morbidities, height, weight with calculation of body mass index will be documented.
After surgery, the patient will be instructed to keep a diary to record erectile function including how often they use a PDE-5 inhibitor or injection therapy and each time they get an erection and the level of rigidity. The diary is required to document PDE-5 inhibitor and injection therapy use and response in each sexual encounter, unlike the IIEF questionnaire, which addresses erectile function over a 4-week period. Accurate documentation is essential for erectile function assessment, as patient choice of erectile function medication may differ in each sexual encounter, and accordingly, the achieved rigidity level.</description>
