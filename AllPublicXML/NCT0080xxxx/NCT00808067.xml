    <measure>Major Bleeding, Annualized Rate of Subjects With Major Bleeds</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 43 months</time_frame>
    <description>Annualized event rate (%) = 100 * No. subjects with event / subject-years. Subject-years = Sum (date of last visit - date of first dose + 1) of all subjects / 365.25.
Major bleeding must have satisfied one or more of the following criteria:
Bleeding associated with a reduction in hemoglobin of at least 20 g/L
Required transfusion of at least 2 units of blood or packed cells
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ: intraocular, intraspinal, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal, intra-articular, pericardial, gastrointestinal
Major bleed were classified as life-threatening if they met one or more of the following criteria:
Reduction in hemoglobin of at least 50 g/L
Transfusion of at least 4 units of blood or packed cells
Symptomatic intracranial bleeding, either subdural or intracerebral
Associated with hypotension requiring use of intravenous inotropic agents
Required surgical intervention to stop bleeding
Resulted in death</description>

    <description>Annualized event rate (%) = 100 * No. subjects with event / subject-years. Subject-years = Sum (date of last visit - date of first dose + 1) of all subjects / 365.25.
Stroke was an acute onset of a focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular origin lasting for 24 hours or more or resulting in death. The stroke was categorized as ischemic or hemorrhagic or cause unknown based on computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) scanning or autopsy. Fatal stroke was defined as death from any cause within 30 days of stroke. Severity of stroke was assessed by modified Rankin score at discharge from hospital</description>

a. In subjects not undergoing PCI or CABG a subject should have fulfilled at least 2 of the following: i. Typical prolonged severe chest pain or related symptoms or signs suggestive of MI. ii. Elevation of troponin or CK-MB to more than upper level of normal (ULN) or, if CK-MB was elevated at baseline, re-elevation to more than 50% increase above the previous level. iii. Development of significant Q-waves in at least 2 adjacent ECG leads. b. After percutaneous coronary intervention (within 24h). c. After coronary artery bypass grafting (within 72h). d. Silent myocardial infarction. e. Myocardial infarction could also have been demonstrated at autopsy.</description>

Stroke was an acute onset of a focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular origin lasting for 24 hours or more or resulting in death. The stroke was categorized as ischemic or hemorrhagic or cause unknown based on computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) scanning or autopsy. Fatal stroke was defined as death from any cause within 30 days of stroke. Severity of stroke was assessed by modified Rankin score at discharge from hospital</description>
