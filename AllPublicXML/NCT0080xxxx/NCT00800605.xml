    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of an investigational Vero
      cell-derived, trivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine to prevent infection with an influenza
      virus that is antigenically similar to one of the three strains in the vaccine. Subjects will
      be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a single intramuscular injection of either
      the investigational vaccine or placebo. Blood will be drawn from all subjects for a
      determination of hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers on Days 0 and 21, body
      temperature and injection site reactions will be monitored daily for 7 days. In addition,
      subjects must return to the clinic promptly to have swab samples of their nose and throat
      taken whenever they feel flu symptoms and all subjects will be monitored for adverse events
      until Day 180.
