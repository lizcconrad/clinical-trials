  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of
      phonotraumatic lesions of the vocal folds, using the International Classification of
      Functioning Disability and Health (World Health Organization, 2001) as the conceptual
      framework to guide the selection of outcome measures.

      The experimental hypothesis for this study is that needling at the designated treatment
      acupoints will bring about greater improvement in structural and functional impairment in the
      vocal folds and its sequelae, as compared to placebo treatment. However, it is further
      hypothesized that treatment benefits from acupuncture will be outweighed by continued
      phonotrauma following termination of treatment, and thus will not be maintained at long-term
      follow-up. Further, it is expected that voice-related quality-of-life improvements may be
      equal for genuine acupuncture as compared to placebo. Finally, it is hypothesized that the
      acupuncture protocol should have comparable effects for male and female subjects.
