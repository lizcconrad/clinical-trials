             within 28 days prior to treatment initiation

          -  All Adverse Events of any prior chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy, must have
             resolved to NCI CTCAE (v. 3.0) Grade &lt;= 2 (except for alopecia)

          -  The following laboratory results, within 10 days of KOS-1022 administration:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 8.5 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophils count &gt;= 1.5 x 10*9* /L

             trastuzumab

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women. Male patients must be surgically sterile or agree to
             use an acceptable method of contraception

          -  Known active CNS metastases

          -  Administration of any other chemotherapy, biological, immunotherapy or investigational
             agent (therapeutic or diagnostic) within 14 days prior to receipt of study medication.
             Patients should be 6 weeks from last dose of nitrosourea

          -  Patients with Grade 2 or higher dyspnea at rest on room air; patients with other
             clinically significant pulmonary co-morbidity(s) that might predispose the patient to
             pulmonary toxicity

          -  Prior pulmonary toxic chemotherapy (e.g, bleomycin or carmustine)
