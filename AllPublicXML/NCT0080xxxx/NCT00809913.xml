  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a 7-day duration of antibiotic treatment of
      febrile urinary tract infection (FUTI) is non inferior to 14-day standard duration of
      treatment in unselected population presenting at primary care or emergency department.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decades hospitalization rates of patients with acute pyelonephritis (AP) or FUTI
      has decreased from almost 100% to 10-30%. The outpatient management of patients with FUTI has
      become popular as well as oral antimicrobial treatment regiments and shortening of treatment
      duration. However, as such approaches are only discovered in otherwise young health
      non-pregnant women, the best management of FUTI in the elderly, men and patients with
      co-morbidity remains elusive. Bases on personal perception of the attending physician
      antibiotic treatment, duration varies approximately between 7-14 days. Facing the aging of
      the general population, it is urgent to better define the optimal treatment for AP or FUTI in
      an unselected population and to identify those at risk for treatment failure or poor outcome
      to guide and optimize individual patient management and to prevent on the one hand
      unnecessary long treatment duration and hospital admission and on the other hand unsafe short
      duration or unsafe outpatient management.

      In this study the efficacy and safety of a 7-day antimicrobial regimen compared to a 14-day
      antimicrobial regimen will be evaluated in an unselected population presenting with FUTI at
      primary care or emergency department. In addition a clinical and/or biomarker based scoring
      system of disease severity will be derived to predict those at risk for treatment failure or
      poor outcome.
