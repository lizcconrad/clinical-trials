      This clinical study was planned in order to assess the superiority of INNOCELL Corp.
      &quot;Immuncell-LC&quot; in aspects of therapeutic efficacy and safety when administered with
      Temozolomide to glioblastoma patients when compared with the control group who did not
      receive administration of the drug.

      &lt;Primary Purpose&gt; Compare clinical efficacy of group treated with cell theraputic INNOCELL
      Immuncell-LC evaluated by progression free survival with that of untreated group.

      &lt;Secondary Purpose&gt; Compare clinical efficacy of group treated with INNOCELL Immuncell-LC, a
      drug for treating glioblastoma evaluated by overall survival, therapy reaction, EORTC
      QLQ-C30, and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) and that of untreated group, and evaluate
      adverse reactions, clinical pathological tests, and its safety.
