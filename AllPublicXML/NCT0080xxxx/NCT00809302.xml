  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to be conducted at multiple Parkinson Study Group (PSG) sites in the
      USA. Patients with early Parkinson disease will be randomly allocated to one of 4 arms in the
      study. The 4 arms include 3 arms with different doses of aplindore MR tablets and 1 placebo
      arm. The study drug will be taken twice a day (BID). The study is blinded and neither
      subjects, nor the investigators, will know what treatment the subject is receiving.
      Investigational study drug will be adjusted to the assigned dosage and then maintained at
      that dosage for the balance of the 12 week follow-up period. The entire study will take about
      13 weeks. The study will assess the safety and tolerability of aplindore and measure how
      effective aplindore is in improving movement and other effects of Parkinson disease.

      One hundred and sixty eight patients will be randomly assigned to one of four investigational
      treatment regimens in this outpatient study. For active treatment arms, study drug will be
      titrated to the assigned dosage and then maintained for up to a 12 week follow-up period
      before receiving tapered doses in advance of study completion. Dosing will take place over a
      total of about 13 weeks.
