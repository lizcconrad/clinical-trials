    <textblock>
      This study will test the SCION (Self care improvement through oncology nursing)-HSCT program
      a multi-modular, somatic-psycho-social care intervention to improve self management in
      oncologic patients undergoing HSCT. The study will determine if the self management skills of
      the patients to enhance:

        -  physical activity,

        -  prevention of oral mucositis and

        -  mal nutrition during the period of hospitalization.

      It is hypothesized that patients who receive the multi-modular somatic-psycho-social care
      intervention will have better health related quality of life (HRQoL).

      According to Precede Model of health behavior from Green - modified by our research group -
      patients self management skills are affected by the patients' knowledge, activities and
      attitude to self management.

      Therefore, we propose a prospective non-randomized clinical trial that will test the
      effectiveness of SCION-HSCT program against care as usual on perceived HRQoL of the patient
      and the adherence to care program.

      Oncology patients with HSCT will be recruited by the nurses of the participating wards under
      the guidance of a research nurse. They will be included in the trial if they will meet the
      inclusion criteria and signed informed consent (the full inclusion criteria see below).

      Groups will be treated consecutively. The first group will receive care as usual (Control).
      After finishing the control period, i.e. after 42 Patients will have completed the trial. The
      the newly assigned patients will be treated according to SCION-HSCT program a multi-modular
      somatic-psycho-social care intervention (Intervention).

      The intervention will be conducted by specially trained ward nurses in cooperation with the
      research nurse. It includes components of knowledge, skills training, and coaching to improve
      patients adherence to self management strategies for physical activity, prevention of oral
      mucositis and mal nutrition prevention. The HRQoL, adherence and symptom level of the
      patients will be observed up to 100 days post HSCT. Both quantitative and qualitative
      analyses will be conducted to evaluate patient outcomes.

    <description>Patients receive SCION-HSCT program a multi-modular somatic-psycho-social care intervention. consisting of 3 modules: Activity Enhancement, Oral Mucositis Prevention and Mal-Nutrition Avoidance.
The intervention will be conducted by specially trained oncology nurses and will include components of knowledge, skills training, and coaching to improve self management. The intervention starts at admission followed by booster sessions during the period of hospitalization. Patients will be scheduled to an individualized physical activity program incl. endurance training on light level 60-80% of max heart rate. Additionally the patient will be counselled to follow a mouth care protocol based on self assessment of the mouth to prevent oral mucositis. Both interventions are accompanied by a systematic screening of the nutritional situation. All three interventions are aimed to improve patients' adherence to self management strategies of side effects.</description>
