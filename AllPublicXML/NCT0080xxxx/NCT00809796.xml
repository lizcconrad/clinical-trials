             clinical trial

          -  Any of the following conditions: Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE grade ≥ 2;
             atrial fibrillation of any grade; QTc interval &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for

             trial participation of study drug administration, or which in the judgement of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.
