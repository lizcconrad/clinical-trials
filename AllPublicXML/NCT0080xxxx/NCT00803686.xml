  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the plasma CTx-1 concentrations when dosing is at
      night and to compare these results with those obtained with a placebo control and with
      commercially available nasal calcitonin.

    <textblock>
      Timing of the dose of recombinant salmon calcitonin (rsCT) is important in effecting
      reduction of osteoclast activity. It is theorized that a dose administered before bedtime
      will be more effective than a dose administered in the morning. See protocol summary for
      information.

    <description>C-terminal telopeptide of Collagen Type I (CTx-1) is an established plasma biomarker employed as an index of bone-resorption activity in response to interventions such as an anti-resorptive agent such as calcitonin. Here the calcitonin-salmon is rsCT, (recombinant) both oral and intranasal. These CTx-1 plasma concentrations were collected over 12 hours post-dosing where each subject served as her own control, as all received placebo in this crossover study, to account for the known diurnal variation of plasma CTx-1. For each time point, the ratio of the calcitonin response over the placebo response for that subject was derived from the plasma levels of CTx-1 and reported as a % of the placebo response (% Placebo or %P). These values were used to determine the primary pharmacodynamic parameter of Rmin, the minimum value seen following each active dose. The same %P values were used to derive the secondary pharmacodynamic parameters described in Secondary outc</description>

    <description>See Primary Outcome description. These CTx-1 plasma concentrations were collected over 12 hours, the values seen following active were compared with the time-matched individual values following placebo and used to derive the pharmacodynamic parameters. The primary was Rmin, seen above, and the Secondary ones were the time to that Rmin (Tmin) and the total time from the beginning of the inhibition to the end of the effect or the end of the study period (Tinhibition).</description>

        <title>Pharmacodynamic Effect of Oral Calcitonin</title>
        <description>C-terminal telopeptide of Collagen Type I (CTx-1) is an established plasma biomarker employed as an index of bone-resorption activity in response to interventions such as an anti-resorptive agent such as calcitonin. Here the calcitonin-salmon is rsCT, (recombinant) both oral and intranasal. These CTx-1 plasma concentrations were collected over 12 hours post-dosing where each subject served as her own control, as all received placebo in this crossover study, to account for the known diurnal variation of plasma CTx-1. For each time point, the ratio of the calcitonin response over the placebo response for that subject was derived from the plasma levels of CTx-1 and reported as a % of the placebo response (% Placebo or %P). These values were used to determine the primary pharmacodynamic parameter of Rmin, the minimum value seen following each active dose. The same %P values were used to derive the secondary pharmacodynamic parameters described in Secondary outc</description>
