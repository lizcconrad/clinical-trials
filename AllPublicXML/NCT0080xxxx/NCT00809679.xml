      Study K862-08-2002 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      assessing the analgesic efficacy and safety of T-62 in subjects with postherpetic neuralgia
      (PHN) and its associated pain. Up to 20 centers in the United States will participate in the
      trial. Two doses of T-62 and placebo will be evaluated in parallel design. Approximately 130
      subjects will be enrolled to complete approximately 100 subjects. Each subject will complete
      a 7-day Screening Period , a 28-day Treatment Period, and a 14-day Post-Treatment Period.
      Each subject will complete 8 clinic visits over the course of the study during which
      procedures and assessments of safety, efficacy, and protocol compliance will be performed.

        Inclusion criteria (additional criteria apply):

          1. Diagnosis of PHN made by primary treating physician and is experiencing pain for at
             least 3 months after the healing of a herpes zoster rash.

          2. Subject is in general good health.

          3. Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating, and practicing an acceptable method of
             birth control or be surgically sterile or post-menopausal. Double barrier methods and
             abstinence are the only acceptable birth control methods for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria (additional criteria apply):

          1. Subject has a current acute disease or unstable chronic disease other than post
             herpetic neuralgia.

          2. Subject has a clinically important history of a medical disorder (particularly
             cardiovascular, neurological [e.g., diabetic neuropathy], respiratory, or
             hepato-biliary systems [e.g., Gilbert Syndrome]) that would confound and/or interfere
             with the safety and efficacy evaluations defined in the protocol.

          3. Subject is being treated for a medical condition that affects cardiac conduction.

          4. Subject's plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
             total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) values are not within the normal
             reference ranges.

          5. Subject has a history of asthma requiring management for reactive airway disease in
             the last year.

          6. Subject uses and is unwilling/unable to discontinue use of (A) Lyrica® (pregabalin),
             Cymbalta® (duloxetine), Neurontin® (gabapentin), topical lidocaine, topical capsaicin,
             or other medication specifically indicated (i.e., labeled) for the treatment of
             neuropathic pain, or (B) anticonvulsant medications to control post herpetic
             neuralgia.

          7. Subject currently requires anticonvulsant medications to control seizures.
