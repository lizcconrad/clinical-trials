  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Tata Memorial Hospital 50% of the patients present in the locally advanced stage which is
      technically unresectable, or that is beyond the realm of a potentially curative surgical
      resection. The evaluation of treatment approaches for these tumors is hampered by the absence
      of any substantial randomized studies and the heterogeneous nature of the tumors at
      presentation.

      The management of these tumors has changed over the years, there is emphasis on neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation therapy, trying to convert a tumor that is initially unresectable to one that
      is potentially curable by surgery. But only 70-80% of the patients are able to complete this
      treatment without any significant treatment breaks.

      Dose escalated treatment with radiotherapy in locally advanced and unresectable rectal
      cancers have been tried in many small series with good results and lesser toxicity.

      Comparison outcome between the two arms will indicate the relative efficacy and toxicity of
      neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation vs boosted radiotherapy alone in downstaging of
      advanced cancers.

      Aims/ Objectives

        1. To compare the resectability rate when patients are treated when conventional
           chemoradiation to patients treated with radiation alone with an additional boost to the
           primary tumor in case of unresectable rectal cancers.

        2. To study the treatment toxicity and local control rate.

      Study methodology This is a phase II Randomised controlled study. Ninety cases of advanced
      rectal cancer (Stage II - Stage III) will be divided in two equal groups (Arm I &amp; II)
      Arm-1(standard arm) - Patients will receive standard external radiation therapy to pelvis +
      concurrent chemotherapy with Tab Capecitabine. This will be followed by surgery at 6-8 weeks
      if deemed resectable.

      Arm-2 (research arm) Patients in this group will not receive any neo-adjuvant chemotherapy,
      instead they will receive radiotherapy alone additional dose of localized radiotherapy boost.
      This will be followed by surgery at 6-8 weeks if deemed resectable.

    <description>Radiation dose to pelvis will be delivered at 1.8 Gy per day, five days per week, to give a total of 25 fractions over a period of five weeks for a total of 45 Gy.
Boost Field - Will be given to all the patients in the radiotherapy alone followed by surgery arm.
The boost will be given with by 3dimensional conformal radiotherapy to a dose of 15-20 Gy. After 45Gy the boost will be planned on the original tumor volume.</description>

    <description>The Radiation dose will be delivered at 1.8 Gy per day, five days per week, to give a total of 25 fractions over a period of five weeks for a total of 45 Gy.
Chemotherapy will begin on the first day of radiotherapy and continue until the completion of radiotherapy. Capecitabine will be administered orally daily 2000 mg/m2 in two divided doses (approximately 12 hours apart) for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period given as 3 week cycles.</description>
