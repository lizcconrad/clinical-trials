  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      99mTc-rBitistatin is a radiolabeled polypeptide which is designed to stick to blood clots so
      that the blood clots can be detected by imaging. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate in
      patients the safety of 99mTc-rBitistatin and its ability to locate blood clots in the arms
      and legs.
