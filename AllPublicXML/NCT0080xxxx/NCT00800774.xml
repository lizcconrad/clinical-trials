    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability
      of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) to correct high anisometropia in patients 8 to 15
      years old in whom conventional treatments have failed.

    <textblock>
      Nine eyes of nine patients (3 male and 6 female) with high anisometropia (&gt;3.50 D), were
      included in this study. Minimum follow-up was 10 years. All patients were treated with the
      Chiron Technolas 217 excimer laser.
