      The objective of this study is to evaluate under routine clinical setting the efficacy and
      remission status from treatment of 2nd-generation antipsychotic in patients who is upon acute
      episode or not achieving remission under regular treatment from schizophrenia/schizoaffective
      disorder. This study will collect in real-life practice the severity of schizophrenia by
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI), also evaluate the criteria of schizophrenia remission
      applying 8 items of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from Andresen working group,
      the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Global Assessment of
      Functioning Scale (GAF). Side effect of movement disorder will be evaluated by Drug Induced
      Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). Tolerability for treatment will be monitored by
      documenting spontaneous reports on adverse events as well as change in body weight.
