      Patients with locally advanced (IIIB with effusion) or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC), EGFR FISH positive, candidate for a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy will be
      considered eligible for the trial. After evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
      after signature of informed consent form, all eligible patients will be randomized to receive
      standard chemotherapy (control arm) or gefitinib (250 mg daily dose-experimental arm).
      Before, and in every case, no more than 4 weeks before study entry, all eligible patients
      will receive a complete disease staging, including thoracic and abdominal CT-scan, and blood
      sampling. Bronchoscopy will be done if not previously performed. Bone scan and brain CT-scan
      will be performed only if clinically indicated. Disease assessment will be performed every 6
      weeks (every 2 cycles) for the first 6 cycles, and thereafter every 3 months, with a
      confirmatory evaluation in all patients with response or disease stabilization no less than 4
      weeks after the response assessment, according to RECIST Criteria. A complete disease
      staging, including the above mentioned procedures, will be performed in case of progressive
      disease, and, in every cases, when patient withdrawals the trial. Following completion of
      protocol therapy, patients will be followed every 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, EGFR FISH positive, candidate for
             a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-squamous NSCLC. Availability of tumor tissue
             for EGFR FISH analysis is mandatory

          -  Stage IIIB (with effusion) or stage IV or disease relapsed after surgery or
             radiotherapy and in any case not suitable for radiotherapy or surgery with curative
             intent

          -  EGFR FISH positive

          -  Presence of at least one measurable/evaluable not previously irradiated lesion
             according to RECIST criteria. Previously irradiated lesion(s) are allowed only if
             progressing

          -  ECOG performance Status 0-2

          -  Patient untreated with chemotherapy or EGFR targeting agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is
             allowed if disease relapsed after at least 12 months after therapy completion.

          -  Patient candidate to standard platinum-based chemotherapy

          -  Patient compliance to trial procedures

          -  Patients must be willing to complete the FACT-L questionnaire

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  EGFR FISH negative tumor

          -  Squamous-cell carcinoma, presence of neuroendocrine features or small cell carcinoma
             histology

          -  Impossibility to ascertain EGFR FISH status

          -  Concomitant radiotherapy

          -  Less than 30 days since completion of prior wide field chest radiotherapy or

          -  Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, barbiturates or St
             John's Wort (Hypercium).

          -  Serum bilirubin greater than 3 times the upper limit of reference range (ULRR

          -  Alanine amino transferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 2.5
             times the ULRR if no demonstrable liver metastases or greater than 5 times the ULRR in
             the presence of liver metastases.

          -  Treatment with a non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days before Day 1 of
             study treatment.
