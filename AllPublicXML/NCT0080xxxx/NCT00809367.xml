  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to determine if it is feasible to collect leukemia cells
      from patients ahead of time (before they undergo further treatments) so that these cells
      (after being radiated so they will no longer grow or divide) can be given back to them as a
      cancer vaccine if/after the participant receives a bone marrow or blood stem cell transplant
      in the future. The purpose of the research study will be to collect, freeze and store
      leukemia calls from participants blood or bone marrow. This study is a companion study to a
      vaccine study.

      -  Leukemia cells will be collected by one or more of the following methods: 1)Routine
           blood draw 2)Bone marrow aspirate 3) Leukapheresis. The physician and study staff will
           determine which of the methods above is best suited for each participant.

        -  After collection, the leukemia cells will be transported to the Cell Manipulation Core
           Facility (CMCF) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where they will be frozen until the
           time of vaccine administration.
