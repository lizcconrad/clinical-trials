  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in the industrialized nations. For a
      long time glaucoma has been defined as a disease in which high intraocular pressure (IOP)
      leads to irreversible optic disc damage and subsequent visual field loss. However, recent
      investigations show that IOP is not the only factor that is involved in the glaucomatous
      process leading to retinal ganglion cell death. The role of vascular factors in the
      pathogenesis of glaucoma has recently received much attention based on animal experiments and
      epidemiological studies. It is, however, assumed that vascular factors do not contribute to
      same degree in all glaucoma patients. Generally, it is believed that a vascular component is
      more important in normal tension glaucoma patients and patients with underlying
      cardiovascular disease. Little is, however, known about a potential association between optic
      nerve head morphology and ocular perfusion in POAG patients. The current study seeks to gain
      insight into this association by assessing ocular blood flow parameters with a number of
      noninvasive technologies.
