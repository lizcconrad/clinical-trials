  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims for this project are to enroll up to 10,000 subjects who will have their
      genomes surveyed using the Navigenicsâ„¢ Health Compass technology. The Navigenics Health
      Compass helps you understand what your genetic variants have to say about the future of your
      health, and gives you action steps to take control of your health today. In addition, the
      investigators will assess how the Navigenics Health Compass, results affect lifestyle
      decisions. The phenotyping information that can be analyzed with the resulting Navigenics
      genotype information will assist in identifying genetic variations associated with other
      traits and diseases.

      The uses of molecular markers such as cholesterol and glucose levels to assess disease risk
      are well established in clinical medicine today. Although these tools are useful in screening
      for subclinical disease, their predictive value is limited. Until recently, these molecular
      markers were the best risk assessment and screening tools in existence. Since the completion
      of the Human Genome Project, the era of personalized medicine, which exploits knowledge of
      the genes an individual carries that may predispose him/her to disease, has come to the
      forefront of research.

      The Navigenics Health Compass technology assesses risk for about over 20 common diseases and
      provides subjects with more accurate assessments of their individual predictive risk for
      developing these conditions than traditional biomarkers such as cholesterol and glucose
      levels. This may positively influence changes in lifestyle, as well as decisions to seek
      further medical evaluation associated with preventive strategies.
