  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapy plays an important part in rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty. Even
      if this is a common practice, few studies have been performed on this issue.

      The prime aim of this study is to examine the effects of an ambulatory individualized
      task-oriented exercise program compared with current ambulatory physiotherapy(usual care)on
      activity performance and self efficacy beliefs in the time span 6 weeks to 3 months after
      total knee arthroplasty with a follow-up at twelve months.

      HO:Task oriented physiotherapy has better effect than usual care on activity performance and
      self-efficacy beliefs in the time span 6 weeks to 3 months after total knee replacement.

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial was performed with an experiment group having task oriented
      exercises in only weight-bearing 12 times from 6 weeks to 12 weeks after the operation, while
      the control group had usual physiotherapy care during the same time span. The primary outcome
      was walking measured by the six minutes walk test. Other performed and self reported measures
      of physical functioning were performed, at baseline, six weeks after the operation,
      immediately after the intervention at 12-14 weeks and with a follow-up nine months after the
      intervention.
