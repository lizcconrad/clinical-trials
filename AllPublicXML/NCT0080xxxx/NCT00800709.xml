      In AD, tau protein is abnormally hyperphosphorylated. Significant changes of
      hyperphosphorylated tau levels in CSF are found in AD patients. It has been shown in vitro
      that memantine can reverse abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in hippocampal neurons of
      rats. A statistically significant reduction of CSF phosphorylated tau at a preliminary 1-year
      follow-up was observed, from median 126 (interquartile range 107-153) to 108 (88-133) ng/l (p
      = 0.018). No statistically significant differences of total tau or Aβ42 were found
      (Gunnarsson MD, 2007).

      FDG-PET has the unique ability to estimate the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose
      consumption, thus providing information on the distribution of neuronal death and synapse
      dysfunction in AD in vivo (Herholz K. 2003). Synaptic dysfunction and loss induce a reduction
      in neuronal energy demand that results in decreased glucose metabolism. Hypometabolism in AD
      is thought to reflect loss of synaptic activity and density (Herholz K. 2003; Mielke R, et
      al. 1998).

      Another biological markers such as inflammatory factor and APOEε4 also play a part in the
      onset of AD (Glodzik-Sobanska L, 2007).
