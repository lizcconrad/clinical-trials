  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical and microbiological effectiveness of the
      moxifloxacin compared with the combination ciprofloxacin - metronidazole, when used as
      adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planning for the treatment of advanced chronic
      periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an endemic inflammatory disease caused by a mixed bacterial biofilm
      infection that is followed by destruction of tooth supporting tissues. Standard of care
      consists of lifelong mechanical removal of the biofilm. However, outcome is variable.
      According to recent EFP and AAP reviews, adjunctive antimicrobial therapy may be
      beneficial.However, bearing in mind that Colombia has reported the frequent presence of
      Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella and Enterobacter) in subgingival plaque of patients with
      chronic periodontitis, the response to treatment may be different.The enteric have shown
      resistance to amoxicillin, amoxicillin / clavulanate, metronidazole and tetracycline in
      studies conducted in the United States, Norway, Brazil and Colombia.Although the combination
      ciprofloxacin metronidazole has been recommended in the dental literature are not known
      publications that demonstrate its effectiveness against periodontopathogens and enteric
      present in subgingival plaque of subjects with chronic periodontitis.On the other hand, some
      in vitro studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of moxifloxacin against
      periodontopathogens, but was not aware of any clinical trials or in vitro studies on
      antibiotic resistance and susceptibility to enteric isolated subgingival plaque of patients
      with chronic periodontitis in which employs moxifloxacin.
