  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate the result reading clarity of the VS-SENSE is
      substantially equivalent to the result reading clarity of the Nitrazine pH Paper test for
      vaginal secretions.

      Once informed consent has been signed, the clinician will perform the following:

      Record baseline variables in the CRF. The 1st clinician will obtain a vaginal secretion
      sample by using the VS-SENSE swab. The 1st clinician will obtain the specimen by separating
      the labia to expose the vagina. The yellow tip of the VS-SENSE swab will be inserted into the
      vagina approximately 5 cm/ 2&quot;. The 1st clinician will use the VS-SENSE according the
      instructions for use - attachment 1 to the protocol.

      The 1st clinician will read the VS-SENSE results and record them on the designated form
      (Clinician Report - VS-SENSE Result form), and fill out the table regarding the VS-SENSE
      reading clarity on the same form.Vaginal examination (including speculum examination) - will
      be performed by a 2nd clinician, masked from the results of the 1st clinician test.

      The 2nd clinician will use a vaginal swab for pH measurement by Nitrazine pH Paper test. The
      Nitrazine pH Paper test will be performed according to strict manufacturer's instruction.

      The 2nd clinician will read the results of the Nitrazine pH Paper test result, document it on
      the Clinician Report - pH Test Result form, and fill out the table regarding the pH test
      reading clarity on the same form.
