      A comparison of three medications to treat diarrhea in adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single (investigator) blind, randomized, 3-arm, parallel-group study design was selected
      to show non-inferiority of loperamide/simeticone caplets compared to chewable tablets in a
      heterogeneous subject population aiming at validity of results and reducing bias. The study
      will also compare the loperamide/simeticone combinations versus a probiotic (Saccharomyces
      boulardii) in the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults. Probiotics have been used for acute
      infectious diarrhea to reduce the duration and severity of the illness.
