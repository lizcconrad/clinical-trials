  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of aerobic physical
      exercise and alprazolam in patients with panic disorder has a better therapeutic response
      than the treatment with alprazolam alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have observed in our clinical practice that patients who practiced aerobic physical
      exercise had faster remissions and better improvement in their treatments that those who did
      not. There are also some scientific studies that included physical exercise in the treatment
      for panic disorder and compared them to other single pharmacological treatments.

      So our objective will be to compare the efficacy of a pharmacological monotherapy
      (alprazolam), that is one of the options for the pharmacological treatment of panic disorder,
      with other treatment such as the combination of aerobic physical exercise and alprazolam, and
      to determine if this combination results in a better therapeutic response.

    <description>The patients assigned to the pharmacological plan will receive 4 mg alprazolam daily for 12 weeks. Two weeks after the first interview they have their first baseline psychiatric control, where all the patients are tested.
Then, at the same visit, all the patients are indicated 4 mg of alprazolam. The dose is gradually increased from 1 to 4 mg along the first week of treatment. The test is repeated during weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.</description>

    <description>The patients assigned to exercise have to pass an ergometric test to determine the functional capacity expressed in Metabolic Equivalents of Task (METs), and their maximum heart rates to standardize the future exercise indication.
Two weeks after the first interview they have their first baseline psychiatric control and at the same time they are indicated a 4 mg dose of alprazolam, gradually increased from 1 to 4 mg along the first week of treatment. The test is repeated during weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.
At the same time they have to follow a protocolized aerobic exercise plan for this study 3 times a week for 12 weeks.
The type of selected exercise consists of a rapid walk (both in not inclined treadmill or natural courses) for 30 minutes divided in stages.
After each stage the patient has to control his own heart frequency that has to be maintained between 50 and 75% of their maximum not to turn to an anaerobic condition, according to the American Cardiological Association.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with panic disorder scored between 20 and 30 by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating
             Scale/14. (Baseline scale scores were measured during the first interview and
             diagnoses were made by a psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM
             IV).

          -  Good physical health and normal results determined on a previous physical examination
             and routine laboratory tests (renal, hepatic, hematological and thyroid function).

          -  Patients who completed a written informed consent form (which was obtained from every
             included patient and had been fully explained before the procedure).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of some kind of recent somatic disease.

          -  Diagnosis of some other type of associated or psychiatric disease of axis I of DSM IV,
             such as affective disorders, drug dependency.

          -  Hamilton Anxiety Scale lower than 20 points or higher than 30.

          -  Use of some other type of medication or treatment (including psychotherapy) or having
             received it during last past 3 months.

          -  Patients who could not complete the clinical examination

          -  Patients who have not accepted to complete or sign the written informed consent.

          -  Pregnant patients or in lactation. (A pregnancy test was performed for women in
             fertile age)

          -  Patients with history of rejection to the used drug.

        <title>Participants´Endpoint Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S)</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression Severity scale is a 7 point ordinal scale that rates the severity of the patient's illness, assessing on the severity of a patient’s mental illness. It ranges from 1 to 7 (1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; 7, extremely ill).</description>

        <title>Participants´Endpoint Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I)</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale is a 7 point ordinal scale that assesses how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state before the intervention. Rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>For this outcome the baseline number of participants is zero as at the first visit patients have not received any treatment yet, thus they cannot be assessed with a scale that measures improvement at their first visit. This scale will only be applied along weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, after patients have received their corresponding treatments.</population>
