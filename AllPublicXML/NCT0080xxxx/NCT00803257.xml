  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of CTS occur when any condition decreases the size of the carpal canal or increases
      the volume of the structures within the carpal canal, compressing the median nerve. One cause
      of the symptoms of CTS is the incursion of the lumbrical muscles of the hand into the carpal
      canal. Individuals with CTS tend to have tight lumbrical muscles which increase this
      incursion, thereby increasing CTS symptoms. An intervention designed to reduce the incursion
      of the lumbrical muscles should have an effect on the symptoms of CTS.

      The purpose of this study is to systematically examine the effect of an intensive lumbrical
      muscle intervention, splinting to prevent lumbrical muscle incursion and lumbrical muscle
      exercises, on the symptoms of CTS. This project will be a randomized clinical trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a home program targeting the lumbrical muscles. One hundred and
      twenty subjects will be assigned to one of 4 groups: Group 1 will receive a home program of
      lumbrical muscle stretches combined with a lumbrical positioning splint; Group 2 will receive
      a home program of lumbrical muscle stretches combined with a night wrist cock-up splint;
      Group 3 will receive a home program of general stretches combined with a lumbrical
      positioning splint; and Group 4 will receive a home program of general stretches combined
      with a night wrist cock-up splint. After 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months the groups will be
      compared to determine if there is a significant reduction in symptoms between the groups.
