  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the chief cause of severe and irreversible loss of
      vision in developed countries. The prevalence of AMD increases dramatically with age.

      The early stage (or dry AMD) is associated with minimal visual impairment and is
      characterized by large drusen and pigmentary abnormalities in the macula. The late stage is a
      neovascular, exudative form. This so called exudative AMD includes serous or hemorrhagic
      detachment of retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal neovascularization leading to severe
      loss of vision (20/200 or worse). Patients with unilateral CNV (choroidal neovascularisation)
      have a significant risk of CNV developing in the second eye.

      Choroidal blood flow is of great importance for normal visual function. Several reports have
      provided evidence suggesting that choroidal blood flow is decreased in subjects with AMD. In
      late stages of AMD angiogenesis leads to the formation of choroidal neovascularization that
      can cause severe visual impairment by disrupting normal macular function.

      The purpose of this evaluation is to investigate a possible link between alterations in
      choroidal blood flow and the development of CNV and serous detachment in the fellow eye of
      patients with AMD and unilateral neovascular maculopathy. This longitudinal study may provide
      important findings with respect to natural history and visual prognosis of patients with
      neovascularized AMD.

      Ocular blood flow will be determined by non-invasive methods, including laser Doppler
      flowmetry and laser interferometry
