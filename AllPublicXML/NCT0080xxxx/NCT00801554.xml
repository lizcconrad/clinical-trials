      The overarching aim of the study is to characterize children and adults with ASDs, and
      compare them with age-matched controls in relation to their functioning in family, academic,
      employment, and social spheres. Subjects will be comprehensively assessed in multiple
      non-overlapping domains of functioning, using psychiatric, cognitive, and psychosocial
      instruments.
