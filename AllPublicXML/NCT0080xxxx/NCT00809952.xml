        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The woman's inclusion criteria in our IUI program were at least one patent tube,
             normal cavity, basal FSH &lt; 10 mU/mL and age under 40 years.

          -  IUI with husband's sperm (IUI-H) was indicated when, after sperm preparation, at least
             5 million motile spermatozoa were recovered; this was performed in 58 cases (79.45%).

          -  In the remaining 15 cases (20.55%), IUI was performed with donor sperm (IUI-D) either
             because of azoospermia (n=6) failure to recover spermatozoa during testicular biopsy
             (n=5) or in women without a male partner (n=4).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous infertility treatments had been carried out.
