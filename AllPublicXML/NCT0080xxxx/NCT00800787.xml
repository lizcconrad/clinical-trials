      A phase 3, multicenter, open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of Nabi-HB,

      This is a phase 3 prospective, single arm open label study to be conducted t approximately 4
      study sited located in th e USA. Approximately 25 HBV DNA negative patients who underwent
      liver transplant at least one year prior, due to chronic hepatitis B infection will bwe
      eligible for study participation. The study consist of a total of 16 study visit and the
      duration of participation will be 20 weeks for each patients. Patients will be converted from
      the intravenous standard HBIG to Nabi-HB subcutaneous administration according to the
      individual scheduled dosing interval.
