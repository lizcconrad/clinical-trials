  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that blood pressure sensitivity to high
      sodium intake in healthy humans is characterized by increased urinary excretion of two
      endogenous sodium pump inhibitors, marinobufagenin (MBG), and ouabain-like compound (OLC).
      The study also tests the hypothesis that women who breathe slowly and have high resting end
      tidal CO2 at rest are more likely to have low plasma renin activity and sodium sensitivity of
      blood pressure than those who breathe more rapidly and maintain lower end tidal CO2.

      The experiments will involve a common procedure of sodium restriction followed by sodium
      loading of normotensive (having normal blood pressure) humans. However, the first experiment
      will involve continuous urine collection throughout the experimental period in a smaller
      group of men and women, while the second experiment will involve urine collection only at the
      end of each diet period in a larger group of normotensive women. If, as expected, experiment
      one shows that sodium loading produces MBG increases that are sustained throughout the sodium
      loading period, then experiment two will also be able to address a third issue: that is
      whether MBG or OLC response to sodium loading is specific to breathing pattern or sodium
      sensitivity. It is hypothesized that women with inhibited breathing who are sodium sensitive
      will show higher levels of MBG, even before sodium loading, but also following sodium
      loading.

      Each participant will be seen at the Clinical Research Unit for a screening visit and on days
      6 and 12, and consume a low sodium diet for 6 days followed by a high sodium diet for 6 days.
      Research staff will meet with the participant at regular intervals for meal provision and
      transfer of 24-hr urine collections (if applicable). Respiration and blood pressure will be
      measured on the last day of each sodium diet.
