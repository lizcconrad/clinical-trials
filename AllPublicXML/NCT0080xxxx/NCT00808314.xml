  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lexiscan(TM) has ideal properties for Rb-82 PET imaging and the stress response it invokes
      may offer multiple advantages for the diagnosis of coronary disease and functional
      abnormalities. The goal of this investigation is to establish quantitative equivalence of
      Lexiscan(TM) rest/stress Rb-82 PET images to dipyridamole rest/stress images.

    <description>A CT scan will be acquired for attenuation correction of the rest image (9 mA, 120 kVp, 4.24 secs) during end-expiration breath-holding. This will be followed by infusion of approximately 60 mCi of Rb-82, 60 to 100 seconds after which resting images will be acquired with ECG-gating. Following rest imaging, 0.56 mg/kg of dipyridamole will be infused over 4 minutes. Three minutes after the completion of the infusion, approximately 60 mCi of Rb-82 will be infused. Peak stress images will be acquired with ECG-gating, starting 90 seconds after the the beginning of the infusion of Rb-82 and continuing for 5 minutes. A CT scan will be acquired for attenuation correction of the stress image (9 mA, 120 kVp, 4.24 secs) during end-expiration breath-holding.</description>

    <description>A CT scan will be acquired for attenuation correction of the rest image (9 mA, 120 kVp, 4.24 secs) during end-expiration breath-holding. This will be followed by infusion of approximately 60 mCi of Rb-82, 60 to 100 seconds after which resting images will be acquired with ECG-gating. Following rest imaging, 400 umg of Lexiscan(TM) will be injected, and then approximately 60 mCi of Rb-82 waill be infused. Peak stress images will be acquired in list mode with ECG-gating, starting 90 seconds after the the beginning of the infusion of Rb-82 and continuing for 5 minutes. A CT scan willbe acquired for attenuation correction of the stress image (9 mA, 120 kVp, 4.24 secs) during end-expiration breath-holding.</description>
