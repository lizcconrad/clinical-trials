  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though much attention has been given to the practice of parental presence during invasive
      procedures in children in the ED, few studies have examined the patient's perspective. The
      only study to have addressed this issue used a single visual analog scale, which is not a
      well validated tool to assess children's distress level. Furthermore, no studies have
      assessed parental presence during fracture reduction; only a few incidental cases were
      reported in the literature. Finally, most studies evaluating parental presence had
      methodological limitations because of the absence of a control group.

      The investigators seek to assess whether parental presence during fracture reduction under
      sedation, in children 8 to 18 years of age, decreases anxiety levels in both parents and
      children.

    <description>Patients in the study group will be accompanied by one of their parents for the whole procedure. Before this, a short explanation of the procedure, the patient's expected behavior during the procedure and what roles parents should play will be given to the parent by the research assistant. Parents will be seated close to the patient's head and will wear radiology proof gowns. If deemed necessary by the attending physician or if their behavior becomes unacceptable, parents can be asked to leave the procedure room at any given time. Parents will be allowed to leave the procedure room if they wish to at any time during the procedure.</description>
