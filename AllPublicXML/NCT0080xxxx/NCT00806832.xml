  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is the most prevalent surgical procedure. Since most candidates are elderly
      patients, hypertension is common among these patients. Preoperative anxiety and tension may
      cause elevation of patient's heart rate and blood pressure and thus expose them to serious
      potential complications such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Medical clowns are known to
      reduce preoperative anxiety of both children and their parents. It is possible therefore that
      medical clown may have such a beneficial effect also on patients scheduled for cataract
      surgery under local anesthesia.
