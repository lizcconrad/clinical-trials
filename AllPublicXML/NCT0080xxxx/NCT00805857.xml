  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SCOLTA project is a system for online surveying of adverse events to recently
      commercialized antiretroviral drugs and a sentinel for unexpected and late adverse events
      reactions arising during any antiretroviral treatment.Aim of the proposed study is:

        1. to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of serious adverse events and serious
           unexpected adverse events in HIV-infected patients enrolled in the SCOLTA project
           Tipranavir cohort and to identify possible risk factors

        2. the evaluation of tipranavir containing regimens durability, considering treatment
           interruption for each reason.
