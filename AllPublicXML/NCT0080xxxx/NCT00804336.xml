  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of the combination of SOM230
      and RAD001, as well as determine the highest dose of this combination that can be given to
      people safely. SOM230 is an investigational drug that is similar to Sandostatin LAR.
      Sandostatin is an approved drug for the use of treating symptoms of neuroendocrine tumors.
      SOM230 has shown to be effective in patients who have become resistant to Sandostatin and may
      also stop cancer cells from growing. RAD001 is an investigational drug that also may stop
      cancer cells from growing.

      -  Participants will be receiving two study medications, SOM230 and RAD001, during each
           treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks.

        -  For the first four weeks of treatment, the participant will self-administer the SOM230
           twice a day by subcutaneous injection. If they tolerate the SOM230 after 4 weeks, they
           will switched to the long-acting SOM230 which will be administered during scheduled
           treatment visits once every 4 weeks. For the first two weeks after switching to the
           long-acting SOM230, participants will continue to self-administer the short-acting
           SOM230 twice a day.

        -  RAD001 will be taken orally once every day.

        -  On Day 1 of every cycle, a physical exam and blood tests will be performed. Following
           every 2 cycles of treatment an assessment of the tumor by CT scan wil be performed.

        -  Pharmacokinetic (pK) blood samples will be taken on days 1 and 15 of cycle one. The pK
           samples will be taken right before the study drug is administered and then 1, 2, 3, and
           5 hours later.

    <description>RAD001 was administered orally as a once-daily dose. Pasireotide s.c. was self-administered s.c. twice daily for 4 weeks. If pasireotide s.c. was tolerated, patients received pasireotide LAR i.m. at the corresponding dose level. Pasireotide s.c. was continued for an additional 2 weeks after administration of pasireotide LAR until anticipated steady-state levels of pasireotide LAR were achieved. Pasireotide LAR was administered every 28 days. Cycles for everolimus and pasireotide LAR were repeated every 28 days.</description>
