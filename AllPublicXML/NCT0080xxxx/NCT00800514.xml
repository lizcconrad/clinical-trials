      The study will explore the neurocognitive effect of four weeks of treatment with amantadine
      versus placebo in patients with traumatic brain injury using the Interval Bisection Timing
      Task. Approximately 16 individuals with traumatic brain injury are expected to participate in
      this study. Subject participation is expected to last up to 8 weeks with 16 study visits.
