  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the
      propionyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride tablets among Chinese population in comparison with the
      placebo, for treatment of the peripheral arterial diseases (intermittent claudication) with
      oral supplementation of 2g daily for a 4 months continuous administration.

      This is a randomized, multi-centre, double-blind and placebo controlled clinical study.
      Propionyl-L-Carnitine (PLC) is a kind of natural derivative of L-Carnitine (LC) and is
      produced in the body and concentrated by 90% in the skeletal muscle and myocardium via an
      enzyme-mediated reaction involving propionyl-CoA and LC. For oral adminsitration, PLC shows
      that the decrease of the leg muscle carnitine of the PAD patient appears to correlate with
      poor exercise performance. It has recently been shown that the severity of the impairment in
      walking distance is correlated with the impairment in carntine metabolism at the muscle
      level. 2g daily of PLC supplementation can significantly improve the walking ability in
      patients with IC with a maximum walking capacity between 50 and 250 meters on the treadmill.
