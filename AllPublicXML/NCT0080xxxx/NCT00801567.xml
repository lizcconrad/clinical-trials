  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to gather additional information to support the theory that bipolar disorder
      is due to cellular (mitochondrial) dysfunction. To test this theory adults with bipolar
      disorder who are not currently symptomatic will receive a one-time brain scan (magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy [MRS] scan) with light stimulation. To test whether any MRS findings
      are specific to bipolar disorder, healthy controls and adults with schizophrenia will also be
      included in this study.

      This study will include males and females between the ages of 18 and 55 years. Participants
      will include adults with stable bipolar disorder or schizophrenia as well as healthy
      controls. The study involves a one-time visit that includes a clinical evaluation, laboratory
      tests, and a magnetic resonance scan that will last approximately 90 minutes. The procedures
      can also be separated into two study visits, if necessary.
