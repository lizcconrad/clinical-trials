    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug product sNN0029,
      containing the growth factor VEGF165, when administered directly into one of the fluid filled
      cavities in the brain using an implanted catheter and an implanted SynchroMed® II pump.
      Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis will be enrolled.

    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endogenous human protein fundamental to the
      development of the vascular and nervous systems in the body. A role for VEGF in ALS has been
      suggested from observations in animal models of the disease as well as observations of a
      dysregulation of VEGF production in patients with ALS.

      NeuroNova intends to investigate whether intracerebroventricular administration of VEGF165 in
      the form of the drug product sNN029 can improve motor function and prolong survival in
      patients with ALS, and in this first study the safety and tolerability of treatment for 3
      months will be evaluated.

      Assessments will include:

        -  Electrocardiograms, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests

        -  Adverse events and withdrawals related to adverse events

        -  Possible pathological changes in the brain, spinal cord or retina identified through
           magnetic resonance imaging and funduscopy

        -  Possible signs of intracranial bleeding or loss of blood-brain-barrier integrity through
           measurements of bilirubin and albumin levels in cerebrospinal fluid collected through
           lumbar and cervical puncture

        -  Device performance as characterized by catheter tip placement (determined by imaging)
           and infusion accuracy (pump residual volume)

      The secondary objective of this study is:

        -  To explore the effect of ICV administration of sNN0029 on the time course of Amyotrophic
           Lateral Sclerosis related parameters including:

             -  Disease activity as measured by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating
                Scale

             -  Quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D rating scale

        -  To explore the levels of VEGF165 in cerebrospinal fluid collected through lumbar and
           cervical puncture.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of ALS classified as definite, or probable with or without
             additional laboratory evidence, according to the revised WFN El Escorial criteria.

          2. Age 18 to 75 years inclusive.

          3. If patients are being treated with riluzole, they must have been on a stable dose for
             at least 30 days.

          4. Ophthalmological examination at screening with normal findings regarding vascular
             structure and function.

          5. MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) examination of the brain and cervical spinal
             cord at screening with no findings of tumors or potential sources of pathological
             bleedings, or abnormality that may interfere with the assessments of safety or
             efficacy or that would, in the judgement of the investigator, represent a surgical
             risk to the subject.

          6. Values of coagulation parameters including platelet count, normalized prothrombin
             complex (PK-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) within normal ranges.

          7. Patient is medically able to undergo the surgery required for stereotactic
             implantation of the catheter and infusion pump.

          8. Patient has been given written and verbal information, has had the opportunity to ask
             questions about the study, and understands the time and procedural commitments.

          9. Patient has given signed consent (written) to participate in the study. In the event
             that a patient who gives oral informed consent is not physically able to sign the
             informed consent form (ICF) due to disease progression, a witness may sign the ICF on
             the patient's behalf.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Impaired respiratory function judged to pose a risk to the patient during anaesthesia
             for the device implantation.

          2. Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic.

          3. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

          4. Proliferative retinopathy.

          5. Non-proliferative retinopathy of moderate severity or higher.

          6. Concurrent clinically significant dementia as determined by the investigator.

          7. Concurrent clinically significant depression as determined by the investigator.

          8. History of structural brain disease other than ALS, including tumours and hyperplasia.

          9. Any disorder that precludes a surgical procedure (e.g., signs of sepsis or
             inadequately treated infection), alters wound healing (e.g., including bleeding
             disorders), or renders chronic ICV delivery or device implants medically unsuitable.

         10. Presence of risk for increased or uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk of bleeding that
             is not managed optimally. Physicians should specifically investigate anatomical
             factors at or near the implant site (e.g., vascular abnormalities, neoplasms, or other
             abnormalities), underlying disorders of the coagulation cascade, platelet function, or
             platelet count (e.g., haemophilia, Von Willebrand's disease, liver disease, or other
             medical conditions), and the administration of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant
             medication (e.g., aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDs) in the pre- or perioperative period. Any of
             those conditions or drugs could place a patient at an increased risk for
             intraoperative or postoperative bleeding.

         11. Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted CNS catheter.

         12. Presence of cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, implantable programmable
             intraspinal drug pumps, or any other device that may interfere or interact with the
             programmer, without prior approval by Medtronic.

         13. Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters as
             assessed by the investigator.

         14. Ongoing medical condition that according to the investigator would interfere with the
             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., severe
             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study
             procedures (e.g., MRI), or to give informed consent.

         15. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within
             3 months prior to Screening visit.

         16. For female subjects, ongoing pregnancy or planned pregnancy during the period of
             treatment with study drug.

         17. Breast feeding during the period of treatment with study drug.
