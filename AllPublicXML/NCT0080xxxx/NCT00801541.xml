      To this study and identify the sequence of alterations occurring in the chorioretinal
      interface during progression of AMD from &quot;dry&quot; AMD to sight-threatening chorioretinal
      neovascularization (CNV).

      The primary statistical objective of this study is to identify the sequence of alterations
      occurring in the chorioretinal interface during progression of AMD from risk &quot;dry&quot; AMD to
      sight-threatening chorioretinal neovascularization (CNV) (wet AMD).

      Different imaging methods will be used simultaneously and at regular intervals in order to
      characterize markers or predictors of conversion to sight-threatening CNV will be: CNV
      (classic or occult) or position of CNV within 2500 µm (~1.7 disc diameters) of the foveal
      center, as evidenced by fluorescein angiography.

      This is an institutional, prospective, observation study to be performed in fellow eyes of
      patients with evidence of &quot;wet&quot; AMD in other eye. Therefore, patients will have evidence of
      exudative (&quot;wet&quot;) AMD in one eye ( the non-study eye) and non-exudative (&quot;dry&quot;) AMD in the
      fellow eye (the study eye) that is at risk for progressive to exudation &quot;wet&quot; CNV.

      Patients will exit the study at the time of developing sight-threatening CNV in the study eye
      and will be treated at the discretion of the physician.
