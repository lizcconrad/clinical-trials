      BACKGROUND Vitiligo is a common, often distressing condition. Many of the patients do not
      achieve sufficient effect from what is regarded as the treatment of choice at present, narrow
      band(NB)UVB(Tl01). There are reports on some patients partly successfully treated with
      Tacrolimus ointment.

      AIM OF THE STUDY We want to study whether Tacrolimus ointment may give an additive effect on
      symmetric vitiligo in combination with NB-UVB.

      METHODS This is a double blind left/right comparative study with 6 months treatment time.
      Patients are treated with whole body NB-UVB x 2 or x 3 weekly, in addition to Tacrolimus
      ointment versus placebo every night on affected half body sites. To measure effects we use
      photodocumentation in addition to morphometric registration of symmetric target lesions every
      6 weeks.
