  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate pain control and quality of life in patients with paraspinal
      metastases, who have receive previous radiation therapy to these lesions, using single dose
      stereotactic radiotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine the lowest dose of radiation that can be given to
      effectively control the tumor and provide effective pain relief.
