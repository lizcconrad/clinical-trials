  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avodart (dutasteride) reduces the male hormone (DHT) that leads to prostate growth and
      stimulates cancerous growth. Avodart is currently approved by the FDA to treat men with
      symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Avodart works by reducing DHT and prostate size; therefore,
      the drug may be useful in improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as frequency,
      urgency, weak stream, and urination difficulty (dysuria), among others, in men with prostate
      cancer. Avodart may be effective in men with prostate cancer who are being treated with
      hormonal therapy with one injection of Zolodex (goserelin) followed one month later with a
      trans-urethral incision of the prostate (TUIP), and three months after that, seed
      implantation (SI) of the prostate.

      The purpose of this study is to test whether Avodart (dutasteride) is effective on LUTS and
      dysuria in men with localized prostate cancer being treated with single-dose goserelin, TUIP,
      and interval SI.

      Dutasteride is an inhibitor of the 5 alpha reductase type I and type II enzymes that convert
      testosterone to DHT, the male hormone that leads to benign prostate growth and drives
      malignant growth. Dutasteride has been shown to significantly decrease intraprostatic DHT in
      men with localized prostate cancer, and additionally cause apoptosis and regression of some
      prostate cancers [Andriole, 2004a; Andriole, 2004b]. Furthermore, reduction in tumor volume
      has also been demonstrated in human prostate tissue [Iczkowski, 2004]. Dutasteride is
      currently indicated to treat symptomatic BPH in men with enlarged prostates, but is also
      being studied to reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men at risk (elevated PSA and previous
      negative biopsy). Dutasteride is clinically useful at improving lower urinary tract symptoms
      (LUTS) in men with clinically-localized prostate cancer and voiding difficulty being treated
      with single-dose goserelin, TUIP, and interval SI. [Mitcheson, personal observation].
