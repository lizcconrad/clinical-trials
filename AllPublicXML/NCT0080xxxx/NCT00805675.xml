  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of 12
      weeks of treatment with telbivudine 600 mg daily plus tenofovir DF 300 mg one daily (OD)
      taken together vs. tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily (QD) or vs telbivudine 600 mg monotherapy
      daily (QD). This is an open labeled, active controlled, viral kinetics study which means the
      subjects and study doctor will know what study drug subjects have been assigned. This study
      is open to male and female subjects, &lt;40 years of age, who have been infected with HBV for at
      least 6 months and have not received oral treatment for HBV.

    <measure>Change in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Level From Baseline to Week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline HBV DNA is defined as the last pre-dose assessment of HBV DNA. Serum HBV DNA determinations were performed at a central laboratory through use of the COBAS TaqMan™ HBV DNA assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA, USA) which utilized the Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and automated extraction by Cobas Ampliprep (threshold for detection 12 IU/mL). The Screening serum HBV DNA values must be ≥ 7 log10 copies/mL by COBAS TaqMan™ HBV DNA assay.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Achieve Hepatitis B &quot;e&quot; Antigen (HBeAg) Loss and HBeAg Seroconversion at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HBeAg loss is defined as the loss of detectable serum HBeAg in a patient who was HBeAg positive at baseline. HBeAg seroconversion is defined as HBeAg loss with detectable Hepatitis B 'e' antibody (HBeAb). HBeAg stands for hepatitis B &quot;e&quot; antigen. This antigen is a protein from the hepatitis B virus that circulates in infected blood when the virus is actively replicating. The presence of HBeAg suggests that the person is infectious and is able to spread the virus to other people.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients Who Achieve Hepatitis B &quot;e&quot; Antigen (HBeAg) Loss and HBeAg Seroconversion at Week 12</title>
        <description>HBeAg loss is defined as the loss of detectable serum HBeAg in a patient who was HBeAg positive at baseline. HBeAg seroconversion is defined as HBeAg loss with detectable Hepatitis B 'e' antibody (HBeAb). HBeAg stands for hepatitis B &quot;e&quot; antigen. This antigen is a protein from the hepatitis B virus that circulates in infected blood when the virus is actively replicating. The presence of HBeAg suggests that the person is infectious and is able to spread the virus to other people.</description>
