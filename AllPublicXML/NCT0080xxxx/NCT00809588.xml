    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the proposed therapy will delay or stop the
      progression of the participants skin cancer. This study is being done because there are
      currently no treatments which have been shown convincing to treat disease which has
      progressed. This research study is designed to evaluate the immunologic effects and clinical
      side effects of giving vaccines to patients that are made from their own skin cancer cells.

      -  The vaccines created from the participants melanoma cells are scheduled to be given to
           the participants on days 1, 8, 15, 29 and every two weeks after until the supply of
           vaccine has run out. The amount of vaccine is dependent on the total amount of cells
           yielded when the tumor is processed and treated. It is hoped that participants will
           receive at least six vaccines.

        -  The vaccines will be administered in two injections that will be placed underneath the
           participants skin. The two injections will be given at the same place on the body.

        -  If tumor sample yields enough cells, participants will also receive an injection of
           non-transduced irradiated melanoma cells. The purpose of this is to measure the amount
           of reaction of the participants immune system occuring created by the vaccine.

        -  If either the vaccine site or DTH placement site has shown a reaction, a punch-biopsy
           will be taken. This will consist of a small piece of skin tissue removed under local
           anesthesia.

        -  With vaccine #5, participants will receive a second DTH injection. Two days after the
           vaccine and DTH injection, punch biopsies will be taken of both sites.

        -  At week 10 of treatment (or earlier if necessary), participants will undergo a chest,
           abdomen and pelvic CT scan. The physician may also have participants undergo a brain MRI
           if indicated at this time.
