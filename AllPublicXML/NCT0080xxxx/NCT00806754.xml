      -  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the concomitant
           administration of ciclesonide nasal spray and azelastine nasal spray versus ciclesonide
           nasal spray alone in patients (18 years or older) with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR)
           not adequately controlled on an intranasal corticosteroid or antihistamine monotherapy

        -  The secondary objective is to investigate the safety of the concomitant administration
           of ciclesonide nasal spray and azelastine nasal spray

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 18 years of age or older at the B0 Visit.

          2. General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that in the
             investigator's judgment could interfere with study conduct, influence the
             interpretation of study observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk
             during the trial.

          3. A history of PAR for a minimum of two years immediately preceding the Screening Visit
             (B0). The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to require treatment(continuous or
             intermittent) in the past with intranasal corticosteroids and/or antihistamines and,
             in the investigator's judgment, experienced less than complete symptom alleviation on
             this prior therapy. In addition, the patient is again expected to require treatment
             throughout the study period.

          4. A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR through a
             standard prick test within one year of study start. A positive test is defined as a
             wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than the control (saline) wheal for the prick
             test. Documentation of a positive result within 12 months prior to the Screening Visit
             (B0) is acceptable.

          5. Females of childbearing potential currently using contraception must continue to use a
             medically reliable method of contraception for the entire study duration(e.g. oral,
             injectable, trans-cutaneous or implantable contraceptives or intrauterine devices or
             double-barrier protection).Females who are not sexually active must agree to use
             double-barrier protection should they become active during the course of the study.
             Women of childbearing potential, or less than 1 year postmenopausal, will require a
             negative plasma pregnancy test at the Screening Visit (B0). Females will be considered
             to be of non-child-bearing potential and will not require a urine pregnancy test if at
             least one of the following apply:

               -  More than one year post-menopausal

               -  Had a hysterectomy

               -  Had bilateral ovariectomy or salpingectomy or tubal ligation

               -  Has congenital sterility

          6. Patients on intranasal corticosteroids and antihistamines should be on a stable dose
             for at least 4 weeks.

          7. Patients must complete a 24-hour reflective total nasal symptom assessment at the
             Screening Visit (B0) and score a total of 6 or greater (out of 12).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy, nursing, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or sperm) for
             in vitro fertilization during the study period or for 30 days following the study
             period.

          2. History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps (within the
             last 60 days) or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent
             nasal biopsy (within the last 60 days), nasal trauma, or surgery and atrophic rhinitis
             or rhinitis medicamentosa (within the last 60 days).

          3. Participation in any investigational drug trial within the 30 days preceding the
             Screening Visit.

          4. A known hypersensitivity to any intranasal corticosteroid, antihistamine or any of the
             excipients in the formulation.

          5. History of a respiratory infection or disorder [including, but not limited to
             bronchitis, pneumonia, the common cold, acute or chronic sinusitis, flu, severe acute
             respiratory syndrome (SARS)] within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit, or
             development of a respiratory infection during the Screening Period.

          6. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the preceding two years.

          7. History of a positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

          8. Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or
             routine use of b-agonists; intermittent use of b-agonists is acceptable.

          9. Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within the prescribed (per protocol)
             time since last dose period prior to the Screening Visit (B0) and during entire
             treatment duration.

         10. Use of antibiotic therapy for acute conditions within 14 days prior to the Screening
             Visit (B0). Low doses of antibiotics taken for prophylaxis are permitted if the
             therapy was started prior to the Screening Visit AND is expected to continue
             throughout the trial.

         11. Initiation of immunotherapy during the study period or dose escalation during the
             study period. However, initiation of immunotherapy 90 days or more prior to the
             Screening Visit AND use of a stable (maintenance) dose (30 days or more) may be
             considered for inclusion.

         12. Non-vaccinated exposure to or active infection with, chickenpox or measles within the
             21 days preceding the Screening Visit (B0).

         13. Exposure to systemic corticosteroids for any indication, chronic or intermittent
             (e.g.: contact dermatitis), during the past 2 months, or presence of an underlying
             condition that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with corticosteroids
             during the course of the study.

         14. Use of topical corticosteroids in concentrations in excess of 1% hydrocortisone for
             dermatological conditions during the past 1 month, or presence of an underlying
             condition that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with such preparations
             during the course of the study.

         15. History of epilepsy or seizures (excluding febrile seizures).

         16. History of coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or other clinically
             significant cardiovascular disease.

         17. Patients using combination treatment for allergic rhinitis (e.g. intranasal
             corticosteroid and antihistamine).

         18. Have any of the following conditions that are judged by the investigator to be
             clinically significant and/or affect the subject's ability to participate in the
             clinical trial, might interfere with the study, require treatment or make
             implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult:

               -  Impaired hepatic function including alcohol-related liver disease or cirrhosis;

               -  History of ocular disturbances e.g. glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts;

               -  Any systemic infection;

               -  Hematological, hepatic, renal, endocrine (except for controlled diabetes mellitus
                  or postmenopausal symptoms or hypothyroidism);· Gastrointestinal disease;

               -  Malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma).

         19. Clinical site employees and their immediate relatives are excluded from study
             participation.
