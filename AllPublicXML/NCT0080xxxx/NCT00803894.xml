    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the transcriptional signature of Notch Inhibition
      by testing hair and blood samples on healthy male volunteers who have received MK0752 vs
      placebo for possible future biomarkers in the treatment of cancer or Alzheimers Disease
