      This is a phase I study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using MRI/MRS to identify
      the dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) and to selectively boost the lesion using inverse
      planned high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy.

      The main objective is to exploit the ability of MRI/MRS to identify cancer regions within the
      prostate or the dominant intraprostatic lesions (DIL). The imaging data will be combined with
      the treatment planning CT images to define a treatment plan that will boost the dose
      delivered to the DIL up to 150% of the prescribed dose. Dose to the whole prostate and the
      dose delivered to adjacent organs will not change. This is accomplished by using inverse
      treatment planning software that can focus normally occurring high dose regions within the
      target volume to coincide with the DIL.

      After enrollment, each patient will have a MRI/MRS before starting treatment. Hormonal
      therapy and external beam radiotherapy will be given based on current standard of practice.
      During HDR brachytherapy, information about the location of tumor within the prostate will be
      used to design the brachytherapy treatment plan. We will try to increase dose to DIL by
      coincide existing high dose region on DIL using inverse planning software. Dose to prostate,
      and adjacent structure will remain the same as the current treatment practice. Timing and the
      delivery of brachytherapy will not change from our current practice. After the treatment,
      each patient will remain on study and follow for 12 months and treatment toxicity will be
      evaluated. A two-stage study design will be applied with a stopping rule for safety. Once a
      patient comes off study he will be routinely followed for disease outcome and any late
      toxicities.

      1.1 The goal of radiotherapy is to deliver a high dose of radiation to the target volume
      while minimizing the dose to the surrounding normal tissue. Using CT based three-dimensional
      treatment planning system and multiple field technique, the three dimensional conformal
      radiotherapy (CRT) has become the standard of care for external beam radiotherapy for
      prostate cancer. Multiple institutional studies and prospective randomized trials have been
      done documenting the safety and efficacy of this modality. Brachytherapy is an alternative
      method of delivering conformal radiotherapy for treatment of prostate cancer. The technique
      of HDR prostate brachytherapy has been in clinical practice since the 1980's [1-13]. Kovacs
      et al reported one of the earliest experiences using HDR brachytherapy boost at University of
      Kiel.[10, 11, 13] Patients treated were mostly T2b-T3, G3. They used a combination of split
      course external beam radiotherapy and two 15 Gy HDR treatments. They reported 18% positive
      biopsy rate 18 months post treatment. The result was updated at 10 years and 78 percent of
      171 patients remained free of disease at median follow-up of 55 months. Mate et al at Swedish
      Medical Center reported their experience with HDR brachytherapy [9]. They used a more
      moderated hypofractionated schema with four treatments of 3-4 Gy fractions of HDR treatments
      combined with 45-50 Gy of external beam radiotherapy. They recommended routine cystoscopy at
      the end of the implant procedure to ensure the catheters are placed at the proper depth and
      to avoid injuring the urethra. Pretreatment patient characteristics were stage T1b to T3c,
      mean initial PSA was 12.9 and Gleason grade ranges 3 to 9. They reported 84% 5-year
      biochemical disease free survival. Martinez et al at the William Beaumont Hospital reported
      the only on-going prospective dose escalation trial using HDR brachytherapy as a boost. There
      have been multiple updates of their results.[5-7, 12] They have continued to dose escalate
      using increasingly larger fractions of HDR treatment range from 5.5-6.5 Gy x 3 to 8.25-11.5
      Gy x 2 combined with 46 Gy of external beam radiotherapy. As of their most recent update,
      they have shown acceptable toxicity level using 9.5 Gy x 2 treatments. Patients with PSA ≥
      10, T ≥ T2b, and Gleason score ≥ 7 were selected for the trial. Despite a high frequency of
      poor prognostic factors, the actuarial biochemical control rate was 89% at 2 years and 63% at
      5 years. The 5-year actuarial rates of local failure and distant metastasis were 16% and 14%,
      respectively. Borghede et al. at Goteborg University in Sweden reported their experience
      using 50 Gy of external beam radiotherapy combined with 2 fractions of 10 Gy HDR boost.[1, 2]
      They used ultrasound to target tumor nodules within the prostate and gave an additional 5 Gy
      boost during each HDR treatment. Patients included in the study were T1-3, and grade 1-3.
      They report a 4% positive biopsy rate at 18-months post treatment. This is a remarkably low
      positive biopsy rate considering no hormonal therapy was used in the study. The results from
      these clinical trials and others have shown the technique of HDR brachytherapy for prostate
      cancer is feasible with minimal morbidity. Other institutional trials have suggested HDR
      boost may be more efficacious compared to external beam radiotherapy alone or external beam
      radiotherapy with short term hormonal therapy. Results of these studies need to be confirmed
      in large multi-institutional trials.
