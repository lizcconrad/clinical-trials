      This study is designed to investigate the effect of body posture (particularly when sleeping)
      on the pressure in the eye. The effect of body posture on progressive glaucoma (glaucoma
      where a significant change i.e. a disc hemorrhage has occurred) is not known.

      The study will involve being admitted to the Sleep Unit of the University Health Network at
      Toronto Western Hospital for 1 night (14 hours). IOP will be measured in both eyes every 2
      hours with a Tonopen, along with brachial blood pressure (BP), in the sitting position until
      the patients reach their normal sleep cycle time. Patients will then be asked to sleep in
      either lying down or reclining at a 30 degrees position and have the IOP measurements and
      brachial BP every 2 hours in that position.

      The same cohort of patients will then be invited for a repeat 14 hour IOP and BP measurement
      but will change their position, i.e. sitting before will now be supine and vice versa.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This pilot study included patients with progressive NTG or POAG as evidenced by disc

             flat

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patients who were not able to sign a consent or lying flat during sleep
