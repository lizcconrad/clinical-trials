  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the use of anidulafungin for the
      treatment of Candida infection in patients with an abnormal immune system. It is expected
      that anidulafungin will be at least as safe and as effective as the comparator drug,
      caspofungin.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>Pfizer has the right to review disclosures, requesting a delay of less than 60 days. Investigator will postpone single center publications until after disclosure of pooled data (all sites), less than 12 months from study completion/termination at all participating sites. Investigator may not disclose previously undisclosed confidential information other than study results.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Study prematurely terminated due to slow enrollment, not due to safety issues. Meaningful interpretation and comparison of treatment outcomes with caspofungin was difficult due to low number of participants (n=3) with confirmed Candida infection.</limitations_and_caveats>
