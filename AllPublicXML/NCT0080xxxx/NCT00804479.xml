  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the long-term consequences (8 years) of initiating patients with Parkinson's
      disease on either pramipexole or levodopa. We hypothesize that patients initiating therapy
      with pramipexole compared with levodopa will demonstrate less self-reported disability as
      measured by the Modified Schwab and England (S/E) scale 8 years after randomization.
