  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study was a pilot, double blind, randomized controlled trial to (1) evaluate the
      feasibility of an online obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening intervention, (2) estimate
      effect size for planning of future studies, and (3) test the hypothesis that the
      intervention, compared to a control condition, would lead more individuals to discuss OSA
      with their healthcare provider.
