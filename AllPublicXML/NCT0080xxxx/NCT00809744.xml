    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to compare glucose handling (insulin secretion and
      insulin sensitivity) in 100 persons with low and 50 persons with normal-high levels of
      vitamin D, using a hyperglycemic clamp technique, were sugar is given intravenously for 3
      hours in order to keep the blood sugar level at 10 mmol/L. Those with low vitamin D levels
      will be randomized to treatment with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 40 000 IU/week or placebo
      for 6 months before a new clamp is performed.

      The study hypothesis is that persons with low vitamin D levels have impaired glucose handling
      which might be improved by vitamin D supplementation.
