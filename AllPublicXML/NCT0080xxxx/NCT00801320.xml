      The purpose of this research study is to collect tumor samples at the time of surgery and
      store them for possible use as part of an experimental vaccine study for the participants
      cancer in the future.

      -  Even if tumor sample is collected, the participant is under no obligation to participate
           in the vaccine study.

        -  Participants will have their regularly planned surgery as described by their surgeon.
           During the surgery, tumor samples will be collected. We will only collect tumor that is
           not needed and could otherwise be thrown away.

        -  The tumor samples will be frozen and placed in storage for up to two years.
