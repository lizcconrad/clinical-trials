      This is a multi-center, open-label non-randomized dose-escalation trial of vorinostat given
      in combination with vinorelbine. Cohorts will be treated with a fixed dose of vinorelbine
      (25mg/m²/week continuously, representing the schedule that has been approved). Patients
      eligible will be enrolled into a standard 3+3 design with a starting dose of vorinostat at
      200 mg po qd 7/21 (weekly schedule). Then, further dose levels will be explored. Toxicity of
      the schedule will be assessed during the first cycle. Patients may receive up to 6 cycles of
      study medication. Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to assess
      pharmacokinetic endpoints.

Barring dose limiting toxicities the dose of vorinostat will escalate in several steps (300 mg po qd 7/21 days, 300 mg po qd 21/21 days, 400 mg po qd 7/21 days, 400 mg po qd 21/21 days).
Patients may receive a maximum of 6 cycles of study medication.</description>
