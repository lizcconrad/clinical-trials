    <textblock>
      Falls, with a high prevalence, high risk and consequent medical and social costs, are an
      important issue for medical care and health promotion in the elderly. The prevalence of falls
      in the elderly lies in between 10-20%. Falls have become the second leading cause of death
      from injury for the elderly in Taiwan. A community-based study showed that, among those old
      adults after a fall, 27.3% were severely injured, 53.9% got a minor injury, and only 18.9%
      remained intact. Another study revealed that among fall injury events reported, 42% were
      hospitalized, of whom 2.2% died in hospital, and 37% entered nursing homes after discharge
      from hospital. In addition to physical discomfort, half of the elderly fallers would become
      disabled, and bring a heavy burden of social economy and family care. It was estimated that
      there were 460 thousand of old people who had a fall, and 125 thousand of them were injured
      in Taiwan, 2007. Research evidence shows that falls prevention is effective and feasible.
      Although primary falls prevention programs have been conducted at the community level and
      extended to 25 counties and cities for many years, they were not integrated with secondary
      and tertiary prevention. The study aims to establish an integrated fall prevention model,
      combined with primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. The model will be practiced in
      participating hospitals and communities, with a randomized control trial (RCT) design to
      examine its feasibility and effectiveness. Our study subjects are persons aged 65 and over
      who live in communities, go to out-patient departments (OPD) or emergency room (ER) care.

      Tasks for implementation

        1. To organize a multidisciplinary team for integrated falls prevention.

        2. To draft a guideline for falls prevention in the elderly.

        3. To set up a multidisciplinary fall clinic.

        4. To set up a falls prevention classroom.

        5. To enhance cooperate between hospitals and primary care units to fulfill the guideline
           for falls prevention in the elderly.
