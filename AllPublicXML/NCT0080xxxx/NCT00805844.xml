    <textblock>
      To determine if using usual clinical practice plus a depth of anesthesia monitor, SedLine, to
      guide anesthetic administration improves the quality and ease of MEP monitoring in patients
      undergoing corrective spinal procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) monitoring during spine surgery is now used routinely. However
      it is affected by a variety of anesthetics including fluctuating and/or excessively deep or
      light levels of anesthesia. A common problem is maintaining an overall constancy and adequacy
      of anesthesia. Individual patients' responses to anesthesia can differ greatly from
      population means and can complicate the interpretation of MEPs. False alarms can have
      significant consequences. One strategy to minimize the anesthetic induced variability of
      MEPs, and thereby improve the monitoring overall, is to keep the patient's anesthetic state
      (or &quot;depth&quot;) in a narrow range during surgery. This study tests whether using a commercially
      available depth of anesthesia monitor in addition to usual clinical practice improves the
      quality of MEPs.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the SedLine Monitor, which uses an EEG derived
      assessment of anesthetic depth, may facilitate MEP monitoring if it is kept within a narrow
      range during spine surgery. Because SedLine recommends maintaining their Index between 30 and
      40 during surgical anesthesia, this is the range used in the primary hypothesis.
