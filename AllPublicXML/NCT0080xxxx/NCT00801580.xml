      The patient receive 2 different drug combinations on this study. The first combination will
      consist of an intensive chemotherapy regimen (cyclophosphamide, mesna, methotrexate,
      doxorubicin liposomal or doxorubicin, vincristine, ARA-C (cytarabine) and dexamethasone). The
      second combination will consist of another intensive chemotherapy regimen (methotrexate and
      Ara-C [cytarabine]).
