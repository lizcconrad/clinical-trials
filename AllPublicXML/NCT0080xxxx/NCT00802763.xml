    <textblock>
      This study was designed to validate the color appearance on the newly developed panty liner
      (NORMA-SENSE). The NORMA-SENSE liner changes color when worn by the user and comes into
      contact with vaginal secretion with an elevated pH level, without false positives due to
      urine remains or incontinence. The study will also asses the physical comfort in using
      NORMA-SENSE and the result reading clarity which includes the ability to visualize and
      interpret the NORMA-SENSE strip results.
