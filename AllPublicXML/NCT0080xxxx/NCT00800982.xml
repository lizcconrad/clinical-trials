  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, pilot study. A total of 30 subjects (15 in each study
      arm) will be enrolled in this 6 month study to evaluate whether the addition of narrow band
      UVB (NB-UVB) phototherapy can enhance the efficacy of etanercept's maintenance dose, 50 mg
      once a week, in obese psoriasis patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase I, all subjects will receive etanercept's induction dose, 50 mg twice a week, for a
      total of 12 weeks. In Phase II, all subjects will receive etanercept's maintenance dose, 50
      mg once a week, during Weeks 12-24. Those subjects randomized to the treatment arm will
      receive NB-UVB phototherapy 3 times a week during Phase II. In order to ensure homogeneity
      between the NB-UVB arm and non-NB-UVB arm, subjects will be randomized according to their
      Body Mass Index (BMI). The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score and Physician Global
      Assessment (PGA) will be calculated at each visit to determine the effectiveness of the
      etanercept and NB-UVB treatment during both phases of the study. The hypothesis is that the
      combination of NB-UVB phototherapy three times a week and etanercept maintenance dose (50 mg
      once a week) will enhance the efficacy of the maintenance dose alone in obese patients (BMI
      &gt;30) with moderate to severe psoriasis.

    <description>Psoriasis area severity index was used to determine the number of patients in each treatment arm who had 75% improvement in their psoriasis.

In addition, for months 3-6, subjects will receive Narrow Band Ultraviolet B phototherapy three times a week for 12 weeks in addition to the etanercept maintenance dose. The safety and efficacy of the combination therapy will be evaluated by the registered phototherapy nurses at each phototherapy visit and by the study investigator at monthly visits.

        <title>Psoriasis Area Severity Index. This Scale Ranges From 0-72, 0 Being no Disease, and 72 Being Most Severe. The Number of Patients Who Achieved 75% Improvement of Their Psoriasis at the End of 24 Weeks Are Indicated in the Outcomes Data Below.</title>
        <description>Psoriasis area severity index was used to determine the number of patients in each treatment arm who had 75% improvement in their psoriasis. This scale uses the characteristics of the psoriasis, such as body surface area, redness, thickness, and scaling, to determine the severity score.</description>

        <population>All patients that completed the trial through week 24 were used for analysis.</population>

            <title>1 (Etanercept Only)</title>
            <description>Subjects will only be treated with etanercept. This is given at the standard FDA approved dosage of 50 mg twice weekly x 3 months then 50 mg once weekly x 3 months. No UVB will be given. Sham UVB will not be used because the subjects are not blinded because they often know they are receiving sham UVB due to differences in light intensity and heat.</description>

            <description>Subjects will receive etanercept. This is given at the standard FDA approved dosage of 50 mg twice weekly x 3 months then 50 mg once weekly x 3 months.
In addition, for months 3-6, subjects will receive NB-UVB phototherapy three times a week for 12 weeks in addition to the etanercept maintenance dose. The safety and efficacy of the combination therapy will be evaluated by the registered phototherapy nurses at each phototherapy visit and by the study investigator at monthly visits. NB-UVB therapy will be adjusted according to the clinical judgment of the UCSF Psoriasis Treatment Center phototherapy staff.</description>
