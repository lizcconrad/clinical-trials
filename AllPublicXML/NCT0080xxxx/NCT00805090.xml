      An open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of DIC075V in
      subjects with mild or moderate chronic renal insufficiency and in patients with mild chronic
      hepatic impairment compared. Additionally, the healthy adult volunteers will participate in a
      randomized, open-label, crossover study in which they will receive Sporanox® to compare the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of HPβCD when administered in DIC075V compared to Sporanox®.

      For the renal and hepatic subjects, following the screening visit, eligible subjects will
      return to the study site on Study Day 0 and remain at the site for 2 nights and 2 days. Study
      drug administration will occur on Study Day 1. Subjects will be discharged on Study Day 2
      after the last blood sample has been collected. Subjects will return 7 ± 3 days after dosing
      with study drug to have final safety assessments performed. For the healthy subjects,
      following the screening visit, eligible subjects will return to the study site on Study Day 0
      and remain at the site for 3 nights and 3 days. Study drug administration will occur on Study
      Day 1 and Study Day 2. Subjects will be discharged on Study Day 3 after the last blood sample
      has been collected. Subjects will return 7 ± 3 days after receiving the last dose of study
      drug to have final safety assessments performed.

          -  The subject must be willing and able to provide signed informed consent.

          -  The subject must be willing and able to stay at the clinical site for the required
             number of days and nights and return to the clinic in 7 ± 3 days after dosing with

        Inclusion Criteria (subjects with mild or moderate chronic renal insufficiency):

          -  The subject must have mild or moderate chronic renal insufficiency and documented
             history of stable renal disease for 1 month prior to screening and clinical laboratory
             test results consistent with the underlying disease for renal impairment.

        Inclusion Criteria (subjects with mild chronic hepatic impairment):

          -  The subject must have mild chronic hepatic impairment, as defined by Child-Pugh
             Classification A, Score of 5-6 and a bilirubin of ≤ 2.5 mg/dl.
