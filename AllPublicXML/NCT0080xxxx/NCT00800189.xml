  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an alternative imaging protocol done at the time
      of radiotherapy treatments for patients with breast cancer can improve accuracy in patient
      set-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate patient positioning is critical in Radiation Therapy. Electronic imaging is used to
      compare a patient's actual treatment position, with that which was planned from an initial CT
      scan. Radiation Therapists compare planned and actual images using analysis software to
      determine if differences are within acceptable tolerances. At the VIC, we use 3 different
      breast imaging protocols depending on the patient set-up and treatment technique. Findings
      from our recent retrospective planning study show that our current electronic imaging
      protocols miss some clinically significant patient set-up errors, particularly in the
      medial/lateral direction, and that these errors can be better detected with the use of an
      anterior image. The purpose of this study is to test these findings prospectively in clinical
      practice, through the direct comparison of our current protocols with a proposed new
      protocol, which would include an anterior electronic portal image (EPI).
