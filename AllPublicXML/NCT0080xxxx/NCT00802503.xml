      Rationale: Enteral nutrition (EN) in the intensive care (ICU) patients is recommended as a
      standard of care. However, EN alone is often associated with insufficient energy intakes and
      increased complication rates. Recently the investigators proposed to decrease this deficit by
      combining EN and supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN) whenever EN is insufficient (&lt; 60%
      of their predicted energy needs) at day 3 after admission in the ICU.

      Objective: This study aims at: a/ investigating if the delivery of optimal nutrition support
      (100 % of predicted energy targets) in ICU patients by the combined administration of SPN and
      EN optimizes their clinical outcome; b/ implementing the new ICU nutrition guidelines.

      Study design: Prospective, controlled, randomized clinical study.

      Study site: Service of Intensive Care, Geneva University Hospital.

      Patient population: 220 ICU patients to be included: expected length of stay &gt; 5 days,
      expected survival &gt; 7 days, no contraindication to EN, obtained informed consent from
      themselves or their next of keen.

      Exclusion criteria: refusal of consent, age &lt; 18 years, short bowel syndrome, significant
      persistent gastrointestinal dysfunction with ileus, high output proximal fistula (&gt; 1,5
      liter/d), patients receiving PN.

      Nutrition: At day 3 after admission, if energy input is &lt; 60%; patients are randomized into
      either the &quot;Control group&quot; (EN alone) or the &quot;SPN group&quot; (EN + PN) to reach 100% of their
      predicted energy needs. Tight glycaemic control (target 6.0 to 8.3 mmol/l) to be achieved
      according to our local practice by insulin administration.

      Study endpoints:

        -  Primary: nosocomial infections (CDC criteria)

        -  Secondary: Mechanical ventilation duration, ICU and hospital length of stay, antibiotic
           free days, ICU complications (extra-renal epuration, neurological, cardiac and
           respiratory complications), energy and protein balance, 28 days clinical outcome.

      Introduction:

      Nutritional support of the intensive care (ICU) patients is recommended as a standard of
      care. It is also strongly recommended to start enteral feeding as soon as possible whenever
      the gastrointestinal tract is functioning (1). However, studies have repeatedly shown that
      with enteral support alone, insufficient energy and protein intakes often occur (2). The
      resulting energy and protein deficit is associated with an increased complication rate in ICU
      patients (3-5). Recently we proposed to decrease this deficit by promoting a combined
      nutrition support by enteral nutrition (EN) and supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN)
      whenever EN is insufficient (6).

      Contrary to former beliefs, recent meta-analyses show that parenteral nutrition (PN) does not
      carry excess mortality (7, 8). These reports convey a concept that is a major break-through
      in current routine of nutritional support in ICU patients by promoting a much wider use of
      PN. SPN could be the optimal modality to provide the calculated energy targets if this cannot
      be reached by EN alone. To improve ICU patient's outcome and minimise complications, we
      propose to implement feeding protocols which combine both EN and PN, when EN is insufficient
      to cover more than 60% of caloric needs at day 4 to reach 100% of the energy targets by
      adding PN from day 4 (6).

      Hypothesis:

      The administration of SPN, in ICU patients receiving &lt; 60% of targeted energy needs by EN
      alone, has a positive impact on their clinical outcome by optimising their nutritional
      support (reduced infectious complications rate, mechanical ventilation days, duration of ICU
      and hospital length of stay and rehabilitation).

      Objective:

      The aim of the present study is to investigate if the delivery of optimal nutrition support
      (100 % of predicted energy targets) in ICU patients achieved with the combined administration
      of SPN and EN optimizes their clinical outcome.
