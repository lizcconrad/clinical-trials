  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized controlled clinical trial, double blinded, with the purpose to compare the
      use of EMLA - local anesthetic (lidocaine and prilocaine), and or nitrous oxide at 50% in
      oxygen (Livopan®) to prevent and treat pain in pediatric patients aged four to 16 years old
      submitted to lumbar puncture for intrathecal chemotherapy. Pain was assessed using the Wong
      Baker faces scale and the visual numeric scale during six observational periods: baseline;
      three minutes after gas administration and before the first attempt of lumbar puncture;
      during the first lumbar puncture attempt; during the chemotherapy administration; during
      needle remove and three minutes after gas interruption. All the studied procedures will have
      clinical indication and will not be held by the researcher. The children was random divided
      within three groups A, B and C as follow: Group A (n=16)EMLA + Livopan; Group B (n=19)EMLA +
      gas placebo (oxygen); Group C (n=17) Livopan® + placebo cream.

      Primary outcome was the detection of a difference of 20% or more in the visual numeric scale
      between the three treatment groups during the first attempt of lumbar puncture.
