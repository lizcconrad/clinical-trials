  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is an important clinical feature in cystic fibrosis. Better exercise capacity has
      been associated with better patient outcomes and quality of life. Exercise-induced
      bronchospasm is a condition, often associated with asthma, which may make exercise difficult.
      The role that exercise-induced bronchospasm has in people with cystic fibrosis is unknown.
      This study is designed to determine how often exercise-induced bronchospasm occurs in cystic
      fibrosis.

      We anticipate that Visit 1 will take approximately three hours. This will include obtaining
      informed consent, completing baseline demographic and quality of life questionnaires, brief
      physical exam, measuring exhaled nitric oxide level, skin allergy testing, obtaining blood
      and sputum samples, and performing pulmonary function testing before and after
      bronchodilators.

      Visit 2 will take approximately two and one-half hours. This will include performing Eucapnic
      Voluntary Hyperventilation, measuring exhaled nitric oxide levels, and obtaining blood and
      sputum samples.

      Visit 3 will take approximately two and one-half hours. This will include performing
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing followed by serial spirometry, measuring exhaled nitric
      oxide levels, and obtaining blood and sputum samples.
