      This study will examine the safety of giving the experimental drug, resiniferatoxin (RTX), to
      treat severe pain in patients with advanced cancer. RTX is a chemical extracted from a
      cactus-like plant. It is similar to capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot pepper. RTX has
      relieved pain and reduced the need for pain medication in several animal experiments. It
      works by destroying nerves that transmit pain information.

      People at least 18 years of age with severe pain from advanced cancer at or below the level
      of the chest that cannot be controlled with standard treatments may be eligible for this
      study. Participants undergo the following procedures:

      Pretreatment Visit

      Before beginning treatment with RTX, patients give a medical history and undergo a physical
      examination that includes:

        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG)

        -  Blood draw

        -  Urinalysis

        -  Neurological examinations

        -  Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)

        -  Eye examination

        -  MRI

        -  Urology assessment

        -  Pregnancy test, when appropriate

        -  Questionnaires to collect information on health, personality, mood, pain levels and
           symptoms.

           2-Day Hospitalization

      Patients are hospitalized for 2 days for RTX injection and monitoring, as follows:

        -  RTX injection: RTX is injected in the operating room under general anesthesia. It is
           given through a catheter placed in the patient s spine. The catheter is also used to
           obtain samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the clear fluid that bathes the spinal cord.
           The fluid is examined to assess drug effects and side effects, chemical changes in the
           content of the CSF associated with RTX, and how RTX is handled by the body.

        -  Post-injection monitoring, including:

        -  Surveys about symptoms such as pain or weakness

        -  Neurological examinations

        -  Blood and CSF sampling

        -  EKG

        -  AEs

      Outpatient followup

        -  Vitals

        -  Blood draw, Urinalysis, neurological and sensory testing, EKG on days 7, 14 and 30 after
           the injection

        -  MRI scans of the head and back, Urology assessment and PEFR on day 15 after the
           injection

        -  Eye examination

        -  Follow-up phone calls monthly for 6 months

      Pain continues to be a major problem in patients with advanced cancer. Resiniferatoxin (RTX),
      a potent member of the family of drugs that includes capsaicin, selectively and irreversibly
      destroys the neurons (or their axons) transmitting chronic pain sensation. Intrathecal
      injection of RTX in several animal species has demonstrated a high level of safety,
      specificity, and efficacy in treating severe pain. This first-in-human, dose-escalation study
      will investigate the intrathecal administration of RTX in cancer patients with severe pain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To investigate the safety and efficacy of RTX administered intrathecally in subjects with
      severe refractory pain associated with advanced cancer.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Up to 45 subjects will be accrued. Eligible subjects will be greater than or equal to 18
      years of age, have a clinical and histological diagnosis of advanced malignancy, and have
      severe pain due to malignancy that is at or below the level of the chest and not adequately
      relieved by other pain control therapies.

      DESIGN:

      This is a single site, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study using a modified
      Fibonacci scheme. The starting dose of RTX was 13 micrograms given as a 2 mL injection via an
      intra-spinal catheter over approximately 30 seconds followed by a 1 mL flush. Five

      subjects were dosed at this level and 3 were dosed at the 26 g dose level at the same volume
      of injectate, flush and injection time. Pursuant to the study design, RTX doses were to be
      increased in progressively smaller percentage increments with each dose escalation to occur
      in sequential groups of 3 subjects until 1 escalation above the effective dose in 100% of
      subjects (ED100), completion of the 100 g dose level, or establishment of the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), whichever occurs first. The total duration of study participation for
      any subject will be up to 7 months.

      The amended RTX injection technique will be a 1 mL injection over 60 seconds (0.25 mL/15
      seconds) given via infusion pump, followed by flushing of the IT catheter with the minimum
      volume of sterile, preservative-free saline necessary to clear the internal volume of the

      catheter used for the injection. Two patients were treated at the new starting dose or
      13micrograms with the new injection technique; four more patients are needed to complete this
      cohort.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary study outcome is the ED100, the MTD, or the maximum dose administered, whichever
      is achieved first during dose escalation. The primary pain variable for determining the ED100
      is the daily worst pain score averaged over a 7-day period during the 3 weeks before RTX
      dosing and during Days 8 through 14 after dosing. The numerical rating scale (NRS),
      administered verbally during a daily telephone interview, will be the primary pain assessment
      instrument. For a given subject, the treatment will be considered effective if the subject
      experiences a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the mean daily worst pain score
      assessed by NRS (evaluated at Study Day 15).

      Secondary outcome measures will be other surveys of pain, including an assessment of worst
      daily pain by the visual analog scale, and assessments of function and quality of life.

      Safety assessments will include hematology; serum clinical chemistry tests; cerebrospinal
      fluid examinations; physical, neurological, and eye examinations; reporting of adverse
      events; electrocardiograms; and findings of magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and
      brain.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patient inclusion criteria are based on inadequate control of pain despite best efforts
        including appropriate use of medication(s). Thus, criteria include the following:

          1. Age 18 years or older.

          2. Clinical and histological diagnosis of cancer with disease that has not adequately
             responded to standard therapies. A pathology report documenting malignancy is
             required.

          3. Subject not currently seeking or receiving potentially curative therapies for cancer
             (e.g., chemotherapy or immunotherapy). Curative cancer therapy may be sought after the
             Day 15 clinic visit, and palliative anti-tumor therapy is allowed as long as the
             subject was established on that therapy prior to enrollment (see exclusion criterion
             7).

          4. Mean daily worst pain NRS score of greater than or equal to 6 for pain at or below the
             T6 dermatome (level of the chest) that is associated with a malignant disease. The
             mean score must be derived from recordings on at least 4 of 7 consecutive days within
             3 weeks preceding treatment.

          5. Alternative methods of pain control are not sufficiently effective, not indicated, not
             tolerated, and/or refused by the subject, as determined by the Pain and Palliative
             Care Service (PPCS). Alternative methods of pain control include, but are not limited
             to, the following:

               -  Opioids (all routes of administration including neuraxial infustion)

               -  Adjuvant pain medications such as antidepressants, corticosteroids, local
                  anesthetics, and antiseizure medications

               -  Procedures such as catheter or implantable pump placement for delivery of
                  analgesic medication or neurolytic interventions (including intercostal, superior
                  hypogastric, or celiac plexus blocks)

               -  Complementary medicine approaches

               -  Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation

               -  Radiation therapy

          6. Reasonable expectation that the subject will be able to complete the study through the
             30-day follow-up.

          7. Medical clearance from referring physician, consisting of a statement indicating an
             adequate recovery period from other previous trials/medication.

          8. Formal review of the subject s medical records and written approval for his/her
             inclusion in the study by 3 separate persons:

               -  Principal Investigator (PI) or an Associate Investigator (AI)

               -  Medical oncologist or oncologic surgeon

               -  A member of the PPCS at the NIH.

          9. International normalized ratio (INR; from prothrombin time [PT]) &lt;1.5 and partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to the upper limit of the reference
             range. The INR and PTT may be corrected (e.g., by administration of blood products,
             vitamin K, etc.), provided a repeat blood draw confirms that the values meet this
             inclusion criterion.

         10. Platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000/mm3. Platelets will be transfused as
             necessary to raise the platelet count to greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3 prior to
             dosing.

         11. Ability to stop any anticoagulant (e.g., Coumadin) and antiplatelet therapies (e.g.,
             aspirin) before and during intrathecal catheter placement according to accepted

             the ability and willingness to use an effective method of contraception during the
             study. Effective methods of birth control include:

               1. hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injected hormones, or vaginal ring),

               2. intrauterine device,

               3. barrier methods (condom or diaphragm) combined with spermicide, or

               4. surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or vasectomy).

         15. Availability of a responsible adult to live with the subject through the Day 15 visit.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Primary pain source from anatomical regions at T5 dermatome or above.

          2. Pain due to causes other than cancer or its treatment that is moderate to severe in
             intensity.

          3. Anatomic abnormality or pathology of the spinal cord and/or intrathecal space on
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that could increase the risk of adverse effects of
             intrathecal catheter placement or interfere with CSF flow.

             by symptoms, history, physical examination (including neurological and eye
             examination), and/or MRI.

          5. Presence of an intrathecal shunt device (e.g., ventriculo-peritoneal and
             ventriculo-atrial shunts).

          6. Anticipating initiation of palliative anti-tumor therapy or significant changes to
             current palliative anti-tumor therapy before completion of the Day 15 visit.

          7. Documented allergy to chili peppers or capsaicin (e.g., hives, wheal).

          8. Contraindication to MRI or MRI contrast.

          9. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

         10. Clinically significant disorder or condition that might interfere with study
