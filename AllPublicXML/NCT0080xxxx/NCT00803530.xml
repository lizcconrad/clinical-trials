    <description>Loading phase (week 1): ATO 0.3 mg/Kg/die for 5 consecutive days.
Subsequent phase (from week 2 to week 16): ATO 0.25 mg/kg twice a week (day 2 and 5 of every week).
Ascorbic acid 1000 mg IV within 30 minutes after each arsenic trioxide infusion for 16 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>ATO will be diluted in 250 ml of normal saline solution at a dosage of 0.3 mg/Kg during the first week of therapy and at a dosage of 0.25 mg/Kg during the subsequent weeks (week 2 to 16), and administered intravenously over a 1-2 hour period.
The dose of ascorbic acid will be 1000 mg in 100 cc D5W or normal saline solution (NaCl 0.9 %) (protected from light and air) administered as an IV infusion over 15 to 30 minutes. The dosing solution is not to be mixed with any alkaline solution.</description>
