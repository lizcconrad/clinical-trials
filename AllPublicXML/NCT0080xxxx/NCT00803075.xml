      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is safe and effective to use the TALENT AAA
      Stent Graft System as a treatment for AAAs in patients who are also candidates for
      conventional surgical aneurysm repair.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:1. Patient has one of the following:

          -  Aneurysm &gt;4 cm in diameter, or an aneurysm that has increased in size by 0.5 cm in the
             last 6-months

          -  Aneurysm is 1.5 times larger than the diameter of the normal infrarenal aorta or
             symptomatic

          -  Aneurysm is saccular

          -  Penetrating ulcer 2. Patient's vascular dimensions must be in the range that can be
             safely treated with the stent graft available to the physician at the time of the
             procedure.

             3. Patient has endovascular access to the aneurysmal site with the Introducer Sheath
             or Delivery Catheter of the appropriate ize device chosen for treatment.

             4. Patient has anatomic characteristics suitable for endovascular repair. 5. Patient
             has an immediate life-threatening disease of the abdominal aorta in which there is a
             reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a matter of months or in which
             premature death is likely without early treatment.

             6. Patient is American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade 1 through 4. 7. Patient
             is able and willing to comply with 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and every year thereafter
             post treatment follow-up requirements.

             8. Patient or patient's legal representative understands and has signed an Informed
             Consent.&amp;#xA; Exclusion Criteria:1. Patient is pregnant or nursing. 2. Patient is
             morbidly obese or has other clinical conditions that severely inhibit X-ray
             visualization of the aorta.

             3. Patient has connective disease. 4. Patient is hypercoagulable. 5. Patient has
             active systemic infection. 6. Patient is less than 18 years old. 7. Patient has less
             than a one-year life expectancy. 8. Patient is unwilling or unable to return for
             follow-up visits.
