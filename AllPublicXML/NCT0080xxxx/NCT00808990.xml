  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has been suggested to be the most common cause of
      chronic liver disease in the general population in the Western World. In advanced stages of
      NAFLD, steatohepatitis (NASH) develops characterized by: steatosis, inflammation, and
      fibrosis progressing to cirrhosis in some patients. The knowledge of the role of small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in the pathogenesis of NASH has led to the proposal of
      probiotics as a therapeutic strategy for this disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics may interfere with the development of NASH by several mechanisms. Data from an
      uncontrolled clinical trial in NASH patients show promising results, with improvement of
      liver enzymes in treated patients.

      RESEARCH GOALS:

      A. To assess the degree of SIBO in NAFLD patients vs. healthy controls. B. To evaluate the
      effect of probiotics vs. placebo on SIBO in NAFLD patients. C. To evaluate the effect of
      probiotics vs. placebo on disease severity (inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis) in NAFLD
      patients.
