      Do Back School and/or supervised walking improve reported pain and spine flexibility in
      sedentary women with chronic low back pain (LBP)?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From August 2002 to March 2004, one hundred nineteen volunteers sedentary women with chronic
      LBP and age ranging from 32 to 60 years old, randomly allocated to four groups of
      participants assigned as Back School (BS; N=28), Supervised Walking (W; N=32), Back School
      and Supervised Walking (BS+W; N=29), and Control Group (CG; N=30) were submitted to
      interventions once a week for 5 consecutive weeks and followed for up to 6 months. The groups
      BS, W, and BS+W received LBP-targeted lectures and on-place practical sessions of each
      respective intervention. CG received print information about LBP and 5 different lectures
      unrelated to LBP.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between August 2002 and March 2004, 351 women that attended 4 community centers located in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, responding to invitations by folders and voice announcements, filled a form with basic questions about physical activity and low back pain (LBP). After a clinical evaluation, 119 patients fulfilled the study criteria.</recruitment_details>
