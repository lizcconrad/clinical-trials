        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  20 years of age or older, of any race and either sex.

          -  Able to understand and sign an informed consent that has been approved by an
             Institutional Review Board.

          -  Criteria for the diagnosis must include the following two characteristics at Visit 1
             (Day 1):

          -  Subjects' assessment of dry eye status (answer of at least &quot;Some of the time&quot; to the
             question, &quot;How often have your eyes felt dry enough to want to use eye drops?&quot;

          -  Sodium fluorescein (NaFl) corneal staining score sum of â‰¥3 in either eye (NEI scoring
             system).

          -  Able and willing to follow study instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          -  History or evidence of ocular or intraocular surgery in either eye within the past
             three months.

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the study medications.

          -  History or evidence of epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendrictic keratitis);
             vaccine, active or recent varicella viral disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva;
             ocular rosacea; chronic bacterial disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva and/or
             eyelids; mycobacterial infection of the eye; and/or fungal disease of the eye.

          -  Use of topical ocular medications during the study period.

          -  Subjects using systemic medications that may contribute to dry eye (e.g. cold and
             allergy medications, tricyclic antidepressants, hormone replacement therapies) may not
             be enrolled in the study unless they have been on a stable dosing regimen for a
             minimum of 30 days prior to Visit 1. In addition, the dosing regimen must remain
             stable throughout the study.

          -  Presence of ocular conditions such as active acute blepharitis, conjunctival
             infections, iritis, or any other ocular condition that may preclude the safe
             administration of the test article.

          -  Subjects unwilling to discontinue contact lens wear during the study period. Contact
             lens wear must have been discontinued at least one week prior to Visit 1.

          -  Current punctal occlusion of any type (e.g. collagen plugs, silicone plugs).

          -  Enrollment of the investigator or his or her staff, family members of the
             investigator, family members of the investigator's staff, or individuals living in the
             households of these individuals.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug or device study within 30 days of entering
             this study.
