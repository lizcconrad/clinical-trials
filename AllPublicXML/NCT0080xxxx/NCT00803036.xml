  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the primary damage from traumatic brain injury (TBI) is irreversible, the focus of
      medical management of TBI is preventing secondary injury that can be life-threatening and
      worsen patient outcome. Insight into the pathologic mechanisms of secondary injury, which are
      largely unknown, is required for developing better treatments.

      In preliminary studies, the investigators have found that a pathologic brain activity, known
      as spreading depression, recurs in a large number of TBI patients in the first week after
      injury. Spreading depressions are short-circuits of brain function that arise spontaneously
      from an injury and spread repeatedly as waves into neighboring brain tissue. Animal research
      has shown that spreading depressions can cause secondary injury to the brain.

      The primary objective of this observational study is to determine whether the occurrence or
      severity of spreading depression is related to worse neurologic recovery from TBI. Results
      from the study will determine whether monitoring of spreading depression should be used as a
      guide or target for improved medical management of the TBI patient.
