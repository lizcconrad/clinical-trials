  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II trial the investigators plan to incorporate two targeted agents, bevacizumab
      and everolimus, into the first-line multimodality therapy of glioblastoma. In the first
      portion of the treatment, bevacizumab will be added to standard concurrent radiation therapy
      plus temozolomide. After completing radiation therapy, patients will continue treatment with
      the combination of bevacizumab and everolimus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although this maintenance regimen departs from the standard treatment with single agent
      temozolomide, we feel this approach may add to the overall efficacy of treatment for the
      following reasons: 1) results with bevacizumab/everolimus in renal cell carcinoma suggest
      there is at least an additive efficacy when these drugs are used in combination; 2) the
      efficacy of single agent temozolomide following standard concurrent radiation
      therapy/temozolomide has not been proven, 3) the use of the three-drug maintenance program
      (i.e., bevacizumab/everolimus/temozolomide) would probably not be tolerated well on a chronic
      basis in this patient population; and 4) the bevacizumab/everolimus combination has potential
      advantages as a maintenance therapy, since it has been well tolerated for many months in
      patients with other malignancies.
