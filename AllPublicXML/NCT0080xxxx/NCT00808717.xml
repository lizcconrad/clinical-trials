    <textblock>
      Although statin prior to PCI has favorable effects in stable angina and ACS except ST
      elevation MI (STEMI), there have been few studies for STEMI. Celik T et al. reported in
      patients with STEMI that prior statin use may improve coronary blood flow after PCI in
      patients with AMI, possibly by its beneficial effects on microvascular function. But this
      study was retrospective, non-randomized study and evaluated the effects for chronic statin
      therapy not acute high dose effect. Therefore, the investigators investigated whether acute
      high-dose statin prior to primary PCI in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction can have
      beneficial effect or not for periprocedural period and 30 days-cardiac events.

          2. The patient had the symptoms of acute myocardial infarction within 12 hours with ST
             segment elevation of more than 1 mm in at least two contiguous leads of EKG or new
             onset LBBB.

          3. The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and provides informed, written
