    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects (â‰¥18 years old) receiving oral Revatio 20 mg TID for PAH within the approved
             indication (EU Summary of Product Characteristics) for a minimum of 1-month and who,
             in the investigator's opinion, have demonstrated good tolerability. Subjects with PAH
             who are nil by mouth for any reason (eg, elective surgery or medical procedure, TPN
             feeding, gastrointestinal disturbance etc) may also be included in the study provided
             they are haemodynamically stable (see Inclusion Criterion 4) and the 6 hour period of
             blood pressure and pulse monitoring in the study does not interfere with any planned
             medical or surgical intervention.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and
             study tests and procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject receiving Revatio outside ('off-label') of the current Summary of Product
             Characteristics (SmPC).

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Introduction of potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole and
             ritonavir) within the previous 1 month of screening.
