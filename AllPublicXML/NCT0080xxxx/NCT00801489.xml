      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if gemtuzumab ozogamicin and idarubicin
      can be added to the combination of fludarabine, cytarabine, and Neupogen (Filgrastim) without
      increasing the risk of side effects. This study will also look at whether the addition of
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin and idarubicin will increase the long-term chances of patients
      remaining disease free.

      This is an investigational study. Cytarabine is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of AML. Fludarabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Filgrastim is FDA approved and commercially
      available to treat fever associated with low white cell counts in patients with AML.
      Gemtuzumab ozogamicin and Idarubicin are FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of acute leukemias, lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer. At this time,
      their use in combination is for research purposes only.

      Decitabine is FDA approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and is commercially
      available.

      The study doctor will explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 200 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Parts of the Study:

      There will be 2 parts to this study. The first part of the study is called induction therapy.
      During induction, the study doctor will try to get rid of the leukemia cells from your bone
      marrow. If induction causes the leukemia cells to be removed from your bone marrow and your
      blood counts return to normal, you will be in remission. Induction usually lasts 4-6 weeks.

      If you are in remission, you will begin the second part of the study, called post-remission
      therapy. You will receive up to 4-6 cycles (1 cycle every 4-6 weeks) of post-remission
      therapy, depending on your blood counts. Each study cycle lasts 4-6 weeks.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, during induction therapy, you
      will be given fludarabine and cytarabine through a needle in your vein every day, for 5 days
      in a row (Days 1-5). You will receive fludarabine over 30 minutes and cytarabine over 4
      hours.

      Filgrastim will be given one time daily as an injection just under the skin starting on the
      day before you receive fludarabine and cytarabine, and you will continue to receive
      filgrastim one time daily until your white blood cell count is near normal.

      Once you complete chemotherapy, your doctor may decide to give a dose of pegfilgrastim
      instead of daily filgrastim.

      You will receive idarubicin through a needle in your vein over 30 minutes on Days 3 and 4
      right after you receive fludarabine. You will receive gemtuzumab on Day 1 through by vein
      over 2 hours. If you are 66 years or older, and the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest, you will receive fewer days of cytarabine, fludarabine and idarubicin. The doctor
      will discuss this with you.

      Gemtuzumab may cause allergic reactions, nausea, and vomiting. To help prevent such side
      effects, you will receive Tylenol (acetaminophen), Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and
      corticosteroids. You can receive these drugs by vein, or by mouth.

      During post-remission therapy, you will receive fludarabine and cytarabine for 3 days (Days
      1-3) instead of 5 days. During Cycle 4 of post-remission therapy, you will receive idarubicin
      at the same dose as given during induction therapy on Days 2 and 3.

      During either Cycles 2 or 3, and or in Cycles 5 or 6 of post-remission therapy, you will
      receive gemtuzumab at the same dose as given during induction.

      You will receive filgrastim one time on the day before each post-remission cycle and you will
      continue to receive filgrastim one time daily until your white blood cell count is near
      normal.

      Your doctor may decide to give a dose of pegfilgrastim instead of daily filgrastim

      During post-remission therapy, you may begin receiving decitabine instead of fludarabine,
      cytarabine, filgrastim, gemtuzumab, and idarubicin if you are 60 years or older, or if you
      have had intolerable side effects. If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will
      begin receiving decitabine infusions over 1 hour, for 5 days in a row, every 4-6 weeks for up
      to 12 cycles. The doctor will discuss this with you.

      Study Visits:

      During induction therapy, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn at least once a week for
      routine testing.

      After 3 weeks (Between Days 18-24), you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status
      of the disease. If the leukemia cells are not completely gone from your bone marrow by the
      end of 3 weeks, your study doctor may decide to repeat the test.

      If the repeat bone marrow aspirate shows that you are not in remission, your study doctor may
      decide to give you another cycle of induction therapy.

      Once you begin post-remission therapy, you will have the following tests and procedures:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, including your
           weight.

        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living
           (performance status).

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine blood tests.

      At Months 4 and 7, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease.

      Part of the bone marrow sample collected at these bone marrow aspirations will be sent to the
      M.D. Anderson molecular lab for testing.

      If your study doctor thinks it is necessary, you may have a bone marrow aspirate after the
      first 7 months to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for one cycle of induction therapy and up to 6 cycles of post-remission
      therapy. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects
      occur.

      Long-term follow up:

      You will have blood (about 2 teaspoons) drawn for routine testing every 6 months for 2 years
      after the study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have untreated AML, or high-risk MDS [refractory anemia with excess
             blasts, (RAEB), or RAEB &quot;in transformation&quot; (RAEB-t)] characterized by t(8;21),
             inv(16), or t(16;16).The presence of additional abnormalities is irrelevant.

          2. Age equal to or greater than 18 years (the safety of GO in patients &lt;18 years is not
             determined and advantage of fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin-based regimen in CBF
             leukemias in children is not demonstrated).

          3. Patients must provide written consent.

          4. Because of the high possibility of CR in CBF leukemias, participants will not be
             excluded based on performance status.For patients with Eastern Co-operative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) performance status &gt;/= to 3 the dosing schedule will be discussed with
             study chairman.

          5. Patients with organ dysfunction will not be excluded from the study. For patients with
             evidence of organ dysfunction (creatinine &gt;/= 1.5, cardiac ejection fraction &lt;/= 50%,
             total bilirubin &gt;/=2 and AST/ALT &gt;/= 3 times ULN, dose adjustments/omissions will be
             made.

          6. Up to one cycle of prior induction therapy will be permitted to include patients in
             whom presence of &quot;good-risk&quot; cytogenetics was initially missed. If the patient is in
             remission from induction therapy, he/she will receive post-remission therapy. If the
             patient is not in remission then he/she will receive induction therapy.

          7. Patients of child bearing potential should practice effective methods of
             contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Pregnant and lactating females will be excluded since the safety of GO or FLAG + Ida in
        pregnancy and lactation is unknown.
