      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the SynergEyes SA Hybrid Contact Lens
      clinical performance is substantially equivalent to that of the SynergEyes A Hybrid Lens when
      studied:

        -  within the corresponding range of lens powers

        -  in a population randomized within multiple investigational sites

        -  with a study ration of 2/1 test vs control lenses

        -  for a duration of 90 days.

      The objective of the study is to compare the SynergEyes SA Hybrid Contact Lens (Test) to the
      SynergEyes A Hybrid Contact lens (Control) when used in a daily wear regimen on non-diseased
      eyes for the correction of myopia (-0.25 to -6.00Diopters) with up to -2.50 Diopters of
      astigmatism. The population will be randomized into a 2/1 ratio of the Test/Control for 90
      days. The study objective is to complete at least 40 subjects in the Test material and 20
      subjects in the Control material.

      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the SynergEyes SA Hybrid Contact Lens
      clinical performance is substantially equivalent to that of the SynergEyes A Hybrid Lens when
      studied within the corresponding range of powers in a population randomized within
      investigational sites to produce a 2/1 ratio of Test vs. Control lenses.

          2. Have

               1. read the Informed Consent,

               2. been given an explanation of the Informed Consent,

               3. indicated an understanding of the Informed Consent and

               4. signed the Informed Consent Form.

          3. Be willing and able to adhere to the instructions set forth in this protocol and able
             to keep all specified appointments.

          4. Be a current contact lens wearer.

          5. Possess wearable and visually functional eyeglasses.

          6. Be in good general health, based on his/her knowledge.

          7. Require spectacle lens powers between plano and -6.00 diopters sphere with no more
             than -2.50 diopters of spectacle refractive astigmatism and be willing to wear lenses
             in both eyes.

          8. Have manifest refraction visual acuity equal to or better than 20/25 in each eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may not be enrolled into the study if ANY of the following apply:

               1. Subject is wearing lenses in a monovision modality and is unwilling to be fit
                  with distance lenses in both eyes. NOTE: Subjects may NOT wear monovision lenses
