      The purpose of this study is to determine, among adults and in the total population, the
      effects of offering a choice of FluMist or trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) in the

      The primary objective is to determine, among adults in the 18-49 year old population and in
      the total population, the effects of offering a choice of FluMist or TIV with and without
      enhanced advertisement/added incentive on the overall influenza vaccination rates in the
      employer setting when compared to a control group.
