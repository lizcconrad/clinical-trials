  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with chronic kidney disease are known to have immune response abnormalities, including
      a diminished response to some vaccinations. Those with chronic kidney disease have a
      disproportionate burden of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- and/or 18-related genital tract disease. Due to
      immune response abnormalities, the CKD population may or may not respond to the recommended
      three-dose regimen of Gardasil®, a vaccine intended to protect against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and
      18-related genital tract disease. The objective of this study is to measure the antibody
      response to Gardasil® in female patients 9-21 years of age with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      (Stage 1-4), end-stage kidney disease (Stage 5 CKD), and status-post kidney transplant.
      Gardasil® vaccine will be administered according to the FDA-approved schedule. Blood samples
      to measure antibody levels to vaccine strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) will be obtained
      at months 0, 7 and 24.

    <time_frame>Month 7</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was antibody response to each of four HPV genotypes contained within the HPV vaccine at the time periods specified for the blood draws. Antibody levels, measured by Merck GmbH, were initially determined using the competitive Luminex immunoassay(cLIA; Merck GmbH), the assay used in the original licensing studies. Seropositivity was defined as being above thresholds set at 20, 16, 20, and 24 milliMerck units for HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18, respectively, as determined in phase 2 studies among patients who were immunocompetent. Antibody levels were reanalyzed using the newer, more sensitive IgG cLIA in stored serum from blood draws 2 and 3. Seropositivity for this assay was defined as being above thresholds set at 15, 15, 7, and 10 milliMerck units for HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18, respectively.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome was antibody response to each of four HPV genotypes contained within the HPV vaccine at the time periods specified for the blood draws. Antibody levels, measured by Merck GmbH, were initially determined using the competitive Luminex immunoassay(cLIA; Merck GmbH), the assay used in the original licensing studies. Seropositivity was defined as being above thresholds set at 20, 16, 20, and 24 milliMerck units for HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18, respectively, as determined in phase 2 studies among patients who were immunocompetent. Antibody levels were reanalyzed using the newer, more sensitive IgG cLIA in stored serum from blood draws 2 and 3. Seropositivity for this assay was defined as being above thresholds set at 15, 15, 7, and 10 milliMerck units for HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18, respectively.</description>
