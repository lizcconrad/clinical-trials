  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dosing regimens of tapentadol HCl
      immediate release capsules for the treatment of postoperative pain over a period of 12 hours
      on the first day following a bunionectomy in men and women.

      Tapentadol hydrochloride is a centrally active analgesic (antinociceptive) compound. This was
      a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled dose
      study in men and nonpregnant, nonlactating women. The patients were at least 18 and no more
      than 75 years of age and experienced moderate to severe pain within 9 hours after removal of
      postoperative analgesia. The surgery was a standardized first metatarsal bunionectomy.
      Treatment of postsurgical pain after the 9 hr period was with either placebo, tapentadol, or
      oxycodone using various dosing regimens. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of these treatments on total pain relief and total change in pain
      intensity over 12 hours and reporting of adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and
      ECGs. Secondary objectives included evaluation of several other pain measures, and drug
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Six patient treatment groups received study medication
      orally at 0, 4, and 8 hours with one of the following dosing regimens: 1) placebo, placebo,
      and placebo, 2) 93 mg, 93 mg, and 93 mg tapentadol IR, 3) 140 mg, 140 mg, and 140 mg
      tapentadol IR, 4) 140 mg, 70 mg, and 70 mg tapentadol IR, 5) 186 mg, 93 mg, and 93 mg
      tapentadol IR, and 6) 10 mg, 10 mg, and 10 mg oxycodone IR.
