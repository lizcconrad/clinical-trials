    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer mortality in men and
      women in Singapore.Chemotherapy and biologically targeted agents can extend survival only
      modestly for these patients; therefore, discovery of novel ways to prolong the disease course
      is a top research priority.

      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a central role in the
      neoplastic transformation of NSCLC and promotes cancer cell survival, metastasis, and
      angiogenesis. The predominance of EGFR signaling in NSCLC makes the pathway an attractive
      candidate for the development of targeted therapeutics. Over the last three years, the FDA
      has approved two drugs for salvage treatment of NSCLC, gefitinib (Iressa 速, formerly known as
      ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva 速, formerly known as OSI-774). Both are small molecule
      orally-bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the EGFR TK domain, and have been
      shown to improve survival compared to placebo in asian patients when administered after
      failure of first or second line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.

      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer mortality in men and
      women in Singapore.Chemotherapy and biologically targeted agents can extend survival only
      modestly for these patients; therefore, discovery of novel ways to prolong the disease course
      is a top research priority.

      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a central role in the
      neoplastic transformation of NSCLC and promotes cancer cell survival, metastasis, and
      angiogenesis. The predominance of EGFR signaling in NSCLC makes the pathway an attractive
      candidate for the development of targeted therapeutics. Over the last three years, the FDA
      has approved two drugs for salvage treatment of NSCLC, gefitinib (Iressa 速, formerly known as
      ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva 速, formerly known as OSI-774). Both are small molecule
      orally-bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the EGFR TK domain, and have been
      shown to improve survival compared to placebo in asian patients when administered after
      failure of first or second line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.

      Recently, it was found that somatic mutations in the EGFR gene sensitize NSCLC tumors to
      TKIs. These mutations are present in approximately 50 % of asian patients with NSCLC.
      Retrospective studies suggest that patients harboring a mutation may derive greater clinical
      benefit from treatment with TKIs than patients without a mutation.

      Nevertheless, all patients that benefit from TKI treatment ultimately develop resistance to
      therapy manifesting as progression of their cancer, after which there remains few, if any
      treatment options. Hence, there would be vast clinical utility in understanding the
      mechanisms of TKI resistance and developing strategies to reverse or prevent it.

      We have preliminary data which shows that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and gefitinib
      results in delayed acquired resistance to gefitinib in cell lines that harbour the EGFR
      mutation. In addition, the addition of hydroxychloroquine to gefitinib can result in reversal
      of acquired resistance to gefitinib. Much parallel has been observed in resistance mechanisms
      between NSCLC cell lines and molecular changes observed in patients thus far.

      The long term aim therefore is to examine the efficacy of this combination in delaying
      acquired resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC patients.

      First, however, the MTD and DLT of each drug when used in combination therapy will be
      examined in this study. The other aim is to examine the pharmacokinetic effect and
      interactions of hydroxychloroquine on gefitinib, and vice versa. Gefitinib is usually well
      tolerated, with main toxicities of rash and diarrhoea. Hydroxychloroquine is also FDA
      approved and widely used and generally well-tolerated for rheumatological conditions.

                  =&gt;60mL/minute as calculated by the standard Cockcroft Gault formula.

          8. Approval for HCQ treatment by an eye doctor, based on a screening eye exam. Examples
             of disqualifying baseline conditions include macular degeneration and other retinal
             disease, see exclusion criteria.

          9. Willingness to comply with protocol procedures including the blood-sampling schedule
             for PK analyses and periodic eye examinations.

         10. Willingness to participate in clinical research as evidenced by their signature on the
             informed consent form.

         11. Tumor block from subject's biopsy or surgical resection specimen should ideally be
             available but is not a mandatory requirement for study entry.

        For the phase II study:

        Inclusion criteria as above, except that:

          1. NSCLC patients must be non-smokers and have adenocarcinomas.

          2. Patients who had been on gefitinib should have a wash out period of two weeks prior to
             commencement of treatment drugs for this study. They must have responded to Gefitinib
             previously (either CR, PR or SD) for more than twelve weeks to be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For both lead in phase I and phase II study:

          1. Current use of hydroxychloroquine for any reason.

          2. Known hypersensitivity to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or any closely related
             drug.

          3. Known hypersensitivity to erlotinib, gefitinib, or any closely related drug.

          4. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as HCQ may cause hemolytic anemia
             in patients with G6PD deficiency.

          5. Cataracts that would interfere with required funduscopic examinations, or severe
             baseline visual impairment including macular degeneration, retinopathy or visual field
             changes, or having only one functional eye. All patients must undergo a screening eye
             exam prior to enrollment.

          6. Pregnant or breastfeeding. HCQ crosses the placenta and use is not recommended during
             pregnancy except for life-threatening malaria. The effects of gefitinib on a fetus are
             unknown. For these reasons, female subjects of childbearing age must practice
             acceptable methods of birth control to avoid pregnancy. Male subjects must also
             practice acceptable methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy of a partner.

          7. Symptomatic CNS metastases or newly diagnosed CNS metastases that have not yet been
             definitively treated with radiation and/or surgery. Note that patients with a history
             of CNS metastases or cord compression are allowable if they have been definitively
             treated and are clinically stable. Maintenance steroids are allowed but maintenance
             seizure medication is not allowed.

          8. Prior radiation therapy inclusive of all identified target lesions. Note that prior
             palliative radiation to bony disease, CNS disease, or a limited thoracic area is
             allowed, provided that there is measurable disease outside the field and radiation is
             completed at least two weeks prior to starting treatment and the patient has fully
             recovered from all side effects.

          9. Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. Note that patients with
             chronic, stable radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not be excluded.

         10. Malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of the
             cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

         11. Although not an absolute exclusion criteria, caution should be exercised in patients
             with a diagnosis of prophyria or non-light-sensitive psoriasis, as HCQ can
             significantly exacerbate both of these conditions.

         12. Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study, in the opinion of the
             investigator.

         13. Use of any non-FDA approved or investigational agent within 2 weeks of enrolling onto
             the trial, or failure to recover from the side effects of any of these agents.

         14. Penicillamine use for Wilson's disease or any other indication, as concomitant use
             with HCQ can increase toxicity to penicillamine.

         15. Concommitant use of anti-convulsants is not allowed.
