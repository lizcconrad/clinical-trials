    <measure>Proportion of Subjects in Each Treatment Group With Therapeutic Cure</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 3: Day 22-31</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of subjects in each treatment group with a therapeutic cure at the Test-of-Cure visit (Visit 3). A subject was considered a therapeutic cure if the subject was a clinical cure with mycological cure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Mycological Cure</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 3: Day 22-31</time_frame>
    <description>Mycological cure was defined as a negative mycological culture (no growth) for Candida albicans or other relevant baseline yeast organism.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Clinical Cure</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 3: Day 22-31</time_frame>
    <description>A subject was considered a clinical cure if all of the following were satisfied:
All signs and symptoms with a score of 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) at the Screening/Baseline visit were absent (score = 0), and all signs or symptoms with a score of 3 (severe) at Screening/Baseline had a score of 0 or 1.
Total signs and symptoms did not worsen at any time following completion of the study treatment.
Any new sign or symptom observed during the study period was determined by the Investigator not to be related to VVC.
The subject did not require additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal therapy at any time during the study period.
The subject did not use any topical drug therapy other than the study medication for the treatment of vulvovaginal irritation and/or pruritus such as topical analgesic or corticosteroid products</description>

Total signs and symptoms did not worsen at any time following completion of the study treatment.
Any new sign or symptom observed during the study period was determined by the Investigator not to be related to VVC.
The subject did not require additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal therapy at any time during the study period.
The subject did not use any topical drug therapy other than the study medication for the treatment of vulvovaginal irritation and/or pruritus such as topical analgesic or corticosteroid products</description>
