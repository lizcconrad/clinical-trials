    <textblock>
      The systemic treatments for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) are limited to
      phototherapy and cyclosporine with the risks respectively of either carcinoma, or
      hypertension or nephropathy.

      Methotrexate was effective in 75% of moderate to severe AD patients with good tolerance in an
      open retrospective study.

      We want to confirm our observations: a non inferiority multicenter clinical trial,
      methotrexate versus cyclosporine, will be conducted in 100 patients for 24 weeks.
