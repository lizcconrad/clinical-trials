    <textblock>
      The University of Michigan is conducting a study investigating a potential new treatment
      aimed at slowing/halting progression of primary biliary cirrhosis. This will be a 2 arm
      double blind study in which half of the patients will be randomly selected to receive a
      placebo (capsule with no active ingredient) and half will receive the new treatment drug,
      tetrathiomolybdate. Neither the patient nor the treating physician will know which arm the
      patient is in. The length of the study for each patient is 24 months of drug therapy. Lab
      draws will be necessary weekly for the first 6 weeks of the study, followed by every other
      week for 3 weeks, and then monthly for the remainder of the 2 year period. In addition,
      intermittent history and physicals and urine samples will also be necessary. There is no cost
      to you for any experimental treatment. All patients in both arms will continue on ursodiol
      and receive standard of care treatment

    <description>120 mg/day, divided as 20 mg three times/day with meals and 60 mg away from food at bedtime, for one week to test gastric tolerance. Increased to 180 mg/day, divided as 40 mg three times/day with meals and 60 mg away from food at bedtime. Serum ceruloplasmin levels measured weekly will be used as a surrogate measure of copper status, with a target of 10-15 mg/dl (normal 20-40). When target Cp levels are reached, usually in 4-8 weeks, a maintenance dose of usually 40-80 mg of TM/day, divided half with a major meal, and half away from food at bedtime will be established (vary from 10 mg to 120 mg/day).</description>

    <description>Arm 2 will basically mirror Arm 1 with the patients receiving 120 mg/day, divided as 20 mg three times/day with meals and 60 mg away from food at bedtime the first week. Increased to 180 mg/day, divided as 40 mg three times/day with meals and 60 mg away from food at bedtime. With the dosage being reduced at about the same frequency as the patients receiving TM</description>
