  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, Phase I, open-label, single-blind (subjects blinded to the contents
      of each injection), 4 stage study designed to determine the PK, GD, safety, tolerability, and
      optimal ratio of rHuPH20 administered with fixed Humulin R or Humalog doses in healthy
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in one of four sequential study stages. In each stage, a euglycemic
      clamp procedure will be used to control plasma glucose levels. Blood samples will be
      collected over an 8-hour time period after insulin administration (either Humulin R or
      Humalog) to analyze insulin and glucose levels using fully validated methods. Glucose
      infusion rates (GIR) will be recorded throughout the study period. The study is single-blind,
      with study subjects blinded as to the contents of each injection.

      Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and optimum ratio of rHuPH20:insulin when a range of
      rHuPH20 dose ratios are administered subcutaneously (SC) with fixed doses of Humulin R, by
      determining Tmax, Cmax, AUCs, and relative bioavailability based on serum insulin
      concentrations collected at specified time points (Stage 1).

      Determine if different concentrations of Humulin R impact the PK and minimal rHuPH20 dose
      necessary to achieve full insulin PK effect over a representative range of typical prandial
      SC Humulin R doses using the rHuPH20:insulin ratio identified in Stage 1 (Stage 2).

      Determine the PK and optimum ratio of rHuPH20:insulin when a range of rHuPH20 dose ratios are
      administered SC with fixed doses of Humalog, by determining Tmax, Cmax, AUCs, and relative
      bioavailability based on serum insulin concentrations collected at specified time points
      (Stage 3).

      Determine if different concentrations of Humalog impact the PK and minimal rHuPH20 dose
      necessary to achieve full insulin PK effect over a representative range of typical prandial
      SC Humalog doses using the rHuPH20:insulin ratio identified in Stage 3 (Stage 4).

      Evaluate the safety and local tolerability of the SC injection at various rHuPH20, Humulin R,
      and Humalog doses (Stages 1 - 4).

      Assess the glucodynamics (GD) of the SC injection of various rHuPH20, Humulin R, and Humalog
      doses (Stages 1 - 4).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. (Healthy is defined
             as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full
             physical examination (PE), including blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests specified in these eligibility
             criteria).

          -  BMI between 18-28 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Total body weight &gt;70 kg (154 lb) for men and 46 kg (101 lb) for women.

          -  Subject willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures including adequate venous access.

          -  Vital signs (BP, HR, temperature, respiratory rate) within normal range or, if out of
             range, assessed by the Principal Investigator (PI) as not clinically significant (NCS)
             and mutually agreed by both PI and the Sponsor's medical monitor that the subject need
             not be excluded from the study for this abnormal value.
