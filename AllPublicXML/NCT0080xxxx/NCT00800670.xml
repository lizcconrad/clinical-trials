    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and immune responses of a new
      tuberculosis vaccine, Ad5Ag85A, administered to healthy volunteers. 48 subjects will be
      recruited, 24 who have previously been vaccinated with BCG and 24 who have not received BCG
      vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine will be compared.

    <textblock>
      As the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic continues, the incidence of latent and active TB is
      expected to rise. HIV-infected persons are especially susceptible to TB. An improved TB
      vaccine over the present BCG vaccine is needed.

      The general objectives of our TB vaccine research program are to develop a safe and effective
      vaccine for persons who at increased risk of contracting TB or reactivating latent
      tuberculosis and develop a safe booster vaccine for persons who have been previously
      vaccinated with BCG.

      This is an open-labeled phase 1 single institution trial investigating a recombinant genetic
      TB vaccine AdAg85A given by intramuscular injection in healthy subjects with or without a
      history of BCG vaccination. Ad5Ag85A is a recombinant replication-deficient adenoviral vector
      expressing an M. tuberculosis immunogenic antigen Ag85A. We have shown that it is safe,
      immunogenic and associated with enhanced protection against challenge with virulent M Tb in
      murine, bovine and guinea pig models. Clinical grade AdAg85A has been manufactured by the
      Robert E Fitzhenry Vector Laboratory, Centre for Gene Therapeutics, McMaster University,
      Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

      The effect of pre-existing adenovirus antibodies on the safety and immunogenicity of the
      recombinant AdTB vaccine will be evaluated and the results of the PPD skin test following
      vaccination evaluated in a subset of subjects with a history of a negative PPD skin test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy human subjects who are between 18 and 55 years of age with or without a
             history of BCG vaccination.

          -  HIV antibody negative

          -  For women, negative pregnancy test and practising two acceptable forms of
             contraception for the duration of the study (barrier contraceptive, birth control
             pill, surgically sterile, post-menopausal 2yrs, abstinence)

          -  For men, using barrier contraception for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Subjects who have any acute or chronic illnesses including active tuberculosis or
             receiving any drug treatment in the opinion of the investigator likely to affect the
             immune system.

          -  Subjects with symptoms suggestive of an upper respiratory tract infection (including
             cough, runny nose, or sore throat)

          -  Subjects who have a history of active or latent TB infection or whose PBMCs are
             strongly responsive to ESAT6/CFP10 stimulation using a commercial interferon gamma
             release assay for TB [consistent with latent TB infection].
