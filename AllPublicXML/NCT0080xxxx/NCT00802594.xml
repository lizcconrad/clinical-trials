  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human African Trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness has made a spectacular return during the
      last decade, and in many places the demand largely surpasses the capacities of the treatment
      centers. Treatment of the disease remains unsatisfactory. All currently used drugs must be
      administered parenterally, treatment is lengthy, and adverse drug reactions frequent. There
      are currently no drugs which might be used as a tool to support disease control that is
      easily administered and has low toxicity.

      This study aims to assess the efficacy of DB289, a new, oral drug for treatment of first
      stage sleeping sickness. The project will be executed in the framework of an international
      consortium consisting of more than a dozen partners from academia, industry, and the
      Ministries of Health of Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

      This is a single-center, open label, non-controlled Phase IIa trial. Patients with first
      stage T.b. gambiense sleeping sickness will receive 100 mg of DB289 orally twice a day for 5
      days. Subjects meeting entry criteria will be enrolled at a single site.

      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Enrollment is planned to begin third
      quarter 2001 and be completed in 2-3 months.

      The study will be conducted at the Trypanosomiasis Reference Center, Viana (ICCT), Angola,
      and at the Trypanosomiasis Treatment Center in Maluku, Congo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has early stage T. b. gambiense infection i.e. parasitologically confirmed
             infection in the blood or lymph and less than or equal to 5 WBC mm-3 detected in the
             CSF by microscopic examination

          2. Patient is 16 years old or more

          3. Patient has a minimal weight of 45 kilograms

          4. If patient is female of child bearing potential (a women will be considered of
             non-child bearing potential only if she has been post menopausal for over 2 years or
             has had a hysterectomy), she is not lactating, she had a negative urine pregnancy test
             result within 24 hours prior to DB289 treatment and she agrees to use a medically
             proven method of contraception (abstinence from sexual intercourse acceptable) from
             the day of consent on until 7 Days after DB289 treatment completion (Study Day 12).
