    <textblock>
      This research trial studies the development of a blood test for detecting anti-insulin-like
      growth factor II mRNA binding protein 3 (anti-IMP3) antibody and micro ribonucleic acid
      (microRNA) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that has spread to other parts of the
      body (metastatic) or is limited to the tissue or organ where it began (localized). Anti-IMP3
      is a tumor marker that can be detected in many human cancers, including RCC and is likely to
      be present in the serum (blood) of patients with metastatic or localized RCC. Alterations in
      microRNA expression has also shown to play a critical role in cancer progression and may be a
      promising biomarker for patients with RCC. Developing a blood test for anti-IMP3 antibody and
      microRNA in serum and tissue samples of patients in the laboratory may help doctors find and
      diagnose RCC earlier, find out how far the disease has spread, and plan effective treatment
      for RCC.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To develop a blood test by monitoring the titer of IMP3 autoantibody and/or microRNA
      (miRNA)/small non-coding RNA (snRNA) expression in patients' serum for the early detection of
      RCC and its recurrence/metastasis.

      OUTLINE: Serum samples are collected prior to treatment and analyzed for anti-IMP3
      autoantibody titer via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and total RNA via
      sequencing, microarray, and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Previously
      collected tissue samples are analyzed for IMP3 via immunohistochemistry (IHC).
