    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of aerobic interval training on left-
      and right ventricular diastolic- and systolic function on healthy, sedate people over 70
      years. The old sedate cohort will be compared to young, sedate subjects also performing
      aerobic interval training and old master athletes without intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with a reduced diastolic and systolic function of the heart. Earlier
      studies have shown that physical exercise can improve both systolic and diastolic function.
      However the impact on age-related cardiac function is to some extent conflicting. The use of
      different training intensities will impact on the cardiac result. We have in earlier studies
      shown aerobic interval training at 90 % of maximal heart rate (4x4 minutes) to have more
      impact on cardiac function, endothelial function and maximal oxygen uptake compared to
      moderate intensity.

      To our knowledge the effect of aerobic interval training on cardiac function has not been
      studied in an old, sedate group before.

    <description>High intensity aerobic interval training consists of 10 minutes warm up at ~60% of maximal heart rate, 4x4 minutes intervals at 90-95 % of maximal heart rate corresponding to 85-90% of VO2max) walking/running uphill on a treadmill, with three minutes active pause between the exercise bouts at 60-70% maximal heart rate. The session is terminated with 3 minutes cool down. Total exercise time is 38 minutes.The training is supervised by an exercise physiologist and the subjects train 3 times per week for 12 weeks.</description>
