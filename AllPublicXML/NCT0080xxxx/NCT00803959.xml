  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although no reliable and specific figures are available for the total expenditure on UDS, UDS
      is commonly performed for patients with urinary incontinence (UI) regardless of gender and
      age. UDS is typically performed prior to incontinence surgery. Urodynamic studies are
      expensive, time-consuming, and uncomfortable diagnostic investigations. The 3rd ICI reported
      insufficient evidence with which to answer the following key research questions related to
      UDS: 1) Do physicians alter clinical decision-making based on results of UDS?, and 2) Do
      alterations in clinical decisions made in response to UDS results improve the clinical
      outcomes?

    <measure>Self-reported Urinary Incontinence, Irritative and Obstructive Symptoms: Reduction of 70%+ in the Urogenital Distress Inventory From Baseline to 12 Mos and &quot;Very Much&quot; or &quot;Much&quot; Better on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement Measure at 12 Mos.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success is defined as a reduction in the Urogenital Distress Inventory score from baseline to 12 months of 70% or more and a Patient Global Impression of Improvement response of &quot;very much better&quot; or &quot;much better&quot; at 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Meeting or Exceeding 70% Decrease in UDI Score Between Baseline and 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 mos</time_frame>
    <description>The Urogenital Distress Inventory is a 20-item patient-reported measure that assesses the presence of urinary incontinence, urgency, frequency, and voiding dysfunction and the extent to which the patient is bothered by these symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 300, with higher scores indicating greater distress. The 70% cutoff value was selected on the basis of the previous experience of the study investigators and receiver-operating- characteristic curve analyses from a previous surgical trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Impression of Improvement is a patient-reported measure of perceived improvement that is obtained by asking study participants, &quot;How is your urinary tract condition now, as compared with how it was before you received treatment for your urinary leakage?&quot; Responses are on a 7-point scale from 1 meaning &quot;very much better&quot; to 7 meaning &quot;very much worse.&quot; Values of &quot;very much better&quot; (1) or &quot;much better&quot; (2) were considered to have &quot;perceived improvement&quot; according to this criteria. Values of 3 or greater were not (e.g. &quot;a little better&quot;, &quot;no change&quot;, &quot;a little worse&quot;, &quot;much worse&quot; or &quot;very much worse&quot;). This instrument correlates with the frequency of incontinence episodes, pad tests, and quality of life as it relates to incontinence.</description>

    <measure>Change in Bother as Measured by the UDI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Urogenital Distress Inventory is a 20-item patient-reported measure that assesses the presence of urinary incontinence, urgency, frequency, and voiding dysfunction and the extent to which the patient is bothered by these symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 300, with higher scores indicating greater distress. Change was calculated as the score at 12 months minus the score at baseline. Higher scores indicate worse function, so the larger the negative value, the greater the improvement.</description>

          <title>Change in Quality of Life as Measured by the IIQ</title>
          <description>Incontinence Impact Questionnaire has scores ranging from 0 to 400 and higher scores indicating a more negative effect on quality of life. Change was calculated as the score at 12 months minus the score at baseline and scores could range from -400 to 400. Higher scores indicate worse function, so the larger the negative value, the greater the improvement.</description>
          <population>There were 315 women randomized to each arm. In the UDS arm, 43 did not have primary outcome data leaving 272 in the intention-to-treat group. In the no UDS arm, 49 did not have primary outcome data leaving 266 in the ITT group. ITT analysis was used for all outcomes with the exception of the primary non-inferiority endpoint.</population>

          <title>Stress Test at 12 Mos</title>
          <description>A provocative stress test at a bladder volume of 300 ml was performed for direct observation of urine leakage. Observed urine loss from the urethra coincidental with the Valsalva maneuver or cough was considered a positive test. The stress test was not performed by the study surgeon but rather by an outcome assessor who was unaware of the study assignments.</description>
          <population>There were 315 women randomized to each arm. In the UDS arm, 43 did not have primary outcome data leaving 272 in the intention-to-treat group. In the no UDS arm, 49 did not have primary outcome data leaving 266 in the ITT group. Of these, only 225 in the UDS arm and 222 in the no UDS had stress test data at 12 months.</population>
