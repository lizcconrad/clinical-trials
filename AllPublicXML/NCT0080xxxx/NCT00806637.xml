    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare vessel sealing system uvulopalatoplasty (VSSU) to the
      traditional uvulopalatal flap (UPF) in the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing with
      special regard to intraoperative bleeding, operative time, postoperative pain, postoperative
      hemorrhage and other adverse effects.

    <textblock>
      Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty is one of the common procedures performed by otolaryngologists to
      treat sleep-disordered breathing patients who have retropalatal obstruction. Intraoperative
      bleeding is a significant problem which requires hemostasis and causes prolonged operative
      time. Several different techniques are used to perform this operation, including cold knife,
      monopolar cautery, coblation, and radiofrequency. Efficacy in hemostasis and tissue trauma
      from different operative techniques may result in different operative time and different
      degrees of morbidity including intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain, postoperative
      hemorrhage, and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The vessel sealing system has been widely
      used in head and neck surgery because of its effectiveness and safety. It was also found
      quite effective and safe in tonsillectomy procedures, providing excellent hemostasis and
      minimal tissue trauma.

    <description>Vessel sealing system uvulopalatoplasty (VSSU) is a new technique for uvulopalatoplasty using a special biclamp forceps for better hemostasis control. Vessel sealing system (VSS) is a bipolar vascular sealing system, with integrated active feedback control. The tissue is grasped and compressed by the handpiece. After the instrument is removed, the seal is visible as a semitransparent window, which can safely be divided. Uvular tip is grasped with an Allis clamp and retracted back toward the soft palate. Excision of the uvula and the redundant part of soft palate is performed by the VSS handpiece. VSS is also used for hemostasis.</description>

    <description>Uvulopalatal flap (UPF) is a standard uvulopalatoplasty technique. Uvulopalatal flap is usually performed as described originally by Powell et al. The soft palate was injected with 5 to 10 milliliters of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine solution. The mucosa, submucosa with glands, and fat on the lingual surface of the uvula and soft palate were removed with a scalpel. Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocoagulation. The uvular tip was amputated, and reflected back toward the soft palate, and fixated into its new position with multiple sutures of 3-0 chromic catgut.</description>
