    <measure>Composite Score of Plaque Inflammation/Stability Gene Expression as Assayed by Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Taqman Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of carotid endarterectomy (after 4 to 12 weeks of dosing)</time_frame>
    <description>Excised carotid plaques were evaluated for the gene expression of 60 biomarkers associated with inflammation (&quot;Hot&quot; biomarkers) &amp; 25 biomarkers associated with stability (&quot;Cold&quot; biomarkers). Each biomarker was assayed using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method and results were reported as a Cycle Threshold, (Ct). A Composite Score was calculated by averaging the Ct for each of the 25 &quot;cold&quot; genes, and subtracting the average Ct for the 60 &quot;hot&quot; genes. A higher composite score was associated with greater inflammation and a lower score was associated with stability (non-inflamed).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Plaque Instability Protein Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of carotid endarterectomy (after 4 to 12 weeks of dosing)</time_frame>
    <description>Each excised plaque was analyzed using an assay of 20 proteins that reflect plaque composition and inflammation. Each protein was assigned scaled signs, with a lower (negative) sign associated with plaque stability and a higher (positive) sign associated with plaque inflammation/instability. The Composite Score was the average amounts of all the 20 proteins with their associated signs. A higher Composite Score is associated with more plaque instability.</description>

        <title>Plaque Instability Protein Composite Score</title>
        <description>Each excised plaque was analyzed using an assay of 20 proteins that reflect plaque composition and inflammation. Each protein was assigned scaled signs, with a lower (negative) sign associated with plaque stability and a higher (positive) sign associated with plaque inflammation/instability. The Composite Score was the average amounts of all the 20 proteins with their associated signs. A higher Composite Score is associated with more plaque instability.</description>
