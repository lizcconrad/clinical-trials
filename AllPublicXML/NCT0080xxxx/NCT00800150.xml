      RATIONALE: Giving total marrow and total lymph node irradiation together with low doses of
      chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It
      may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated
      stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect).

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of total marrow and
      total lymph node irradiation when given together with fludarabine and melphalan followed by
      donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with advanced hematological cancer that has
      not responded to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of intensity-modulated total marrow and lymph
           node irradiation (TMLI) using helical tomotherapy in combination with a
           reduced-intensity preparative regimen comprising fludarabine phosphate and melphalan in
           patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for advanced,
           relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies.

        -  To describe the toxicities of escalating doses of TMLI in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the frequency of clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To describe the frequency of primary and secondary engraftment failure in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  To describe the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  To describe the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  To describe the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To describe the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of intensity-modulated total marrow and lymph node
      irradiation (TMLI).

        -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy: Patients undergo TMLI to skeletal bone/marrow,
           major lymph node chains, spleen, and liver using helical tomotherapy twice daily on days
           -6 to -3.

        -  Reduced-intensity preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days
           -6 to -2 and melphalan IV on day -1.

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): Patients undergo allogeneic HSCT on day
           0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
