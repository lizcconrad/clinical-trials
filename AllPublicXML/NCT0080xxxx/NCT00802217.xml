      Safety and pharmacokinetic first-time-in-human study of orally administered civamide in
      healthy subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized pharmacokinetic study of two dosage strengths of oral
      Civamide. The study consists of a Screening Period (Days -21 to Day -2), an Admittance
      Period, A 4 Day in-house Treatment Period(Days 1-4))and a follow-up Visit on Day 7.

      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed at specified timepoints relative to dosing on Day 1 during
      the in-house stay. Subjects will be discharged from the research unit following the 72 hr
      blood draw.

      Subjects will return to the research unit on Day 7 for a follow-up safety assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject voluntarily agrees to participate in this study and signs an IRB-approved
             informed consent prior to performing any of the screening procedures.

          2. Healthy, determined by pre-study medical evaluation (medical history and physical
             examination, vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations).

          3. Males or females between 18 to 45 years of age, inclusive.

          4. Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential (surgically sterile [hysterectomy

             hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 U/L).

          5. Non-smokers (or other nicotine use) as determined by history (no nicotine use over the
             past year) and by urine cotinine concentration (&lt; 200 ng/ml) at screening and/or Day
             -1.

          6. Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30.5 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening.
