  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with coronary artery disease (CAD) or people who have had a heart attack may develop a
      leak in the mitral valve of their heart and may therefore need to undergo surgery to fix the
      valve. The best way to fix the mitral valve remains undetermined. This study will evaluate
      whether it is better for people with severe mitral valve leakage to undergo a mitral valve
      replacement procedure or a mitral valve repair procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAD occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become blocked as a result of
      plaque buildup. In severe cases, CAD can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart
      attack. After a heart attack, some people may develop a leak in the mitral valve of the
      heart. This condition is known as ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), and it can cause blood
      to flow backward into the heart. If left untreated, severe IMR can lead to heart failure or
      serious heart rhythm irregularities, known as arrhythmias. People with severe mitral valve
      leakage routinely undergo one of two surgical procedures to fix the mitral valve: a mitral
      valve repair procedure, in which a surgical ring is used to repair the valve; or a mitral
      valve replacement procedure, in which the damaged valve is replaced with a new one.
      Currently, there is no consensus in the medical community as to which procedure is more
      beneficial. The purpose of this study is to determine whether people with severe mitral valve
      regurgitation should undergo a mitral valve repair procedure or a mitral valve replacement
      procedure.

      This study will enroll people with CAD who have severe mitral regurgitation. At a baseline
      study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination; blood collection;
      neurocognitive tests; and questionnaires regarding medical history, medication history, and
      quality of life. In the operating room, participants will be randomly assigned to undergo
      either the mitral valve repair procedure or the mitral valve replacement procedure. Blood,
      urine, and tissue samples may be collected from participants after the surgery; this is
      optional and will only be done with prior approval from participants. All participants will
      attend study visits at Day 30 and Months 6, 12, and 24. At each visit, participants will take
      part in a medication history review, a physical examination, an echocardiogram, a
      cardiopulmonary exercise test, neurocognitive tests, and quality of life surveys.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic severe ischemic mitral regurgitation (often with tethering as a major
             mechanism) in the judgment of the clinical site echocardiographer, assessed by
             transthoracic echocardiogram. Assessment of mitral regurgitation will be performed
             using an integrative method (Zoghbi W. et al. J. American Society of Echocardiography.
             2003:16:777-802. see appendix). Quantitative guidelines as proposed would be: ERO ≥
             0.4 cmsq. If ERO &lt; 0.4, then the degree of mitral regurgitation will be guided by
             other color Doppler quantitative methods (jet area/left atrial area ratio, vena
             contracta, supportive criteria in an integrated fashion

          <description>Participants will undergo mitral valve repair with annuloplasty and a sub-valvular procedure for severe tethering.
Mitral Valve Repair with Annuloplasty: The annuloplasty ring will be chosen by the surgeon. The ring is sized to the anterior leaflet and intertrigonal distance. A semi-rigid or rigid annuloplasty ring will be used, and if tethering is present, a subvalvar procedure will be performed.</description>

Mitral Valve Replacement: Mitral valve replacement will include complete preservation of the subvalvar apparatus. The technique of preservation, choice of prosthetic valve, and technique of suture placement will be dependent on the surgeon's preference. The prosthetic valve will be tested for paravalvular leaks by using the left ventricular saline infusion test.</description>

            <groups_desc>The trial was designed with a power of 90% to detect a between-group difference of 15 ml per square meter in the LVESVI from baseline to 12 months. We assumed a baseline LVESVI of 100 ml per square meter, improvements of 20 ml per square meter in the repair group and 35 ml per square meter in the replacement group, and equal 1-year mortality of 10 to 20% in the two groups. The primary null hypothesis was that there would be no between-group difference in the LVESVI at 12 months.</groups_desc>

            <non_inferiority_desc>We tested this hypothesis in an intention-to-treat analysis using a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, at a 0.05 alpha level. This analysis accommodated nonignorable missing LVESVI outcomes owing to the death of patients by assigning deceased patients the worst ranks in order on the basis of the time of death. We used multiple imputation for data that were missing for reasons other than death to calculate the 12-month LVESVI on the assumption that the data were missing at random.</non_inferiority_desc>

          <description>Participants will undergo mitral valve repair with annuloplasty and a sub-valvular procedure for severe tethering.
Mitral Valve Repair with Annuloplasty: The annuloplasty ring will be chosen by the surgeon. The ring is sized to the anterior leaflet and intertrigonal distance. A semi-rigid or rigid annuloplasty ring will be used, and if tethering is present, a subvalvar procedure will be performed.</description>

          <title>Mitral Valve Replacement</title>
          <description>Participants will undergo mitral valve replacement and complete preservation of the sub-valvular apparatus.
Mitral Valve Replacement: Mitral valve replacement will include complete preservation of the subvalvar apparatus. The technique of preservation, choice of prosthetic valve, and technique of suture placement will be dependent on the surgeon's preference. The prosthetic valve will be tested for paravalvular leaks by using the left ventricular saline infusion test.</description>
