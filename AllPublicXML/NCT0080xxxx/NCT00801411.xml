      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, and doxorubicin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the
      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet
      known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying cyclophosphamide given together with
      docetaxel to see how well it works compared with cyclophosphamide given together with
      doxorubicin in treating women with newly diagnosed breast cancer that can be removed by
      surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate tumor pathological complete response rate after neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide
           in combination with docetaxel vs doxorubicin hydrochloride in women with operable
           clinically node-negative breast cancer and normal topoisomerase IIα expression.

      Secondary

        -  To assess tumor clinical and pathological overall response rates in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of these regimens.

        -  To assess disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To assess the efficacy of short-course (3 days) filgrastim (G-CSF) as primary and
           secondary prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia in patients receiving docetaxel and
           cyclophosphamide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]- or
      progesterone receptor [PR]-positive vs ER- and PR-negative) and T stage (T2 vs T3). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all
      patients undergo surgery.

      Tumor specimens obtained prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are analyzed for topoisomerase IIα
      gene and protein expression by IHC and FISH. Tissue samples are also collected at surgery for
      future studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.
