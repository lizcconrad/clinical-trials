      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a behavioral treatment,
      contingency management, in reducing stimulant use in persons with serious mental illness.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of a twelve week contingency management (CM)
      intervention for treating psycho-stimulant substance abuse when delivered in the context of a
      community mental health center (CMHC) setting for adults suffering from serious mental
      illness (SMI). The CM paradigm to be used is one which has been shown effective in several
      recent large clinical trials, using the variable magnitude of reinforcement procedure. The
      reinforcers will be vouchers or actual items useful for day to day living in this population.
      Two hundred SMI participants with co-occurring stimulant disorders will be recruited from a
      large urban CMHC and randomized to receive either the active CM paradigm plus treatment as
      usual (TAU), or TAU which will include the delivery of reinforcement for study involvement
      (reinforcement that is not contingent on drug abstinence). The primary outcome is change in
      psycho-stimulant use (methamphetamine, amphetamine and/or cocaine). Secondary outcomes
      include: changes in use of other illegal drugs or alcohol; changes in CMHC treatment
      adherence and follow-through; changes in psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and community
      outcomes (homelessness, incarcerations, etc.). Additional outcomes to be measured include
      changes in drug craving, stage of change, nicotine use, and HIV risk status. The study
      involves two phases, the 12 week treatment phase, where CM and control treatments are
      delivered, as well as a 3 month follow up phase.
