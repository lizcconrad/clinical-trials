    <textblock>
      Induced pluripotent stem cells potentially may be useful in the future as an unlimited source
      of cells for transplantation.

      The major goal of the project is to develop human iPS cells from existing lines of
      fibroblasts that were originally donated as clinical grade feeders for the development of
      clinical grade hESCs. The clinical grade feeders were developed from aborted fetuses,
      foreskin and umbilical cord.

      The potential to reprogram somatic cells into an embryonic state raises multiple basic
      research questions related both to the process of reprogramming and the properties of iPS
      cells. We will use various approaches to study the molecular mechanisms and processes that
      occur during reprogramming. We will use various experimental systems to characterize and
      study the properties of the iPS cells, their biology, developmental potential, capability to
      give rise to functional differentiated progeny etc.

      The clinical grade donated feeders used in this project were developed under GMP conditions
      using animal-free reagents. For potential future clinical applications, the iPS cells will be
      developed under GMP conditions, using reagents and methods that will be acceptable for
      clinical applications.
