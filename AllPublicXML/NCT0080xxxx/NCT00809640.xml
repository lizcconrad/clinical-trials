    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a prevention campaign promoting active
      management in shifting beliefs in 6 to 8 year old schoolchildren. Subjects will be taken from
      a random sample of schools in Majorca, Spain: private, public and concerted. A 10 item
      questionnaire will be given to all children in that age group, to be answered in class on
      days 1, 14 and 97. Schools will be randomly assigned to the study and control groups. In the
      study group the students will get a Back Comic-Book (promotes active management) after the
      first assessment. The control group will have no other intervention than the questionnaire.
