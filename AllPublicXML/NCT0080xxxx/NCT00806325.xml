    <textblock>
      Acute leukemia is a life threatening illness that strikes people of all ages. In addition to
      surviving the direct effects of the disease, the treatment of leukemia generally requires
      chemotherapy which has its own burden. Infection is one of the most common secondary problems
      faced by these patients. Simple infections are common and easily treated with aggressive
      antibiotics. However, treated progressive infection leads to loss of vital organ function and
      is termed severe sepsis. Severe sepsis is associated with increased risk of death and the
      need for specialized care in the intensive care unit.

      Besides the appropriate use of antibiotics, little is known about what clinical and patient
      factors are associated with the development of severe sepsis. Recent evidence has suggested
      that certain practices like frequent transfusion of blood products and control of glucose
      levels effects outcome in critically ill patients. In addition, there have been advances in
      our knowledge of certain genes that may predispose people to severe infections. It is
      possible that these factors are important in people who are not yet critically ill, but are
      at risk for the development of severe sepsis.

      This observational study will look at genetic, clinical and therapeutic factors that are
      associated with the development of severe sepsis. This will help doctors understand what
      treatments may be helpful in preventing this serious complication.

      Primary hypothesis: Hyperglycemia during inpatient therapy of AML is associated with
      increased mortality (fewer hospital free days to Day 60, see below).

        -  H1a: Hyperglycemia will result in an increased risk of developing clinical signs of
           infection (fever).

        -  H1b: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of developing severe sepsis
           after the onset of clinical signs of infection (fever).

           o H1b1: Hyperglycemia will be associated with the development of acute lung injury after
           the onset of signs of infection (fever).

        -  H1c: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission.

           o H1c1: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission for
           severe sepsis.

        -  H1d: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of death in those subjects
           with severe sepsis (fewer hospital free days to Day 60, see below).

      Secondary Aim: To investigate whether TSP-1 is important in modulating the course of
      sepsis-induced acute lung injury.

      Secondary hypothesis: In patients with sepsis, increased levels of functional TSP-1 will be
      associated with a lower incidence of and a less severe course of lung injury.

        -  H2a: In human sepsis, increased TSP-1 levels will be associated with a lower incidence
           of lung-injury.

        -  H2b: In human sepsis, increased TSP-1 levels will be associated with a less severe
           course of lung-injury.

        -  H2c: In human sepsis, patients with the Asn682Ser polymorphism in the TSP-1 gene will be
           associated with a higher incidence of lung-injury.

        -  H2d In human sepsis, patients with the Asn682Ser polymorphism in the TSP-1 gene will be
           associated with a more severe course of lung-injury.
