      The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability to combine a radioactive medication
      directly targeted against lymphoma cells with the immune effects of an allogeneic blood stem
      cell transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite initial high response rates of low grade Non Hodgkin lymphoma, progressive or
      refractory disease currently remains incurable. Being a radiosensitive tumor, we hypothesize
      that combining different modalities of treatment including targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT),
      and a graft versus lymphoma effect related to an allogeneic non myeloablative stem cell
      transplant may increase response and survival rates in a safe manner in patients with
      persistent disease following initial treatment. In this study patients who are not eligible
      for a standard stem cell transplant approach because of relapsed or refractory disease and
      who have a related sibling donor are treated with RIT followed by an allogeneic non
      myeloablative blood stem cell transplant

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have/be

          1. Age 18 to 65 years. Patients between age 66 and 69 may be enrolled if judged to be in
             excellent physical condition as per treating physician and study investigator and
             based on institutional practice.

          2. Diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular, marginal zone, small lymphocytic
             lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma or transformed from an indolent NHL to aggressive
             histology disease lymphoma as defined by the World Health Organization.

          3. Disease relapsed after, refractory or failing to achieve a PR after two or more cycles
             of intensive salvage chemotherapy (R-ESHAP or other) or disease relapsed after
             autologous stem cell transplantation. Poor partial response is defined as less than
             50% reduction of tumor size. Salvage chemotherapy has to be administered after either
             1st, 2nd or 3rd relapse

          4. Disease expressing the CD 20 antigen

          5. ECOG performance status 0-2

          6. Judged to be able to tolerate NST and Zevalin treatment based on institutional
             criteria.
