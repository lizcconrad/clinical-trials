  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a modified-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trial
      of levalbuterol HFA MDI administered using a facemask and holding chamber in subjects birth
      to &lt;48 months with asthma. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009,
      Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's
      name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Visit 4 in the Mean Daily Composite Score Based on the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Assessments (PACA)</title>
        <description>The daily composite score is the sum of the scores of 5 domains: Nocturnal Awakenings Due to Wheeze and Cough, Daytime Wheeze, Daytime Cough, Shortness of Breath, and Asthma Symptom Score. A possible score of 0 (no symptoms) to 19 (severe symptoms).

        <title>Change From Baseline to Visit 4 in the Mean Daily Composite Score Based on the Daytime and Nighttime Asthma Symptom Scores as Measured by Pediatric Asthma Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The daily composite score is the sum of the scores of 7 items: Difficulty Breathing, Cough, Wheeze, Activity Limitation, Level of Activity Limitation, Overall Symptom Score, and Nighttime Asthma. The range for the PAQ is 0 (no symptoms) to 27 (severe symptoms).
The mean daily composite score at Visit 4 is defined as the mean daily composite scores in the 7 days prior to Visit 4.</description>
