  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of early intranasal
      cooling prior to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the emergency medical services
      (EMS) environment. It was hypothesized that cooling during the resuscitation attempt would
      increase ROSC and subsequent survival. The study was not powered to demonstrate
      statistically-significant differences in any outcome parameter, but was intended as an
      exploratory study only.

    <textblock>
      Out of hospital cardiac arrest remains a significant cause of death. Mild hypothermia induced
      after resuscitation from cardiac arrest has been shown to improve neurologically intact
      survival. Studies in dogs and rodents have demonstrated improved outcomes when cooling is
      initiated intra-arrest.

      The RhinoChill is a non-invasive cooling device through which rapid cooling is achieved via
      the intranasal delivery of an evaporative coolant into the nasopharynx. Due to its
      non-invasive and portable nature, the RhinoChill can be used to begin cooling earlier than
      other cooling devices.

      Studies performed using the RhinoChill in a porcine model of cardiac arrest suggest that
      cooling with the RhinoChill prior to the first defibrillation attempt facilitates
      resuscitation and improves resuscitation rate and neurologically intact survival.

      This study is being performed to assess the feasibility of using the RhinoChill device in the
      pre-hospital setting to improve resuscitation from cardiac arrest.

    <measure>Achieve Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-hour after arrest</time_frame>
    <description>ROSC was defined as the return of an organized rhythm on electrocardiography (ECG) with a palpable pulse that was maintained for at least 20 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Survived to Hospital Discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after arrest</time_frame>

    <measure>Survived Neurologically-Intact</measure>
    <time_frame>30-days after arrest</time_frame>
    <description>The Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) are used to describe neurological outcome. A CPC of 1 or 2 is considered &quot;neurologically intact.&quot;
- Good cerebral performance: little to no deficit.
- Moderate cerebral disability: capable of independent activities of daily life
- Severe cerebral disability: conscious, but dependent on others for daily support
- Coma or vegetative state
- Death or brain death</description>

    <description>The therapeutic temperature range for treatment in cardiac arrest is considered to be 32-34C. Time to therapeutic temperature was taken as the first time in which 34C was measured. Tympanic and core temperatures were taken in all patients.</description>

    <measure>Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after arrest</time_frame>
    <description>These were defined serious adverse events that are not direct sequelae of the cardiac arrest itself or the underlying cardiac disease. Therefore, these do not include recurrent arrests occcuring within 24 hours of resuscitation nor deaths due to lack of cardiac and/or neurological recovery.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited by emergency medical system advanced life support personnel over an 8-month period (November 2008 through June 2009). Patients appearing to meet the study criteria were randomized during ongoing resuscitation procedures. Patients that survived to hospital admission were followed until death or hospital discharge.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Due to the emergency nature of the research, patients were often randomized into the study before all exclusion criteria could be ruled out (e.g., &quot;Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate&quot; (DNAR) orders, drug over-dose (OD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA)). Therefore, patients meeting pre-defined exclusion criteria were not included in the outcome measures.</pre_assignment_details>

Additional events that did not qualify for reporting as SAEs were re-arrests occurring within 24 hours and deaths directly due to lack of cardiac or neurological recovery from the index event.</desc>
