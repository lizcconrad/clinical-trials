  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of single
      doses of trospium inhalation powder (TrIP) administered to subjects with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD).

    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study.
      Following screening, each eligible subject was randomized to a dosing sequence. Study
      subjects received a total of 5 single doses, each separated by a 3- to 14-day washout period.
      Doses A, B, C, and D were administered in a double-blind fashion, in sequences generated by a
      4-period Latin square design. The 4 dosing sequences were: ABCD, BDAC, CADB, and DCBA. Dose E
      was administered in an open-label fashion as the final dose in each dosing sequence for all
      subjects.

      Subjects reported to the clinic the evening prior to each dose. Protocol assessments were
      carried out until 24 hours postdose. Pulmonary function testing (via spirometry) was captured
      at specified timepoints at baseline as well as before and after dosing. Other efficacy and
      safety outcomes were assessed according to protocol. Blood sampling was performed for
      assessment of trospium concentrations at specified timepoints.

    <description>Following screening, each subject was randomized to a sequence of 5 dosing periods (Doses A, B, C, D, and E). Each period was separated by a 3- to 14-day washout interval.
The dosing formulations were as follows:
Dose A = placebo Dose B = TrIP-2D (100 μg TrCl formulated in leucine and DPPC) Dose C = TrIP-2SS (100 μg TrCl formulated in leucine and sodium saccharin) Dose D = TrIP-2D (400 μg TrCl) Dose E = TrIP-2SS (100 μg TrCl) + Foradil (12 μg formoterol fumarate) FEV1 (L)was measured at 15 and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours postdose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FEV1 Response to Treatment</measure>

    <description>Response was defined as the number of subjects reporting a post-treatment FEV1 of ≥12% (or 200 mL) above baseline.</description>
