      1. Circulating bone marrow and blood vessel precursors home in to sites of ischemia and aid
           regeneration of injured tissue

        2. Increasing the number of circulating precursors will improve in regeneration of damaged
           brain following ischemic stroke.

      We hypothesize that mobilization of bone marrow precursor cells into the blood stream will
      allow them to redistribute in the injured central nervous system and aid regeneration of
      damaged tissue. If the hypotheses is correct, it predicts that G-CSF treatment will improve
      the functional outcome of patients following acute ischemic stroke.

      Underlying this work are the following considerations:

        -  Currently the clinical and functional outcomes following ischemic strokes are poor and
           require new treatment strategies.

        -  G-CSF administration is a well established routine treatment for the mobilization of
           hematopoietic and endothelial precursors from the bone marrow into the circulation.

        -  Acute ischemia locally increases factors that direct circulating bone marrow derived
           cells to home to these sites of injury.

        -  Evidence exists that bone marrow derived cells are able to repopulate different tissues
           including those of the CNS.

        -  Acute ischemic injury to the central nervous system provides a milieu for the
           regeneration of neural tissue.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is between 45 and 85 years of age

          -  Patient is of either gender

          -  The qualifying stroke is ischemic with a total NIH Stroke Score less than 18.

          -  The stroke involves the non-dominant hemisphere including the cerebral cortex and
             results in hemiparesis. The inclusion of sub-cortical strokes will be permitted if the
             size is of 3 cm or greater. Patients suffering strokes involving the dominant
             hemisphere resulting in mild dysphasia are also eligible.

          -  The stroke is classified as a partial anterior cerebral syndrome by the Oxfordshire
             Criteria.

          -  NIHSS at baseline evaluation with:

             *Level of consciousness is not impaired as defined by an NIHSS between 0 and 1 on
             question 1a and

          -  Hemiparesis as defined by

               -  an NIHSS between 1 and 4 on questions 5 and/or

               -  an NIHSS between 1 and 4 on questions 6.
