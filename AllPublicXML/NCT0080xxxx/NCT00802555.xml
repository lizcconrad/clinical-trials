          -  Written informed consent granted prior to initiation of any study-specific screening
             procedures, given with the understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw
             from the study at any time, without prejudice

          -  18 year of age or older

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC (not required if: a hepatic lesion is
             &gt;2cm in diameter , is suggestive of HCC at radiology and α-fetoprotein (AFP) is &gt; 200
             mg/mL)

          -  Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging Category27 A, B or C that can not benefit
             from treatments of established efficacy and/or higher priority

          -  Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh Class A and B without ascites or with slight ascites
             that can be recognized only by imaging techniques and/or managed easily with diuretics
             (e.g. 100 mg spironolactone per day and/or furosemide 40 mg/day)

          -  Cirrhotic status confirmed by one of the following methods/evidence:

          -  Biopsy

          -  Endoscopy showing gastrointestinal tract varices

          -  Evidence of portal hypertension on imaging studies such as dilated portal vein,
             collateral circulation

          -  ECOG PS ≤1

          -  Not more than two prior systemic regimens for HCC and the last treatment must have
             been completed ≥4 weeks prior to first dose of ARQ 197

          -  Local or loco-regional therapy (i.e., surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic arterial
             embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol
             injection, or cryoablation) must have been completed ≥4 weeks prior to first dose of
             ARQ 197

          -  Measurable disease as defined by revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST), version 1.1. Tumor lesions selected as target lesion(s) at baseline should
