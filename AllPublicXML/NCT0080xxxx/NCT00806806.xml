  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given as a single perioperative injection, SKY0402 could provide adequate, continuous, and
      extended pain relief that could greatly simplify postoperative pain management, reduce the
      need for repeated administration, and minimize episodes of breakthrough pain.

      Subjects will be given either SKY0402 or placebo in response to a noxious stimulus, and the
      time to onset will be recorded.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible for study entry will meet the following criteria:

          -  Male or female, ages at least 18 years and not over 55 years.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range 20.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Applies to females only: Female subjects of childbearing potential with a
             nonsterilized male sexual partner must agree to use a hormonal contraceptive, barrier
             contraceptive with additional spermicide, or an intrauterine device beginning &gt; 30
             days prior to the first dosing and continuing until &gt; 7 days after the end of the
             study. Female subjects who are postmenopausal must have been postmenopausal for &gt; 1
             year if they wish not to use contraceptives.

          -  Good general health, evidenced by a lack of significantly abnormal findings on medical
             history and screening assessments.

          -  Pain intensity score of &gt; 30 mm on a VAS after incision and application of an 18%
             acetic acid solution to nontreated skin (i.e., not infiltrated with any test or
             control article) at Screening.

          -  Able and willing to comply with all study visits and procedures, including returning
             as scheduled for the second treatment visit.

          -  Able to speak, read, and understand the language of the ICF, study questionnaires, and
             other instruments used for collecting subject-reported outcomes, in order to enable
             accurate and appropriate responses to pain scales and other required study
             assessments.

          -  Willing and capable of providing written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for the study if he or she meets any of the following
        criteria:

          -  A history of hypersensitivity to amide type local anesthetics.

          -  Pregnancy, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Any current conditions that might interfere with pain assessments, including current
             pain.

          -  Conditions of the skin or neurological abnormalities that might alter pain
             sensitivity. These include excessive scarring, burns, skin grafts, and trauma. Tattoos
             are permitted.

          -  A history of keloid formation.

          -  A coagulopathy or use of medications that might enhance bleeding.

          -  Use of any of the following medication within the times specified before study drug
             administration:

               -  Long-acting opioid mediations within 3 days.

               -  Any opioid medication within 24 hours.

               -  Any analgesic medication within 12 hours.

          -  Consumption of alcohol within 24 hours before either treatment visit.

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, renders a subject unsuitable
             for participation in the study. NOTE: The specific reason(s) for exclusion will be
             documented in the Screening Log.

          -  Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives
             of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration,
             or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the
             subject's participation in this study.

        Minor deviations in eligibility criteria are permitted if approved by the Pacira Medical
        Monitor in agreement with the Investigator prior to dosing.
