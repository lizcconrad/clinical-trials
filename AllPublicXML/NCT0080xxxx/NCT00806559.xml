  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the clinical encounter through the design of the
      clinical environment. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to measure the extent to
      which a newly designed clinical room, compared to a traditional room, affects the
      patient-physician interaction. We will judge this outcome by (a) videotaping encounters; and
      (b) conducting post-visit surveys with patients and an interview with physicians. We will use
      both qualitative and quantitative tools, including a validated and widely used interaction
      coding system on the videotapes, to draw inferences from these data.
