  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the blood
      sugar lowering effect and the safety profile of biphasic insulin aspart 30 compared to
      biphasic human insulin 30, both in combination with metformin in Chinese insulin-naive
      subjects with type 2 diabetes when failing on oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) therapy.

    <measure>Change in IAUC (Incremental Area Under the Curve) for Postprandial Glucose (0-4 Hours) Over 3 Main Meals</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The blood glucose profiles were monitored by CGMS (Continuous Glucose Monitoring System) for 72 hours at baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 6). IAUC was calculated using the trapezoidal method. The arithmetic mean of IAUC (3 meal-specific incremental areas) of day 1 and day 2 was used as the value of IAUC for each CGMS period</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The blood glucose profiles were monitored by CGMS for 72 hours at baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 6). IAUC (0-4 hours) after each meal at 6 weeks and change in IAUC (0-4 hours) from baseline (week 0) after each meal were to be assessed.

    <description>The blood glucose profiles were monitored by CGMS for 72 hours at baseline (week 0) and at end of treatment (week 6). Change in mean FBG from baseline (week 0) was assessed. FBG was read on the CGMS glucose curves at 06:00 each morning over the 72 hours. The arithmetic mean of day 1 and day 2 was used as the value of mean FBG for each CGMS period.</description>

    <measure>Change in 8-point SMBG (Self-monitored Blood Glucose) Profiles</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to perform 8-point SMBG profiles using the provided blood glucose meter on one day within 72 hours CGMS monitoring period at week 0 and week 6. Change in blood glucose level at end of treatment (week 6) from baseline (week 0) at each time point was to be assessed respectively. Blood glucose levels were measured at the following 8 time points: Before each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner), 120 minutes after the start of each meal, at bedtime and at 3 am in the morning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Prandial Blood Glucose Increment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to perform 8-point SMBG profiles using the provided blood glucose meter on one day within 72 hours CGMS monitoring period at week 0 and week 6 respectively. Prandial increment was the difference between the blood glucose (BG) value measured 120 minutes after meal and the BG value measured before meal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in MAGE (Mean Amplitude of Glycaemic Excursions) Assessed by CGMS</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>MAGE is a parameter to monitor the intraday blood glucose excursions. It was calculated using CGMS data and as the arithmetic mean of glycaemic excursion with the criterion that both segments (ascending and descending parts) of the glycaemic excursion exceed of the value of one standard deviation of respective 24-hour blood glucose value. The direction of calculation (peak-to-nadir or nadir-to-peak) was established by the direction of the first excursion. The arithmetic mean of the glycaemic excursion of day 1 and day 2 was the value of MAGE for each CGMS</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in GA (Glycated Albumin)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week -2, week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Glycated Albumin is used as a general glycaemic control parameter. Analysed by laboratory. GA was measured at baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 6). Change in GA at end of treatment (week 6) from baseline (week 0) was assessed.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Hypoglycaemic Events Based on CGMS</measure>
    <time_frame>72-hour monitoring period at Week 0 and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGMS device recorded blood glucose levels every 10 seconds then stored a smoothed average over 5 minutes. The range of blood glucose detection was 2.2-22 mmol/l. Hypoglycaemia was defined as blood glucose readings below 3.5 mmol/l or below 2.5 mmol/l, respectively. The duration of the hypoglycaemic episodes was quantified by accumulating the total time the CGMS profiles stays below the defined threshold (i.e. below 3.5 mmol/l or below 2.5 mmol/l, respectively).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypoglycaemia Based on Self-reported Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-6</time_frame>
    <description>Total number of hypoglycaemic episodes occurring in the trial after baseline (week 0) until the end of treatment (week 6). Hypoglycaemic episodes are classified as major, minor or symptoms only: Major if the subject was unable to treat her/himself; minor if subject was able to treat her/himself and self monitored blood glucose (SMBG) was below 2.8 mmol/L; symptoms only if subject was able to treat her/himself and with no blood glucose measurement or SMBG higher than or equal to 2.8 mmol/L.</description>

        <description>The blood glucose profiles were monitored by CGMS for 72 hours at baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 6).

        <title>Change in MAGE (Mean Amplitude of Glycaemic Excursions) Assessed by CGMS</title>
        <description>MAGE is a parameter to monitor the intraday blood glucose excursions. It was calculated using CGMS data and as the arithmetic mean of glycaemic excursion with the criterion that both segments (ascending and descending parts) of the glycaemic excursion exceed of the value of one standard deviation of respective 24-hour blood glucose value. The direction of calculation (peak-to-nadir or nadir-to-peak) was established by the direction of the first excursion. The arithmetic mean of the glycaemic excursion of day 1 and day 2 was the value of MAGE for each CGMS</description>
