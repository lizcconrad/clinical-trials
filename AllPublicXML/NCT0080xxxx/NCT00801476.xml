  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young women with breast cancer have an increased breast tissue density and conventional
      imaging tests such as mammography and breast ultrasound are less sensitive and specific for
      detecting breast cancer than in older breast cancer patients. Breast MRI is an emerging tool
      that has been proven to improve the ability to identify breast cancers by determining the
      extent of disease and also detect multifocal, multicentric and bilateral breast cancers. To
      date, the role of pre-operative breast MRI is not clearly defined. The investigators are
      proposing a study to evaluate the impact of preoperative breast MRI on surgical
      decision-making in breast cancer patients &lt;= 50 years. This may lead to improved
      characterization of breast cancers in these younger patients that may ultimately result in
      lower local recurrence rates in the future. The additional information attained through the
      breast MRI may also guide the use of radiation, chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy in these
      patients.

    <description>After the standard mammogram and ultrasound testing, the surgeon is asked which surgical procedure they feel is appropriate for the patient. A bilateral breast MRI is then performed prior to surgery. The surgeon is again asked which surgery they feel is appropriate based on the new information provided by the MRI. The study is trying to see if this pre-operative breast MRI helps define the tumour leading to a better first surgical decision.</description>

          -  Female aged &lt;= 50 years

          -  Histological proof of invasive breast cancer via fine needle aspiration or core needle
             biopsy

          -  Premenopausal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient not considered an appropriate surgical candidate; i.e., patient is not well
             enough to have breast cancer surgery

             diagnosed cancer

             neurodefibrillator, metallic foreign bodies, etc.)

          -  Patient has inflammatory breast cancer according to the standard clinical definition.
             This is a type of breast cancer in which there is evidence of erythema and/or edema.
             The skin of the breast may also have changes of peau d'orange.
