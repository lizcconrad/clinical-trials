    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive a dose of study medication and will undergo a PET scan at 4 hrs and
      23.5 hours post dose. Subjects will remain in the clinic from Day-1 to Day 7 for PK sample
      collection and safety monitoring. Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 10 for a
      follow-up safety assessment.
