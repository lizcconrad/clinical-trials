        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with unilateral acute sensorineural hearing loss (ASNHL) with onset 48 hours
             or less ago

          -  Mean earing loss compared with the unaffected contralateral ear of at least 30 dB in
             the 3 most affected contiguous frequencies

          -  Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 60 years

          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

          -  Able to attend the on-study visits

          -  Written informed consent before participation in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bilateral ASNHL, if not resulting from acoustic trauma

          -  Suspected perilymph fistula or membrane rupture

          -  Barotrauma

          -  Average air bone gap higher than 20 dB in 3 contiguous frequencies

          -  History of Meniere disease, autoimmune hearing loss, radiation-induced hearing loss,
             endolymphatic hydrops, suspected retro-cochlear lesion or fluctuating hearing loss

          -  Previous ASNHL incident within the past 6 weeks

          -  Evidence of acute or chronic otitis media or otitis externa on examination

          -  Any drug-based therapy for inner ear hearing loss that is ongoing or was performed in
             the past 2 weeks

          -  Any ongoing or planned concomitant medication for the treatment of tinnitus until 30
             days after administration

          -  Any therapy known as ototoxic (e.g. aminoglycosides, cisplatin, loop diuretics,
             quinine etc.) in the past 6 months prior to study inclusion

          -  History of drug abuse or alcoholism

          -  Any clinically relevant respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological (except vertigo or
             tinnitus), or psychiatric disorders

          -  Known hypersensitivity, allergy or intolerance to the study medication or any history
             of severe abnormal drug reaction

          -  Women who are breast-feeding, pregnant or who plan a pregnancy during the trial

          -  Women of childbearing potential who declare being unwilling or unable to practice
