      Aim: Osteosynthesis with locking plate/screws has become increasingly popular in recent
      years. It is the only treatment option which allows immediate postoperative immobilization.
      However, compared to conservative treatment or treatment with external fixators, locking
      plates are very expensive and the operation can be very challenging, even for experienced
      surgeons. The long-term results of all treatment modalities are equal, which has been shown
      in numerous studies. However, there are no evidence based studies published yet which look at
      short-term outcomes. The investigators do feel but do not know that patients who do not need
      postoperative immobilization return to work significantly earlier or are independent faster
      than patients whose wrists are immobilized for up to 6 weeks. If that is the case, then the
      higher costs and risks of the operation are justified, if not, then we have to re-evaluate
      our indications for using locking distal radius plates distal radius Methods: Group 1:
      Treatment of distal radius fractures with either volar or dorsal locking plates. No fixation
      postoperatively, immediate ROM (range of motion) exercises and usage of the wrist in
      activities of daily life (ADL) allowed.

      Radiological and clinical controls 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively. Endpoints
      are time to return to work / return to independency (in older people), ROM; Grip strength
      (with Jamar Dynamometer).

      Outcome scores are DASH (Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score)and PRWE (Patient related
      wrist evaluation).

      Group 2 Treatment of distal radius fractures with either an external fixator +/- K-wires or
      with K-wires and forearm cast or by cast alone. Main issue is that the wrist is immobilized
      for a period of 6 weeks. Radiological and clinical controls 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks
      postoperatively. Endpoints are time to return to work / return to independency (in older
      people), ROM; Grip strength (with Jamar Dynamometer). Outcome scores are DASH and PRWE. Both
      plating and external fixation / cast fixation are standard and accepted treatment modalities
      for distal radius fractures. A power analysis indicated that a total sample size of 52
      patients randomized equally (1:1) to each treatment arm without any blocking or
      stratification would provide 80 % statistical power (alpha = .05, beta = .20) to detect a 20%
      difference in mean DASH and PRWE scores.
