  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is ranked number 3 by the WHO list of important diseases worldwide and is the only
      disease with increasing mortality. The pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced COPD is
      obscure, therefore more insight is needed to design effective anti-inflammatory agents. We
      hypothesize that healthy individuals who are susceptible to smoking demonstrate a higher and
      aberrant inflammatory response to cigarette smoke. This susceptibility is caused by
      heterogeneous factors and is associated with various polymorphic genes that interact with
      each other and with the environment.

      Objective:

        -  To define mediators involved in the early induction of COPD in susceptible smokers (and
           so to define new drug targets)

        -  To develop new biological and clinical markers for the early diagnosis and monitoring of
           COPD

        -  To compare between susceptible and non-susceptible individuals the corticosteroid
           responsiveness of bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, and to study the mechanisms of
           smoking-induced corticosteroid unresponsiveness.

        -  To study the role of candidate genes that may play a role in the development of fixed
           airway obstruction, and to identify clues for patient's responsiveness to specific
           drugs.

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

        -  Local inflammation before and after cigarette smoking assessed by exhaled breath
           condensate, microprobe sampling and bronchial biopsies.

        -  Systemic inflammation before and after cigarette smoking assessed by the expression of
           established and newly developed markers on innate immune cells associated with
           pre-activation.

        -  Extensive clinical characterisation including life style factors, lung function, CT
           scanning of the lung.

        -  Corticosteroid responsiveness of epithelial cells in vitro.

        -  Distribution of candidate genes (SNPs) for COPD between the 5 different groups ( see
           description below) and associations with the inflammatory responses on acute smoking.
