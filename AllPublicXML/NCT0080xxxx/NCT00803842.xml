  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A side effect occurring in a majority of patients taking erlotinib (Tarceva®) consists of a
      skin rash. Sometimes, symptoms associated with the rash necessitate erlotinib dose reduction
      or discontinuation. Some physicians have successfully treated the erlotinib-induced rash with
      doxycycline. At the same time, it has been observed that in patients who develop the
      erlotinib rash, the cancers respond better to erlotinib treatment. This research study is
      designed to determine how well doxycycline treats the erlotinib rash and whether doxycycline
      affects the blood levels of erlotinib.

    <description>Doxycycline (the study drug) will be provided to all subjects as 100 mg tablets. They will be allocated enough doxycycline to last them until their next scheduled visit. The doxycycline tablets should be taken orally (only) at a dosage of 100 mg every 12 hours. Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The doxycycline tablets should not be taken with foods that contain calcium. The absorption of doxycycline is reduced when taking bismuth subsalicylate. Duration of study period if 14 days</description>
