    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been recently FDA approved for the
      treatment of resistant depression. No accordance exists on which are the involved mechanisms
      of action and on which stimulation parameters, frequency and side are optimal.

      To compare these different procedures we study patients with unipolar recurrent resistant
      major depressive disorder in a double-blind, controlled trial randomized to either sequential
      bilaterally on the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or monolaterally on
      the right DLPFC. Patients will be randomized to receive sequentially low-frequency rTMS at 1
      Hz to the right DLPFC and high-frequency rTMS at 10 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC, or to receive
      low-frequency rTMS at 1 Hz to the right DLPFC. Significant antidepressant effect as expressed
      by a reduction of Hamilton Depression Scale score will be recorded in both the groups of
      patients.

    <description>Repetitive TMS will be administered using a MAGSTIM rapid magnetic stimulator (Magstim Company, Ltd., Whitland, U.K.) and a 70-mm figure-eight shaped coils.
In monolateral treatment in right DLPFC, three 140-second trains will be applied at 1 Hz and at 110% of RMT. There is a 30 seconds intertrain interval (total of 420 stimuli per session). In sequential treatment, the stimulation will be applied in the first to the right and then to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In right DLPFC will be applied three 140-second trains at 1 Hz and at 110% of RMT. There will be a 30 seconds intertrain interval (total of 420 stimuli per session). In left DLPFC will be applied twenty 5-second trains were applied at 10 Hz and at 100% of RMT. There will be a 25-second intertrain interval (total of 1000 stimuli per session). Patients will be treated from Monday to Friday, for a total of 15 days.</description>
