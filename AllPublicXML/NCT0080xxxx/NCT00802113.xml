    <textblock>
      The sequential combination of myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation
      (APBSCT) followed by a reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplant (Allo SCT) and post
      SCT adoptive cellular immunotherapy will be well tolerated in patients with refractory or
      recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphomas are the third most common group of cancers in children and adolescents in the
      United States. While Hodgkin's Disease (HD) has been described for many years, some subtypes
      of the non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL) have only recently been described. Non-Hodgkin's
      lymphomas traditionally have been classified as low, intermediate or high grade based on
      their clinical aggressiveness. More recently they have been divided into two major subgroups
      indolent and aggressive lymphomas by the current National Cancer Institute (NCI/PDQ)
      reference. Among children, aggressive histologies are prevalent including small non-cleaved
      cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and diffuse large cell lymphoma. The most common
      histologic classifications of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma over the past 30 years has
      included the morphological schema developed by Rappaport, the morphologically and
      immunologically based schema of Lukes and Collins, the Kiel classifications, the prognostic
      sub-groupings of the National Cancer Institute's Working Formulation, and the most recently
      developed classification that utilizes morphological, immunophenotypic and genetic
      information in the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification.

    <description>Fludarabine and Busulfan: Patients who have a matched family (allogeneic) donor will go on to receive non-ablative therapy, followed by an infusion of donor stem cells; this is called an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant. The non-ablative therapy will be busulfan and ﬂudarabine, Usually large (myeloablative) doses of these drugs are used for an allogeneic transplant. However, in this study lower doses (non-ablative) of chemotherapy will be given. In patients who still have evidence of disease after allogeneic transplant, additional donor immune cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) (DLI) will be given twice to further treat the lymphoma.</description>

    <description>Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG: For patients who don't have a matched family donor, a cord blood search and unrelated adult search will be done at all of the cord blood banks and adult donor registries in the world. If a closely matched cord blood donor or unrelated adult donor is found, non-ablative chemotherapy with busulfan, ﬂudarabine and antithymocyte globulin followed by the infusion of matched unrelated cord blood cells or adult donor stem cells or bone marrow to restore the bone marrow will be given.</description>
