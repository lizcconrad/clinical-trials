      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective
      immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating
      patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube
      cancer, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of ALVAC(2)-NY-ESO-1(M)/TRICOM vaccine in patients
           with stage II-IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive ALVAC(2)-NY-ESO-1(M)/TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
