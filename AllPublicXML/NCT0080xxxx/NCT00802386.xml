  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have shown a higher prevalence of BV among IUD users.13,,14 None,
      however, have screened women prior to inserting the IUD. No data exists detailing the status
      of the vaginal microflora and possible cervical infection prior to IUD insertion. Thus, no
      inference can be made about the possible influence of IUD insertion and presence to the
      development of upper genital tract infection . Consequently, with the current literature, it
      would be difficult to make an argument for screening and treatment for BV prior to IUD
      insertion. This study will help us determine whether women with an IUD develop a change in
      the normal bacteria that are present in the vagina, known as bacterial vaginosis (BV). In
      addition, in those women with BV, we are looking to see if they develop more significant
      problems with the IUD, than those who do not have BV. Overall, this will help us determine
      whether all women should be screened for BV prior to IUD insertion.

    <measure>Rate of abnormal bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>In the study population, we will calculate the number of women who have BV at the time of IUD insertion. In order to assess abnormal bleeding, participants will be asked to keep a menstrual calendar denoting the bleeding characteristics (heavy, normal, light flow or spotting).</description>

    <description>At the 1-month follow-up visit, repeat swabs for BV will be taken and we will also checking that the IUD is still in place, by the presence of visible IUD strings at the cervical os.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurence of new onset BV infection</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-IUD insertion</time_frame>
    <description>We will look at women who did not have BV at the first visit but who acquire this infection at the 1-month visit. From this, we may make an inference about the possible influence of IUD insertion and presence on the occurrence of vaginal flora changes.</description>
