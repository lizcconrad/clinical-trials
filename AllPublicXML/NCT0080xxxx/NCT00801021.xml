      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of an investigational oral rinse in
      reducing uropathogens and treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 7-day treatment with a 28-day follow up has been designed as a &quot;before and after&quot;
      assessment of the clinical signs and symptoms of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection and
      the reduction/eradication of urinary pathogens. Enrollment is targeted to achieving 20
      evaluable subjects by the end of the study. After enrolling in the trial at Day 0 (first day
      of dosing), participants will report back to the study site at Days 3, 7, and 28. At Day 3 or
      any time thereafter, worsening of symptoms and/or increases in quantitative bacteria counts
      will result in removal from the trial and prescription of a rescue medication, which will be
      selected based on microbial susceptibility testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-pregnant adult females;

          2. 18 years of age or older;

          3. Clinical signs with one or more symptoms of a UTI (e.g., dysuria, frequency, urgency,
             suprapubic pain) with onset of symptoms &lt; 72 hours prior to study entry;

          4. One positive dipstick urine test positive either for leukocyte esterase or nitrates or
             have a urinalysis with &gt; 5 wbc/hpf.

          5. A pre-treatment clean-catch midstream urine culture with ≥ 104 CFU/mL of a bacterial
             organism

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Males;

          2. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or not using a medically accepted, effective method
             of birth control;

          3. Three or more episodes of acute uncomplicated UTI in the past 12 months;

          4. Known structural abnormality that would predispose the participant to reflux or
             urinary retention;

          5. Patients with evidence of factors predisposing to the development of urinary tract
             infections, including calculi, stricture, primary renal disease (e.g., polycystic
             renal disease), or neurogenic bladder;

          6. Patients with significant impaired immunity secondary to chemotherapy, oral
             corticosteroids, or HIV;

          7. Patients with onset of symptoms &gt; 72 hours prior to entry;

          8. Patients with a temperature ≥ 100°F, flank pain, chills, or any other manifestations
             suggestive of upper urinary tract infection;

          9. Patients with purported hypersensitivity to iodine;

         10. Patients with history of thyroid disease;

         11. Patients who received treatment with other antimicrobials within 48 hours prior to
             entry;

         12. Any significant medical or psychiatric condition that would render examination
             difficult or invalid or prevent the subject from active study participation; inability
             to use an oral rinse;

         13. Use of concomitant medication that, in the opinion of the Study Directors, might
             interfere with the outcome of the study.
