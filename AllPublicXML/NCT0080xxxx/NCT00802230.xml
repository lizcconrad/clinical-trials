  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metoprolol succinate is a beta1-selective beta-blocker, becoming non-selective at higher
      doses, while carvedilol is non-selective. We examined whether metoprolol remained
      beta1-selective compared to carvedilol during dose up-titration in Class C heart failure (HF)
      Beta-blocker naïve patients.

      METHODS: Twenty-five NYHA FC II-III HF patients were randomized to carvedilol or metoprolol.
      Patients were studied at baseline and after 2 weeks of up-titration (metoprolol at 25, 50,
      100, and 200 mg daily; carvedilol IR at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 mg and 50mg twice daily).
      Beta2- blockade was determined by an infusion of terbutaline at 6 mg/kg over 1 hour. Glucose
      and potassium levels were serially measured at baseline, every 15 minutes for the 1st hour
      and 30 minutes for 2nd hour post-infusion. The median area under the curve (AUC) for glucose
      and potassium changes were calculated.

             (ejection fraction ≤40%), were &gt;18 years of age, and were on stable optimal medical
             heart failure therapy excluding the use of beta-blockers within the previous 30 days.

             pressure &lt;85/50; second or third degree heart block); concomitant use of
             beta-agonists, beta-antagonists, or anti-arrhythmics; unstable angina; myocardial
