  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which clinically manifests as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and
      pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common but elusive illness that can cause significant
      disability and death if not promptly diagnosed and effectively treated. The annual incidence
      of VTE in the United States is estimated at 1 per 1000. Death occurs in approximately 12% of
      PE cases within 1 month of diagnosis. At present, clinical management of VTE and PE is
      hampered by gaps in our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms, the wide variety in patient
      populations, and incomplete understanding of the long term risks of recurrence and death.
      Given the complex presentation and risk associated with these conditions, proper risk
      assessment and subsequent prophylaxis for all at-risk patients is crucial. While clinical
      prediction rules have been recently developed to associate short-term risks and to stratify
      patients with acute PE, there is a dearth of objective biomarkers that can be related to the
      long-term prognosis of the disease. In addition to clinical information, clot burden is known
      to be strongly associated with clinical outcome of recurrent VTE. The quantification of clot
      burden requires imaging.

      CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) has been established as a reference imaging standard in the
      diagnosis of PE. In addition to its role as a superb diagnostic tool, CTPA contains a wealth
      of information including characteristics of the clot that may be used as biomarkers
      associated with prognosis of PE. The work proposed in this application takes advantage of
      widely available CTPA imaging biomarker data and extends and advances clinical PE risk
      prediction model to include long term (2-year) survival as well as the clinically important
      outcome of recurrence. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and identify CTPA
      imaging biomarkers that are associated with short-term and long-term prognoses of patients
      who were positively diagnosed for PE by CT. The rationale for this proposal is that CT
      imaging is a rich source of imaging biomarkers that may be associated with prognosis of PE.
      This information will help advance our understanding of the risk and recurrence of PE and
      provide a new insight to prognosis and clinical management and treatment of PE. This proposed
      research is innovative in that we have developed new CT imaging biomarkers and designed a
      clinical trial to assess and validate the prognostic values of these biomarkers. Our central
      hypothesis is that CT imaging biomarkers are associated with the risk of death and recurrence
      in patients with PE. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to quantify and characterize
      pulmonary emboli (volume and distribution) and comorbid cardiovasculopulmonary findings from
      CT images of patients who were positively diagnosed for PE by CT; (2) to identify CT imaging
      biomarkers that are associated with the prognosis of patients who were positively diagnosed
      for PE by CT, and to develop risk prediction tools for death and recurrence; and (3) to
      prospectively validate the risk prediction tool, and identify whether the change in CT
      imaging biomarkers of PE after initiation of therapy improve the predictive ability for
      recurrence and death.
