        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of distal-lateral or lateral subungual onychomycosis of one great
             toenail (the target nail)

          -  Target nail plate showing ≥ 12.5% of clinically infected area

          -  Patient must have at least 2 mm of the proximal end of the target nail free of
             infection

          -  Target nail infection due exclusively to a dermatophyte (from both positive direct
             microscopy examination and positive fungal culture as reported by the central
             mycological laboratory)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with more than 2 affected toenails

          -  Patient with psoriasis, lichen planus or other abnormalities that could result in
             clinically abnormal toenail(s)

          -  Patient with moccasin-type tinea pedis

          -  Patient who has received systemic antifungal therapy or topical antifungal nail
             lacquer within 3 months or any other topical antifungal therapy applied to the feet or
             toenails within 2 months prior to screening visit
