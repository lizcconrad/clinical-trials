  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of psilocybin dose and the frequency and intensity of
      support activities for spiritual practice (e.g., meditation) on a battery of attitudinal and
      behavioral outcome measures in 75 healthy volunteers who are interested in pursuing a program
      of spiritual practices with the intention applying spiritual insights and knowledge to
      everyday life. After screening and study enrollment, each volunteer will be assigned to one
      of five groups that vary in dose, frequency and intensity of support for spiritual practice,
      and number of psilocybin sessions (either 2 or 3 sessions). The psilocybin dose manipulation
      will be double-blind. Volunteers will be told that in each of sessions 1, 2, and 3, he/she
      could receive a very low, low, moderate, moderately high, or high dose of psilocybin. They
      will be told that each participant will receive 2 or more dose levels of psilocybin over the
      2 or 3 sessions, and all participants will have one or more sessions in which he or she
      receives a moderately high or high dose of psilocybin. The duration of each volunteer's
      participation will be approximately 6 to 8 months. Each volunteer will receive several hours
      of preparation with the study guides in the month prior to the first psilocybin session; the
      first two sessions will be separated by one month. Various measures will be assessed before,
      during and immediately after sessions. A battery of longitudinal measures will be evaluated
      immediately after study enrollment, 3 weeks after the second psilocybin session, and 4 months
      after the second psilocybin session (6 months after study enrollment). For purposes of
      controlling expectancies through the 6 month follow-up evaluation, volunteers and guides will
      not know which volunteers or how many volunteers will be scheduled for a third session.
