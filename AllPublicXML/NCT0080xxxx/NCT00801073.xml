    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of preserved scleral, corneal and amniotic
      membrane graft for the surgical repair of scleral thinning of different sizes in patients
      underwent surgery of pterygium with associated beta therapy .

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scleral thinning may occur secondary to different ocular surface conditions, especially in
      rheumatologic diseases and after surgeries as in pterygium. There are different methods to
      treat this condition, as to use scleral, corneal and more recently amniotic membrane graft.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with corneal scleral defects that have persisted for 1 years or longer,
             regardless of their cause. These patients will have received corneal-scleral or
             amniotic membrane transplant in order to correct scleral thinning

          -  Patients with history of pterygium surgery associated with beta therapy followed by
             scleral thinning

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular infection

          -  Acute ocular inflammatory condition

          -  Previous ocular surgery in the eye study

          -  Non-controlled systemic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis
