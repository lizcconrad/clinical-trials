      To evaluate the levels of morphine in a patient's blood when morphine is given into the
      epidural space in the form of DepoDur® either alone or following a dose of lidocaine also
      given in the epidural space.

      To evaluate the levels of morphine in a patient's blood when morphine is given into the
      epidural space in the form of DepoDur® either alone or following a dose of lidocaine also
      given in the epidural space. Specifically, we are looking at pregnant women undergoing
      cesarean delivery who will be receiving these medications. A secondary objective is to
      evaluate how well DepoDur® works for pain control, as well as its safety, when it is given
      either alone or following a dose of epidural lidocaine.

    <description>All participant underwent cesarean delivery. An epidural &quot;top-up&quot; anesthetic consisting of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and sodium bicarbonate (1 meq per 10 mL lidocaine) was given. The lidocaine solution was administered in 5 mL increments every 2.5 minutes until a T6 sensory level to touch was attained. Patients also received a 100 mcg dose of fentanyl epidurally after the lidocaine solution had been administered.
Provided delivery had occurred at least 60 minutes after the initial lidocaine administration, patients received EREM 8 mg (DepoDur™) administered through the epidural catheter. A 2 mL epidural saline flush was administered before and after drug administration.</description>

    <description>Participants underwent an elective cesarean delivery with a combined spinal/epidural. All patients received 12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine with 20 mcg fentanyl administered intrathecally. No local anesthetic was administered through the catheter. The combined spinal-epidural was performed at the L2/L3 or L3/L4 interspace and the intrathecal dose was injected over 5-10 s. A multiple orifice epidural catheter was threaded 5 cm into the epidural space.
Provided delivery had occurred 60 minutes after the intrathecal dose patients received EREM 8 mg (DepoDur™) through the epidural catheter. A 2 mL epidural saline flush was administered before and after drug.</description>
