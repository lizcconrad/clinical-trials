      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as PET scans, may determine the extent of cancer and help
      doctors plan radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor
      cells. Giving radiation therapy that uses a 3-dimensional image of the tumor to help focus
      thin beams of radiation directly on the tumor, and giving radiation therapy in higher doses
      over a shorter period of time, may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects.
      Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor
      may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying PET scans to see how well they work in patients with
      head and neck cancer who are undergoing 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the value of pre-treatment PET in determining the target volume in patients
           with head and neck cancer undergoing three-dimensional conformational radiotherapy and
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate variations in weekly fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET imaging during the first 5
           weeks of treatment.

        -  To determine the relationship between changes in tumor metabolism during radiotherapy
           and control tumor at 3 months and at 1 year post-treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F18 PET (FDG-PET) in addition to conventional imaging at
      baseline. Patients undergo standard three-dimensional conformational radiotherapy and
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

      Some patients also undergo weekly FDG-PET during treatment.
