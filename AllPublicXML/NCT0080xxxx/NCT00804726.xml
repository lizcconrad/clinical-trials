    <textblock>
      The objective of this 12-month clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Akreos MI Five-O intraocular lens (IOL). Effectiveness
      will be shown through the demonstration of accurate distance correction and safety will be
      demonstrated through the monitoring of adverse events.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a clinically documented diagnosis of age-related cataract.

          -  Subjects must have clear intraocular media other than cataract.

          -  Subjects must be undergoing primary in-the-bag intraocular lens implantation for the
             correction of aphakia following continuous curvilinear anterior capsulotomy and
             phacoemulsification cataract extraction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any anterior segment pathology for which extracapsular
             phacoemulsification cataract surgery would be contraindicated.

          -  Subjects with diagnosis of degenerative visual disorder.

          -  Subjects who have any inflammation or edema (swelling) of the cornea.

          -  Subjects with immunodeficiency disorders.

          -  Subjects who have had previous intraocular surgery in the study eye.

          -  Subjects with incomplete/damaged zonule, or with conditions associated with increased
             risk of zonular rupture.

          -  Subjects with chronic use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications.
