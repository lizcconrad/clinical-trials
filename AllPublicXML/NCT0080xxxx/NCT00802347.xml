    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single administration of QPI-1002 (also
      known as I5NP) can prevent DGF in patients undergoing deceased donor kidney transplantation.
      In this Phase I /II study, patients who are undergoing renal transplantation with organs from
      DCD donors, ECD donors or SCD donors with ≥ 24 hours of cold ischemia time who meet study
      entry criteria will be studied to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of I5NP
      (Part A) and clinical activity of I5NP administration (Part B). Data from this study will be
      used to identify doses of I5NP to be used in follow-on efficacy studies.

      Part A will be a randomized, dose escalation study to determine the highest or maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). Part A will enroll 40 patients at approximately 20 sites; patients will
      be randomized to receive either I5NP or placebo in a ratio of 8:2 in each cohort (cohorts
      1-4).

      Part B will utilize the dose identified in Part A to further evaluate, in a double-blind
      manner, the safety, and clinical activity of I5NP. In Part B, up to 326 patients will
      participate at approximately 60 sites; up to 163 patients will be randomized to receive I5NP
      and up to 163 patients randomized to receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the etiology of DGF is not fully understood and may be multifactorial, the
      pathophysiology appears to be primarily related to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury resulting
      from organ preservation between the times of harvesting from the donor and reperfusion
      following vascular reanastomosis in the recipient.

      I5NP is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that is being developed for the prophylaxis of
      delayed graft function (DGF) in patients receiving renal transplants.

             post-menopausal (2) surgically sterile, or (3) using an effective means of
             contraception (per the site-specific guidelines or using 2 methods of birth control
             concurrently, whichever is more stringent) which will be continued until the Study Day
             90 visit with a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to administration of
             study drug. Male patients with female partners of child bearing potential must agree

             requirement for at least 2 dialysis sessions/week during the 56 days prior to
             transplant, or b) the planned removal of any remaining native kidney at the time of
             transplant, or c) the opinion of the investigator that the patient has no remaining
             native renal function (Part A only), or d) the investigator has provided documentation
             to the Medical Monitor that the patient has no remaining native renal function (e.g.,
