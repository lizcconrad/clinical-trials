      The purpose of this study is to determine is Denileukin diftitox will be safe, well tolerated
      and induce a significant overall response alone and in combination with chemotherapy:
      ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) and will be safe and well tolerated in a
      population of children, adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory anaplastic
      large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

    <textblock>
      Despite significant progress in the treatment and outcome for childhood ALCL, the prognosis
      for children who develop progressive or recurrent disease is poor with &lt; 30% DFS. Novel
      therapies are urgently needed for these subgroups of patients. One potential approach is the
      investigation of a new class of receptor targeted cytotoxic fusion proteins (denileukin
      diftitox{DD}). We have previously demonstrated that &gt; 85% of children with ALCL express CD25.
      The human IL-2 receptor exists in three forms, low (CD25), intermediate (CD122/CD132) and
      high (CD25/CD122/CD132) affinity. DD is a recombinant DNA-derived cytotoxic fusion protein
      composed of the amino acid sequences for diphtheria toxin fragments followed by the binding
      sequences for the interleukin-2 receptor. Malignant cells expressing one or more of the
      subunits of the IL-2 receptor are found in certain leukemias and lymphomas including
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Clinical studies have shown therapeutic efficacy of DD
      alone and in combination with CHOP chemotherapy in CD25 expressing malignancies such as CTCL,
      CLL and lymphoma. We hypothesize that DD will be safe and efficacious in children with
      relapsed ALCL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: Patients must be ≥ 2.00 year and ≤ 24.99 years of age at the time of study entry.

          -  Diagnosis:

        Patients must have previous histologic verification of anaplastic large cell lymphoma
        (ALCL). Patients must be in first, second or third relapse or initial induction failure.

        - Disease Status: Patients must have measurable radiographic disease.

        - Performance Level: Karnofsky &gt; 60% for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky &gt; 60 for
        patients &lt;16 years of age. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who
        are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the
        performance score.

        - Prior Therapy

        Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy,
        immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study. Patients who are
        post-allogeneic transplant should be off immunosuppressive agents prior to starting
        therapy. Steroid doses should also be stable or decreasing for at least 1 week prior to
        starting therapy.

        biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after
        administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events
        are known to occur. These patients must be discussed with the Study Chair on a case-by-case
        basis.
