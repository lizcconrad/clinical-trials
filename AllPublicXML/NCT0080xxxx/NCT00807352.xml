      The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity and the reproducibility of the canadian
      triage and acuity scale when applied by regular nurses for the triage of children in the
      Emergency Department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of triage in the Emergency Department (ED) is to assign high priority to patients
      who need urgent care while identifying patients that may be able to wait safely. The Canadian
      Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a triage tool constructed from a consensus of experts that
      is universally used in Canada. Until now, there has been no evaluation of the validity of the
      tool for children in a clinical context. Also, its inter-rater reproducibility has not been
      evaluated. The expected implementation of a revised version of the Canadian triage tool in
      2008 would be an ideal moment to evaluate its validity and reproducibility. Specific
      objective: 1. To evaluate the validity of the CTAS for children visiting a pediatric ED and
      2. To measure the inter-rater agreement for nurses using the CTAS in these settings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Every patient younger than 18 years old that presents to the ED will be eligible
