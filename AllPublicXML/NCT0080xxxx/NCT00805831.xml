    <textblock>
      The HDH device is intended for creating sutureless vascular anastomosis in various blood
      vessels. The HDH device consists of four parts: an elastic tube (graft), docking head
      (anastomotic device), inversion device (connects the vascular graft to HDH) and measuring
      device. This study was design in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using HDH
      device and method an innovative anastomotic device for sutureless aortic anastomosis in
      patient diagnosed with abdominal aneurysm or Aorto-iliac aneurysm.
