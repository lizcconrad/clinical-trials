  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the combined growth
      hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) + Arginine test in healthy volunteers, subjects with highly
      probable adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) and subjects who were probably free of AGHD.

      The randomisation was carried out before the first test was performed. In order to be
      informed of the subject's randomisation group, the investigator phoned the access number
      given to him/her. The subject's allocation to a given randomisation arm was determined on the
      basis of a centralised randomisation (answering service), balanced per group of subjects with
      a minimisation on 2 criteria: age and BMI.

      This was a centralised randomisation using a Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) which
      was balanced in each of the following 3 categories of subjects:

        -  Category A = healthy volunteers,

        -  Category B = subjects with a strong probability of deficit in GH,

        -  Category C = subjects with a low probability of deficit in GH.

      In each of these 3 categories, the subjects underwent 3 tests whose sequences were determined
      by the following randomisation group:

        -  Group 1: GHRH+Arg, GHRH+Arg, ITT or

        -  Group 2: ITT, ITT, GHRH+Arg.

          -  Effective contraception in women of childbearing age: hormonal contraception or use of
             female condom and spermicides or use of diaphragm and spermicides or Intra Uterine
             Device (IUD),

          -  Signed informed consent,

          -  Subjects possessing social security cover.

          -  Subjects having at least one of the following criteria were considered as subjects
             with a high probability of presenting a GH deficit:

               -  Subjects with a tumour of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal region (hypophyseal
                  adenomata, craniopharyngioma, meningioma, etc.) in whom the presence of a
                  hypophyseal insufficiency in GH must be tested preoperatively or postoperatively,
                  or

               -  Subjects presenting a secondary ante-hypophyseal insufficiency to an
                  inflammatory, infectious, post-traumatic pathology or to a hypophyseal necrosis,
