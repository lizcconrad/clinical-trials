      Each winter, viruses belonging to two kinds of influenza A (&quot;A/H1N1&quot; &amp; &quot;A/H3N2&quot;) and two
      kinds of influenza B (&quot;B/Yamagata&quot; &amp; &quot;B/Victoria&quot;) can cause illness. The yearly influenza
      vaccine is designed to protect against both kinds of influenza A but only one or the other
      kind of influenza B. The vaccine is changed from year to year, meaning it may include one
      kind of B virus one year and the other kind another year. But because influenza is so hard to
      predict, sometimes the kind of B virus chosen for the vaccine may not match the kind that is
      causing illness. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that all infants
      and toddlers receive influenza vaccine to protect against their high rates of
      hospitalization. Infants/toddlers receiving influenza vaccine for the first time must get two
      doses (prime plus boost) to have a good antibody response. If they have ever before received
      a single dose of influenza vaccine, then they are recommended to receive only one dose each
      year afterwards. But we don't know how well previous doses of one kind of influenza B set the
      stage for good antibody response to a single dose of the other kind of influenza B. This
      study will try to answer that question in a group of infants/toddlers who last year received
      two doses of one kind of B virus (&quot;Yamagata&quot;), as part of another study. This year, we will
      give them a single dose of influenza vaccine that now contains the other kind of B virus
      (&quot;Victoria&quot;) and see how much antibody they make to both kinds. About half these children
      received a higher amount of influenza vaccine in the previous year's study, so we will also
      compare their antibody levels on that basis. Since influenza B is an illness especially of
      children, understanding how to best protect infants/toddlers against both kinds of influenza
      B is important. This study will help us know if we need to design a new vaccine that not only
      includes both kinds of influenza A, but also both kinds of influenza B.
