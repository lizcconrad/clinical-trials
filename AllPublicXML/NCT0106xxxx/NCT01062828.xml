  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the first description of citrulline as a potential marker for intestinal function in
      1998, its use has been investigated in a variety of disease processes including Short Bowel
      Syndrome, Celiac disease, chemotherapy and radiation induced intestinal injury, infections
      producing intestinal cytopathic effects like Adenovirus, and predicting rejection in
      intestinal transplantation. The use of citrulline levels as a diagnostic tool to predict
      gastrointestinal disease in the premature population has not been properly addressed.

      The introduction of enteral nutrition in the premature infant is a process of trial and
      error, knowing that the immaturity of the gastrointestinal system may lead to frequent
      episodes of feeding intolerance. This is augmented by the fear of the development of
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) once feeds are commenced. NEC is a condition characterized by
      disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, a pathogenic process shared with some of the
      conditions mentioned above for which citrulline has proven clinically useful.

      A normal pattern of citrulline production has not been established in the premature
      population. Previous studies have shown decreased levels of glutamine and arginine in
      premature infants up to 10 days prior to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis.
      Glutamine and arginine are two amino acids closely involved in the synthesis and catabolism
      of citrulline.

      The investigators therefore hypothesize that defining a normal pattern of citrulline
      production in the premature population may prove to be a clinically useful diagnostic tool to
      screen for gastrointestinal disease.
