  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nature of dietary lipids, age and perivisceral adiposity could alter the postprandial
      inflammatory response. It is supposed that there is a relationship between the postprandial
      inflammatory response and the repartition of fat and lean mass, which could partially explain
      the muscle mass loss with age.

      The aim of this study is to compare the inflammatory response of a normal meal or high fat
      meal (from different fatty acids sources) between young lean and young obese and aged lean
      and aged obese men.

      32 healthy volunteers will be separated into four groups: 8 young lean men, 8 young obese
      men, 8 aged lean men and 8 aged obese men. They will come to the center four times after
      inclusion, with 2 to 4 weeks wash out each time. At the first visit they will undergo
      different test to evaluate their body composition, glucose tolerance, resting energy
      expenditure, and muscular strength. At the other three visits, people will undergo a kinetic
      blood sampling, urine and biopsies of adipose tissue over a period of 8h after ingestion of a
      test meal. The different meals tested (Oleic acid vs palmitic acid vs no lipid) will be given
      in a random way over the three visits. Before each of these three visits, a controlled diet
      will be established. At the last visit body composition and muscular strength will be
      evaluated.
