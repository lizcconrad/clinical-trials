  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A low glycemic index diet may improve glycemic control and reduce plaque buildup in arteries
      of those with type 2 diabetes. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive dietary advice
      on either a low glycemic index diet, or a high cereal fibre diet, for three years.

      All subjects will be randomized to one 3-year treatment in a two-treatment parallel design.

      Treatments:

        1. low glycemic index dietary advice (e.g. to eat intact grain cereals, parboiled rice,
           cracked wheat, pasta, peas, beans, lentils, and baked goods made from legume flour); or

        2. a high cereal fiber diet emphasizing whole grains. Duration: The study will consist of
           approximately two months of recruitment and patient selection, during which time
           estimation of individual caloric requirements will be assessed, and a 3 year treatment
           period assigned.

      Study Details: Fasting blood samples are obtained at screening, week -2, and months 0, 3, 6,
      9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36 each study period. HbA1c will be assessed on all
      visits. A carotid ultrasound (CUS) (screening, months 0, 12 and 36) and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) (months 0, 12 and 36) technologies will be used to assess arterial wall
      thickening and changes in the nature of carotid plaques. Twenty-four hour urine for urinary
      C-peptide analyses will be obtained immediately prior to the beginning of the study and at
      the end of each 3 year treatment phase. At the end of the 3 year treatment period, subjects
      who wish to undertake the alternate treatment will be given appropriate instruction.
