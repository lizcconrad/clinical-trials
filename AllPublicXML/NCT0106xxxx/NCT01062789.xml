  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective or our study is to test the feasibility of a new optical-based breath-hold
      control (OBC) system for monitoring breath-hold levels and providing patient feedback during
      CT-guided biopsies of the lung and upper abdomen where respiratory motion is a problem.

      1. Specific Aim #1: To further test the feasibility of the new OBC system for guiding
           accurate and reproducible breath-hold levels that correlate with internal target
           position in human volunteers. Hypothesis: The OBC system is as good as or better than
           the currently used IBC system with regard to accuracy and reproducibility of a reference
           breath-hold level.

        2. Specific Aim #2: To compare the use of 2 optical-based belts (wrapped around the chest
           and abdomen) versus 1 optical-based belt (wrapped around the chest or abdomen, depending
           on which region expands the most during respiration) with regard to accuracy and
           reproducibility of a pre-determined reference breath-hold level in a subset of patients
           (prone and/or obese). Hypothesis: The use of 2 optical-based belts allows increased
           accuracy and reproducibility of a pre-determined reference breath-hold level compared
           with the use of only one belt in this subset of patients.

        3. Specific Aim #3: To test the clinical feasibility of the new OBC system in patients
           undergoing CT-guided biopsy of the lung or upper abdomen where respiratory motion is a
           problem. Hypothesis: The OBC system is as good as or better than the currently used IBC
           system with regard to the accuracy and reproducibility of the reference breath-hold and
           ease of use.

    <description>This is a feasibility study that will use this new device in place of a different bellows-based breath-hold control device for a series patients undergoing CT-guided lung biopsy. The new belt will be used in all patients in our study.</description>

    <intervention_name>Optical breath-hold control system (OBC)</intervention_name>
    <description>The OBC system was designed to replace the IBC rubber bellows respiration sensor system that we are currently using for CT-guided lung biopsies. Unlike the IBC, the OBC is 1) unaffected by temperature changes, 2) has a linear sensitivity (for easier use and better accuracy), 3) has no pneumatic purge time when setting reference breath-hold level (reducing the chance of an inappropriate reference), 4) has no pneumatic cable that can occasionally interfere and get pinched during procedures, 5) is ambulatory (so patients can more easily familiarize themselves with the device before the procedure), 6) is capable of indicating proper fitting tension, 7) allows for easier binding (wireless pairing with other system components), and 8) is significantly less expensive (and possibly disposable).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients scheduled for a CT-guided lung or upper abdomen biopsy (including lesions in
             the liver, pancreas, stomach, kidneys, adrenals, spleen, or in the peritoneum at or
             above the level of the kidneys) on the SMH-CT-3M scanner when either Dr. Carlson or
             Dr. Bender are scheduled.

          -  Lesions will need to measure 3 cm or less in maximum dimension and cannot be affixed
             to the chest or abdominal wall.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to cooperate with breath-holding (including cognitive impairment, poor
             pulmonary function that inhibits patients from being able to hold their breath for at
             least 10 seconds)

          -  Patients with bleeding diatheses (platelets &lt; 50,000, International Normalized Ratio &gt;
             1.5, or activated partial thromboplastin time &gt; twice normal)

          -  Lesions that abut the pleura or abdominal wall for a distance greater than 3 cm (these
             lesions were assumed to be fixed in position and less likely to be affected by
             respiratory motion).

          -  Patients with implanted medical devices (pacemakers) (this exclusion is based on the
             Division of Engineering Safety Reviewâ€”enclosed in application)
