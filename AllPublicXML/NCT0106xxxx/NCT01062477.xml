      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of ACTACEL combined
      vaccine in support of registration of this product in China

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that ACTACEL vaccine administered at 2, 3 and 4 months of age or at 3, 4
           and 5 months of age is not inferior, in terms of seroprotection, to Wuhan's Diphtheria,
           Tetanus, acellular Pertussis (DTaP) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Act-HIB) vaccine
           given concomitantly, for diphtheria, tetanus, and Polyribosyl Ribitol Phosphate (PRP)
           antigens, one month after the three-dose primary vaccination.

        -  To demonstrate the superiority, in terms of seroconversion, of ACTACEL vaccine
           administered at 2, 3 and 4 months of age or at 3, 4 and 5 months of age for Pertussis
           Toxoid (PT), Fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM2) and (FIM3) pertussis antigens, compared with
           Wuhan's DTaP and Act-HIB vaccines given concomitantly, one month after the three-dose
           primary vaccination.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety after administration of the study vaccines.

        -  To describe in each group the immunogenicity of the study vaccines one month after the
           primary vaccination and before and one month after the booster vaccination.

      Participants will receive a primary vaccination consisting of three doses of ACTACEL at
      either 2, 3, and 4 months of age or at 3, 4, and 5 months of age; or Wuhan DTaP and Act-HIB
      vaccines at 3, 4, and 5 months of age. All participants will receive a single booster dose at
      18-20 months of age and will be followed up for one month after the last dose of study
      vaccine.
