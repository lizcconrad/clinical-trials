  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect a blood sample from patients with Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia (CLL) and from volunteers without CLL.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The blood sample will be used in the laboratory to perform focused studies on Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing routine blood draws as part of their ongoing follow-up care for
             CLL at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center of DHMC.

          -  Normal donors who have no history of active or prior hematologic malignancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received cytotoxic drug, oral or intravenous steroid or targeted
             antibody therapy for their CLL, other hematologic malignancy or other disease process
             within the past 2 months are excluded. Use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is not
             a reason for exclusion.

          -  Normal donors who have a history of steroid use, immunosuppression therapy or
             autoimmune disease are excluded.
