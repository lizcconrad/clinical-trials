  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of repeated Mesenchymal Stromal
      Cells (MSC) infusions to patients with Type II or III osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).

      Participants will receive MSC infusions approximately every 4 months to complete a total of 6
      infusions over 20 months. Participants will be followed for 4 months post their last MSC
      infusion.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated MSC infusions to
      subjects with OI. This study will evaluate subjects on two separate strata. Stratum A will
      include subjects with a diagnosis of Type II or Type III osteogenesis imperfecta who have
      previously undergone a bone marrow transplant. Stratum A may use previously harvested and
      cryopreserved bone marrow mononuclear cells from original BMT donor or freshly harvested or
      cryopreserved bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained from a haploidentical healthy parent or
      sibling. Stratum B will include subjects with Type II or III osteogenesis imperfecta who have
      not undergone a bone marrow transplant. Stratum B will only receive freshly harvested or
      cryopreserved bone marrow mononuclear cells from a haploidentical healthy parent or sibling.

      Participants will receive MSC infusions approximately every 4 months to complete a total of 6
      infusions over 20 months. Participants will be followed for 12 months post their last MSC
      infusion.
