    <textblock>
      Pacemaker technology is constantly evolving. In the past 10 years, numerous advancements have
      been made in pacemaker therapy, diagnostics and connectivity. These advancements include
      automated capture, automated sensing, patient alert functions, algorithms minimizing
      ventricular pacing, automatic mode switching in response to atrial tachyarrhythmia, rate
      responsive pacing, advanced diagnostic features, remote monitoring and radiofrequency (RF)
      technology. However, little information is available on how these new features are being
      utilized by physicians in the real world and how these features impact patient outcomes.

      This observational study will gather data on the patients' presenting clinical status,
      indication for device implantation, utilization of advanced device features, device therapy
      choices, clinical management and outcomes in a general pacemaker population.

      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the usage of advanced features and diagnostics in
      patients with St. Jude Medical pacemakers. The secondary aim of the study is to learn more
      about the progressive clinical outcomes in the general pacemaker patient population. The
      tertiary aim of the study is to evaluate the correlation between the usage of advanced
      features in pacemaker patients and the patient's clinical outcomes.

           and newer advanced features)

        -  Device and lead measurements

           heart failure (HF), incidence and onset of angina, occurrence of myocardial infarction
           (MI), occurrence of transient ischemic attack (TIA)/ischemic stroke, and occurrence of
           hemorrhagic stroke

        -  Modified Specific Activity Scale (SAS)

        -  Intrinsic QRS duration

        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
