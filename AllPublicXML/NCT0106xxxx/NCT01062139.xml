      Title of Study:

      A randomized, parallel, double-blind, multi-center, comparative study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Cosalin monotherapy versus Cosalin and Xarlin combination therapy in
      patients with allergic rhinitis

      Objective of study:

      To exploratively evaluate superiority of combination therapy - twice-daily Cosalin Tab
      (Petasites hybridus CO2 extract) with once-daily Xarlin Tab (Levocetirizine HCl) - compared
      to monotherapy of Cosalin with allergic rhinitis subjects.

      Number of Subjects:

      Total 100 subjects / Each group 50 subjects (combination therapy group, monotherapy group /
      include 20% of subjects drop out rate)

      Test Products:

      Cosarlin (Petasites hybridus CO2 extract) 30 mg tablet Xarlin (Levocetirizine HCl) 5 mg
      tablet

      Study Design:

      Development Phase: Phase IV Randomized, double blind, active-controlled, multi-center study

      The subject, who is to satisfy inclusion criteria and not to satisfy any of exclusion
      criteria will be allocated 1:1 to combination therapy group or mono therapy group,
      randomized.

      Written informed consent will be obtained from the subjects prior to study entry.

      Dose, Mode of administration:

      Monotherapy group - Cosalin 30mg tablet two times daily. Combination therapy group - Cosalin
      30mg tablet two times daily and Xarlin 5mg tablet once daily.

      Duration of Tx:

      2 Weeks

      Safety Endpoint:

      Physical Exam, Adverse Events, Vital Signs at Visit 2 and 3.
