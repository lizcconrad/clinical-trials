  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is performed in many high volume centers with a very low
      mortality. Reduced mortality rate is largely the result of careful patient selection,
      improved intraoperative management and a better postoperative care. Unfortunately, there is
      not a similar reduction in morbidity rates which remains about 40%. Persistent morbidity is
      predominantly due to pancreatic fistula (PF). Abdominal abscess and hemorrhage are common
      sequelae of PF which have been associated with a high mortality rate. While many different
      risk factors have been reported, a soft pancreatic texture and a nondilated pancreatic duct
      have been most consistently linked to high rates of PF. A number of methods for reducing the
      incidence of PF have been proposed and analysed. Many of these involve technical features of
      the anastomosis, including site of reconstruction, anastomotic technique, use of biologic
      glue, and prophylactic use of somatostatin analogue. The placement of a stent through the
      pancreatic anastomosis is an attractive strategy to reduce the PF rate. This multicenter
      prospective randomized trial was designed to compare the outcome after PD with external
      drainage stent versus no stent in patients with high risk of PF (with soft pancreas and a
      diameter of wirsung &lt;3mm).

      Analysis:The primary objective of the study was to compare the incidence PF in patients with
      or without external pancreatic stent. With an anticipated PF rate of 30%, based on literature
      experience, it was calculated that a reduction to 10% of PF rate would require the inclusion
      of 75 patients in each group (statistical significance P &lt; 0.05 and power 80 per cent with a
      two-tailed test of proportions). We'll enroll 158 patients to take into account the
      possibility of 5% being lost to follow-up.

      PF was defined, according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula, as amylase
      rich fluid (amylase concentration more than three times serum concentration) collected from
      the drainage placed intraoperatively from day 3 or by needle aspiration of an intraabdominal
      collection. PF were graded according to the clinical impact on the patient's hospital course
      (grades A,B,C).
