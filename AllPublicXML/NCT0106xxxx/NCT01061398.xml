  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with chest pain or shortness of breath who are referred for stress imaging tests
      (either stress echocardiography or stress nuclear testing), the investigators seek to compare
      impact of using cardiac CT scans of the heart arteries to the stress test that their doctors
      ordered.

    <textblock>
      The current evaluation for chest pain in low and intermediate risk patients typically starts
      with a functional assessment for coronary ischemia. Exercise treadmill testing is often
      selected as the initial diagnostic modality for coronary artery function. However, exercise
      treadmill testing is limited by its modest sensitivity and specificity, often resulting in
      further cardiac resource utilization for patient risk stratification and reassurance.
      Additionally, many patients with chest pain are not candidates for regular stress testing due
      to an abnormal baseline electrocardiogram or inability to exercise. Therefore, exercise or
      pharmacologic stress imaging is considered the standard of care for the evaluation of
      coronary artery function in a large percentage of patients with chest pain. However, each of
      the currently available stress imaging tests has well-documented limitations, resulting in a
      sizeable number of false negative and false positive studies. With the advent of coronary
      Multislice Computed Tomography (MSCT) angiography, coronary artery anatomy can now be
      accurately evaluated noninvasively. Despite its impressive performance characteristics, the
      role of coronary MSCT angiography in the evaluation of angina remains undefined. Furthermore,
      studies comparing MSCT to stress imaging are lacking. CT-FIRST compares the impact on
      downstream resource utilization and patient outcomes of an initial diagnostic strategy
      employing the addition of coronary MSCT angiography to stress imaging (exercise and
      pharmacologic stress echo and nuclear perfusion testing) with a standard-of-care diagnostic
      strategy of stress imaging for the evaluation of low-intermediate risk patients with possible
      angina. The study is a single center, prospective, non-blinded, randomized clinical trial.
