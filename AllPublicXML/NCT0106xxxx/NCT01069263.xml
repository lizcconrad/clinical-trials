    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to
      intravesical Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) instillation for the treatment of patients who suffers
      from Interstitial Cystitis / Painful bladder syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) presents as a pelvic pain condition
      associated with urinary urgency and frequency. These symptoms impair significantly the
      patient's quality of life. The etiology is yet not obvious. The current acceptable theory is
      injury or dysfunction of the Mucus (Glycosaminoglycans) layer that covers the inner surface
      of the urinary bladder. Abnormal diffusion of toxins from the urine to the walls of the
      bladder leads to inflammation, pain and scarring.

      Many types of treatments were described but most of them were not evaluated in well designed
      randomized controlled studies. For now, there is no one single treatment that gives good
      outcome to every patient. Therefore, the treatment of patients with IC/PBS is challenging. In
      this study, we will compare the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to intravesical
      dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) instillation for the treatment of patients who suffers from IC/PBS.

      Patients with IC (NIDDK criteria) will be randomized to have either DMSO instillation or
      HBOT.

      Before and after treatments the patients will fill out questionnaires (O'Leary-Sant
      Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index), visual analogue scale for pain and bladder
      diaries. In addition, urodynamics will be performed before and after treatments. In case of
      incomplete symptoms remission, patients will be crossed over to have the other treatment.
