      The dopamine agonist cabergoline inhibits phosphorylation of the vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor-2(VEGFR-2), which prevent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      overexpression and reduce the severity of Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. However, VEGF
      plays an important role in the growth and maintenance of ovarian follicle and developing
      embryo by mediating angiogenesis.This study was designed to analyze whether the timing
      cabergoline administration on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection or
      after oocytes retrieved affects the oocyte maturation and outcome of assisted reproduction
      treatment.

      BACKGROUND:Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the most serious complication of
      ovulation induction. It results from increased vascular permeability caused by ovarian
      hypersecretion of VEGF), which activates its receptor-2. The dopamine agonist cabergoline
      inhibits phosphorylation of the receptor VEGFR-2, which prevent VEGF overexpression and
      reduce the severity of OHSS. However, VEGF plays an important role in the growth and
      maintenance of ovarian follicle and developing embryo by mediating angiogenesis. In human,
      cabergoline averts OHSS, but a possible detrimental effect on oocyte maturation has not been
      explored. This study was designed to analyze whether the timing cabergoline administration on
      the day of hCG injection or after oocytes retrieved affects the oocyte maturation and outcome
      of assisted reproduction treatment.

      PURPOSE: To assess whether the timing cabergoline administration affects metaphase II oocytes
      numbers, embryo quality, pregnancy outcome and the incidence of OHSS.

      METHODS: A prospective randomized study was designed to evaluate the possible of cabergoline
      affect on oocyte maturation. Women (n=120) under controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with the
      risk of OHSS (Estradiol(E2)&gt;4000 pg/ml, or &gt;18 follicle, &gt;11 mm development) randomized into
      two groups. Group I (n=60) received 0.5 mg oral cabergoline per day for 8 days on the day of
      hCG. Group II (n=60) received 0.5 mg oral cabergoline per day for 8 days on the day after
      oocyte retrieval immediately.

      ANTICIPATED RESULTS: No significant differences were seen in the number of metaphase II
      oocytes, the embryo quality, the pregnancy rate and the incidence of OHSS.
