  <brief_title>Immunogenicity, Safety &amp; Reactogenicity of GSK Vaccine Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib2.5 Compared to GSK Vaccine Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase II, Double-blind, Randomized Study to Compare the Immunogenicity, Safety and Reactogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib2.5 to GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ When Administered as a Three-dose Primary Vaccination Course to Healthy Infants at 6, 10 and 14 Weeks of Age. A Dose of Unconjugated Hib Vaccine (Plain PRP Booster) Will be Administered at the Age of 10 Months to 50% of the Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to reduce the amount of thiomersal in its vaccines, GSK Biologicals has developed a
      DTPw-HBV vaccine with low thiomersal content (Tritanrix™- HepB low thio). This vaccine is to
      be used in combination with a Hib low dose vaccine containing 2.5µg of PRP antigen (Hib 2.5).
      The purpose of this study is to generate clinical data with Tritanrix™-HepB low thio vaccine
      when extemporaneously mixed with Hib 2.5 vaccine. The control group will receive
      Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™.

      Subjects received primary vaccination in study 208108/091 (double blind). Of these subjects
      50% were randomised to participate in the PRP challenge study (208108/092) (open), and all
      subjects will be invited to participate in a booster study DTPWHBV=HIB2.5-093 (101477).
