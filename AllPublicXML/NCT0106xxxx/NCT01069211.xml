      This study aimed at evaluating following:

        1. Validity Assessment:

             1. Primary End Point: To evaluate 5-year diseae free survival rate after Letrozole
                treatment according to the estrogen receptor expression in postmenopausal women

             2. Secondary End Point: To evaluate overall survival rate(OS) and Time to distance
                recurrence(TTDR) after Hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone
                receptor positive breast cancer

        2. Safety Assessment: To evaluate all adverse events including serious adverse events after
           Letrozole treatment.
