      A dose escalating phase Ia-b clinical trial of the IGF-1 receptor inhibitor AXL1717 in
      patients with advanced cancer.

      The objective is to study the safety and pharmacokinetics of AXL1717 and to define an
      appropriate Phase 2 dose for further studies. This is the first study in man. The study is
      not designed to show tumor response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age.

               -  P-Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 times the upper institutional limit of the &quot;normal&quot;
                  (i.e. reference) range

               -  P-ASAT or P-ALAT ≤ 2.5 times upper institutional limit of the &quot;normal&quot; range, ≤5

          6. Signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Known malignancy in CNS

          3. Prior anti-tumour therapy within 4 weeks from enrolment (6 weeks for nitrosurea and

             hypersensitivity.

          9. Lack of suitability for participation in the trial, for any reason, as judged by the
             Investigator.
