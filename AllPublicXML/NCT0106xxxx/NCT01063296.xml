  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is a major health problem for Chinese women. It is estimated that nearly
      100,000 new cervical cancer cases occur in China every year, which accounts for about 20
      percent of global new cases. Surgery and radiotherapy are two major radical treatment methods
      for IB-IIB cervical cancer. Unlike the United States and some other countries, most of
      operable women with IB-IIB cervical cancer received radical surgery other than radiotherapy
      in China. Patients with recurrence risk factors (lymph node metastasis, deep stromal
      invasion, positive lymphatic vascular space, et al. ) also received adjuvant therapy after
      surgery, such as radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy that are recommended in the NCCN
      guidelines. However, in China a substantial part of patients especially those admitted to
      tertiary hospitals received several courses of chemotherapy instead of radiotherapy if they
      had recurrence risk factors .

      In our previous study, we found that patients with intermediate risk factors (deep stromal
      invasion, positive lymphatic vascular space, bulky tumor&gt;4cm) had better disease-free
      survival and recurrence-free survival when they received chemotherapy compared with
      radiotherapy. The objective in this study is to investigate whether the advantage of
      postoperative chemotherapy is a result of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in some of the
      patients with intermediate risk factors.
