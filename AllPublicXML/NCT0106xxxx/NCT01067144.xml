      The goal of this study is to determine whether administering Gabapentin prior to surgery
      affects duration of pain and opioid use post-surgery. The investigators aim to compare
      gabapentin to placebo in a prospective, randomized clinical trial in which patients will be
      followed post-surgery until pain resolves and opioid use ceases.

    <textblock>
      Gabapentin was originally developed as an anti-convulsant, but was quickly recognized as a
      medication with significant analgesic activity in patients with neuropathic pain. More
      recently it has begun to be appreciated that it may have some benefits in the peri-operative
      period. Pre-operative Gabapentin reduces preoperative anxiety, early post-operative pain
      severity, post-operative opioid use and post-operative delirium (presumably through reduced
      opioid consumption). These same attributes are shared by medications such as NSAIDS and
      tylenol and the use of peri-operative gabapentin has not permeated the standard of care.
      Early post-operative pain severity and preoperative anxiety have been implicated in our own
      research as risk factors for prolonged time to pain resolution and prolonged time to opioid
      cessation. Since these endpoints are generally synonymous with time to recovery,
      interventions reducing these times would be seen not just to increase comfort but to actually
      speed recovery.
