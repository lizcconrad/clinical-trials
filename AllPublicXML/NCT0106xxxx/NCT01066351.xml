      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of erythropoietin for prevention
      acute kidney injury in CKD patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI)occur 7.7-42% after cardiac surgery. The incidence of AKI requiring
      renal replacement therapy following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery was
      0.7-3.5% and increase mortality rate. Erythropoietin (EPO) is now considered a novel
      anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory action. The present study was designed to evaluate the
      administration of EPO as a means of preventing AKI in these patients.
