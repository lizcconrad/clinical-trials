  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to compare the hemodynamic changes that occur during induction with a
      novel drug combination known as ketofol (propofol and ketamine admixture with that of
      propofol alone (prototypic anesthesia induction agent). Propofol and ketamine are widely used
      as induction agents and their effects on patient hemodynamics are well known. Some of these
      drug-induced hemodynamic changes are undesirable and lead to deleterious effects on patient
      hemodynamics. We seek to investigate the hemodynamic changes associated with a novel drug
      combination known as ketofol (ketamine/propofol admixture) during induction and compare them
      to propofol. If we determine that the changes produced by ketofol are favorable compared with
      propofol, we then will seek to test its use in the trauma setting in a subsequent randomized
      controlled trial.

      This is a pilot study to compare the hemodynamic changes that occur during induction with a
      novel drug combination known as ketofol with that of propofol. Propofol and ketamine are
      widely used as induction agents and their effects on patient hemodynamics are well known.
      Many of these drug-induced changes are undesirable and when used alone sometimes lead to
      hemodynamic effects on opposite ends of the spectrum, ie. hypotension (propofol) and
      hypertension (ketamine). We will investigate the hemodynamic changes associated with this
      drug combination referred to as &quot;ketofol&quot; (ketamine/propofol admixture) during induction
      compared with propofol as the gold standard induction agent used widely in anesthetic
      practice. If we validate that the changes produced by the ketofol admixture are favorable, we
      will then test its use in a wider setting of patient populations including emergency
      department intubations and the trauma setting.

      Background: Propofol is a non-opioid, non-barbiturate, sedative-hypnotic agent with rapid
      onset and short duration of action. It possesses many favorable effects such as an antiemetic
      effect and reliably produces sedation and amnesia (Felfernig Jour of Royal Naval Medical
      Service, '06; White International Anesth Clinics, '88; Willman Ann of Emer Med, '07).
      However, there are several undesirable side effects such as cardiovascular and respiratory
      depression. In addition, Propofol as a sole agent has no analgesic properties. These
      drug-induced side effects have led to alternative drugs being used with the hopes of a more
      favorable side effect profile. Ketamine is an example of one such drug. Ketamine is a
      phencyclidine derivative commonly classified as a dissociative sedative with fairly rapid
      onset and short duration of action (Felfernig Jour of Royal Naval Medical Service, '06; White
      International Anesth Clinics, '88; Willman Ann of Emer Med, '07). It causes little or no
      respiratory and cardiovascular depression and unlike propofol, has pain relieving properties.
      Ketamine as a single induction agent, however, is limited by emergence phenomena including
      postoperative dreaming and hallucinations, however these are attenuated by the administration
      of benzodiazepines. Also ketamine in induction doses 1-4.5 mg/kg can have some undesirable
      effects on hemodynamics (opposite of propofol) in certain patient populations including
      ischemic heart disease (IHD), and patients with increases in intracranial hypertension and
      intracranial pressure (ICP). Effectiveness of the two agents in combination has been recently
      demonstrated and this new combination could allow a novel induction agent with favorable
      effects on hemodynamics (Felfernig Jour of Royal Naval Medical Service, '06; Hui Jour of Amer
      Soc of Anesth, '95; Willman Ann of Emer Med, '07). To date, this combination known as ketofol
      has been used most extensively for procedural sedation in the Emergency Department but has
      not yet been standardized as an induction agent. We are obtaining funding for a pilot study
      to validate the use of ketofol as an induction agent.

    <measure>Percent of Subjects With a Greater Than 20% Decrease in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Following Induction of General Anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes post induction</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure was recorded every minute for a total of 30 minutes after anesthesia was induced and readings were captured via a Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor [NICOM], Cheetah Medical, Israel. The percentage of subjects experiencing decreases in SBP of greater than 20% during the specified time intervals is reported, as compared to the baseline systolic blood pressure reading. There are two numbers in a blood pressure reading, and they are expressed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). This tells how high in millimeters the pressure of your blood raises a column of mercury. The numbers usually are expressed in the form of a fraction; an example of a blood pressure reading is 120/80 mm Hg. The first, or top, number (120 in the example) is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the measure of your blood pressure as the heart contracts and pumps blood.</description>

          <description>As part of the induction, patients will be given 20 mL syringe of an admixture called &quot;ketofol,&quot; which combines ketamine and propofol in one syringe. The dose is weight-based such that ketamine will represent 0.75 mg/kg of the dose and propofol, 1.5 mg/kg of the dose. One subject in the ketofol group was excluded from analysis due to incorrect study drug assignment and outside the protocol-specified dose.</description>

        <title>Percent of Subjects With a Greater Than 20% Decrease in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Following Induction of General Anesthesia</title>
        <description>Blood pressure was recorded every minute for a total of 30 minutes after anesthesia was induced and readings were captured via a Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor [NICOM], Cheetah Medical, Israel. The percentage of subjects experiencing decreases in SBP of greater than 20% during the specified time intervals is reported, as compared to the baseline systolic blood pressure reading. There are two numbers in a blood pressure reading, and they are expressed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). This tells how high in millimeters the pressure of your blood raises a column of mercury. The numbers usually are expressed in the form of a fraction; an example of a blood pressure reading is 120/80 mm Hg. The first, or top, number (120 in the example) is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the measure of your blood pressure as the heart contracts and pumps blood.</description>

        <description>SVV was recorded every minute for a total of 30 minutes after anesthesia was induced and results were captured via a Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor [NICOM], Cheetah Medical, Israel. SVV is a dynamic flow-based parameter and together with cardiac output provides an indication of fluid responsiveness. The average change in SVV (as compared to baseline SVV) during the specified time intervals is reported. SVV is calculated by taking the SVmax – SVmin /*100/ SV mean.</description>

          <title>Average Change in Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)</title>
          <description>SVV was recorded every minute for a total of 30 minutes after anesthesia was induced and results were captured via a Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor [NICOM], Cheetah Medical, Israel. SVV is a dynamic flow-based parameter and together with cardiac output provides an indication of fluid responsiveness. The average change in SVV (as compared to baseline SVV) during the specified time intervals is reported. SVV is calculated by taking the SVmax – SVmin /*100/ SV mean.</description>
          <population>The analysis population of 38/35 (vs. 43/41 at baseline) is due to the NICOM not functioning properly during certain aspects of the procedure and therefore, did not provide a number.</population>
