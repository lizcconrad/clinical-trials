  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to combustion-derived fine particulate air pollution is associated with
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In previous studies, exposure to diesel exhaust (a
      major constituent of urban particulate air pollution) has been shown to impair two important
      functions of the vascular endothelium: vascular vasomotor function and endogenous
      fibrinolysis. Our subsequent studies suggest this impairment of vascular function is mediated
      by a reduction in nitric oxide bioavailability. In this study we aim to investigate the
      cardiovascular responses to systemic nitric oxide synthase inhibition following exposure to
      dilute diesel exhaust.

    <description>Intravenous infusion of 3mg/kg L-NMMA (L-NG-monomethyl arginine; NO synthase inhibitor) and nor-epinephrine at 50 ng/kg/min. Each infusion to run over 15 mins and separated by 45 min to allow return to baseline. Drugs infused in a randomised order. During the study, blood pressure will be measured invasively using an intra-arterial radial artery cannula, central arterial stiffness measured using peripheral arterial tonometry and cardiac output using thoracic bioimpedance.</description>
