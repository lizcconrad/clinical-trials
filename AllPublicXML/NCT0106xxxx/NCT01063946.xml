    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the excretion balance and systemic exposure of radioactivity after
           intravenous infusion of [14C]-AVE8062 to humans

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of AVE8062 and RPR258063 and their contribution to
           overall exposure

        -  To collect samples to determine the metabolic pathways of AVE8062 and identify the
           chemical structures of the main metabolites

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To assess the safety profile of the drug

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of the study for each patient will include approximately 4 weeks of a screening
      phase prior to first infusion of study drug, 21-day study treatment cycles and end of
      treatment visit. The patient can continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or the patient's refusal of further treatment.
