    <textblock>
      Ertapenem is an antibiotic that is highly bound to plasma protein (&gt; 95%). The effects of
      this high protein binding on tissue distribution of antibiotics have been few evaluated yet.

      In this study, two groups of subjects will be compared: 6 healthy volunteers and 6 critically
      ill patients (patients with infection due to an Ertapenem susceptible bacteria). Indeed,
      these 2 populations show changes in binding capacity of drugs to plasma proteins due to a
      decrease of protidaemia and of the affinity of drugs to transport proteins.

      It seems therefore important to clarify the consequences of a modification in protein binding
      on distribution of antibiotics. That's why we have decided to characterize tissue
      distribution of ertapenem in healthy volunteers and critically ill patients by assessing:
      free and total concentrations in plasma and free concentrations in muscle by microdialysis.
