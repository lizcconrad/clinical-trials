  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the nature of their work duties and work environment, physicians often experience
      stress within the workplace and chronic stress negatively impacts physician wellness.
      Physician wellness is now linked to quality of patient care. The stress response can be
      broken down into four components: the stressor, the reaction, the physiological response and
      the experience of the physiological response. Stress can also be absolute (e.g. threat to
      life) and relative (e.g. I have 3 more consults to see). Stress management refers to a range
      of processes that are intended to mitigate one or more aspects of the psychobiology of
      stress. Biofeedback is a useful way of providing guidance and reinforcement for successful
      management of the physiological response to stress. It is important to provide physicians
      with effective tools for stress management. The objective of this study is to compare
      measures of stress and well-being among physicians allocated to learn a relaxation breathing
      technique and to use a biofeedback tool (referred to as a portable stress management device
      or PSMD) for 28 days (intervention group) and those allocated to standard care for 28 days
      (control group).

      After completion of the 28 day RCT with a control group and an intervention group, we
      conducted a trial extension for an additional 28 days. During that time, the original control
      group was trained in the use of the portable stress management device and used it, without
      support of the research team, for 28 days. Also during that time, the original intervention
      group were told that they could keep the PSMD and use it as they like. At the end of the 28
      day trial extension, stress, and physiological parameters were measured again. For the
      initial control group, this allowed us to test effectiveness of the PSMD (real life 1 hr
      training on the device then unsupported use). For the initial intervention group, this
      allowed us to see if any effects of using the PSMD were maintained for an additional 28 days,
      without ongoing support from the research team.

    <description>This group of physicians were trained in the use of the relaxation breathing technique and the biofeedback device, and then used this portable stress reduction tool on a daily basis with twice weekly visits with the research team. After the 28 day RCT, they were invited to continue to use the device at their discretion during a trial extension from day 28-56 to see if any effect measured was maintained.</description>

    <description>This group did not undergo training in the breathing technique and use of the PSMD during the RTC trial day 0-28, but were visited twice weekly by the research team to collect outcome data. During the trial extension Day 28-56, this group did undergo a 1 hr training session with the PSMD and invited to use it at their discretion over the 28 days. Effectiveness outcome data (day 28-56) was collected at day 56.</description>
