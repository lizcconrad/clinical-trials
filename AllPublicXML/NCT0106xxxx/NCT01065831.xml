      This study will test the effectiveness of a church-based lifestyle intervention in improving
      blood pressure control among 400 hypertensive blacks in a group randomized controlled trial.
      The lifestyle intervention will be delivered by trained lay health advisers through
      group-based behavioral counseling and motivational interviewing (MINT-TLC) in 24
      predominantly black churches in New York City.

    <description>This MINT-TLC group will be asked to attend 12 weekly counseling meetings focused on weight loss (if overweight), limiting sodium, regular physical activity, and eating a low-fat diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables. MINT-TLC will be conducted by trained Lay Health Advisors. Participants will attend weekly group classes targeted at lifestyle changes for the first 12 weeks (intensive phase); followed by three individual MINT sessions conducted monthly for the following three months (maintenance phase). The MINT-TLC sessions aim to help participants make useful therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) and develop skills to maintain these changes long-term.</description>

    <description>The MINT-TLC lifestyle intervention lead by lay health advisers will be compared to the health education attention control condition (CC). Twenty churches will participate in the study and each church will be randomly assigned to receive either MINT-TLC or CC. They will be compared on blood pressure reduction, physical activity levels, intake of fruits and vegetables, and weight reduction.</description>
