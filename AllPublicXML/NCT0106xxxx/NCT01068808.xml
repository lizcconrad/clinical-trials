      Rhinitis is a common condition associated with significant effects on quality of life.
      Rhinitis may be divided into two groups, those with concurrent allergy (allergic rhinitis,
      AR) and those without allergy but who still suffer from nasal symptoms (nonallergic rhinitis,
      NAR).

      Evidence indicated that adult with NAR can have de novo sensitization to aeroallergen (24%),
      suggesting that patients with NAR might evolve to AR. Thus the purpose of this study is to
      evaluate development of allergic rhinitis in children with nonallergic rhinitis.
