    <textblock>
      The primary focus of the study is the evaluation of the safety of treatment with moxifloxacin
      in a pediatric population 3 months to &lt;18 years old. Approximately 450 pediatric subjects
      with a complicated intra-abdominal infection will be enrolled in the study and treated with
      either moxifloxacin intravenously and orally if switched to oral therapy or ertapenem
      (intravenously) and, if switched to oral therapy, amoxicillin/clavulanate.

        <description>Clinical responses were graded as clinical cure, failure or indeterminate. 'Clinical cure' defined as a resolution or sufficient improvement of clinical signs and symptoms related to the infection; 'failure' defined as a reappearance of the signs and symptoms of the original infection, or wound infection requiring further systemic antimicrobial therapy; 'indeterminate' defined as those subjects in whom a clinical assessment was not possible to determine (due to early withdrawal from the study because of adverse events, protocol violation, withdrawn consent). Percentage of subjects with clinical response at TOC were reported.</description>

        <description>Clinical responses at EOT were graded as resolution, failure, or indeterminate. 'Resolution' defined as a disappearance of signs and symptoms related to the infection or sufficient improvement of clinical signs and symptoms related to the infection and the subject does not require any further antibiotic therapy or surgical intervention; 'failure' defined as worsening or insufficient lessening of the signs and symptoms of infection requiring a modification or addition of antibacterial therapy; 'indeterminate' is defined as those subjects in whom a clinical assessment is not possible to determine (eg, due to early withdrawal from the study because of adverse events, protocol violation, withdrawn consent; receipt of less than 3 full days of study drug; receipt of an effective concomitant antibacterial for an indication other than study indication; etc).

'presumed persistence' was applicable for subjects judged to be clinical failures and appropriate culture material is not available for evaluation; 'presumed eradication' defined as the absence of appropriate culture material for evaluation because the subject has clinically responded (with a response as a resolution or cure) and invasive procedures are not warranted; 'indeterminate' is applicable when the bacteriological response to the study drug was not valid for any reason (eg, pretreatment culture was negative or culture was not obtained when material was available and the subject was not judged a clinical failure).
