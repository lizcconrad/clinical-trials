  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if higher dose of bevacizumab can be taken safely by some
      patients and if changes in the dose of bevacizumab have any effect on blood pressure.

      Carboplatin and pemetrexed are FDA approved chemotherapy agents for patients with advanced
      non squamous non small cell lung cancer. Bevacizumab is also FDA approved in lung cancer ,
      and the combination of all three drugs is promising. The doctors directing this research want
      to learn how to better personalize drug dosing of bevacizumab by identifying people who could
      safely take a higher dose of the drug.
