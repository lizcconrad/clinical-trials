    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 2-phase observational study of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in
      Greece, designed to provide real world data on the risk factors of patients presenting to a
      hospital emergency department with an index event, as well as to depict the current
      management practices and outcomes of these clinical conditions in Greece.
