    <textblock>
      Breakfast consumption has previously been shown to positively affect cognitive and academic
      performance in children. Specifically, breakfast consumption has been reported to improve
      memory, attention, problem solving, and logical reasoning compared to the absence of
      breakfast. This has been found under both short-term laboratory conditions and within a
      school environment in children from both a low and high socioeconomic background, although
      some studies have failed to find favorable effects.
