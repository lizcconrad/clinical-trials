  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus among pediatric surgeons regarding the optimal treatment for children
      with complicated appendicitis with delayed diagnosis. With the development of broad-spectrum
      antibiotics, some surgeons have advocated expectant management for these children. However,
      there is little evidence to determine which children are most likely to benefit from this
      approach. Prior attempts to determine the effectiveness of expectant management for
      perforated appendicitis with delayed diagnosis often have not controlled for inherent
      differences in the clinical status of patients treated non-operatively vs. those treated with
      immediate appendectomy.

      The ability of clinical practice guidelines to improve clinical practice and optimize
      resource utilization continues to be substantiated in the literature. To be effective,
      clinical practice guidelines must be developed from reliable and reproducible data.

      This trial prospectively compares expectant management versus immediate laparoscopic or open
      appendectomy for perforated appendicitis in children with a delayed diagnosis. The primary
      outcome measure is length of hospital stay.

    <description>A consult to Interventional Radiology will be made at the time of admission to determine whether percutaneous drainage is feasible, and if it is the abscess will be drained by Interventional Radiology. Ultrasound and/or CT scan will be used to follow the abscess collections and/or phlegmons and guide the removal of drains.
For patients with a fecalith on imaging, a laparoscopic interval appendectomy will be performed 6-12 weeks following discharge from hospital. For those without a fecalith on imaging, a decision will be made by the family, with the guidance of the surgeon, whether or not to undergo a laparoscopic interval appendectomy.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All children with a delayed diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. Delayed diagnosis
             will be defined as symptoms for 4 or more days. Duration of symptoms will be defined
             as the time pain started.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. The diagnosis of perforated
             appendicitis will be based on diagnostic imaging (CT scan or ultrasound), showing an
             established appendiceal abscess or phlegmon.

          -  Consent to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncertainty about the diagnosis.

          -  The need for laparotomy for another reason.

          -  Free intraperitoneal air on imaging.

          -  Perforated appendicitis with diffuse abdominal fluid on imaging associated with a
             clinical picture of severe sepsis.

          -  Children with other medical condition that may affect the decision to operate e.g:
             children with inflammatory bowel disease.
