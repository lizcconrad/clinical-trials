      This study is designed to determine if a relationship exists between problems with memory,
      attention, learning, insight and executive function and self management in heart failure.

      Eligible participants are those 75 years of age or less, with left ventricular ejection
      fractions of 40% or less, english speaking and no known cognitive deficits. Participants will
      be administered the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status and
      the Controlled Oral Word Association test at the study visit. They will also be asked to
      complete the Self-Care in Heart Failure Index and the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia
      at their convenience and mail back to investigator. Participants will be contacted in 90 days
      to determine if they have been hospitalized, and if so, for how many days.
