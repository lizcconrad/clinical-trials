      STUDY HYPOTHESIS : An infection prevention program adapted for the nursing home context can
      reduce by 5% the number of infections (urinary, upper and lower respiratory and
      gastrointestinal) in elderly residents in nursing homes.

      STUDY DESIGN : The proposal is for an interventional cluster (nursing home) study comprising
      2 randomized groups: group 1 (interventional), comprising 25 nursing homes implementing a
      specific infection prevention program; and group 2 (control), 25 nursing homes continuing to
      implement their routine prevention measures.

    <description>The intervention mainly involves implementing urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal infection prevention measures. Study nursing home medical coordinators will be in charge of training their own teams. For this, they will be provided with:
a slide-show of recommendations (commented by an expert),
recommendations guides (on paper and on computer) to be shown to their teams. Means will be provided to the intervention nursing homes : Hydro-alcoholic solutions, disinfectant detergent-impregnated tissues, mouth care kits, tec.</description>
