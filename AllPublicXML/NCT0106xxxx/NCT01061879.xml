    <textblock>
      By doing this study, researchers hope to develop a special technique and laboratory
      conditions to help support umbilical stem cell growth and multiplication.

      In this project, researchers propose a three dimensional (3D) microenvironment that mimics
      the bone marrow stem cell microenvironment, with its supporting cells of osteoblasts and
      stromal cells. In theory, this will result in better expansion of cord blood stem cells ex
      vivo.

      To successfully expand umbilical cord blood stem cells ex vivo, a microenvironment that
      resembles the stem cell microenvironment, or stem cell 'niche' should be created. In
      designing this bio-system, we make use of several observations. First, bone osteoblasts are
      important in promoting hematopoietic stem cell expansion, accordingly, this bio-system will
      ensure the physical proximity of the cord blood stem cells to a 3D bone tissue derived from
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These MSCs will be isolated from Wharton's jelly, and by using
      an osteogenic medium and special scaffolds, these MSCs will differentiate into osteogenic
      progenitors creating a 3D bone structure. The other observation is that, co-culture of cord
      blood stem cells with mesenchymal stem cells is superior to liquid cultures in terms of ex
      vivo expansion , accordingly, in this experiment, undifferentiated MSCs will be co-cultured
      with cord blood stem cells in this created 3D bone structure. This is a unique design that
      has the potential to expand cord blood stem cells more efficiently.
