      should have a role in the Norwegian health care system in the acute treatment of a defined
      group of patients.

      The research project's objective is to analyze whether acute admissions to Hallingdal
      sjukestugu (HSS) is a real alternative to hospitalization in a general hospital.

      HSS is a community hospital and a department under Ringerike General Hospital (RS) and is
      located in Hallingdal 170 km from the RS. It is an established practice that the general
      practitioners in Hallingdal send selected patients in need for acute treatment to HSS in
      place of RS. In 2008 this accounted for 10.1% of the total number of acute inpatients from
      the six municipalities of Hallingdal.

      The research program includes a prospective, randomized study in which all patients intended
      for acute inpatient at HSS are distributed randomly into two groups, an intervention group
      who is admitted to HSS, and a control group who is sent to RS. A minimum of 70 patients are
      included in each group.

      The patients are going to be followed through one year after the hospital stay and all
      contacts with the specialist health services and the municipal health care services will be
      registered. There will also be collected data on the patients' functioning level and the
      patients' opinion about quality of the hospital stay. Through standardized questionnaire the
      involved health professional will be asked about their reviews.

      Three studies will analyze the patients' progress, economics and quality in the two groups.
      The three studies will together constitute a doctoral thesis.

      The research project will provide a better basis for assessing the role of local medical
      centers in the Norwegian health care in the acute treatment of a defined group of patients.
