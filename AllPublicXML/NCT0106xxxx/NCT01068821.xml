  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two cushioning materials (a gel mattress and an
      egg-crate foam mattress) placed beneath patients undergoing gynecologic surgery to prevent
      patients from sliding toward the head of the bed during head-down positioning.

      Our hypothesis is that the two materials will be equally good at preventing slide on the
      table and that slide will be less than 5 cm (&lt;2 inches) on average.

      Patient undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery are often placed in steep (30 to 45
      degrees) Trendelenburg's (head lower than feet) position. This helps the bowels to move
      towards the patient's head, making surgery in the pelvis safer. During surgery, if patients
      slide a great deal toward the head of the bed, nerve injury and hernia risk may be increased.
      Several techniques are in use to prevent patients from sliding on the bed during surgery, and
      of these, increasing the friction between a patient's skin and the bed surface appears to be
      the safest technique. Two materials are in use to increase this friction: a gel pad or an
      egg-crate foam mattress upon which the patient lies with bare skin. This study is comparing
      these two materials to see which material is associated with the LEAST amount of patient
      slide. Our hypothesis is that the two materials will be equally good at preventing slide on
      the table and that slide will be less than 5 cm (&lt;2 inches) on average.

    <measure>Amount of Patient Movement on the Operating Room Table</measure>
    <time_frame>About 150 minutes after start of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients undergoing gynecologic surgery require steep (30 to 45 degree) Trendelenberg's position to allow adequate exposure of the pelvis. This position leads to a small amount of movement toward the head of the bed. The table was marked at the point of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and at the point where a vertical marker touching the acromioclavicular (AC) joint of the left shoulder drops to the table. At the end of the surgery, when the operating table is leveled, the final positions of ASIS and AC will be measured. Measurements were made in centimeters to the tenth position.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting a Neurologic Deficit in Extremities After Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>postoperative day 1 and postoperative week 3-8</time_frame>
    <description>The neurologic deficit was assessed as follows: Patients' postoperative care was unchanged from routine for this study. Any postoperative complaints regarding limb pain or weakness or numbness were recorded and assessed with neurologic exam to determine sensation or motor components. Absence of resolution was documented.</description>

    <description>A gel pad (mattress) (approximately 3cm thick) is placed under the patient on top of the usual operating room mattress, directly in contact with patient's skin from buttocks to shoulders with the patient in dorsal lithotomy position under general anesthesia. Time in Trendelenburg's position and time operating are both recorded. The position of two bony landmarks (left anterior superior iliac spine and left acromioclavicular joint) are marked before Trendelenburg's position (30 to 45 degrees below horizontal) and immediately after returning the patient to horizontal position.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients with planned laparoscopic or robotic procedures were offered participation in the preoperative holding area. Recruitment started 3/1/2010 and ended 5/10/2010.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients were enrolled if they acknowledged their desire to participate. Patients were excluded if they were brought to the operating room before being approached for participation or if they indicated they did not wish to participate. The materials being compared are already both commonly used for gynecologic surgery.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Patients undergoing gynecologic surgery require steep (30 to 45 degree) Trendelenberg's position to allow adequate exposure of the pelvis. This position leads to a small amount of movement toward the head of the bed. The table was marked at the point of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and at the point where a vertical marker touching the acromioclavicular (AC) joint of the left shoulder drops to the table. At the end of the surgery, when the operating table is leveled, the final positions of ASIS and AC will be measured. Measurements were made in centimeters to the tenth position.</description>

          <title>Amount of Patient Movement on the Operating Room Table</title>
          <description>Patients undergoing gynecologic surgery require steep (30 to 45 degree) Trendelenberg's position to allow adequate exposure of the pelvis. This position leads to a small amount of movement toward the head of the bed. The table was marked at the point of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and at the point where a vertical marker touching the acromioclavicular (AC) joint of the left shoulder drops to the table. At the end of the surgery, when the operating table is leveled, the final positions of ASIS and AC will be measured. Measurements were made in centimeters to the tenth position.</description>
