  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of medication errors and 20% of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the hospital
      setting are estimated to be related to communication issues regarding patient medications at
      various transition points of care from admission to discharge. The Joint Commission (TJC)
      requires accurate and complete medication reconciliation occur at each transition point
      throughout hospitalization. Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most
      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management
      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is
      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead. In addition, the
      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports
      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing accurate
      medication histories.

      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process. In 2009, a
      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication
      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the
      pharmacist-obtained medication history. The number of home medications identified by the
      pharmacist compared to the nurse was 411 versus 312 (p&lt;0.0001). The total percentage of
      medication errors prevented by the pharmacist was 66.2. Using the VA Healthcare Failure Mode
      Effects Analysis - HFMEAâ„¢ Hazard Scoring Matrix, 3 independent pharmacist reviewers found
      that 18% of patients interviewed had a score greater than 7, and 3 patients had a score of 12
      (major/probable), if the discrepancies would not have been identified and corrected by the
      pharmacist conducting the admission medication reconciliation audit. The same patients'
      discharge medication reconciliation and discharge medication lists were retrospectively
      reviewed for the MUE, and the total percentage of patients with medication errors on
      discharge was 43%.
