      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the time to wound healing in skin graft
      donor sites with a new treatment (Altrazeal dressing) compared to standard of care treatment
      (Aquacel Ag- Carboxymethylcellulose dressing) in partial thickness skin graft donor sites.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, therapeutic exploratory study to monitor wound healing
      with the new AltrazealTM flexible hydrogel nanoparticle dressing compared to the existing
      treatment standard (Aquacel ® AG sodium carboxymethylcellulose dressing) in patients with at
      least two skin graft donor sites. 40 patients with at least 2 skin graft donor sites, ranging
      in age from 3 and 85 years, will be enrolled. Children (age 3 to 16 inclusive) will be
      included in the patient population if possible, but should not exceed 50% of all patient
      enrolled. Researchers will first identify the skin donor sites (A and B) for each patient and
      take baseline digital images and measurements immediately following surgery (Day 1). Trained
      personnel will apply the dressings provided by the Sponsor for and labeled as A or B by the
      Sponsor in a random fashion. Typical meticulous wound care and adequate analgesic medical
      coverage will be provided for the duration of the study. Both the patient and medical staff
      will be trained on instructions for use of each dressing. The patients will be monitored
      daily as part of standard procedure while they are in the in-patient setting. If and when
      patients move to the out-patient setting, they will continue to be monitored at least
      every-other-day at the study center. On each day (in-patient) or every-other-day
      (outpatient), the physician will determine whether each skin graft donor site has healed per
      standard care guidelines (i.e. &gt; 95% re-epithelization), and pain and adverse events will be
      monitored. The last study visit will be on Day 24 or on the day when both wounds have been
      assessed as &quot;healed&quot;, whichever comes first.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient is between the ages of 3 and 85 Note: In order to maintain a
             broad representation of ages, no more than 50% of the patients enrolled in the study
             should be between the ages of 3 and 16, inclusive.

          2. Patient is in general good health

          3. Patient has two independent skin donor sites of approximately the same dimensions.

          4. Patient is willing and able to cooperate with the protocol for duration of study.

          5. Patient is capable of providing informed consent and HIPAA authorization

          6. Ability to read and speak either English or Spanish

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient is less than 3 years of age or more than 85 years of age

          2. Patient has acutely infected wounds

          3. Patient has wounds with surrounding cellulites

          4. Patient has a history of hypersensitivity to any components of either the nanoparticle
             or sodium carboxymethylcellulose dressing, or any known sensitivities to other
             hydrogel bandage treatments

          5. Patient has a concurrent clinical condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator
             could either pose a health risk to the patient while participating in this study, or
             could potentially influence the outcome of the study;

          6. Patient has history of poor wound healing or any skin/immune system condition that
             would increase likelihood of wound irritation, infection or increase chance of early
             termination

          7. Patient is unable to communicate or to cooperate with the investigator due to language
             problems, poor mental development, or impaired cerebral function.
