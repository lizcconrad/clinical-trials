  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A dissecting or intramural haematoma of the thoracic aorta (AH) is a haemorrhage that
      dissects the aortic wall. An entry point is detected at an intimal tear, ulcer or plaque
      rupture via imaging in almost 50% of cases. AH occurs in older patients than those with AD
      and develops on atheromatous lesions with parietal ulcers, most often in cases of poorly
      managed, pre-existing hypertension (HTN). Type A AHs, which affect the ascending aorta,
      frequently progress towards an AD with a high risk of mortality, and represent a surgical
      indication.

      Patients who have presented AD or AH, whether they have been operated or not, must undergo
      prolonged monitoring. This involves both clinical and radiological checks to ensure that
      blood pressure is properly monitored, that the parietal lesions have receded and that there
      are no complications.

      HTN is a recognized risk factor for the onset of AD and systolic blood pressure must be
      brought down to between 100 and 120 mmHg perioperatively. Furthermore, HTN is also a risk
      factor for the rupture of unoperated type B AD. Despite this, only two studies have looked at
      BP management in AD patients. The first, carried out among chronic type A or B AD patients
      revealed that closer monitoring of blood pressure levels at home led to a better long-term
      prognosis. Another study revealed a 60% prevalence of non-managed clinical HTN among 40
      chronic AD patients.

      Whilst frequent, regular aortic wall monitoring via imaging methods (CT or MRI) is
      recommended after thoracic AD surgery, there is no precise recommendation as to the method of
      BP monitoring in very high-risk patients. A BP level of 135/80 mmHg has been suggested as a
      maximum limit for patients having been operated for AD. In order to achieve this,
      antihypertensives of several therapeutic classes must be used, with beta-blockers as a
      priority. The same can be said for AH, as it has been demonstrated that the absence of
      beta-blocker treatment is a predictive factor for poor progress.

      Increased aortic stiffness can cause increased systolic blood pressure and is recognized as
      an independent cardiovascular risk factor. This stiffness can be detected by measuring the
      carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). No study has as yet focused on assessing aortic
      stiffness in patients who have undergone AD or AH surgery.

      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in thoracic AD patients is highly prevalent, and
      respiratory events that occur are more severe. This has prompted some to suggest that
      systematic detection of OSAS after AD should be carried out. No findings have yet been
      published about patients who have undergone AH surgery.

      Main objective:

        -  To evaluate the level of blood pressure control using ambulatory blood pressure
           monitoring in patients who have undergone surgery for a type A thoracic AD or AH.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To study aortic stiffness within this patient population and determine its predictive
           parameters.

        -  To determine the prevalence of OSAS among this patient population and study the
           relationship between respiratory data and blood pressure values.

        -  To determine the respective roles of blood pressure level, aortic stiffness, and
           respiratory and biological parameters upon the postoperative aortic diameters of
           patients who have undergone surgery for type A thoracic AD or AH.
