  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the similarities between heart disease and stroke in terms of disease process and
      elevated risk of recurrent events, exercise-based programs akin to cardiac rehabilitation are
      not available for people with stroke.

      The purpose of this study is to examine 1) the feasibility of adapting cardiac rehabilitation
      for individuals with stroke, and 2) the effects of this program on aerobic capacity, walking,
      risk factors, community integration and quality of life.

      The investigators anticipate that cardiac rehabilitation may be appropriately adapted to
      accommodate individuals with stroke who have a range of functional abilities, and that this
      program is effective in improving aerobic capacity, walking ability and stroke risk factors.
      The investigators also anticipate participants will demonstrate improved community
      integration and quality of life following this program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many parallels between heart disease in stroke, including their cardiovascular
      etiologies, presence of co-morbidities and similarities in risk factors. Cardiac
      rehabilitation is a well-established and successful model of care for individuals with heart
      disease that is focused on exercise and risk factor modification. Yet analogous secondary
      prevention programs for the stroke program are not readily available.

      The main research question is: What is the feasibility and effect of cardiac rehabilitation
      in individuals following stroke?

      The objectives are:

        1. To determine if stroke survivors are able and willing to participate in a cardiac
           rehabilitation program. Specifically, to determine the feasibility of the cardiac
           rehabilitation program in individuals following stroke as determined by compliance to
           attendance and training requirements.

        2. To determine if a cardiac rehabilitation program will have a meaningful benefit, among
           chronic stroke survivors, on:

             -  walking capacity and ability: considering functional capacity [endurance /
                distance] and quality [neuromotor control],

             -  community integration: considering quantity [activity monitors] and quality [index
                of reintegration to normal living] of activity

             -  health-related quality of life: as determined by stroke specific index

             -  risk factors for subsequent stroke: including exercise capacity, blood pressure,
                blood lipid profile
