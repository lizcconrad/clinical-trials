      This is an observational pilot study in patients with definitive relapsing-remitting multiple
      sclerosis to determine whether there is a correlation in serum leptin levels and serum nitric
      oxide levels during a clinically observed increase in disease activity. Each subject will
      followed for 12 months while taking interferon beta-1a subcutaneous injections 3 times a
      week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis per update of McDonald criteria

          -  Initiating treatment with interferon beta 1a subcutaneous injection with minimal
             dosing of 22mcg.

          -  18-60 years of age.

          -  Women who are not pregnant or breast feeding, and who do not intend to become
             pregnant.

          -  Stable dose of concomitant medications for 30 days prior to baseline. Efforts should
             be made to maintain steady doses of concomitant medications for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment on other interferon preparations, glatiramer acetate, in last 30 days or 6
             months on Natalizumab, mitoxantrone, cyclosporine or other immunomodulators as
             determined by the PI.

          -  Treatment with any other investigational treatments within the past year or treatment
             with any investigational treatments for multiple sclerosis within the last year.

          -  Any progressive form of MS.

          -  Known Hypersensitivity to interferon beta 1a.

          -  Inability to administer subcutaneous injections

          -  Inability to undergo laboratory evaluation.

          -  Seropositivity for HIV (by medical history)

          -  Diabetes Mellitus Tyle I or II (by medical history)

          -  Hepatitis B or C (by medical history)

          -  Uncontrolled psychiatric disorder.

          -  Any unstable illness that the investigator's opinion precludes participation in this
             study.

          -  Inability to maintain compliance with study protocol.

          -  Implanted devices or metal which would contraindicate MRI.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in CBC or CMP

          -  MMSE &lt;25
