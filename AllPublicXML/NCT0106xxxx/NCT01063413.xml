  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of two after-school programs on children's
      physical activity, fitness, body composition, and academic performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tennessee ranks 4th for the highest prevalence of adult obesity in the nation (30.2%), and
      ranks 5th for the highest rate of youth obesity (36.5%). The Division of General Pediatrics
      at Vanderbilt has a specific research focus to develop community engagement projects that
      measurably reduce childhood obesity. Metro Parks and Recreation has been showcased by the
      National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) as a national model for its leadership role
      in community health and wellness. The two have created a unique academic-community
      partnership, guided by principals of community-based participatory research (CBPR), that is
      working to test and disseminate effective Metro Parks-based programs to reduce pediatric
      obesity. The proposed study will examine the impact of the Coleman Community Center
      after-school program on routine physical activity, weight and fitness outcomes in children
      who belong to the low-income and racial and ethnic minority populations at highest risk for
      childhood obesity. This study was requested by Metro Parks and has significant policy
      implications: If the program is deemed effective in improving daily physical activity, weight
      and/or fitness outcomes in students, the proposed study will serve as the rationale to expand
      the program to Metro Parks' 22 community centers, all of which are located in under-resourced
      neighborhoods.
