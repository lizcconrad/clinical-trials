      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term safety of a single intravitreal
      injection of autologous bone marrow stem cells in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective phase I, nonrandomized open-label study of retinitis pigmentosa patients with
      best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 20/200. Standardized ophthalmic
      evaluation will be perform at baseline and at weeks 1, 4,12 and 24 (±1) following
      intravitreal injection of 10 x 106 bone marrow stem cells/ 0,1ml . Three measures will be
      used to evaluate the short-term safety of intravitreal of ABMDSC: 1) severe visual loss,
      defined as a drop in 15 letters on ETDRS visual acuity scale; 2) decrease in ERG response; 3)
      decrease in 5 square degrees on visual field; secondary safety outcomes : 1) increase in
      intra-ocular inflammation defined herein as anterior chamber cells and flare higher than 3+
      for more than 1 month after injection according to a classification described elsewhere ; 2)
      decrease in CMT more than 50um; 3)genesis of abnormal tissues (teratomas) or tumors; 4)
      qualitative changes in retinal or choroidal perfusion, like macular nonperfusion. Secondary
      outcome measures will be used to evaluate the short-term efficiency of intravitreal of
      ABMDSC: 1) improvement in ERG response; 2) increase in visual field: 3) increase in CSMT &gt;
      50um and not related to macular edema; 4) increase &gt; 5 letters on BCVA

    <description>One intravitreal injection of a 0.1-ml cell suspension containing around 10x106 bone marrow mononuclear stem cells(BMMSC). All treatments were performed by a single retinal specialist using topical proparacaine drops under sterile conditions (eyelid speculum and povidone-iodine). Autologous BMMSC were injected into the vitreous cavity using a 27 gauge needle inserted through the inferotemporal pars plana 3.0 - 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus. After the injection, central retinal artery perfusion was confirmed with indirect ophthalmoscopy. Patients were instructed to instill one drop of 0.3% ciprofloxacin into the injected eye four times daily for 1 week after the procedure.</description>
