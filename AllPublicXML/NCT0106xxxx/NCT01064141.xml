      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential for co-administration of the first
      dose of CYD Dengue vaccine with childhood vaccination.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety of CYD Dengue vaccine after each dose; first dose given alone or
           coadministered with childhood vaccines.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the immunogenicity of CYD Dengue vaccine after each dose; first dose given
           alone or co-administered with childhood vaccines.

      Participants will be enrolled in a 3-step enrollment and randomized to 1 of 4 treatment
      groups. Groups 1 and 2 will receive 5 vaccinations, and Groups 3 and 4 will received 6
      vaccinations (childhood vaccines or placebo co-administered with the first dose of CYD Dengue
      vaccine in 2 separate arms). All toddlers will receive a pentavalent acellular pertussis
      combination vaccine or Combo (PENTAXIM®), planned approximately 10 months after enrollment.
