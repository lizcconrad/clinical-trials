  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Non-medical
      treatment measures (e.g. dietary therapy or weight loss) can hardly influence Lp(a) plasma
      concentrations. Drug therapy has only limited influence, e.g. treatment with niacin. Statins
      are usually without effect. Lipid apheresis is the only treatment known to lower elevated
      Lp(a) levels in a relevant way. In patients with pronounced elevation of Lp(a) and normal LDL
      cholesterol levels, who suffer from progressive cardiovascular disease, the treatment with
      lipid apheresis seems to be a last-resort treatment option. The current trial will evaluate
      the effectiveness of lipid apheresis on cardioavascular endpoints.

      Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Non-medical

      concentrations. Drug therapy has only limited influence, e.g. treatment with niacin. Statins

      cholesterol levels, who suffer from progressive cardiovascular disease, the treatment with
      lipid apheresis seems to be a last-resort treatment option. The current trial will evaluate
      the effectiveness of lipid apheresis on cardioavascular endpoints. The trial is a randomized
      multicenter trial in Germany. Patients will be randomized to the apheresis group or to the
      control group. All patients will receive maximal risk minimizing therapies. The apheresis
      group will receive in addition weekly lipid apheresis. The principal outcome parameter is a
      composite endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, interventional therapeutic procedure
      (PCI, stenting), coronary bypass surgery (CABG), non-fatal ischemic cerebrovascular accident,
      hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), critical limb ischemia, peripheral
      arterial revascularization procedure; amputation, death from cardiovascular cause.
