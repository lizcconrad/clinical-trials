  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to investigate if Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) will
      impact back and leg flexibility over both the short-term and the long-term.

      It is hypothesized that NET will improve flexibility and that these changes are durable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General flexibility is a key component of health, wellbeing and general physical
      conditioning. In fact, lack of flexibility has been associated with an increased risk of
      developing musculoskeletal injuries and underperformance.

      It has been previously shown that a regular stretching routine will improve flexibility
      relatively quickly. However, when the routine is discontinued or when stretching is not
      performed regularly, flexibility is also quickly lost. Therefore, an alternative intervention
      with longer retention would be desirable.

      The reason for reduced flexibility, or a shortened muscle length, can be multifactorial.
      Reduced flexibility can be due to physical causes, such as an acute injury or strength
      training. Likewise, mental factors, such as anxiety and stress, can also significantly
      contribute to muscle tension, thereby reducing flexibility. It has been previously shown that
      somatic symptoms of anxiety can be lessened by treating the psychological symptoms of
      anxiety. It has also been previously shown that Neuro Emotional Technique® (NET), a
      chiropractic stress-reduction technique, is effective at reducing stress. Therefore, I
      hypothesize that NET may be effective at improving general flexibility. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to investigate if NET can improve flexibility in the short-term, and if so, if
      these changes are durable in the long term.

      Participants of this study will be randomly divided into three arms: (1) Experimental Arm -
      which will receive two 20-minute sessions of NET, (2) Active Controls - which will receive
      two 20-minute sessions of stretching instructions, and (3) Inactive Control - which will
      receive no intervention or instruction, but simply be assessed.

    <description>NET is considered an alternative stress-reduction technique. Its aim is to remove neurological abnormalities which have a specified physiopathological pattern. The goal of NET is to normalize the aberrant patterns through a physical correction.
During the NET procedure, various psychological components of the anxious state are considered: cognitions, emotions, and behaviours. These various components are explored for a physiological reaction in the participant. Once a physiological reaction is found, the practitioner helps the participant identify the specific emotion. The procedure is concluded when the patient no longer feels distress or discomfort. Following the intervention, patients frequently report feeling subjective relief.</description>
