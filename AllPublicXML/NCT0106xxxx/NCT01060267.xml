      Objectives:

      Blood in stomach &amp; oesophagus in patients with variceal bleeding often obscures the
      endoscopic view &amp; makes endoscopic intervention difficult to perform. Erythromycin, a motilin
      agonist induces gastric emptying. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of
      Erythromycin on endoscopic visibility and its outcome.

      Methods:

      Adult patients with liver cirrhosis or stigmata of chronic liver disease presenting with
      hematemesis and or melena within previous 12 hours were randomized in a double blind trial to
      receive either 125 mg erythromycin or placebo 30 minutes before endoscopy. The primary end
      points were endoscopic visibility assessed by objective scoring system &amp; mean endoscopy
      duration. Secondary end points were need for repeat endoscopy and blood transfusions within
      24 hours of first endoscopy , endoscopy related complications and length of hospital stay.

    <measure>The primary end point was to determine the effect of erythromycin on gastric cleansing and thereby quality of endoscopic visualization, reflecting the ease with which the procedure was performed in a clear stomach.</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary end points were; 1. the need for second look endoscopy &amp; number of blood units transfused within 24 hours after initial endoscopy; 3. Incidence of endoscopy &amp; drug related complications and length of hospital stay.</measure>
