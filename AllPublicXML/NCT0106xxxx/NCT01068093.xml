      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of Ezetimibe on coronary plaque volume in
      patients with acute coronary syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies reported that administration of statins in patients with coronary artery
      disease resulted in significant reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C) and
      regression of coronary plaque volume, and a decrease in the level of LDL-C through statin
      treatment positively correlates with a reduction in the volume of plaques. Administration of
      Ezetimibe in addition to statin has been shown to be more effective at reducing LDL-C levels
      compared with statin monotherapy. However, the effects of Ezetimib on coronary plaque volume
      remain unclear. In this study, the investigators assess the effect of Ezetimibe on coronary
      plaque volume and tissue composition in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have been diagnosed as acute coronary syndrome, and successful
             percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were performed with intravascular ultrasound
             (IVUS) guidance.

          2. Patients having coronary plaques (≧ 500 µm in thickness or % plaque of 20% or more at
             ≧ 5 mm distal or proximal to the previously treated area in the same branch of
             coronary artery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with bypass graft or in-stent restenosis at the site of PCI.

          2. Patients who received PCI in the past on the lesion where the evaluation of coronary
             plaque volume is planned.

          3. Patients who had plaques in a non-culprit site and might receive PCI during the
             treatment period.

          4. Patients receiving lipid-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates, probucol, nicotinic acid
             or cholesterol absorption inhibitors).

          5. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

          6. Patients with cardiogenic shock.

          7. Patients receiving cyclosporine.

          8. Patients with any allergy to Ezetimibe.

          9. Patients with hepatobiliary disorders.

         10. Pregnant women, women suspected of being pregnant, or lactating women.

         11. Patients with renal disorders or undergoing dialysis.

         12. Patients who are ineligible in the opinion of the investigator.
