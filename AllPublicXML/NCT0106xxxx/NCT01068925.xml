  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a drug interaction between
      GSK1349572 and the HIV protease inhibitors Tipranavir/Ritonavir (TPV/RTV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The construction of a new antiretroviral regimen with GSK1349572 in raltegravir-resistant
      subjects will likely require less commonly used agents such as tipranavir and enfuvirtide.
      Ritonavir-boosted tipranavir (TPV/RTV) has been shown to induce drug metabolizing enzymes and
      lead to decreased exposure of some antiretrovirals thus necessitating a drug interaction
      study with GSK1349572 as GSK1349572 is eliminated primarily by metabolism.

      This is a single-center, single sequence, open-label, three-period study, in adult male and
      female healthy subjects. Approximately 18 subjects will receive GSK1349572 50mg QD for 5 days
      (Treatment A). Subjects will then be administered TPV/RTV 500/200mg BID for 7 days (Treatment
      B) followed by the combination of GSK1349572 50mg QD and TPV/RTV 500/200mg for 5 days
      (Treatment C). There will be no washout periods between treatments. Safety evaluations will
      be collected during each treatment period. Serial PK samples for GSK1349572 will be collected
      and compared between Treatment A and C. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last
      dose of study drug.

      The study will be conducted at one centre in the US with healthy adult male and female
      subjects.

      ViiV Healthcare is the new sponsor of this study, and GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of
      updating systems to reflect the change in sponsorship.

          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12
             months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with

             including sulfa-containing drugs, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the
             opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their
             participation.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, antacids, iron
             supplements, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days
