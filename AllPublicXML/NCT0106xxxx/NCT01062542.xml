  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy can damage the ovaries and cause premature menopause. In women treated before
      the age of 40 years, menopause does not usually occur. We have very little information about
      the impact of chemotherapy on ovarian function in this particular group of women. In this
      study, we will check hormone blood tests and ultrasound tests of the ovaries to measure the
      reserve of eggs left in the ovaries after treatment in young survivors of breast cancer and
      childhood cancer. We will do the same tests in our comparison group. We can use these results
      to estimate the reduction in fertility in young cancer survivors.

      As women across North America and Europe increasingly delay childbirth, fertility
      preservation is emerging as an important issue among young breast cancer patients. The
      dramatic increase in survival for the major pediatric cancers in the last 50 years has
      resulted in an expanding population of childhood cancer survivors. The information currently
      available to counsel these patients about the impact of treatment on their fertility is
      inadequate. A significant degree of subfertility can exist prior to the onset of frank
      ovarian failure, and current studies do not address this.

      This study will adopt new technologies that have revolutionized the evaluation of female
      fertility to assess ovarian function in young breast cancer survivors. The results will
      provide new, more accurate and clinically useful information to patients and physicians about
      the impact of cancer therapy on fertility. The results have the potential to influence
      clinical decisions regarding cancer treatment, and the use of assisted reproductive
      technologies for contemporary patients and survivors. Further, insofar as treatment advances
      are designed to improve disease control while reducing toxicity, these results may serve as
      the basis for better understanding the toxicity of modern therapy and provide opportunities
      for improvement.

    <description>Patients will have a Blood sample taken to check hormone levels. Patients will also have an ultrasound test done to examine the ovaries. The ultrasound test is done by inserting a cylindrical probe into the vagina. The test has to be done this way to measures the ovaries accurately.</description>
