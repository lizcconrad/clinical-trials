      This project may help to answer several fundamental questions related to public health
      regarding vaccination against influenza viruses and regarding the influenza A(H1N1)v pandemy:

      What is the immunologic efficacy in terms of antibodies response of the vaccination against
      the seasonal (2009-2010) influenza virus and against the A(H1N1)v virus in the clinical
      staff?

      Moreover, it may help to answer questions related to the use of a vaccine against influenza
      virus variants emerging in the French population:

        1. Before the vaccination:

             -  What is the status of the residual anti-H1N1 seasonal viruses immunity and of the
                anti-A(H1N1)v immunity in the population stratified by age and taking into account
                the multiplicity of the prior seasonal vaccinations?

             -  What is the level of the cellular and humoral cross-reactivity between the
                different H1N1 strains?

        2. After the vaccination:

             -  What is the intensity of the anti-vaccine immune response as a function of the age
                of the population ad of the prior seasonal vaccinations?

             -  What is the level of the cellular and humoral cross-reactivity after vaccination as
                a function of the age of the population and of the multiplicity of the prior
                seasonal vaccinations?
