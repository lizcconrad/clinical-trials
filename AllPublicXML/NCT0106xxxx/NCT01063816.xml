    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of veliparib
      (ABT-888)and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose of veliparib (ABT-888) when
      administered in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine in subjects with advanced solid
      tumors.
