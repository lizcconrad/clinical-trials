  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, single-dose, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative
      bioavailability of two formulations of 1 mg risperidone tablets under fasting conditions.

      The test formulation was Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited's Risperidone Tablets, 1 mg, and
      the reference formulation was Risperdal® (risperidone) tablets, 1 mg (Janssen Pharmaceutica
      Products, L.P.).

      The study was conducted with 30 healthy adults. In each study period, a single 1 mg dose was
      administered to all subjects following an overnight fast.The subjects received the test
      product in one study period and the reference product in the other period; the order of
      administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. There was a 7-day interval
      between treatments.
