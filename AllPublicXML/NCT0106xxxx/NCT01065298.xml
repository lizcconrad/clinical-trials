      The purpose of this study is to improve blood glucose control in Type 2 Diabetes mellitus
      patients.

  <detailed_description>

      We hypothesize that Autologous bone marrow derived stem cell transplantation(ABMSCT)into the
      pancreas of patients with T2DM, aged 30 - 70 years with triple oral hypoglycemic agent
      failure and on insulin(&gt;0.4 U/ kg body weight/day) will lead to abolition or reduction of
      insulin requirement by more than or equal to 50% in these patients over a period of 6 months.
      It is assumed that ABMSCT in these patients leads to increased angiogenesis, secretion of
      various cytokines and upregulation of pancreatic transcription factors and Vascular
      endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and creates a microenvironment which supports beta
      cell/resident stem cell activation and survival.

    <description>Group 1: 200 - 250 ml of bone marrow will be aspirated and layered on density gradient medium (Ficoll - Hyperaque) and stem cells will be separated. Separated MNC's will be tagged with FDG-PET and injected into superior pancreatico duodenal artery and an PET scan will be done 2 hours later to see the percentage of stem cells homing in to pancreas. After 8 weeks G-CSF(10mcg/Kg/day) will be given subcutaneous for 5 days to achieve a Leucocyte count of &gt;40,000/mm3. Patients will be urged to monitor and document blood glucose readings for next 6 months. Glucagon stimulated C - peptide, plasma Insulin, HOMA-IR , HOMA-B ,HbA1c, lipid profile and biochemistry will be done at baseline and 6 months .</description>
