  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This evaluation is being conducted on the relative new knee system, the Vanguard Cruciate
      Retaining (CR) to evaluate clinical efficacy of the Vanguard CR components.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was initially designed as a multi-centre, randomized controlled study,
      comparing the Vanguard CR with the AGC in routine use. The study now is a single centre
      study.

      The Vanguard CR system has been specifically designed to give greater knee stability through
      the use of more anatomic patello-femoral kinematics.
