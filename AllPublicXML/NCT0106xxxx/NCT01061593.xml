    <textblock>
      Dzherelo (Immunoxel) is an oral immunomodulating botanical agent available over-the-counter
      in Ukraine. After many years of laboratory and clinical testing the formulation was approved
      in 1997 by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine as a dietary herbal supplement, which enhances
      immunity against viral and infectious diseases. The goal of this study is to conduct
      confirmatory clinical trial in Ukraine and Mongolia for TB indications.

      Phase III, placebo-controlled trial, aimed to seek the therapeutic benefit of Immunoxel in
      combination with standard of care anti-TB therapy (ATT) at the end of the 1-month period
      (p&lt;0.05) among subjects with sputum-positive pulmonary TB. The results will be compared to
      standard ATT therapy + placebo. The trial will consist of one stage with laboratory
      evaluation after one month. Two cohorts or arms of at least 150 subjects each (total 300)
      with pulmonary TB positive for sputum AFB smear will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      once-daily, honey lozenge of Immunoxel in combination with standard ATT for 1 month. Patients
      who receive standard ATT + placebo preparation will be used as a group of comparison.

             patients will have HIV. Another group of at least 30 patients will have MDR-TB.
             Another group of at least 30 patients will have XDR-TB Remaining patients will have
             drug-sensitive TB. They will be randomly assigned to placebo at 1:1 ratio.

          -  TB infection documented prior to Study Entry by sputum smear positive staining for
             acid-fast bacilli (AFB).

             tuberculosis.
