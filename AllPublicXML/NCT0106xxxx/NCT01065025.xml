        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One or more evaluable target lesion according to RECIST (by CT-scan, MRI or calipers),
             of which at least one evaluable target lesion (proven by CT or MRI) has to be located
             in the lung.

          -  Progressive disease as defined by new or progressive lesions on CT-scan, MRI, bone
             scan or by increase of PSA.

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented diagnosis of primary or metastatic solid
             tumors or malignant lymphomas refractory to prior standard therapy or for which no
             standard therapy exists. Entry will include, but is not limited to patients with
             prostate and breast cancer refractory to hormone treatment, ovarian cancer, head and
             neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney
             cancer, malignant melanoma or malignant lymphoma. Patients who have refused standard
             therapies are also eligible.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2.

          -  Acceptable liver, renal and bone marrow function.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with other EG5 inhibitors.

          -  Antineoplastic therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy,
             immunotherapy or use of other investigational agents within the last 2 weeks or a
             longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used (e.g. 6
             weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosourea). Patients must have recovered from any
             treatment-related toxicity (except for alopecia, fatigue and grade 1 neurotoxicity)
             prior to registration.

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies unless having undergone definitive
             treatment more than 5 years prior to entry into the study and without evidence of
             recurrent malignant disease, excluding patients with basal cell carcinoma of the skin;
             superficial carcinoma of the bladder; carcinoma of the prostate with a current PSA &lt;
             0.1 ng/ml; or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

          -  Patients with a history of significant cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine,
             gastrointestinal, respiratory or inflammatory illness.

          -  Patients with a history of, who were treated for, or who are suspected of having,
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.
