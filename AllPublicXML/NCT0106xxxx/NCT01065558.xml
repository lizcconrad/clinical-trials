    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of ecopipam in patients with
      Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND). Ecopipam specifically blocks the actions of one chemical in the
      brain that helps nerves talk to one another; ecopipam does this by stopping the chemical
      (dopamine) from binding to one of its family of receptors (i.e, the D1 family). LND is a very
      rare genetic disease. The sponsor is doing this study to find out what side effects ecopipam
      causes in LND patients, and whether ecopipam may be able to relieve the self-injurious
      behaviors seen in these patients.

    <description>This study's primary outcome is the safety of ecopipam in Lesch-Nyhan patients as measured by standard clinical laboratory tests. The patients will also be observed and questioned about other side effects, such as whether they feel more or less tired.Standard clinical laboratory tests for liver, kidney and blood function were conducted. The normal ranges for each of these tests were different and are too numerous to be individually listed here. However, if any individual value were to be either three-times greater or lesser than the upper or the lower limit of the test, then that value was considered to have been changed.</description>
