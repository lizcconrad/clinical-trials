  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study was planned, with the primary objective to observe patient survival
      following first-line treatment of patients of Stage IIIB/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC) with different platinum-based doublets under routine disease management conditions.
      Further secondary objectives of this study are to provide insights to what extent histologic
      subtyping and the use of additional prognostic or predictive biomarkers are currently
      considered for differential therapeutic decisions under routine conditions. All of these data
      are critical to evaluate the factors for differential therapeutic decisions and their effect
      on patient outcomes in a real life setting, and they can only be obtained through
      observational research.
