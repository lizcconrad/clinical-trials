      QuitAdvisorMD: A point-of-care tool for brief smoking cessation interventions Under a Phase
      II SBIR grant supported by NIH/NIDA, we are developing QUITAdvisorMD: a point-of-care,
      patient-centered resource for counseling patients who smoke or use tobacco products. It is
      based on the principles of Motivational Interviewing, a non-confrontational and very
      effective method for intervening and treating these patients; the 5 A's of behavioral
      interventions; and the Transtheoretical Model of Change. Through a point and click interface,
      the tool uses a series of interview questions designed to motivate patients to stop smoking
      by first assessing their stage of change and then offering effective stage-based
      interventions and interview techniques. The tool also offers stage-tailored patient
      information, a clinician educational reference, and the ability to communicate support
      information patients via email and/or text message.
