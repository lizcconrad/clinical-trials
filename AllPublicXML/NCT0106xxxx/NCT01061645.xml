  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotoxins (ITs), monoclonal antibodies conjugated to plant or bacterial toxins, have been
      extensively investigated for their possible use as anti-tumor agents although not in
      carcinoma patients with minimal residual disease. Various ITs have been tested in early
      clinical trials and recent studies demonstrate anti-tumor activity of IT treatment in
      patients with glioblastoma and different solid tumors. Systemic treatment with immunotoxins
      directed against carefully selected epithelial cell surface molecules may have a potential
      for eradicating also dormant metastatic tumor cells, as their action is independent of cell
      proliferation. The effector moieties of the IT used here, the Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE),
      inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by catalytic inactivation (ribosylation) of
      elongation factor 2 in the ribosome complex.
