      The main objective is to study important factors in the patho-physiology of osteoporosis in
      patients with COPD. Therefore, the investigators will study biological markers in plasma and
      urine and correlate them to markers of bone turnover and clinical data.

      Rationale:

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as a preventable and treatable
      disease with significant extrapulmonary effects. Osteoporosis is recognized as one of these
      extrapulmonary consequences. It results in increased risk of fracture and thereby an
      increased morbidity and mortality. Nowadays it is believed that the patho-physiology of
      osteoporosis is multi-factorial. However, which factors are most important in patients with
      COPD is still not clear.

      Objective:

      The main objective is to study important factors in the patho-physiology of osteoporosis in
      patients with COPD. Therefore, we will study biological markers in plasma and urine and
      correlate them to markers of bone turnover and clinical data.

      Study design:

      The present study will be an observational, cross-sectional study.

        In total 120 patients will be included. All subjects will be included from the outdoor
        clinic of the department of Pulmonology of the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven or Diagnostic
        Centre Eindhoven (DCE). The subjects are divided into 6 groups of 20 subjects each, I: COPD
        patients with osteoporosis based on T-score and without vertebral fractures, II: COPD
        patients with osteoporosis based on T-score and vertebral fractures, III: COPD patients
        with vertebral fractures and without osteoporosis based on T-score, IV: COPD patients
        without osteoporosis based on T-score and without vertebral fractures, V: healthy controls
        with osteoporosis based on T-score and without vertebral fractures, VI: healthy controls
        without osteoporosis based on T-score and without vertebral fractures.
