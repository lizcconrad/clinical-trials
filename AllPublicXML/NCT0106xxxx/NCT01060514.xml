  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of Vinorelbine and Pazopanib that
      can be given together without causing severe side effects. Also, this study will evaluate
      what effects (good and bad) that the treatment has on patients and their cancer.

      This study involves an investigational drug called pazopanib in combination with the
      chemotherapy drug vinorelbine. An investigational drug is a drug that has not been approved
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Vinorelbine has
      been FDA approved to treat patients with NSCLC and breast cancer. Pazopanib is a vascular
      endothelial growth factor inhibitor, which means it may prevent the tumor from growing its
      own blood vessels thereby interfering with the growth of the tumor. Participants in this
      study will be assigned to one of three groups with each group receiving a higher dose of
      vinorelbine and pazopanib than the previous group. Vinorelbine will be given through a needle
      in the vein on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day study treatment cycle. Pazopanib is a pill which
      will be taken by mouth every day during the 21 day study treatment cycle.
