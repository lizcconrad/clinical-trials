    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir
      (Kaletra, a protease inhibitor, PI) when used in combination with maraviroc (Selzentry, an
      HIV entry inhibitor) for the treatment of antiretroviral naïve HIV infected patients. Twenty
      patients will be enrolled and studied for 48 weeks.

      As patients with HIV are living longer it is important to explore antiretroviral treatments
      which may reduce the development of long term complications while preserving future HIV
      treatment options. This trial explores an antiretroviral treatment regimen which does not
      include the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class which is thought to have
      long-term toxicity. This is a non-randomized, open label trial in participants meeting entry
      requirements.

      Participants will be evaluated at screening, baseline,and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 to
      include clinical assessments as well as laboratory assessments.

      An interim analysis will be performed when all patients have reached the week 24 visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has signed and dated approved informed consent form.

          -  There is confirmed laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection (positive ELISA HIV antibody
             test confirmed by Western blot, p24 antigen assay, quantitative HIV-1 RNA assay, or
             HIV culture).

          -  The patient is at least 18 years of age.

          -  ART-naïve, lopinavir/ritonavir susceptible on genotypic testing, CCR5-tropic virus on
             Trofile testing (ESTA).

          -  Negative pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to start of study for women of
             childbearing potential.

             contraception.

          -  Acute hepatitis B or C within 60 days of entry.

          -  Patients harboring preexistent co-receptor CXCR4 tropic or dual-or mixed-tropic HIV.

          -  Patients harboring HIV resistant to lopinavir/ritonavir on genotypic testing.

          -  The presence of decompensated heart failure, myocardial infarction within 1 year,

             or nefazodone.

          -  Patients with concomitant diagnosis of malignancy or cancer other than basal cell
             carcinoma within the past 5 years.

          -  Concomitant use of investigational agents including the use of any investigational
             vaccines.

          -  Any other clinical conditions or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
