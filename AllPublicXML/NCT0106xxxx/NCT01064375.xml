  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a CEA DNA
      immunisation approach in patients with colorectal cancer. The DNA plasmid, tetwtCEA, encodes
      wild type human CEA fused to a tetanus toxoid T helper epitope. The vaccine will be delivered
      using an intradermal electroporation device, Derma Vax (Cyto Pulse Sciences). The following
      will be assessed:

        -  The efficiency of priming immunological responses to CEA by intradermal administration
           of CEA DNA in combination with electroporation.

        -  The efficiency of boosting immunological responses to CEA by intradermal administration
           of CEA DNA in combination with electroporation in subjects already vaccinated with CEA
           DNA.

        -  GM-CSF will be administered to half of the subjects primed with CEA DNA in combination
           with electroporation and any possible adjuvant effects of GM-CSF will be evaluated.
