    <textblock>
      This survey is conducted for preparing application materials for re-examination under the
      Korean Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws and its Enforcement Regulation; its aim is to reconfirm
      the clinical usefulness of VARIVAX through collecting the safety information according to the
      Re-examination Regulation for New Drugs.

    <textblock>
      This post-marketing survey was conducted in the usual routine practice and the investigator
      enrolled participants vaccinated with VARIVAX continuously after study start. The purpose of
      the study was to assess the occurrence of adverse events and to identify factors that may
      affect the safety of the vaccine under real-life, post-marketing conditions. No hypothesis
      testing was conducted in this survey.

    <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, is also an adverse event.
Changes resulting from normal growth and development which do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children, and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time.</description>

          <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, is also an adverse event.
Changes resulting from normal growth and development which do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children, and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time.</description>
