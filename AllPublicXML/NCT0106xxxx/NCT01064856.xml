    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day of first study drug administration) through Week 156 plus 70 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE): results in death or is life-threatening, results in admission or prolongation of hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome. AEs were categorized by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to treatment (probably, possibly, probably not, not related). Please see Adverse Events section below for more details.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Activity at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (last measurement prior to first DB dose), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS was to be used for the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of disease activity (current status). The left end of the VAS scale (0 mm) signifies the absence of symptoms and the right end (100 mm) signifies maximum disease activity. Last observation carried forward (LOCF): missing values were imputed using the last non-missing post-baseline value prior to the missing value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (last measurement prior to first DB dose), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI was to be completed at the designated study visits. The participant was to assess his/her disease activity using the BASDAI which consisted of a VAS scale used to answer 6 questions (Q1 through Q6) pertaining to symptoms experienced by the participant for the past week. Each question on the BASDAI was reported in centimeters (0 [none] to 10 [very severe] with one question's possible answers being in time increments [0 hours to ≥ 2 hours]). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10 cm and was calculated as follows: BASDAI Score = 0.2 × (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5/2 + Q6/2). Lower scores indicate less disease activity. LOCF: Missing value was imputed using the last non-missing post-baseline value prior to missing value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Modified for the Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) Total at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (last measurement prior to first DB dose), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-S is a self-reported measure to assess the physical function and health-related quality of life. The Disability Index (DI) of HAQ-S is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 [without any difficulty] to 3 [unable to do]): Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. Five additional items in the functional status measure were included in the HAQ-S, including carrying heavy packages, sitting for long periods, able to work at a flat topped table, and (if the participant had a driver's license or a car) able to look in the rear view mirror and able to turn head to drive in reverse. The overall score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (three very severe, high-dependency disability). Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement. LOCF: Missing value was imputed using the last non-missing post-baseline value prior to missing value.</description>

          <title>Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)</title>
          <description>The ASDAS is a continuous disease activity score: low score indicates lower disease activity and higher values indicate higher disease activity. The score ranges from 0 to no defined upper limit. It is categorized into 4 disease activity states based on score: inactive disease (&lt; 1.3), moderate (≥ 1.3 to &lt; 2.1), high (≥ 2.1 to ≤ 3.5), and very high (&gt; 3.5). One participant in the Placebo arm did not have a baseline ASDAS assessment.</description>

          <description>The BASDAI consisted of a VAS scale used to answer 6 questions pertaining to symptoms experienced by the participant for the past week. Each question on the BASDAI was reported in centimeters (0 [none] to 10 [very severe] with one question's possible answers being in time increments [0 hours to ≥ 2 hours]). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10 cm. Lower scores indicate less disease activity.</description>

If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE): results in death or is life-threatening, results in admission or prolongation of hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome. AEs were categorized by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to treatment (probably, possibly, probably not, not related).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The BASDAI was to be completed at the designated study visits. The participant was to assess his/her disease activity using the BASDAI which consisted of a VAS scale used to answer 6 questions (Q1 through Q6) pertaining to symptoms experienced by the participant for the past week. Each question on the BASDAI was reported in centimeters (0 [none] to 10 [very severe] with one question's possible answers being in time increments [0 hours to ≥ 2 hours]). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10 cm and was calculated as follows: BASDAI Score = 0.2 × (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5/2 + Q6/2). Lower scores indicate less disease activity. LOCF: Missing value was imputed using the last non-missing post-baseline value prior to missing value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Modified for the Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) Total at Week 12</title>
        <description>The HAQ-S is a self-reported measure to assess the physical function and health-related quality of life. The Disability Index (DI) of HAQ-S is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 [without any difficulty] to 3 [unable to do]): Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. Five additional items in the functional status measure were included in the HAQ-S, including carrying heavy packages, sitting for long periods, able to work at a flat topped table, and (if the participant had a driver's license or a car) able to look in the rear view mirror and able to turn head to drive in reverse. The overall score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (three very severe, high-dependency disability). Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement. LOCF: Missing value was imputed using the last non-missing post-baseline value prior to missing value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Enthesitis Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Assessment of enthesitis was performed in the following 16 domains: left and right (L/R) medial epicondyle; L/R lateral epicondyle; L/R supraspinatus insertion into the greater tuberosity of humerus; L/R greater trochanter; L/R quadriceps insertion into superior border of patella; L/R patellar ligament insertion into inferior pole of patella or tibial tubercle; L/R Achilles tendon insertion into calcaneum; L/R plantar fascia insertion into calcaneum. Tenderness at each site was quantified on a dichotomous basis. Each domain was graded for the presence (1) and absence (0) of tenderness yielding total SPARCC scores ranging from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 16 (worst possible score; 16 sites with tenderness). Participants with non-missing Baseline and at least 1 non-missing post-Baseline value were included in post-Baseline visits. LOCF: missing value was imputed using the last non-missing post-Baseline value prior to missing value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The ASDAS is a continuous disease activity score: low score indicates lower disease activity and higher values indicate higher disease activity. The score ranges from 0 to no defined upper limit. It is categorized into 4 disease activity states based on score: inactive disease (&lt; 1.3), moderate (≥ 1.3 to &lt; 2.1), high (≥ 2.1 to ≤ 3.5), and very high (&gt; 3.5). Clinically important and major improvements in ASDAS are defined as a reduction from Baseline of ≥ 1.1 and ≥ 2.0 points, respectively. Participants with non-missing Baseline and at least 1 non-missing post-Baseline value were included in post-Baseline visits. LOCF: missing value was imputed using the last non-missing post-Baseline value prior to missing value.</description>
