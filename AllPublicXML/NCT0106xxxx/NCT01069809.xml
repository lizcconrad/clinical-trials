    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of AGS-004, an immune
      therapy, for HIV-infected individuals. Safety and effectiveness will be tested while the
      individuals are both taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) medication and interrupting ART
      medication.

          4. HIV VL level ≤ 400 copies/mL for ≥ 2 months prior to Screening.

          5. HIV VL level ≤ 50 copies/mL at Screening.

          6. CD4+ T cell count ≥ 450 cells/mm3 at Screening.

          7. Pre-ART nadir CD4+ T cell counts ≥ 200 cells/mm³.

          8. Availability of an adequate sample of frozen plasma most recently collected (no more
             than 90 days and preferably within 30 days) before starting ART.

         16. Prior history of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining condition.

         17. History or other evidence of severe illness, malignancy, immunodeficiency other than
             HIV, or any other condition that would make the subject unsuitable for the study in
             the opinion of the investigator.
