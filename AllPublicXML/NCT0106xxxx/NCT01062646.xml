      Multimodal music therapy (MT) for children ages 8 to 12 years with anxiety disorders is
      compared to community treatment as usual (TAU). 36 children were randomized either to MT or
      to TAU. Primary outcome is presence of an anxiety disorder at the end of treatment. Secondary
      outcomes are self- and parent-/teacher reported anxiety, co-morbid psychological symptoms,
      and quality of life. Stability of outcome is assessed six months after the end of treatment.
