    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of motivational interviewing in
      promoting maintenance of physical activity in people with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) upon the
      completion of a structured exercise program.

      Participants with T2D who are new graduates of a supervised exercise program will be randomly
      assigned to either standard care (SC) or to standard care and in addition, participate in two
      individual motivational interview (MI) sessions (SC + MI).

      The primary outcome will be change in physical activity behavior assessed by the Godin
      Leisure and Exercise questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will include change in blood glucose
      control (A1C), BMI, six minute walk-test, QoL, and self-efficacy.

      Outcomes will be measured in groups at baseline, end of program, 3 months and 6 months
      post-program.
