  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is often treated with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy.
      Two commonly used treatments are continuous venvenous hemofiltration (CVVH)and continuous
      venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD). CVVH uses convective clearance to remove toxins and solutes
      from the patients circulation, while CVVHD relies on diffusive clearance to remove these same
      toxins/solutes. This study will evaluate which of these two methods is more effective at
      clearing the body of waste/solutes.

      We hypothesize that renal replacement therapy by either modality (hemodialysis or
      hemofiltration; CVVHD or CVVH, respectively) using a modern membrane and higher blood flow
      rates will be associated with similar clearances of both small and middle molecular weight
      solutes. We further believe that continuous renal replacement therapy using CVVHD will be
      associated with decreased clotting events and longer hemofilter survival, as well as improved
      resource utilization (i.e. nursing time, alarms, etc.).

    <description>The NxStage system will be used for CVVH using the NxStage Cartridge Express dialyzer (polyethersulfone membrane). The blood flow rate will be set at 250 cc/min, and decreased at the discretion of the primary nephrologist's assessment of filter pressures and alarms. Replacement fluid will be delivered pre-filter for CVVHthe target effluent flow rate will be 35ml/kg/hr plus desired ultrafiltration (fluid removal). A maximum of 4.5 L/hr effluent will be prescribed to obese or hypercatabolic patients.</description>
