  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we will start by looking for the highest dose of pyrimethamine that
      can be given safely to CLL patients without severe or unmanageable side effects. This dose
      will then be used for a larger Phase II study to assess the efficacy of pyrimethamine for the
      treatment of CLL/SLL. Pyrimethamine is an antibiotic that is used for the treatment of
      certain infections. Previous research studies have shown that pyrimethamine may target a
      protein in tumor cells, called STAT3, which may be important for the growth of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) cells. Pyrimethamine can kill
      CLL/SLL cells in the laboratory, and we are therefore undertaking this study to assess
      whether pyrimethamine will result in clinical benefit or tumor responses in CLL in patients.

      -  Participants will be required to enroll in DFCI Protocol 99-224, the CLL Research
           Consortium Tissue Bank, and DFCI Protocol 01-206, Tissue and Data Collection for
           Research Studies in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies, Bone Marrow Disorders, and
           Normal Donors, or may have blood banked for future use.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days during which time participants will take
           pyrimethamine orally once per day. Since we are looking for the highest dose of the
           study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects,
           not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of study drug.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at specific time points during
           participation in the study: Physical exam, vital signs, blood tests and bone marrow
           biopsy. The participant's tumor will be assessed by CT scans of the chest, abdomen and
           pelvis prior to the start of the study and at the end of the 1st, 3rd and 6th months.

        -  Participants can continue to receive pyrimethamine as long as they do not have side
           effects and their disease does not worsen.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with CLL/SLL based on the standard histologic and immunophenotypic criteria
             described in the WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies, including
             immunophenotypic confirmation that the tumor cells co-express B cell antigens CD19/20
             and CD5. Mantle cell lymphoma should be excluded based on positive staining of the
             tumor cells for CD23, or the absence of staining of the tumor cells for cyclin D1 or
             the absence of t(11;14). This diagnosis should be confirmed at a Dana-Farber/Harvard
             Cancer Center institution within approximately one month after the subject is
             registered.

             CT measurable lesion &gt; approximately 1.5cm, or bone marrow involvement &gt; approximately
             30%

          -  Relapsed after at least one prior purine analogue-containing regimen, or at least two
