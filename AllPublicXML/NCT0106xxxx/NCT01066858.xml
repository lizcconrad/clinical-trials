    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (an
      anti-HIV medication) on the bone health and kidneys of women with HIV during pregnancy and
      while breastfeeding. The study will also look at the changes in overall health, bone health
      and how the kidneys work in the infants of these women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A small number of adults (who are not pregnant) and children who take anti-HIV medications
      develop problems with their kidneys and with the strength of their bones. These problems may
      be more common when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is used. Studies about these bone and
      kidney effects have not been done in pregnant and breastfeeding women and their infants.

      This is a substudy of a larger study (IMPAACT 1077 PROMISE [Promoting Maternal and Infant
      Survival Everywhere]) to evaluate the safety of anti-HIV medications used in pregnancy and
      during breastfeeding. Only participants in the larger study randomly assigned to receive
      maternal tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or no maternal TDF during pregnancy or during
      breastfeeding will be enrolled in this substudy.

      This substudy will look at two groups of participants:

        -  An antepartum exposure group to look at the effects of TDF during pregnancy

        -  A postpartum exposure group to look at the effects of TDF during breastfeeding

      All mother-infant pairs in the substudy will be followed for 74 weeks after delivery. During
      this time, the women and their infants will have medical checkups and tests. The tests will
      include tests of blood, urine, cord blood, and breast milk. Some of the women and infants
      will have a special x-ray called a dual energy e-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to measure
      bone strength. The timing of the tests—at enrollment, at delivery, at 6, 10, 26, or 74
      weeks—will vary dependent on which part of this substudy women and infants are enrolled in.
      Those in charge of the substudy will try to schedule medical visits and tests at the same
      time as tests scheduled for the larger IMPAACT 1077 study.
