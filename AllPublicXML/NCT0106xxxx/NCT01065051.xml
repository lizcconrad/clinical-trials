    <measure>Change in Peak Power Index at Rest</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and 1 hour after administration of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The peak power index is a calculated hemodynamic parameter. It is derived from the directly measured parameters mean systolic arterial pressure (SAPmean) and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWPmean). These 2 parameters are acquired during a right heart catheterization. The peak power index is calculated from the maximal power (which also takes the calculated parameter cardiac output into account) divided by the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV). Formula: Peak Power Index = (SAPmean - PCWPmean)*CO [cardiac output]*16.667/LVEDV</description>
