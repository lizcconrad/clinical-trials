    <textblock>
      This study involves pilot testing of a modified version of a proven treatment for mental
      illness. The treatment, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used to treat more than 100,000
      Americans yearly. ECT is the most effective treatment for major depression, a disorder that
      affects approximately 5 to 8 percent of the adult US population yearly. It is also an
      effective treatment for mania and mixed mood states associated with bipolar disorder and
      schizoaffective disorder.

      The aim of ECT is to induce a seizure, which is thought to be responsible for both its
      therapeutic and its adverse cognitive effects. The proposed modification consists of reducing
      the ECT electrical stimulus dose below the amount necessary to induce seizures so that
      adverse cognitive effects, such as confusion and memory problems, are minimized.

      The investigators intend to determine whether ECT-related cognitive impairment can be reduced
      without diminishing the therapeutic effect of ECT. In addition to distressing patients,
      ECT-related cognitive impairment has significant public health consequences. These include
      increased morbidity and mortality among severely ill individuals who refuse ECT due to
      concern over its adverse cognitive effects as well as increased falls among the elderly
      receiving ECT. Elderly patients are far more likely to receive ECT and are also more
      vulnerable to ECT-related cognitive impairment. They often require hospitalization for ECT
      and a longer hospital stay with greater spacing of treatments to minimize adverse cognitive
      effects.

      The hypothesis driving this research is that electrical brain stimulation applied in the same
      manner as standard ECT, but at a lower dose, can have therapeutic effects and fewer adverse
      cognitive effects without inducing seizures. This hypothesis is based on the following: 1)
      the investigators clinical experience of patients who have improved with ECT despite having
      only one or no seizure, 2) animal studies showing that electrical brain stimulation can
      induce antidepressant like effects in animals without inducing seizures, 3) reports from the
      1950s that &quot;subconvulsive&quot; and &quot;nonconvulsive&quot; electrotherapy was effective for some
      patients, and 4) the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of the use of
      transcranial magnetic stimulation --a technique that uses a magnet to induce an electrical
      current in the brain without inducing seizures--for treatment of medication resistant major
      depression.

      The primary aim of the research is to conduct a proof of concept, open trial investigating
      the therapeutic efficacy and safety of nonconvulsive electrotherapy (NET). The investigators
      plan to enroll 16 subjects, which is the minimum number of subjects needed to show that the
      therapeutic effect of NET is better than would be expected of placebo. If the investigators
      show that the therapeutic effect of NET exceeds that expected of placebo and does not induce
      significant cognitive impairment, then the investigators will go on to propose a blind,
      randomized, controlled clinical trial that more definitively tests the investigators'
      hypothesis. The investigators would use the information gathered from the pilot trial to
      estimate the number of subjects needed to definitively test the efficacy and safety of NET.

      The secondary aim of the study is to find out whether NET affects blood levels of
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is a substance that is important to the
      nervous system and may be related to how treatments like ECT or possibly NET improve
      symptoms. The investigators would draw a blood sample before and after NET treatment to
      assess this.

Subjects responded to specific questions regarding these topics before and after their course of NET treatment. Subjects were scored based on the percent of responses post-NET treatment that correctly matched their responses prior to NET treatment. The score range is 0 to 100%. The higher the percent, the less impaired is the autobiographical memory.</description>

        <description>The Autobiographical Memory Inventory Short Form (AMI-S ) assesses effects on retrograde memory for autobiographical information including information related to a family member, recent travel, events of last New Year's eve, events of last birthday, employment information, and events of last non-psychiatric illness and its treatment. Subjects responded to specific questions regarding these topics before and after their course of NET treatment. Subjects were scored based on the percent of responses post-NET treatment that correctly matched their responses prior to NET treatment. The score range is 0 to 100%. The higher the percent, the less impaired is the autobiographical memory.</description>
