  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder haracterised by
      abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits,while the mechanism is
      still not understood.Recent advances have conceptualized the faecal supernatants of
      diarrhoea-predominant IBS have a substantially higher serine protease activity, while in
      china,almost no studies have reported about protease activity in IBS.
