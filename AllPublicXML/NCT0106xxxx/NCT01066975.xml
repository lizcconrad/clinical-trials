  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soldiers and recreational backpackers are often required to carry heavy loads on their body
      during military operations or hiking. Despite the advances in backpack design, the loads
      carried by soldiers still impose an extreme physiological strain (soft tissue deformation)
      which frequently results in discomfort, pain,musculoskeletal injuries, and loss sensorimotor
      function.

      In the current study, characterization of the pressures, evaluation of the deformations of
      the soft tissues, specifically the fat, muscles, Brachial plexus and subclavian vessels
      applied on the shoulder while sitting with a heavy backpack will performed. The data acquired
      in the current trials will be used for development of a finite element (FE) 3D shoulder
      model. The purpose is to better understand the mechanical loads that are being transferred to
      the underlying tissue below the shoulder straps during walking/marching with a backpack.
      During the 2nd phase of this project, data collected during this research will be used to
      develop gear that will alleviate the strain on the shoulders, prevent injury, and enhance
      performance.

      Hypothesis

        -  High focal strain (hot-spots) on the shoulder tissue that are observed with the pressure
           mapping will be observed also in the MR scans.

        -  The strain at those hot-spots can be reduced by personal-geometry adjusted straps.

      Volunteers

      Five young (18-30 yrs), healthy, and fit males will participate in this study.

      Trials design

        1. MR Scans- The scan will be performed for analysis of personal shoulder anatomy, and will
           be used for developing a 3D FE model. The sagittal view will be used to develop the 3D
           model. The coronal and axial sectional views will be used to assess the deformations
           applied on the shoulder tissue. The scan will then be repeated while carrying a 25 kg
           standard commercial backpack while sitting in the same position, for the assessment of
           shoulder girdle tissues deformations. Time estimation for each scan is 40 min (80 min
           total). The subjects are not required to carry the backpack prior to those scans.

        2. Static pressure measurement- each volunteer will be asked to sit for 30 seconds while
           carrying the 25 kg backpack. During this session, pressure will be measured using a
           pressure mapping pad (Sensor Products Inc., USA) placed between the shoulder strap and
           the underlying tissue.

      The maximal total participation time of each volunteer will be 2 hours total (inside and
      outside the MR).

      Data acquired in the current trials will be used for the development of a FE (finite element)
      3D shoulder model. MR scans will be utilized for composing geometry and for the boundary
      conditions assessment (strain magnitude). Pressure measurements will be used as boundary
      conditions (stress magnitude).

      MR scans and pressure measurements will be performed in the Sheba medical center facilities.

        Five young (18-30 yrs), healthy, and fit males will participate in this study. Prior to
        signing a consent form, the PI will explain to the subjects about the MRI that they are
        about to participate in if they will decide to sign including all the discomforts involved
        in this study. For subjects that don't have contraindications for MRI there are no reported
        risks.

        The subjects will be informed that each one of them is free to decide, and is free to stop
        his participation any time he wishes to.
