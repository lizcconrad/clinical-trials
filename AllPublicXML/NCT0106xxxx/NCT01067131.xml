  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pevion Biotech develops a state-of-the-art vaccine against recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis
      (RVVC) caused by the pathogenic form of Candida albicans especially in pre-menopausal women
      of childbearing age with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. This study is
      designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine, administered by two
      different routes (intramuscular and intravaginal) as primary endpoint. Immunogenicity will be
      evaluated as secondary endpoint.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females aged between 18 and 45 years.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the volunteer.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and/or clinical
             examination and/or gynecological examination before entering the study.

          -  Body Mass Index between 18.0 and 30.0.

          -  A negative pregnancy test and an adequate contraception until at least 4 weeks after
             the last vaccination of the primary vaccination course. Adequate contraception means
             use of a physician-prescribed oral hormonal agent AND use of condoms (without
             spermicidal agents) at the same time. Progesterone-only contraceptives are not
             suitable due to the lack of a regular menstrual cycle.

          -  Availability for the duration of the study and willingness to attend all scheduled
             visits.

          -  No vaginal practices other than receptive intercourse with male or use of sanitary
             tampons during menses.

          -  Negative culture for any Candida species before visit 2. Subjects with a positive
             culture will be treated and the Candida culture will be repeated. They will be
             eligible if a negative culture result is available prior to visit 2 (first
             vaccination).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspect history of cervico-vaginal malignancy or abnormality discovered at
             time of screening. Ovarectomised and hysterectomised women are excluded from the
             study.

          -  Presence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection as detected by PCR
             at screening visit.

          -  Presence of bacterial vaginosis (assessed by the Amsel criteria and bacterial culture)
             for group 1 and 2 at screening visit; at days 0±2, 28±2 and 56±2, for group 3 and 4 at
             screening and by Amsel criteria only at days 0±2 and 28±2.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine within 30 days preceding
             the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period and safety
             follow-up.

          -  Planned use of any registered vaccine other than study vaccine and planned use of
             immunoglobulin-based therapy during the immunization phase until 14 days after the
             last immunization (Day 0 to day 70 for group 1 and 2; Day 0 to Day 56 for group 3 and
             4) and for groups 1 and 2 from application of booster vaccine dose until 14 days after
             administration.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first vaccination until
             30 days after the last vaccination of the immunization period. Equally the above
             applies to the period 30 days prior until 30 days after the booster vaccination.

          -  Any therapy or medications via vaginal route 7 days prior to first vaccination and in
             the period from first dose of study vaccine until the last safety visit (Groups 1 and
             2: Day 140±2; Groups 3 and 4: Day 70±2). Equally the above applies to the period 7
             days prior to booster vaccination until end of study (Groups 1 and 2).

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days) of
             immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the
             first vaccine dose. (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, &gt;
             0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.)

          -  Samples obtained at screening visit show:

               1. a clinically significant amount of protein and/or haemoglobin in the urine sample

               2. a clinically significant abnormality in the haematological or biochemicals assays

               3. positive antibody assays for Hepatitis B and/or C and/or HIV

          -  Any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period (except oral hormonal
             contraceptives)

          -  Any confirmed or suspected acquired immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition,
             including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or history of congenital or
             hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine or component used during the manufacturing process of the vaccine like
             eggs and chick proteins.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrollment. {Acute disease is defined as the presence of
             a moderate or severe illness with or without fever. All vaccines can be administered
             to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection
             with or without low-grade febrile illness, i.e., temperature &lt;38°C (&lt;100.4°F)}.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, blood disorder or immune dysfunction as determined by physical
             examination or laboratory screening tests.

          -  Acute or chronic diabetes.

          -  History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or intravenous drug abuse.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.
