  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare standard Behavior Therapy (BT), BT plus Meal
      Replacements (MR) and a condition focusing on the nutritional changes to the home food
      environment (HFE) on weight loss, weight loss maintenance, nutritional composition of the
      diet and psychosocial outcomes. A second aim is to determine the degree to which the specific
      targets of the experimental interventions do in fact change in the anticipated direction
      during the intervention and to evaluate whether such changes might account for improvements
      in weight loss maintenance. This study is important because it could provide the first
      evidence that the current standard of care for obesity lifestyle treatment could be improved
      by the addition of MRs or a program of comprehensive nutritional change.

    <description>Behavioral treatment strategies will be utilized to facilitate adherence to the treatment goals in all three treatments. Participants in the BT condition will receive only the BT intervention. Strategies that will be emphasized are listed below:
Self monitoring
Stimulus control
Changing eating behaviors
Goal setting
Problem solving
Social support
Cognitive restructuring
Relapse prevention</description>

    <description>The BT +MR condition will implement behavioral treatment strategies in a way that is nearly identical to that of the BT condition. However, participants in this condition also will use MRs during weight loss and weight loss maintenance.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this condition will be informed about the evidence indicating that the availability, structure and composition of foods they encounter or seek out in their daily lives will play a major role in determining their ability to maintain the weight they lose. We will present the treatment as an opportunity to make numerous changes to their &quot;personal food environment&quot; involving the variety, energy density, nutritional composition, and portion size of the foods they encounter in every day life.
The Nutritrol condition is comprised of several components:
Food structure
Energy density
Reduce variety of foods high in energy density and increase variety of foods low in energy density
Protein intake
Controlling the personal food environment
