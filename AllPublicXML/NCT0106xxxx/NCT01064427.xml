      The aim of this study is to identify the determinants of cancer-related fatigue, and the
      long-term effect of the different adjuvants treatments will be explored. A prospective
      longitudinal study in women diagnosed for the first time with stage I-III breast cancer and
      who have undergone surgery, has been designed to meet the study aims.
