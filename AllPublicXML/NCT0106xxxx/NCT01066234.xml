      This study propose adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy vs chemotherapy alone in completely
      resected microscopic N2 NSCLC

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer are diagnosed with stage
      IIIA-N2 disease. However, this subgroup is heterogeneous, with lymph nodes that are only
      microscopically invaded to those that are radiologically visible with bulky ipsilateral
      mediastinal lymph node involvement. Surgical resection in selected patients results in 5-year
      survival rates of 7-24%.

      The standard treatment for locally advanced clinical N2 disease is definitive concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy or induction chemotherapy (± radiation) followed by operation. However, in
      some patients, N2 status could be confirmed only after curative operation without any
      evidence of N2 diseases through preoperative evaluation methods (CT, PET, mediastinoscopy).
      We usually define those N2 disease found only after curative operation as microscopic N2, and
      do adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. However, little data
      about the adjuvant therapy for completely resected N2 disease have been available, Hence, we
      propose a randomized phase II study of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy vs chemotherapy
      alone in completely resected microscopic N2 NSCLC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIA(N2) NSCLC that was completely
             resected by lobectomy, bilobectomy, pneumonectomy, or sleeve lobectomy through any
             incision (thoracoscopic or video-assisted thorascopic surgery approaches were
             acceptable)

          2. &quot;Pathologic N2&quot; disease (involvement of N2 nodes can only be determined at the time of
             surgical exploration or postoperative pathologic analysis)

          3. Age ≥18years

          4. No known residual disease (negative resection margin and no extracapsular invasion of
             lymph node metastasis)

          5. ECOG performance status of 0 to 1

          6. No previous chemotherapy or RT

          7. Adequate organ function as evidenced by the following; Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5
             x 109/L; platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L; total bilirubin ≤1.5 UNL; AST and/or ALT &lt; 5 UNL;
             creatinine clearance ≥ 50mL/min
