  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical response to daily Indinavir oral
      administration in association with a conventional chemotherapy based on cycles of systemic
      Vinblastine +/- Bleomycin in patients affected by advanced classical (non HIV-associated)
      Kaposi's sarcoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been recently demonstrated that HIV protease inhibitors (HIV-PI) exert direct
      anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor actions by blocking endothelial and tumor cell invasion and
      matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity. Based on this data, we have started a phase II trial
      for the treatment of HIV-negative patients with CKS with the HIV-PI Indinavir. Indinavir was
      well tolerated and induced KS regression/improvement in early-stage disease, and prolonged
      stabilization in late-stage KS. Response required high plasma drug concentrations indicating
      a &quot;therapeutic&quot; drug threshold, and was associated with a decrease of circulating endothelial
      cells (CEC), basic fibroblast growth factor and MMP2 plasma levels. However, large, confluent
      tumor masses were generally not responsive (Monini et al, AIDS 2009). Thus, advanced KS may
      benefit at best by treatment with IND upon tumor debulking by conventional chemotherapy.

    <description>Treatment consists in an induction phase where daily Indinavir (800 mg x 2/die, orally) will be combined together with systemic Vinblastine (10 mg intravenously) +/- Bleomycin (15 mg intramuscularly) in cycles administered every 3 weeks. As maximal response will occur, patients will undergo 2 additional Vinblastine +/- Bleomycin (consolidation) cycles upon continuous treatment with Indinavir. This will be followed by a maintenance phase with Indinavir alone (800 mg x 3/die, orally) in responder patients.</description>
