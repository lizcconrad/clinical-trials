  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to find out whether successful treatment of obstructive
      sleep apnea makes people look less sleepy, for example by reducing swelling or dark circles
      under the eyes. In addition, this study will help determine whether facial photographs may be
      used to help identify patients who should be tested for sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main symptom of nocturnal sleep disorders is often excessive daytime sleepiness. Although
      sleepiness can be a major contributor to decreased quality of life, and even mortality,
      patients frequently grow habituated to their sleepiness, ignoring it and any underlying
      disorder. One scarcely explored potential consequence that could motivate patients to address
      sleep disorders is a sleepy facial appearance. No peer-reviewed literature, to our knowledge,
      has explored whether inadequate or insufficient sleep actually causes changes facial
      appearance. No published literature has examined the extent to which treatment for sleep
      disorders might improve such facial changes, and perhaps motivate patients to treat their
      sleep disorders.

      To address these questions in a preliminary manner, therefore, the investigators propose to
      use cutting-edge photographic technology to assess subtle changes in facial appearance. The
      investigators will recruit 20 sleepy adult patients who are diagnosed with obstructive sleep
      apnea, an ideal disease model in which subjects can be tested before and after alleviation of
      severe sleepiness by home use of continuous positive airway pressure. Results of this pilot
      study could show for the first time that successful treatment of a chronic sleep disorder
      improves facial features commonly perceived as an undesirable sign of sleepiness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, age 18-65

          -  Recently diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, confirmed by polysomnography (sleep
             study)

          -  Experiencing daytime sleepiness, based on Epworth Sleepiness Scale

          -  Scheduled for a positive airway pressure (PAP) titration study (CPAP or BiPAP)

          -  Willing to use CPAP or BiPAP at pressures prescribed by the treating physician

          -  Willing to have facial photographs taken before treatment and 2-4 months after nightly
             use of CPAP or BiPAP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with other sleep, medical or psychiatric disorders that might limit the
             effectiveness of PAP treatment (such as morbid obesity, emphysema, and
             neurodegenerative disorders)

          -  Conditions that may cause daytime sleepiness (such as narcolepsy, primary insomnia,
             seizure disorders, or major depression)

          -  Use of medications or herbal remedies that affect sleep and behavior

          -  History of facial plastic or reconstructive surgery or Botox injections or plans to
             undergo these types of treatments prior to completing the second study visit
