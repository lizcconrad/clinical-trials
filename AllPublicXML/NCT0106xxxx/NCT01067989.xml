  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-dose metronomic(LDM)chemotherapy as well as anti-inflammatory agents and bisphosphonates
      have shown anti-angiogenic properties on tumor vasculature.

      This study is meant to test the therapeutic potential of an anti-angiogenic treatment
      strategy by combining all these agents for metastatic breast cancer patients.
