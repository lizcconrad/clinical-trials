      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new type of exposure- and
      acceptance-based smoking cessation treatment vs. standard behavioral smoking cessation
      treatment, in conjunction with the use of the transdermal nicotine patch. In both treatments,
      participants will receive one 60-minute individual session, seven 2-hour group sessions and
      two individual brief telephone contacts over an eight-week period. Both treatments include 8
      weeks of transdermal nicotine patch, which will begin at the time of quitting smoking and
      will continue after the treatment sessions have ended. Participants will provide follow-up
      data with regard to their smoking status through a one-year follow-up period.
