      The Computer-Assisted Self-administration of Ethanol (CASE)will be administered twice, at the
      ages 18 and 20, in a prospective study of 80 adolescents living in the Dresden area. The
      sample will be recruited for a differential family history of alcoholism (FHA) and gender,
      with inventories of alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms and personal recent drinking history
      (RDH) obtained prior to each CASE session.
