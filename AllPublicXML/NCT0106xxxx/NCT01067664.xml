  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study attempts to investigate the potential role of serum progesterone
      levels on the day of hCG administration (thus, the end of the follicular phase) on the
      probability of pregnancy, in patients undergoing IVF with the use of GnRH antagonists and
      recombinant gonadotrophins.

      There has been evidence, that increased serum levels of progesterone are associated with a
      decreased probability of pregnancy after IVF.

      This study will attempt to explore the role of progesterone on the outcome of IVF, by closely
      monitoring its levels during the late follicular phase.
