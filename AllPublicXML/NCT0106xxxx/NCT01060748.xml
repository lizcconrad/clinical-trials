  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study about an experimental (investigational) vaccine called ACE527.
      ACE527 is a vaccine that is being made to prevent disease from a germ called enterotoxigenic
      Escherichia coli (ETEC). This germ causes diarrhea, largely in children living in developing
      countries and in travelers to those countries. One purpose of this study is to see if the
      vaccine is safe and develops an immune response. Another purpose is to see if it prevents
      people from getting sick when exposed to the ETEC germ. This ETEC germ is also experimental
      (investigational).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II vaccination and challenge
      study designed to assess the protective efficacy of the ACE 527 vaccine, as well as collect
      expanded safety and immunogenicity data. The study will be carried out in two phases. In the
      initial vaccination phase, up to 72 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either ACE527
      or placebo on an outpatient basis. Vaccine and placebo preparations will be given orally.
      Following vaccination, subjects will be followed as out-patients for safety using diary card
      surveillance, for vaccine shedding by qualitative stool culture (i.e. presence or absence)
      and for the development of local and systemic antibody responses to the ACE527 vaccine
      strains. In the subsequent inpatient challenge phase, up to 56 vaccinated subjects will be
      admitted as inpatients and challenged with the ETEC strain, H10407. The challenge dose will
      be administered orally.After challenge, subjects will be monitored for diarrhea and other
      signs/symptoms of enteric illness by daily medical checks, vital sign determinations, grading
      and weighing of all stools. Monitoring for fecal shedding of the challenge ETEC strain H10407
      will occur daily, after challenge, while in-patient. Local and systemic antibody responses to
      the challenge ETEC strain H10407 will also be assessed. All subjects will be treated with
      Abx.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Male or female age ≥18 and ≤ 50 years.

          -  General good health, without clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities per clinical judgment of PI.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test before first (visit V0) and before challenge (visit C0)
             for female subjects of childbearing potential. Females of childbearing potential must
             agree to use an efficacious hormonal or barrier method of birth control during the
             study. Abstinence is acceptable. Female subjects unable to bear children must have
             this documented (e.g. tubal ligation or hysterectomy) or must have negative pregnancy
             tests.

          -  Willingness to participate in the study after all aspects of the protocol have been
             explained and written informed consent obtained.

          -  Completion of a training session and demonstrated comprehension of the protocol
             procedures, knowledge of ETEC-associated illness, and by passing a written
             examination.

          -  Availability for the study duration, including all planned follow-up visits.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Presence of a significant medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the
             investigator precludes participation in the study. Some medical conditions which are
             adequately treated and stable would not preclude entry into the study. These
             conditions might include stable asthma controlled with inhalers or mild hypertension
             stably controlled with a single agent.

          -  Significant abnormalities in screening hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis as
             determined by PI or PI in consultation with the MM and sponsor.

          -  Presence in the serum of HIV antibody, HBsAg, or HCV antibody.

          -  Evidence of IgA deficiency (serum IgA &lt; 7 mg/dl or limit of detection of assay).

          -  Evidence of current excessive alcohol consumption or drug dependence.

          -  Evidence of impaired immune function.

          -  BMI &lt;19, &gt;34

          -  Recent vaccination or receipt of an investigational product (within 30 days before
             vaccination).

          -  Intention to donate blood or blood products for one month following the completion of
             study participation (note: The Red Cross will not allow blood donations for 1 year
             following participation in an investigational research study).

          -  Any other criteria which, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the ability
             of the subject to participate in the study, the safety of the study, or the results of
             the study

          -  Working as a food handler, in child-care or as a healthcare worker with direct patient
             contact.

          -  Have household contacts who are &lt;2 years old or &gt;80 years old or infirm or
             immunocompromised (for reasons including corticosteroid therapy, HIV infection, cancer
             chemotherapy, or other chronic debilitating disease).

          -  Abnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 per week or more than 3 per day).

          -  Known allergy to two of the following antibiotics: quinolones,
             trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and penicillin.

          -  Symptoms consistent with Traveler's Diarrhea concurrent with travel to countries where
             ETEC infection is endemic (most of the developing world) within two years prior to
             dosing, OR planned travel to endemic countries during the length of the study.

          -  Vaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or LT toxin within 3 years prior to
             dosing.

          -  Use of antibiotics during the 7 days before dosing or proton pump inhibitors, H2
             blockers or antacids within 48 hours prior to dosing.

          -  History of diarrhea in the 7 days prior to vaccination (outpatient diarrhea is defined
             as ≥ 3 unformed loose stools in 24 hours).
