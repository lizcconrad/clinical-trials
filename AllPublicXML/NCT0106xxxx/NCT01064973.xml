      Study 22003, &quot;An Open-Label, Flexible-Dose Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerability of
      STX209 for Treatment of Irritability in Subjects With Autism Spectrum Disorders(ASD)&quot;
      currently is evaluating the efficacy of STX209 (R-baclofen) for management of typical problem
      behaviors, such as irritability and aggression, in subjects with ASD. This study (22007) will
      enter subjects who complete Study 22003 into a long-term, open-label study.The open-label
      extension protocol will provide necessary data on the long-term safety and tolerability of
      STX209 among subjects with ASD who receive treatment under conditions more closely reflective
      of their general medical care.

    <description>A flexible dose titration will be utilized during the first four weeks to define the optimal titrated dose (OTD) for each subject. Investigators will use clinical judgment to adjust doses to the oral OTD. The starting dose will be 1 mg BID. The dose may be increased every four to five days to 2 mg BID, 3 mg BID, 5 mg BID and then 10 mg BID</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have completed all scheduled visits in protocol 22003 and have shown they can
             adequately follow the protocol, with sufficient medical justification to continue on
             open-label treatment with STX209, as assessed by the principal investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study,
             confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their own well-being.

          -  The occurrence or continuation of any adverse event or condition during study 22003
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, should exclude the subject from
