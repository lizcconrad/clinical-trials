      This phase I study plan is divided in the following four phases:

        -  Eligibility Screen Phase (week -4 to -1): Following written informed consent patients
           with metastatic melanoma (AJCC stage III/IV with unresectable disease) will undergo an
           eligibility screen (incl. blood analysis and PET/CT-scan).

        -  TriMix-DC Vaccine Manufacturing Phase (week I to IV): eligible patients will undergo a
           leucapheresis (15 liter of venous blood) for the preparation of autologous TriMix-DC
           vaccine. Vaccine preparations will be manufactured and quality-controlled (during an
           interval of 4 weeks following the leucapheresis) and released for patient administration
           if the TriMix-DC preparation fulfills the predefined quality requirements.

        -  TriMix-DC Vaccine Administration Phase (Week 1 to 24): 4 weeks after the leucapheresis
           patients will initiate therapeutic vaccination with the TriMix-DC vaccine by IV and ID
           administration. The vaccines will be administered at 4 different visits that will be
           separated with an interval of 2 weeks. At each vaccination a total of 12.106 DC per
           antigen will be administered.

        -  Patients will be allocated to three different cohorts:

             -  The first cohort will receive 10% of TriMix-DC by iv and 90% by id injection.

             -  The second cohort 25% by iv and 75% by id injection.

             -  The third cohort 50% by iv and 50% by id injection.

        -  During the week following the administration of the fourth vaccine (= week 8), a
           DTH-test and punch biopsy of the injection site will be performed as well as a second
           leucapheresis (for the purpose of immuno-monitoring) and tumor evaluation (by PET-CT).

        -  A fifth vaccine will be administered and a repeat tumor staging performed in week 16 (=
           8w after the fourth vaccine).

        -  End of study visit: Patients will perform an &quot;end of study visit&quot; 8 weeks after the
           fifth vaccine (= week 24) as well as a new tumor evaluation (PET/CT).

        -  Follow-up Phase: survival data will be obtained until 3 years after the initiation of
           vaccine therapy or the time of death.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able and willing to give valid written informed consent before undergoing any
             study-related activities.

          2. Patients with histological documentation of AJCC stage III or IV melanoma of the skin,
             mucosa, eye or unknown primary.

          3. Unable to undergo resection of all metastatic disease.

          4. Negative serology for HBV, HCV, HIV and Syphilis. If positive results for HepB or
