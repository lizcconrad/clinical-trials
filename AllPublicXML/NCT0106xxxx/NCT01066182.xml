  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether DHA (in a daily dose of 600 mg.) will
      improve the behaviour and learning of normal children aged 7-9 years in mainstream state
      schools who are underperforming according to nationally standardized tests.

      The study has two stages, as its primary aim is to find out whether there is a real link
      between children's fatty acid status and their reading and behaviour. Previous reviews have
      stated the importance of objective measures, as did our referees.

      We will aim to address this by using well validated tests of reading and behaviour, and
      comparing results from these with children's fatty acid status as assessed from a pinprick
      blood sample. In Stage 1 we will primarily aim to establish the degree of association between
      fatty acid status and reading and behaviour. Secondarily, we will look at whether the
      children who have a higher DHA status have better sleep, and whether in turn they have better
      reading and/or behaviour, as previous work has suggested this.

      In Stage 2 we aim to carry out a randomised trial where children will be given either DHA or
      a taste− and appearance−matched dummy capsule for 16 weeks. Neither the children, parents nor
      the researchers will know which children will get which treatment until the study is over.
