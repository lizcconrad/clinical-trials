      The objective of this study is to evaluate the bone ingrowth after implantation of the study
      device. This study will also document any device-related surgical complications or adverse
      radiographic observations. Improvement in pain, function, and health economic data will be
      compared with improvements documented with other joint systems.

      The purpose of the current investigation is to assess the bone ingrowth after implantation
      with a modular, short hip stem using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). The intended
      use of this product is for patients with non-inflammatory and inflammatory degenerative joint
      disease who require a primary total hip replacement.
