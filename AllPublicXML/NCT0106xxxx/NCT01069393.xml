    <textblock>
      The best format for the delivery of structured education for adults with Type 1 diabetes is
      unclear. Currently some hospitals invite their patients to attend a 5 day outpatient course
      run over one week (Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE)). Other centres offer 1 day a
      week for 3 to 5 weeks. We aim to find out whether or not the benefit of benefits are the same
      then it would mean that the course could routinely be offered to patients in either format,
      thus allowing more patient choice and flexibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DAFNE (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating) course is a 1-week structured education course
      teaching skills in insulin use and dietary freedom to individuals with Type 1 diabetes. At
      the moment, we do not understand enough about why some people get more out of the DAFNE
      programmes than others. Currently DAFNE is always taught over 1 week. We aim to find out
      whether or not the benefit of DAFNE is the same whether it is delivered over 5 consecutive
      days, or one day a week for 5 consecutive weeks. If the benefits are the same then it would
      mean that the course could routinely be offered to patients in either format, thus allowing
      more patient choice and flexibility. At present there have been no RCTs to address

      Approximately 170 people will take part in this study over the next 2 years. Half the people
      who participate will be allocated to attend a DAFNE course over 5 consecutive days, and the
      other halfwill attend one day a week for 5 consecutive weeks. We will perform routine
      biomedical assessments as part of the DAFNE programme and normal diabetes care (e.g. HbA1c (a
      measure of long-term blood glucose control), weight, blood pressure, blood biochemistry), and
      ask patients to recall hypoglycaemic (low blood sugar) events. We will also ask participants
      to fill in some research questionnaires, they will take 45-60 minutes to fill in each time.
      They will include questions about their diabetes, quality of life, well-being and diabetes
      knowledge. These assessments will be made at 3 time pointsÍ¾ baseline, 6 and 12 months.

      The main outcome measure is change in HbA1c, with the other biomedical and psychosocial
      parameters being of secondary importance. These evaluations will help us develop the DAFNE
      programme further and inform us how best to deliver the course in the future.
