    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a blood test to determine which patients are at risk for
      pre-cancerous colon polyps (ACPs: Advanced Colon Polyps). The telomere length of peripheral
      blood lymphocytes (PBLs) can be measured from a blood sample. Mechanistic pathways and the
      investigator's preliminary data support PBL telomere length as a biomarker for ACPs. The
      long-term goal of this project is to decrease deaths from colon cancer by using a blood test
      to target colonoscopy for those patients who are at high risk for pre-cancerous polyps.

      Telomeres are the repetitive DNA sequences that cap both ends of chromosomes. Shortening of
      peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) telomeres has been associated with renal and other cancers.
      The investigators' preliminary data shows an association between shorter PBL telomere length
      and ACPs.

      I. Specific Aims

        1. Develop a DNA and data repository from individuals with advanced colon polyps (ACPs) and
           controls

        2. Confirm that individuals 50 to 60 years of age with ACPs tend to have shorter peripheral
           blood lymphocyte (PBL) telomeres than those without ACPs

        3. Identify a potential optimal PBL telomere length cut-off to differentiate between
           individuals with ACPs and those without for evaluation in a larger scale study

      The over reaching long term goal is to decrease disease and death from colorectal cancer
      (CRC) using a biomarker strategy to target colonoscopy to those at higher risk.

        Most subjects will be recruited at the time of a clinic visit in primary care, community
        internal medicine, executive international physicals, and/or during a pre-colonoscopy visit
        in the GI Department or GI Laboratory. The ACP subjects will be identified primarily from
        those referred for ACP removal (EMR) and secondarily from those having screening
        colonoscopy.
