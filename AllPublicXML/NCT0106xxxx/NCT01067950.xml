  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current medical therapies are not able to prevent progression of established macroproteinuira
      (i.e. diabetic nephropathy) to end-stage renal failure in type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetic
      patients. In this setting, proteinuria is a major risk factor for mortality. Pancreas
      transplantation, on the contrary, can revert diabetic nephropathy and thereby prevent
      end-stage chronic renal failure, with theoretically lower risk of death as compared to
      current medical therapies.The main objective of this study is to assess superiority of
      isolated pancreas transplantation versus intensive exogenous insulin therapy in type 1
      diabetic patients with overt diabetic nephropathy and mildly reduced renal function. The
      primary endpoint is a composite efficacy/failure end-point including: patient mortality and
      renal function impairment during 5 years in patients with badly controlled diabetes and
      nephropathy resisting to up-to-date nephroprotective therapies.Main secondary objectives are
      safety and efficacy of both regimens, including proteinuria and renal histology evaluation,
      metabolic control and quality of life, acute and chronic extrarenal complications of
      diabetes, pancreas survival and all risks related to the transplant procedure (anaesthesia,
      surgery and immunosuppression side-effects) and to the intensive insulin therapy management.
