  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dose
      of ARQ 197 given in combination with erlotinib as primary endpoints in patients with
      advanced/recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer. The pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor
      activity of ARQ 197 administered alone or in combination with erlotinib will also be
      determined as secondary endpoints.

    <measure>Dose-Limiting Toxicity in the combination of tivantinib and erlotinib</measure>
    <time_frame>DLT observation period started from the day of first single agent treatment to the day after the continuous combination treatment for 29 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Tivantinib was treated once as a single agent on Day 1. After 2 days of interruption, dayly treatments of the combination started.</description>

    <measure>Plasma concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters of ARQ 197 and Erlotinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Plasma sample correction at pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12 and 24 hours on Day 1; at pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12 hours on the day of the first comnibation treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma concentration of tivantinib was measured on both Day 1 and the first day of the combination. Plasma concentration of erlotinib was also measured on the first day of the combination.</description>
