    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether neoadjuvant administration of Sunitinib reduces
      the size of the primary kidney tumor in patients with metastatic disease undergoing
      cytoreductive surgery. The study will also assess the safety of neoadjuvant Sunitinib,
      objective response rate, respectability of primary tumor, quality of life, and survival
      advantages.

      Primary objectives :

      1. Response rate of primary tumor based on RECIST criteria

      Secondary objectives :

        1. Resectability based on R0 resection rate (negative margin)

        2. Toxicities of therapy with neoadjuvant Sunitinib in renal cell carcinoma

        3. Quality of life assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire Korean version

        4. To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy of Sunitinib by evaluating time to
           progression

        5. Overall survival rate after Sunitinib therapy

        6. Pathologic evaluation after Sunitinib therapy: the change of necrosis and microvessel
           density

             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          -  Any of the following within 12 months prior to study drug administration:

        severe/unstable angina, myocardiac infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, symptomatic

          -  Women who are breast-feeding â€» Note At screening, resectability of primary tumor
             itself does not influence on patients enrollment. Physicians only have to describe
             about the resectability (&quot;resectable&quot; or &quot;unresectable&quot;) at screening on their own
             discretion, but if they decide that primary tumor is &quot;unresectable&quot;, the should
             specify reasons for unresectable status as follows: invasion into neighboring organs,
             proximity to vital structure or vessels, bulky regional lymph nodes, vascular
             invasion, burden of metastatic disease, and others.
