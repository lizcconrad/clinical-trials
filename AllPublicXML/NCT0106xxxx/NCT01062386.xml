    <textblock>
      Malaria is one of the major public health problems in Sub-Saharan Africa. In response to this
      threat, Roll Back Malaria (RBM) has rolled back a strategy using ACT as first line therapy
      for malaria episode, a wide distribution of Insecticide Treated Bednet (ITN), intermittent
      presumptive treatment of pregnant women and indoor residual spraying. Recent epidemiological
      observations suggested a decline in malaria prevalence in some countries but further
      evidences are still needed to confirm this evolution. The RBM strategy requires the use of
      reliable rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for which an operational assessment is necessary.
      Lastly, home-based management of malaria is also an important compound of this strategy.
      However, a better understanding of the actual use of antimalarial drugs, of the use of bednet
      and of the barrier to the use of health care is important to implement good quality
      strategies for malaria control.

      This study is a cross-sectional community based survey made of two rounds (one in January
      2010 and the second in June 2010). The general objective is to measure the prevalence of
      infection with Plasmodium falciparum at two periods of the year (at the moment of lowest and
      highest transmission based on the seasonal rainfalls) and to compare it with the prevalence
      estimated in 2004 after the rainy season for the same area. Specific objective are the
      estimation of the prevalence by age stratum, the analysis of the geographical distribution of
      the infection, the description of the parasitological characteristics, the assessment of
      three RDT, the description and the analysis of the prevention and care seek behaviours
      related to malaria.

      The study area is the great Mbarara district located in south-west of Uganda. A three-stage
      cluster sampling method will be used. Spatial information will be collected with global
      positioning system and imported to Geographical Information System. Behaviour information
      will be collected through face to face interview.
