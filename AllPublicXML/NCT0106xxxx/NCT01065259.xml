      The objective of this study is to compare the effect of Concerta (Osmotic Release Oral System
      Extended Release Methylphenidate HCL, OROS MPH) and Strattera (Atomoxetine) on the laboratory
      and ecological executive function in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

    <textblock>
      The sample will include 134 ADHD children and adolescence, randomized assigned to Concerta
      and strattera treatment group, with 67 cases in each. It will also include 67 sex and age
      matched normal control. The drug will be titrated to optimal dose. The executive function
      including inhibition, working memory, set shifting and plan will be compared among two
      medication group and the control group, using laboratory executive function test and Behavior
      Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).
