  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is 12 week, open label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention),
      prospective (study following participants forward in time), single arm, multicenter study
      (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) of OROS
      methylphenidate HCl. The study will consist of 6 visits at Screening, Baseline, Week 1, 3, 6
      and 12. The participants already on other ADHD medications in addition to methylphenidate
      will be required to undergo a washout period (period when receiving no treatment) of at least
      1 week. The participants will be on once daily study medication starting at 18 milligram per
      day (mg/day) in participants with less than 30 kilogram (kg) of body weight or at 27 mg/day
      in participants with more than 30 kg. The dose will be increased by 9 mg or 18 mg every week
      for up to Week 6 based on the treatment efficacy and tolerability, followed by a maximum
      maintenance dose of 72 mg orally once daily up to Week 12, during which the dose can be
      decreased by 9 mg depending on tolerability. Efficacy will primarily be assessed using
      Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale, Clinical Global Impression
      of Improvement of Illness (CGI-I) scale, Korean version of ADHD-IV Rating Scale (K-ARS) and
      Learning Skill Test (LST) score. Participants' safety will be monitored.

    <measure>Korean Version of the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale (K-ARS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The K-ARS is a rating scale that is used for the ADHD diagnosis and the assessment of treatment efficacy and comprises 18 items in total on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), each item being rated from 0-3 points. The total score ranges from 0-54 with 0=normal and 54=severe condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Learning Skill Test (LST) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The LST measures learning ability of student. This scale is composed of 7 sections: self control, participation, task accomplishment, reading, writing, test taking and information processing. It consists of 70 items for middle school student (age 13-15 years) and 80 items for high school student (age 16-18 years). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The total score range is 70-350 for middle school version and 80-400 for high school version where higher score indicates better ability for learning. In result analysis, each sub-score and total score was converted to T-score for normalization. The score range of T-score is from 1 to 100 with a mean of 50. Higher score indicates better ability for learning.</description>

    <measure>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Diagnostic System (ADS) Test Result for Omission Errors and Commission Errors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ADS is composed of 4 factors: omission/missing frequency to measure attention dispersibility; false alarm/commission frequency to measure impulse; mean response/reaction time to measure the speed of task processing; and the response variability/standard deviation of response time to measure the consistency of attention. The total value for both, omission errors and commission errors, ranges from 0-100 errors where high value indicates worsening attention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Diagnostic System (ADS) Test Score for Reaction Time and Response Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ADS is composed of 4 factors: omission/missing frequency to measure attention dispersibility; false alarm/comission frequency to measure impulse; mean response/reaction time to measure the speed of task processing; and the response variability/standard deviation of response time to measure the consistency of attention. The score range for both, reaction time and response variability, is 0-100. High score indicates worsening attention. If one or over factor's score is over 65 point, the participant is resulted in having attention deficit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digit Span Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant individually was given a sequence of numbers, with the sequence becoming progressively longer, to repeat the digits in the same sequence, either forwards or backwards. Each sequence length was attempted twice. The test was complete after failure on both trials of any sequence length. 1 point was awarded if the participant passed only 1 trial of a sequence length. 0 points were given if the participant failed both trials. Total score range was 0-16 (forwards) and 0-14 (backwards). A higher score was indicative of better recall and attention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Finger Window (FW) Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>In FW test, a participant shows memory of a demonstrated visual pattern using a 8x11 inch plastic template containing 9 asymmetrically located holes. The examiner models a given sequence of holes and asks the participant to imitate the sequence by placing his/her finger through the same holes in the correct order. The total number of correct sequences constitutes the total score which ranges from 0-24 (forward FW) and 0-28 (backward FW) with higher score indicating a more favorable health state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Controlled Oral Words Association Test (COWAT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the executive function of the frontal lobe and is consisted of examinations of category/meaning fluency and letter/phoneme fluency. It consisted of three 60 second word generation trials in which the participant orally generates as many words as possible that begin with target letters F, A and S. Dependent variables included total number of acceptable words generated for each target letter and total number of words generated across all three letter trials. Total score was calculated as sum of acceptable words generated, with higher scores indicating better verbal fluency.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop Test Result for Reaction Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of 3 trials: color trial (simple execution), word trial (middle execution) and word-color interference trial (interfering execution). In simple execution, participants have to read the written color names of the words independent of the color of the ink. In middle execution, participants have to read words written in black letters. In interfering experiment, participants have to say the color of the letters independent of the written word. This test estimates spending time for execution. High spending time indicates low ability of suppression of automation.</description>

        <title>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Diagnostic System (ADS) Test Score for Reaction Time and Response Variability</title>
        <description>The ADS is composed of 4 factors: omission/missing frequency to measure attention dispersibility; false alarm/comission frequency to measure impulse; mean response/reaction time to measure the speed of task processing; and the response variability/standard deviation of response time to measure the consistency of attention. The score range for both, reaction time and response variability, is 0-100. High score indicates worsening attention. If one or over factor’s score is over 65 point, the participant is resulted in having attention deficit.</description>

        <description>Each participant individually was given a sequence of numbers, with the sequence becoming progressively longer, to repeat the digits in the same sequence, either forwards or backwards. Each sequence length was attempted twice. The test was complete after failure on both trials of any sequence length. 1 point was awarded if the participant passed only 1 trial of a sequence length. 0 points were given if the participant failed both trials. Total score range was 0-16 (forwards) and 0-14 (backwards). A higher score was indicative of better recall and attention.</description>

        <description>In FW test, a participant shows memory of a demonstrated visual pattern using a 8x11 inch plastic template containing 9 asymmetrically located holes. The examiner models a given sequence of holes and asks the participant to imitate the sequence by placing his/her finger through the same holes in the correct order. The total number of correct sequences constitutes the total score which ranges from 0-24 (forward FW) and 0-28 (backward FW) with higher score indicating a more favorable health state.</description>

        <description>This test measures the executive function of the frontal lobe and is consisted of examinations of category/meaning fluency and letter/phoneme fluency. It consisted of three 60 second word generation trials in which the participant orally generates as many words as possible that begin with target letters F, A and S. Dependent variables included total number of acceptable words generated for each target letter and total number of words generated across all three letter trials. Total score was calculated as sum of acceptable words generated, with higher scores indicating better verbal fluency.</description>

        <title>Stroop Test Result for Reaction Time</title>
        <description>This test consists of 3 trials: color trial (simple execution), word trial (middle execution) and word-color interference trial (interfering execution). In simple execution, participants have to read the written color names of the words independent of the color of the ink. In middle execution, participants have to read words written in black letters. In interfering experiment, participants have to say the color of the letters independent of the written word. This test estimates spending time for execution. High spending time indicates low ability of suppression of automation.</description>

        <population>The ITT population included all participants who received the study drug at least once, satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and had efficacy assessment data at the Baseline.
