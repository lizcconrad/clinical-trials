  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab + fotemustine in patients
      with stage IV melanoma, previously untreated with chemo- or immunotherapy for metastatic
      disease. Patients will receive Avastin (15mg/kg intravenously[IV]) on Day 1 of every 3 week
      cycle, in combination with fotemustine (100mg/m² IV) on Days 1, 8 and 15, followed by 4 weeks
      rest, followed by 100mg/m² IV every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles. The anticipated time on study
      treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 9 weeks during study treatment, and every 3 months during follow-up, up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with an objective response, defined as achieving CR or PR, as evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target), PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with an objective response of CR, PR, or SD, as evaluated by RECIST criteria. CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target), PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD: steady state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for pregressive disease (PD). The clinical benefit was finally assessed by computing absolute frequencies and percentages participants with best overall tumor response equal to CR, PR, or SD.</description>

    <description>TTP was defined as the time in days from the date of first study treatment until the date of tumor progression or death.

        <description>The percentage of participants with an objective response, defined as achieving CR or PR, as evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

        <description>The percentage of participants with an objective response of CR, PR, or SD, as evaluated by RECIST criteria. CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target), PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD: steady state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for pregressive disease (PD). The clinical benefit was finally assessed by computing absolute frequencies and percentages participants with best overall tumor response equal to CR, PR, or SD.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD)</title>
          <description>The percentage of participants with an objective response of CR, PR, or SD, as evaluated by RECIST criteria. CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target), PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD: steady state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for pregressive disease (PD). The clinical benefit was finally assessed by computing absolute frequencies and percentages participants with best overall tumor response equal to CR, PR, or SD.</description>
