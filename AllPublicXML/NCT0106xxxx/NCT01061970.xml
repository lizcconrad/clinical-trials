      The objective of the study is to assess and compare the preliminary efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of fispemifene 300 mg and placebo given once daily for 4 weeks in the treatment
      of hypogonadal men with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that are on oral
      glucocorticoid therapy.

             agreed to follow dosing instructions and complete all required study visits.

          2. The subject has COPD as defined by post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7 as measured at
             screening.

          3. The subject is on a stable dose of oral glucocorticoids (dose has not changed in the

          5. The subject has a screening total testosterone level and a confirmatory baseline total
             testosterone level ≤ 350 ng/dl. Testosterone levels should be determined from early
             morning (0700h to 0900h) specimens.

          6. The subject has a serum LH level of 1.7-15.0 IU/L and an FSH level of 1.5-15.0 IU/L at
