  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta on long-term maintenance of haemoglobin levels in
      patients with chronic renal anaemia. Patients will receive methoxy polyethylene
      glycol-epoetin beta intravenously once monthly at initial doses of either 120 micrograms or
      200 micrograms or 360 micrograms in the titration phase of 16 weeks with a potential dose
      adjustment in the evaluation phase of 8 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 24
      weeks. The target sample size is 50-100 patients.

    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with their mean haemoglobin (Hb) concentration (g/dL) within the target range during the efficacy evaluation period was assessed. The target range is the reference Hb not &gt;12 g/dL and not &lt; 10 g/dL.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A Serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect. The AEs were assessed from baseline to every visit throughout the treatment, post study drug discontinuation, and follow up period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A Serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect. The AEs were assessed from baseline to every visit throughout the treatment, post study drug discontinuation, and follow up period.</description>

        <description>A marked laboratory abnormality is defined as above and/or below the normal range of a laboratory parameter which was considered to be potentially clinically relevant. The number of participants with marked laboratory abnormality are presented. Marked laboratory abnormalities were analyzed according to the Roche specified limits for the following reference range: Haemoglobin (Hb) (11.7-17.3 g/dL), Haematocrit (Hct) (35-47%), White blood cells (WBC) (3.6-11.0 10^3/µL), Red blood cells (RBC) (3.8– 5.9 10^6/µL), MCV (80-100 fL) Platelets (150-440 10^3/µL), Iron (37-158 µg/dL), Ferritin (10-365 ng/mL), Transferrin (170-340 mg/dL), TIBC (250-450 µg/dL), TSAT (15-50%), Albumin (3.4-4.8 g/dL), hs-CRP (&lt;= 10.000 mg/dL), Potassium (3.5-5.1 mmol/L), and Phosphorus (2.7-4.5 mg/dL).</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Week 28</time_frame>
        <population>Safety population included all participants who entered into the study and took at least one dose of study drug.The ITT and safety population were identical. Data of maximum number of participants (33 participants) available at the time of analysis were analysed and reported.</population>

            <description>Eligible participants received Mircera IV, once every four weeks for 24 weeks. Participants received a starting dose of Mircera 100, 150 or 200 mcg which was based on the Epoetin dose of &lt;8000, 8000-16000, or &gt;16000 IU/Week, administered during the week preceding the switch to the study drug.</description>
