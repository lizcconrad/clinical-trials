    <textblock>
      This survey is conducted for preparing application materials for re-examination under the
      Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws and its Enforcement Regulation, its aim is to reconfirm the
      clinical usefulness of FOSAMAX PLUS / FOSAMAX PLUS D through collecting the safety
      information according to the Re-examination Regulation for New Drugs.

      Note: FOSAMAX PLUS D is known as FOSAMAX PLUS in several markets. FOSAMAX PLUS (70 mg/2800
      IU) and FOSAMAX PLUS D (70 mg/5600 IU).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~ 16 weeks and 14 days after treatment discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants that experienced Serious Adverse events (SAE). There was no required routine visit scheduled for AE assessment. AEs were collected through participant self-reporting and assessed by investigators.
SAEs were considered serious if the event resulted in:
death or was life-threatening
prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization
a persistent or significant disability/ incapacity
a congenital anomaly/ birth defect
a significant medical situation, other important medical event based upon appropriate medical judgment of the investigator</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Unexpected Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~ 16 weeks and 14 days after treatment discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants that experienced unexpected Adverse Events (AEs) regardless of whether or not the AE was considered related to the use of the product. There was no required routine visit scheduled for AE assessment. An AE was defined as any unfavorable &amp; unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product. Any worsening (any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the product, was also considered an AE.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Improved, Unchanged, or Worsened Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of Treatment (Up to ~ 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of disease improvement was conducted in 3 categories of &quot;improved&quot;, &quot;unchanged&quot;, or &quot;worsened&quot;. Changes in biochemical markers and vitamin D levels were reviewed before (baseline) and after treatment using statistical analyses to determine disease status, which was reported as either &quot;improved&quot;, &quot;unchanged&quot;, or &quot;worsened&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Treatment (Up to ~ 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>For efficacy evaluation, changes in Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were evaluated before study drug administration and at end of study drug treatment. Change was calculated as the later time point (at ~16 weeks) minus the earlier time point (baseline). The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used. That is, the last observed non-missing value was used to fill in missing values at the later point in the study.</description>
