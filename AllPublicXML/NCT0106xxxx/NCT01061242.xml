    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand patients' neurocognitive performance shortly after
      discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and the potential effect of sleep
      quality in the MICU on those neurocognitive outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that
      post-ICU neurocognitive function and patient overall ICU sleep experience will improve
      through a pre-existing MICU sleep improvement initiative.

    <textblock>
      Despite decades of scientific interest in evaluating sleep among critically ill patients,
      little is known about the effects of intensive care unit (ICU)-associated sleep disturbances
      on patient outcomes. Furthermore, few interventions have been rigorously evaluated to
      demonstrate efficacy in improving sleep in the ICU and associated patient outcomes. Post-ICU
      neurocognitive test performance data from this study will be linked to a pre-existing Quality
      Improvement (QI) project for patient sleep in the MICU. We hypothesize that patients'
      post-ICU neurocognitive performance (delirium status, attention, short-term memory,
      processing speed, and executive function) will positively correlate with scores from a
      previously-published Sleep in the Intensive Care Unit Questionnaire. In addition, we
      hypothesize that both neurocognitive performance and the Sleep in the Intensive Care Unit
      Questionnaire will improve during the multi-stage MICU-wide sleep QI project. Our project
      will provide valuable empirical evidence to help support guidelines for promoting sleep in
      the ICU setting.
