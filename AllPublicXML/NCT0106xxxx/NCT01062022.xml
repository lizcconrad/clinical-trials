  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implement a unique evidence-based intervention program to
      help military families deal with the critical issue of combat injury and its impact on
      current and future family health and functioning. The study is a randomized study. The study
      will compare the effects of the newly designed FOCUS-CI (Families OverComing Under Stress -
      Combat Injury) with the existing standard of care (SoC) at three military medical
      rehabilitation sites (Walter Reed Amry Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center and Madigan
      Army Medical Center) on key aspects of family health and functioning.

      Injured service members who have at least one child between the ages of 5 and 18 years who
      have sustained a combat injury severe enough to require at least two weeks of inpatient
      hospitalization and who are within 6 months of discharge from inpatient hospitalization and
      currently receiving outpatient care will be recruited into this study.

    <description>Participation in the study will involve your child completing a questionnaire about (a) your family's background, descriptive information about people in your family, and previous major life events, (b) his/her current functioning, (c) his/her feelings before, during, and after the combat injury, and (d) his/her current social relationships and adjustment. Your child will be asked to complete the questionnaire during the baseline assessment, and at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the original assessment.</description>

    <description>Those participants in the FOCUS-CI intervention will be part of a family skill-building/resiliency training program designed to provide information and skills training in a variety of forms, including clinician-led sessions, handouts, on-line training modules, and individual family care management. Study participation will also involve completing a questionnaire about (a) your family's background, descriptive information about people in your family, and previous major life events, (b) his/her current functioning, (c) his/her feelings before, during, and after the combat injury, and (d) his/her current social relationships and adjustment. Questionnaires will be completed during the baseline assessment, and at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the baseline assessment.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For a family to be eligible for the study, the injured service member must:

          -  have sustained a combat injury that was severe enough to require a minimum of two
             weeks inpatient hospitalization immediately after the injury;

          -  currently be participating in outpatient rehabilitation for the same combat injury;

          -  must be within 6 months of discharge from inpatient hospitalization at the start of
             the intervention;

          -  families must have at least one child between the ages of 5 and 18 and be fluent in
             English. English fluency will be determined by asking, &quot;Is English spoken in your
             home?&quot;

          -  pregnant women are eligible to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  families in which the service member did not sustain a qualifying injury or has been
             discharged from inpatient care for more than six months will not be eligible to
             participate

          -  families in which a member is actively psychotic

          -  families in which a service member's primary relationship is with a &quot;significant
             other&quot; who is not eligible for military medical care

          -  due to the limited ability of young children to comprehend the intervention
             activities, children under the age of 5 years will not be invited to participate in
             the intervention.

          -  no one will be excluded based on race, ethnicity, gender, pregnancy, medical status,
             or cognitive functioning.
