    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adherence and effectiveness of AL in the
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children aged under five years using blister packs with
      pictorial leaflets can be at levels comparable to those with unit dosed age specific
      pre-packs.

    <textblock>
      Prompt and adequate treatment of clinical malaria episodes remains one of the key elements of
      malaria control and this partly depends on patients' compliance to treatment. Uganda adopted
      Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) as first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. This is
      available at the health facilities in form of 6 dose pre-packs with different doze strengths
      in different packages. However, concerns about the costs and stock-outs of these packages
      have been raised and alternative equally efficacious alternatives need to be determined in
      order to reduce these problems. This study will assess if AL blister-packs can act as
      alternatives to the unit dose age specific pre-packs in the public sector
