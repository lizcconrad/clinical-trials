      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of BLINK™ tears compared with NO topical artificial tear
      use in improving subject's visual performance and reduce ocular symptoms of discomfort in
      subjects who have undergone cataract surgery implanted with a Tecnis™ diffractive multifocal
      intraocular lens (IOL).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, 21 years of age or older

          -  Written, informed consent and HIPPA Authorization

          -  Has 20/40 or better best corrected visual acuity in the surgical eye at the Day 1
             post-op visit (Visit 3)

          -  Has undergone cataract surgery in only one eye and has received a Tecnis multi-focal
             intraocular lens in the study eye.

          -  Patients not currently using any artificial tears regularly, or using low viscosity
             tears for symptom relief (Refresh Tears, Visine Tears, Tears Naturelle, etc.)

          -  Likely to complete the entire course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision

          -  Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results
             (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.)

          -  Subjects with diabetes mellitus

          -  Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease

          -  History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery

          -  Amblyopia or strabismus

          -  Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that
             affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy, etc.)

          -  Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or other retinal
             disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of 20/30 or
             worse

          -  Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical
             intervention

          -  Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of
             the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome)

          -  Pupil abnormalities (non-reactive, tonic pupils, abnormally shaped pupils, or pupils
             that do not dilate at least 4.0 mm under mesopic/scotopic conditions)

          -  Contact lens usage within 6 months for PMMA contacts lenses, 1 month for gas permeable
             lenses or 1 week for extended-wear and daily-wear soft contact lenses

          -  A subject whose best-corrected visual acuity is worse than 20/40 in their surgical eye

          -  A subject with any UNCONTROLLED systemic disease. A potential subject in whom therapy
             for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized will not be considered for entry into the
             study

          -  A subject that required the use of any artificial tear supplements, vasoconstrictor
             and/or redness reliever ocular drops 28 days prior to or during the study period

          -  A subject that required the use of cyclosporine ocular drops 3 months prior to or
             during the study period

          -  A subject with active ocular inflammation or corneal edema beyond what is expected on
             Day 1 after cataract surgery in the study eye

          -  A subject with a history of conjunctivitis or ocular infection in the study eye within
             the past 3 months, or a history of kerato-refractive surgery in the study eye within
             the past 6 months of entry in to the study

          -  A subject that has punctual plug(s), intracanalicular plug(s) or a history of punctual
             cautery in the study eye
