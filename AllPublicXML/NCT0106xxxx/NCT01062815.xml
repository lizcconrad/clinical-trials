      Hypothesis to be Tested:

      Since the first description of intravenous alimentation over half a century ago, parenteral
      nutrition (PN) has become a common nutritional intervention for conditions characterized by
      inability to tolerate enteral feeds such as Short Bowel Syndrome, Chronic Intestinal
      Pseudoobstruction, Microvillus Inclusion Disease, Crohn's disease, multi-organ failure and
      prematurity. Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) encompasses a spectrum of
      disease including cholestasis, hepatitis, steatosis and gallbladder sludge/stones which may
      progress to liver cirrhosis and even failure.

      There is a direct correlation between duration of parenteral nutrition and development of
      cholestasis in infants. There is evidence in animals and humans that cycling of parental
      nutrition, defined as infusing nutrients over a time period shorter than 24 hours, reduces
      cholestasis. There is also data that premature infants with gestational age (GA) &lt; 32 weeks
      and birth weight &lt;1500g, as well as infants with congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal
      tract, are among those at highest risk of developing Parenteral Nutrition-Associated
      Cholestasis (PNAC).

      We therefore hypothesize that infants with gestational age (GA) &lt;32 weeks and birth weight
      (BW) between &lt;1500g, or with congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract regardless of
      GA or BW, receiving PN over a period of 20 hours will have a decrease severity of PNAC,
      demonstrated by a lower peak direct bilirubin, compared to a similar control population
      receiving standard 24 hour infusion.
