  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis patients usually have peripheral muscle weakness due to metabolic disturbances
      (increased protein catabolism) and fatigue. This muscle weakness may decrease functional
      capacity and quality of life. It also serves to increase cardiovascular risk factors in these
      end stage renal disease patients. Peripheral muscle strength training shall combat physical
      inactivity during dialysis. In the investigators trial, the investigators hypothesis that
      peripheral muscle training might regulate protein catabolic rate,renal functions,
      cardiovascular risk factors, improve functional capacity and quality of life in endstage
      renal disease patients undergoing dialysis.

      End stage renal failure patients undergoing dialysis have profound muscle wasting, reduced
      functional capacity and quality of life due to uremia, steroids, frequent dialysis and
      fatigue. During dialysis, physical inactivity further deteriorates the patient's functional
      capacity. Aerobic or strength training may combat this physical inactivity. It may also
      improve the functional capacity and quality of life. Recent studies have claimed the benefits
      of resistance exercises in improving functional capacity. But they have not documented
      effects on kidney function (electrolyte and urea kinetics) and muscle wasting (protein
      catabolic rate). In our trial, we attempt to study the effects of resistance training in
      improvement of renal function and muscle wasting apart from functional capacity and quality
      of life in dialysis patients
