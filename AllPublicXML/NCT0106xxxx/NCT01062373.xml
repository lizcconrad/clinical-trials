  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several recent publications showed a reduction in the level of DHA and/or an increase in the
      arachidonic acid (AA)/DHA ratio in the milk of mother. We hypothesized that the
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status of the premature newborn fed mother's milk is
      unbalanced because the content of DHA of the milk of mother nowadays is insufficient, whereas
      scientific arguments point-out the essential role of DHA and balanced AA/DHA ratio of human
      milk to explain the beneficial role of the breast-feeding at short, medium and long term. We
      will study the benefits of DHA supplements (TG-DHA versus GPL-DHA) of mothers in PUGA status
      improvement in their premature newborn consecutive to DHA enrichment and balanced AA/DHA
      ratio of human milk. GPL-DHA should be more effective than TG-DHA by protecting both n-3 and
      n-6 fatty acids pathways.
