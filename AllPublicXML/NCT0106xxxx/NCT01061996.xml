      Primary Objective Safety: assess the safety of basiliximab 40 mg, given every 4 weeks, in
      subjects with ulcerative colitis who completed previous basiliximab studies.

      Secondary Objectives: evaluate the efficacy and assess the immunogenicity of this
      multiple-dose maintenance regimen in this population
