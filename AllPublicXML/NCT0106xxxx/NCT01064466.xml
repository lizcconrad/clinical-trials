      Personalized or individualize Etoposide (VP-16) chemotherapy targeting the SCLC
      patient-specific biomarkers (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms - SNPs of relative etoposide
      targets, topoisomerase II and CYP4503A4)

      Targeted SCLC chemotherapy with Etoposide (VP-16) and patient-specific biomarkers (SNPs)

      Individualize or personalize etoposide chemotherapy toward small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with
      maximizing effectiveness via assay single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of relative
      etoposide target - topoisomerase II, and minimizing risk via assay single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) of relative etoposide target - CYP4503A4, based on precisely sequencing
      drug targets' genes.

      The usual approach group, after local therapy with surgery, 300 double blind random group
      separated SCLC patients currently used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus
      CISPLATIN INJECTION, it will try to look for the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION
      therapeutic efficacy and the Topoisomerase II SNP Genotyping, and the relationship between
      the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic safety and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotyping, based on
      precisely sequencing drug targets' genes.

      The study approach group, after local therapy with surgery, 300 double blind random group
      separated SCLC patients currently used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus
      CARBOPLATIN INJECTION, it will try to look for the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE
      INJECTION therapeutic efficacy and the Topoisomerase II SNP Genotyping, and the relationship
      between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic safety and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotyping, based on
      precisely sequencing drug targets' genes.

        -  1) Detect drug target whole gene precision sequence of everyone patient for all 600
           recruited double blind SCLC patients.

        -  2) Mutually compare everyone patient drug target whole gene precision sequence for total
           600 recruited double blind SCLC patients.

        -  3) Calculate drug target gene SNPs in all 600 recruited double blind SCLC patients.

        -  4) Correlate everyone patient drug target gene SNP to everyone patient drug efficacy.

        -  5) Correlate everyone patient drug target gene SNP to everyone patient drug safety.

        -  6) Mutually compare the usual approach group SNPs (300 double blind random group
           separated SCLC patients) with the study approach group SNPs (300 double blind random
           group separated SCLC patients).

        -  7) Confirm the relationship between drug target gene SNPs and drug efficacy.

        -  8) Confirm the relationship between drug target gene SNPs and drug safety.
