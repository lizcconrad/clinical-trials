      Running patterns are thought to have a major influence on the development of Running Related
      Injuries (RRI), however to studies have documented such relationship. Thus, the aim of the
      study is to investigate the association between running patterns and overuse injuries in
      runners.

      Running patterns are thought to have a major influence on the development of Running Related
      Injuries (RRI).

      Worldwide, running is a sport practiced by many individuals to improve cardio-respiratory
      function, health and well-being. Although running positively contributes to health, there is
      also a risk of running related injuries (RRI). At best, the consequence of RRIÂ´s is a
      periodic absence from physical activity, with the athlete returning to sport within weeks. In
      the worst case, the injury is a chronic painful condition, causing a sedentary lifestyle
      without physical activity. This is undesirable since physical inactivity increases the risk
      of lifestyle diseases and death.

      In Denmark it is estimated that 4.500 deaths each year can be attributed directly to
      inactivity. Furthermore, inactivity leads to reduced quality of life compared to active
      persons. To avoid people getting a sedentary lifestyle prevention of RRI are necessary.

      To define a prevention strategy, one must have knowledge about risk factors and causation.
      Many risk factors have been proposed. Among these, running patterns and foot type are thought
      to play a major role in the development of RRI. However, very few firm conclusions can be
      made based on the existing literature, often because of methodical problems. Consequently, it
      is suggested to design large scale prospective studies controlling for multiple variables.
      Furthermore, studies should differentiate between novice, elite and extreme runners. Thus,
      the study design in this project will take these suggestions into account.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the association between running patterns and overuse
      injuries in runners.

        Beginners: n = 1000. By means of the Danish Personal Register adult citizens (age 18-65
        years) from Aarhus Municipality are identified, contacted by phone, and invited to
        participate in the study. A question on running experience in the past is used to assess
        the novelty to running. 500 beginners with previous running experience and 500 beginners
        without previous running experience (former runners) will be included in the study. It is
        estimated that 11000 persons have to be contracted to include 1000 individuals. Healthy
        persons who have not sustained an injury in the lower extremity in the last 3 months before
        inclusion and who have not been running for the last 12 months, are eligible for the study.
        Participants are excluded if there are absolute contraindications for vigorous physical
        activities according to the ACSM, or in case of unwillingness to keep a training log / wear
        a heart rate belt during training.
