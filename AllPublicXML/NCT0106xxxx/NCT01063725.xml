  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of Femarelle ( a plan-derived SERM) on hot
      flushes and quality of life in menopausal women. Our hypotheses are that compared to placebo,
      Femarelle reduces the daily number of hot flushes and their severity and also improves the
      quality of life as measured by validated dairies and questionnaires.

    <textblock>
      Symptomatic menopausal women will be divided to treatment with Femarelle or placebo for 12
      weeks after two weeks of baseline record. Hot flashes daily diary will be recorded daily and
      a quality of life questionnaire will be filled at the beginning and at completion of the
      study.
