    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (cancer that involves the
      local blood vessels so it cannot be removed without cutting major blood vessels) that cannot
      be treated with surgery. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and benefit of 6
      three week cycles of chemotherapy treatment consisting of gemcitabine, capecitabine and
      docetaxel (also called 'GTX'). The patients fall into two groups. Group I are those with only
      venous involvement. Group II patients have arterial involvement and may also have venous
      involvement. If there is arterial involvement, GTX will be followed by 5 and 1/2 weeks of
      radiation therapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine. After the chemotherapy and radiation
      treatment, participants may be able to have surgery to remove any remaining pancreatic
      cancer.

Pegfiligastrim 6mg at the end of week 2 if the WBC count is less than 2500 cells/cu mm.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (When possible the tissue
             should be evaluated for K-ras mutation and the patient evaluated for BRCA and p16
             mutations.)

             (chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast), MRI scan (of abdomen with gadolinium) or PET
             scan.

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease by CT scan (chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast), MRI
             scan (of abdomen with gadolinium) or PET scan.

             surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

          -  Complete Blood Count and Complete Metabolic Profile:

        Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt; 1,500 μl White Blood Count &gt; 3,000/μl Platelet count &gt;

             disease process and must willingly give consent after being informed of the nature of
