  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) continues to be the primary therapy prescribed for
      the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Although effective, adherence to CPAP is
      suboptimal in many patients, making alternative therapies desirable. Recently, a novel device
      (Provent™) has been developed for the treatment of snoring and OSA. The purpose of the
      current study is to examine how well the Provent™ device treats OSA with particular attention
      to the how the it may treat sleep apnea and who may most likely benefit from the use of this
      treatment.

    <time_frame>Comparisons were made between the 2 nights</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the change in the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Sleep apnea events are defined as apneas and hypopneas.The AHI is a measure of sleep apnea severity. An AHI &gt; 5 event/h is considered abnormal. AHI values are typically categorized as 5-15 events/hr = mild; 15-30 events/hr = moderate; and &gt; 30 events/hr = severe. For this study we compared the change in AHI from the baseline sleep study (No Provent) compared to the treatment night sleep study (on Provent).</description>

    <description>Participants with sleep apnea will be recruited for the study. Each participant will undergo 3 sleep studies to assess the effect of the Provent™ device. Participants will only use the device while they are in the sleep laboratory. They will not use the device at home between sleep studies .
Baseline sleep study (No device) - Assess the effects of no Provent™ on sleep apnea severity.
Treatment sleep study (Provent™ device used) - Assess the effects of Provent™ on sleep apnea severity
Physiology sleep study (Provent™ on/off) - Assess the physiological effects of the Provent™ device on breathing during sleep.</description>
