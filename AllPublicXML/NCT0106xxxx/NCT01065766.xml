      This survey is conducted for preparing application materials for re-examination under the
      Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws and its Enforcement Regulation, its aim is to reconfirm the
      clinical usefulness of sitagliptin/metformin (JANUMET) through collecting the safety and
      efficacy information according to the Re-examination Regulation for New Drugs.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Treatment in Hemoglobin HbA1c (A1C) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1C is found when high blood levels of glucose combines with hemoglobin to form glycated hemoglobin. The average amount of glucose in blood over a prolonged periods of time can be determined by measuring a hemoglobin A1c level which is reported as a percentage (%). The change from baseline reflects the Week 12 A1C minus Week 0 A1C.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Treatment in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose was measured on a fasting basis (collected after an 8- to 10-hour fast). FPG is expressed as mg/dL. Therefore, this change from baseline reflects the Week 12 FPG minus Week 0 FPG.</description>

    <description>Overall efficacy analysis was conducted on participants who have used study drug for more than 12 weeks and whose improvement of the disease has been assessed by Principal investigator. The investigator's global assessment of disease improvement was classified as either: &quot;Improved&quot;, &quot;Stable&quot; and &quot;Worse&quot; in a Medical History/Physical Examination form.</description>
