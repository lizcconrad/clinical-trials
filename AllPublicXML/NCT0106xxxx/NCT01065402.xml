      The MiniMed Medtronic CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system), the first model approved
      by FDA, was used for subcutaneous glucose monitoring. The CGMS continually measures the
      glucose concentration of the interstitial fluid every 10 seconds and then stores an average
      glucose value for each 5 minutes period, for a total of up to 288 measurements each day.

    <description>PPB-R-203 is manufacture by Pharma Power Biotec Co., Ltd. The composition of PPB-R-203 is resistant starch (RS). By definition, resistant starch (RS) is any starch that is not digested in the small intestine but passes to the large intestine (or the colon). Therefore, resistant starch can be regarded as a component of dietary fiber. RS intake is associated with several changes in metabolism which may confer some health benefits.

    <description>PPB-R-203 is manufacture by Pharma Power Biotec Co., Ltd. The composition of PPB-R-203 is resistant starch (RS). Resistant starch can be regarded as a component of dietary fiber. Some forms of RS are present naturally in many foods, and average global consumption is estimated at 3-10 g/day. PPB-R-203-Based is the diet equivalent to daily energy needs as judged by indirect calorimetry and of the same macronutrient composition.</description>
