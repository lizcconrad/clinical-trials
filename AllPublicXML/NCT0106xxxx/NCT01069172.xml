      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the OptiMedica
      Femtosecond Laser System to perform surgical maneuvers used in the treatment of subjects with
      cataracts. The safety and efficacy will be compared to the standard surgical procedure of
      continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) and ultrasonic phacoemulsification.

    <time_frame>Day of Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>CDE (the amount of ultrasound energy delivered during phacoemulsification of the crystalline lens) used will be measured during surgery. CDE is a unit used for the Alcon Infinity System (the U/S phacoemulsification used in this study). It is not expressed in standard units such as watts or Joules. CDE, which accounts for the power and time of two ultrasound delivery modes (longitudinal and torsional), is calculated as follows:
CDE = (Phaco time x average phaco power) + (torsional time x average torsional aptitude x 0.4)
0.4 is a factor representing the approximate reduction of heat dissipated at the incision as compared to conventional phacoemulsification.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>30 subjects were included in the study, but one subject withdrew prior to surgery on their second eye. Baseline and outcome measure analysis was performed on the 29 subjects with both eyes enrolled. Of these 29 subjects, all had FS laser surgery in one eye (29 FS surgery eyes) and CCC with U/S surgery in their fellow eye (29 CCC surgery eyes).</pre_assignment_details>

CDE is a unit used for the Alcon Infinity System (the U/S phacoemulsification used in this study). It is not expressed in standard units such as watts or Joules. CDE, which accounts for the power and time of two ultrasound delivery modes (longitudinal and torsional), is calculated as follows:
CDE = (Phaco time x average phaco power) + (torsional time x average torsional aptitude x 0.4)
0.4 is a factor representing the approximate reduction of heat dissipated at the incision as compared to conventional phacoemulsification.</description>
          <population>29 subjects had FS laser surgery in one eye (29 FS surgery eyes) and CCC with U/S surgery in their fellow eye (29 CCC surgery eyes). Analysis of CDE was done by eye group.</population>
