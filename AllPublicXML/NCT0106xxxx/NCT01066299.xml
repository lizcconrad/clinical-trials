  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin (OXT) is currently regarded as a crucial neuropeptide in the mediation of various
      human social behaviors, e.g. social affiliation, social recognition, and the modulation of
      anxiety, mood, and aggression. An impairment of social behavior, emotional regulation as well
      as increased stress reactions are characteristic of several psychiatric conditions, including
      schizophrenia, social anxiety and PTSD, in which there is also some evidence for OXT
      dysfunction. The startle reflex is a basic defensive reaction that can be modulated by
      emotional stimuli. The investigation of the startle reflex and of its modulation is a
      well-validated method to test stress reactions and emotional regulation. These processes are
      impaired in the same psychiatric diseases, in which OXT dysfunction was evidenced. Although
      previous animal studies showed that the dysfunction of brain OXT systems might be implicated
      in startle reflex and in its modulation, no study has been performed yet in human that
      investigated the influence of OXT administration on the startle response and on its affective
      modulation. A first aim of this study is to investigate the influence of OXT on stress
      reactivity and emotional modulation in healthy humans. A second aim is to develop a method
      for the investigation of anxiety disorders. Fifty male healthy participants will be tested
      using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design in two occasions; once
      with administration of 24 IU OXT, and once with placebo using nasal sprays while performing a
      computer-based experiment, in which emotional pictures and auditory startle probes are
      presented. We will measure the subject's subjective ratings of the pictures as well as the
      facial EMG activation, heart rate and electrodermal activation throughout the study. This
      project offers a unique opportunity to study the relationship between the OXT system and
      basic motivational and emotional behaviors. The investigation of these mechanisms is in turn
      greatly worthwhile, not only for understanding of the neurochemical and physiological
      processes involved in emotional regulation, but also for the comprehension of the
      neuroendocrine and neurophysiological mechanismsunderlying anxiety disorders. In the long
      term, it could open the possibilities of OXT as a psychobiological therapeutics of
      psychiatric disorders.
