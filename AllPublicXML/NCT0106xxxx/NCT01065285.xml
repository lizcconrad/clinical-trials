  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is to evaluate immunogenicity, efficacy and tolerance of vaccination against
      influenza (seasonal and H1N1) in patients affected with systemic and autoimmune diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study concentrates on patients with vasculitis, systemic sclerosis,
      Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases.

      Patients responding to the inclusion criteria, will receive vaccine against seasonal
      influenza then, 3 weeks later, vaccine against H1N1 influenza. According to the results of
      ongoing trials a second injection of H1N1 vaccine has been scheduled 3 weeks later. At each
      consultation a blood sample will be taken to evaluate immunogenicity of vaccination. Two
      additional consultations have been scheduled: one month after the last vaccine administration
      and at 6 month, in order to evaluate the occurrence of late side effects.
