  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the side effects of
      cyclophosphamide in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Han Chinese and
      the genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes and pharmacokinetics of
      cyclophosphamide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cyclophosphamide is a widely applied agent in treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. As
      an alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide is able to induce several side effects, including
      thinned hair, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, infection, myelosuppression, etc. However,
      the remarkable variability of the reactions to the drug -- the incidence of side effect or
      the outcome of the treatment -- has been observed among patients. Cyclophosphamide is a
      pro-drug, which require some enzymes in the liver to transform it into an active chemical to
      arouse alkylating function. And then it undergoes a series of detoxification steps catalyzed
      by the specific metabolic enzymes. This study is designed to explore the genetic variation
      among individuals in the key processes of the activation and elimination of cyclophosphamide
      in order to find out whether these genetic factors are associated to the side effects or
      efficacy. The further understanding into the factors concerning on the drug might imply
      possible solution to minimize the incidence of side effects in patients of systemic lupus
      erythematosus.

             Rheumatology (ACR) criteria published in 1997.

          2. The patients must sign the informed consent. And for the patients who are under 18

             intravenous injection once every two days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women, women in breast-feeding period and the women who refuse to take
             contraception measures during treatment.

          2. Patients with poor compliance.

          3. Patients who are also diagnosed of cancer or who are receiving cyclophosphamide in
             treatment of cancer, or other anti-cancer therapy.
