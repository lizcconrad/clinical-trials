      The primary objective of this study is to acquire digital mammography images produced by the
      Xpress Digital Mammography System in order to develop Computer Aided Detection software and
      systems.

      The proposed study is an image acquisition study of mammograms produced by the
      investigational digital system. Women who meet the selection criteria and who agree to
      participate in the study will be imaged with the Xpress Digital Mammography System at the
      clinical sites. These images will be provided to CAD development companies to conduct their
      own development and testing. The CAD development companies will be responsible for submitting
      their results to the FDA for marketing approval of their CAD systems.

      Patients will be drawn primarily from those women scheduled for breast biopsy since this
      population has an enhanced probability of cancer. The intent is to enroll patients until at
      least 107 women with biopsy proven cancers, and at least 330 women who have negative
      mammograms are enrolled. All cancers found will be used in the study. It is anticipated that
      approximately 720 patients undergoing diagnostic mammography will need to be enrolled to
      yield 107 proven cancer cases. In addition, approximately 330 cases will be drawn from a
      screening population. The negative status of the screening cases will be established by
      selecting only cases classified as BIRADS 1 or 2, and have a negative mammogram at one year
      follow-up. All images collected will be utilized to develop and test the CAD systems, and may
      be used for further product development.

        To achieve the goal of 107 cases with biopsy-proven cancer, it is expected that
        approximatley 720 patients undergoing breast biopsy will need to be enrolled in the study.
        In addition, we will enroll up to 330 patients from a screening population.
