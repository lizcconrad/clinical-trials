  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish which of the following tests perform best in
      diagnosing clostridium difficile. PCR, Enzyme Immunoassays (EIA) and C. difficile cytotoxin
      assay (CTA).

      This comparative study will be carried out in the hospital microbiology laboratory of a
      tertiary academic health center, St. Joseph's Healthcare (SJH) affiliated with McMaster
      University, Hamilton, ON on 500 individual stool samples from patients greater than 12 months
      of age to determine an efficacy of distinction between current gold standard and other
      methods of testing for Clostridium difficile. This study is required to find a faster test
      for diagnosis of CDI in order to facilitate prompt treatment and reduce the complications of
      CDI. Identification of infected cases will lead to the enforcement of infection control
      measures and thereby prevent spread to other susceptible children. This is turn will reduce
      costs, length of stay, morbidity, and mortality from CDI if instituted correctly.
