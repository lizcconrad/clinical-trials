    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze if the infants who received Primene solution, have
      lower serum levels of methionine and cysteine and higher serum levels of taurine, we also
      analyze if the infants who received Primene solution develop TPN-associated cholestasis in a
      smaller proportion than those who received Trophamine solution.

    <textblock>
      Total parenteral nutrition is an essential component of the care of premature and ill
      infants. Prolonged parenteral nutrition is associated with complications affecting the
      hepatobiliary system, such as cholelithiasis, cholestasis, and steatosis. The most common of
      these is total parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (TPNAC), that occurs because of
      reduced bile flow from the liver into the duodenum. Cholestasis causes liver damage and in
      some cases, death. Infant and neonate are at particular risk for this complication. The
      incidence of TPNAC ranges from 7.4 to 84%.

      Animal studies have implicated amino acids in the production of cholestasis; whereas studies
      in human neonates suggest a direct effect of amino acid infusions on the hepatocyte
      canalicular membrane. An appropriate amino acid solution might compensate for the metabolic
      immaturity of infants and perhaps reduce total parenteral nutrition associated complications
      such as cholestasis. Therefore, is important to compare the frequency of cholestasis and
      blood amino acid concentration during Primene and Trophamine use.

    <description>This group of neonates will be receive the Trophamine amino acids solution from Pisa laboratories as an active comparator with Primene. The infants in this group will receive, daily intakes (g/kg/d) of parenteral protein, carbohydrate and fat or daily enteral intake (ml/kg/d). Besides, the intake of breast milk or formula will be record, during the first 28 days of total parenteral nutrition.</description>
