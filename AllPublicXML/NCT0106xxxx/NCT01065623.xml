          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal functions as assessed by the following
             laboratory requirements to be conducted within 14 days prior to start of first dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cardiac disease: congestive heart failure (CHF) &gt; NYHA Class II; myocardial
