  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zinc deficiency is a widespread public health problem in developing countries. The true
      prevalence of this condition remains uncertain because of lack of a specific, sensitive and
      reliable biomarker for assessment of human zinc status. The most widely used indicator for
      measuring zinc status is serum zinc level, which, however, is homeostatically regulated and
      influenced by stress and infection. To explore the possibility of using mRNA levels of zinc
      responsive genes as an indicator of zinc status, Cao and Cousins suggested metallothionein
      (MT) mRNA level in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells as an indicator of recent
      zinc uptake. However, the usefulness of MT mRNA is also limited because its level is
      influenced by other metals, such as copper, cadmium and cobalt and it is also affected by
      stress. Several authors have proposed that expression of zinc transporter genes might be
      useful markers of Zn status. Evidence shows reduction in dietary zinc content produces a
      marked increase in intestinal absorption and decrease in intestinal zinc losses. As zinc
      homeostasis is regulated in the intestine, study of the zinc transporters in this organ may
      provide indication of recent zinc uptake. Recently, a few studies have begun to investigate
      the applicability of using white blood cell zinc transporter expression as an indicator of
      zinc status and found that some of the transporters are zinc responsive. The primary
      objective of this study is to explore whether the expression of zinc responsive genes, such
      as zinc transporters in human intestinal mucosal cells, can be used as indicators of zinc
      status. The specific aims are to compare gene expression in: a) intestinal mucosal cells
      obtained by duodenal biopsy, b) sloughed intestinal mucosal cells isolated from feces, and c)
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in fasting individuals who are receiving their
      usual diet + placebo or their usual diet + supplemental zinc (20 mg/d for 7 days). Gene
      expression values from intestinal mucosal cells (biopsy) will be compared between the placebo
      and zinc supplemented groups. Similar comparison will be done in the cells isolated from
      stool and PBMCs. This study will also provide an opportunity to compare the relative
      responsiveness of gene expression and serum zinc concentration following supplementation and
      to explore the kinetics of any changes in serum zinc concentration. Thus, blood samples will
      be obtained for measuring serum zinc concentration on two occasions prior to the
      interventions and at specified intervals during and after the intervention.
