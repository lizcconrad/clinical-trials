    <textblock>
      The objectives of this survey are: 1) To examine the safety/efficacy profile of Januvia in
      Korean participants, and 2) To identify factors that might have an influence on the safety
      and efficacy profile of Januvia in Korean participants.

      Post-marketing surveys are not considered applicable clinical trials and thus the results of
      this survey will not be posted at its conclusion. The results will be submitted to public
      health officials as required by applicable national and international laws.
