      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of the combination of the two
      drugs cediranib and temsirolimus and the highest doses of these two drugs that can be given
      in combination to people safely. Cediranib is a drug that may stop blood supply to the tumor
      and therefore help keep cancer cells from growing. Temsirolimus is a drug that may stop
      cancer cells from growing. These drugs have been used in other research studies in ovarian
      and kidney cancer and these studies suggest that these drugs may help to keep cancer from
      growing in this research study.

      -  We are looking for the highest dose of the study drugs that can be administered safely
           without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have recurrent
           gynecological cancers. Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive
           the same dose of the study drug.

        -  There will be samples of blood taken that measure any additional effect of the study
           drugs and to look for a marker for the participant's particular type of cancer. Blood
           will be taken at a certain point in the study to evaluate the interaction of the two
           study drugs, cediranib and temsirolimus when given together. These are called
           pharmacokinetic (PK) samples. About 6 teaspoons of blood will be taken with each PK
           sample with a total of 34 samples taken.

        -  Participants will be given a study medication diary for each treatment cycle. Each cycle
           lasts four weeks (28 days). Temsirolimus will be given on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each
           cycle. Cediranib wil be taken orally once daily in the morning.

        -  Participants will be asked to monitor their blood pressure on a daily basis at home and
           keep a blood pressure diary.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at specific time periods during the
           course of the study: medical history; side effect assessment; physical exam; vital
           signs; blood tests; CT scan; MUGA or ECHO; EKG and urine test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic endometrial cancer

          -  Patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian and peritoneal cancer

          -  Patients with recurrent cervical cancer

          -  Patients may have either measurable or non-measurable disease

          -  Up to one prior line of chemotherapy in the recurrent setting is allowed. Biologic
             therapies will be considered as a prior line but hormonal therapies do not count.

          -  No prior VEGF inhibitor therapy allowed.

          -  Toxic side effects related to prior chemotherapy or hormonal therapy must have
             resolved to less than or equal to grade 1 or to baseline (excluding alopecia), or for
             peripheral neuropathy to less than or equal to grade 2.

          -  Subjects may begin AZD2171 and temsirolimus at least 3 weeks after their last dose of
             chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, assuming they are otherwise eligible.

          -  At present, the potential of AZD2171 for clinically significant drug interactions
             involving the CYP isozymes is unknown. Eligibility of patients receiving any
             medication or substances known to affect or with teh potential to affect the activity
