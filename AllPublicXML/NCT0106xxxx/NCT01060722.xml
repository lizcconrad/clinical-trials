             administration.

          -  Subjects who have received any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  Subjects who donated blood in the three months or received blood or plasma derivatives
             in the six months preceding study drug administration.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial with drugs within 3 months prior to dosing
             (calculated from the previous study's last dosing date).

          -  Subjects with an inability to communicate well with the investigators and CRC staff
             (i.e., language problem, poor mental development or impaired cerebral function).
