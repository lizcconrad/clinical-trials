  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that 6 weeks of repetitive handgrip exercise will improve endothelial
      function and venous compliance in pre-dialysis patients with an estimated glomerular
      filtration rate of less than or equal to 20 ml/min. If proven correct then arm exercise might
      be useful to improve the success rate for a surgically created arteriovenous fistula in the
      forearm to become usable as a vascular access for hemodialysis.

    <textblock>
      An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the optimal vascular access for chronic hemodialysis.
      However, AVFs frequently fail to mature. Better strategies are needed to promote AVF
      maturation. Successful AVF maturation involves arterial and venous dilation. Arterial
      dilation depends on endothelial release of nitric oxide which can be measured by brachial
      artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and has been reported to predict successful AVF
      maturation. Venous dilation depends on venous compliance which can be measured by venous
      plethysmography and is also predictive of successful AVF maturation. Endothelial function is
      impaired in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aerobic exercise has been reported to
      improve endothelial function and venous compliance but it has not been studied in the
      pre-dialysis patient. To address this question we will determine whether 6 weeks of
      repetitive handgrip exercise with upper arm venous compression can improve brachial artery
      endothelial function or venous compliance in pre-dialysis patients with an estimated
      glomerular filtration rate of less than or equal to 20 ml/min.
