    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study ovarian reserve after laparoscopic endometrioma
      cystectomy by measuring antimullerian hormone. The measurements were measured before the
      surgery and one week and three months after the surgery.

      Antimullerian hormone will be obtained in patients with ovarian endometrioma before
      laparoscopic cystectomy is done. The measurements were compared with antimullerian hormone
      after one week and three months after the surgery. Forty three patients will be included in
      this study.
