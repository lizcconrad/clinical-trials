    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of oxygenation and
      patient-acceptability of a novel oxygen face mask in patients undergoing carotid
      endarterectomies (CEAs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a procedure to remove plaques from a carotid artery (one of
      the two main arteries supplying blood to the brain). The procedure is effective at reducing
      the risk of subsequent stroke. To access the artery, an incision is made in the artery wall
      which means that the artery must be clamped in order to prevent blood loss. Consequently, the
      blood supply (and therefore oxygen supply) to the brain is reduced. To ensure that the
      patient has sufficient oxygen to avoid brain damage, this procedure is often carried out
      under local anaesthetic as this means the anaesthetist can talk to them during the operation;
      by this means they can determine the patient's conscious level and whether or not they need
      supplementary oxygen.

      There are various ways to administer the supplementary oxygen. Most oxygen masks completely
      cover the mouth and nose which inevitably limits patient-doctor communication. Oxygen is
      therefore usually administered via nasal tubes. However, the actual level of oxygen taken in
      by the patient is very hard to measure, and at best is only 40%.

      A novel mask with an open design. By creating a 'vortex' of oxygen it can deliver higher
      concentrations of oxygen to the patient without significantly interfering with doctor-patient
      communication and, at the same time, improving patient comfort.

      We wish to test the efficacy of this mask during CEA and plan to do this by measuring the
      oxygen content of blood directly using blood samples; we also monitor markers of brain damage
      which may occur from lack of oxygen. Finally, we will survey the patients as to acceptability
      of the mask.
