      RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. Giving vorinostat together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when
      given together with cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage III or
      stage IVa squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx which is either unresectable or borderline
      resectable.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of Vorinostat in combination with concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advance stage OPSCC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. To determine the complete response rate, overall survival and progression free survival
      using the maximally tolerated dose of Vorinostat.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess treatment related acute and late toxicities when combining Vorinostat with
      chemoradiation and correlate these toxicities to molecular markers of apoptosis in tumor and
      normal oral mucosa.

      II. To evaluate the effect of Vorinostat on tumor immune surveillance, particularly in HPV
      positive patients.

      III. To illustrate that Vorinostat alters the methylation status of commonly methylated genes
      in OPSCC.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat. Patients receive oral vorinostat on
      days 0-2 and cisplatin IV on days 7, 21, and 35. Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week
      beginning on day 7. Patients also receive concurrent oral vorinostat along with the
      radiotherapy to be given 3 days per week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). Treatment
      continues for 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
