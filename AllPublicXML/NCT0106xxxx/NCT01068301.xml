  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory hematologic malignancies, including those who develop recurrent
      disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have a dismal
      prognosis. Historically, both regimen-related mortality and disease recurrence have been
      significant causes of treatment failure in this heavily pre-treated patient population. Novel
      therapeutic agents that target molecular signaling mechanisms and increase the sensitivity of
      leukemic cells to apoptosis may clearly play a role in this setting.

      This study hypothesizes that interrupting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis using the selective CXCR4
      antagonist plerixafor may be useful as a leukemic stem cell mobilizing agent for patients who
      are refractory to standard dose chemotherapy and in relapse after an allogeneic transplant.
      This hypothesis is based on the dependence of leukemia cells on MSCs for survival signals as
      described above and on the preclinical data that suggest increased efficacy by antileukemia
      agents when leukemia cells are separated from MSCs.

      In the present trial, the study proposes to add plerixafor to enhance the conditioning
      regimen cytotoxicity. At this time the goal is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of plerixafor through the process of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation. Pharmacokinetic
      studies will be conducted. Additional studies will quantify and the content of leukemia cells
      and key regulatory and effector T cell populations in the bone marrow and blood before and
      after exposure to this medication.

      If the observed outcomes of this trial are promising, it could serve as a platform on which
      to study further use of plerixafor as a complimentary agent with conditioning as well as
      other chemotherapeutic regimens for patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic
      malignancies.

      This study will determine the following objectives:

        1. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
           plerixafor in combination with fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan as a conditioning
           regimen for children and young adults undergoing a second allogeneic stem cell
           transplant (SCT) procedure.

        2. The study determines the secondary objectives:

             -  To describe the pharmacokinetic properties of plerixafor in this study population

             -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse and overall survival in study
                participants at one year after this second transplant procedure

        3. Other exploratory objectives include:

             -  To study the correlation between the pharmacokinetic properties of plerixafor and
                key regulatory and effector T cell populations in blood before and after exposure
                to plerixafor.

             -  To evaluate the content of leukemia cells in bone marrow and in blood before and
                after exposure to plerixafor

             -  To evaluate key regulatory and effector T cell populations in bone marrow and in
                blood before and after exposure to plerixafor

    <description>Plerixafor in combination with fludarabine, thiotepa and melphalan as a conditioning regimen for patients undergoing a second allogeneic transplant procedure (bone marrow or peripheral blood). A traditional 3+3 phase I design will be employed during this study, where dose escalations are planned in groups of 3 participants. No intra-participant escalation will be allowed and dose escalation will not be considered until toxicity information is available from at least 3 evaluable participants at the current dose level.Plerixafor will be given intravenously (IV) rather than subcutaneously (SQ) to minimize discomfort associated with repeated daily injections (up to 3) to the pediatric population of this study.</description>
