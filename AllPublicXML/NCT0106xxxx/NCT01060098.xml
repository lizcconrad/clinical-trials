  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory arthritis particularly rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing
      spondylitis are potentially disabling conditions which cause joint pain, swelling and
      deformity and treatments are aimed at preventing these complications. Although treatment has
      improved with the advent of antiTNFalpha therapies, up to 30% of patients fail to respond to
      this treatment and in others, treatment is associated with significant side effects. The
      precise mechanisms of this remain unclear. In addition, there are no sensitive methods
      available to monitor or predict disease response to treatment aside from testing inflammatory
      markers in the blood. Understanding the mechanism of action and what governs response to
      antiTNF therapy will allow development of more specific therapies for inflammatory arthritis.
      Work in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis has characterised a novel cell type, Th17
      cells, important in the inflammatory cascade which are affected in a particular way by
      antiTNF therapies and may underpin their mechanism of action and side effects. We aim to
      translate these findings into patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions treated
      with anti-TNF therapy, such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Patients from
      rheumatology clinics within NHS trusts will be recruited. We will correlate disease activity
      assessed by clinical parameters, ultrasonography and questionnaires with biomarkers in the
      blood and target tissues, such as synovium and skin.
