      To detect differences in MR spectroscopy, diffusion weighted MR, diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI) or dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MR imaging between primary cervical tumors and
      normal cervical tissue.

    <textblock>
      At our institution, all patients receiving external beam and/or brachytherapy as part of the
      treatment of primary cervical cancer receive CT, PET, and MRI simulation scans as standard of
      care. Brachytherapy patients also receive weekly T1/T2 weighted MR simulation scans as part
      of their treatment planning.

      We propose the use of additional MR sequences to the standard T1/T2 weighted MR simulation
      scans. The data obtained from these additional sequences will be used for improving tumor
      delineation and obtaining prognostic information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have biopsy-proven newly diagnosed squamous cell cervical cancer (FIGO
             clinical stages IB2-IVA).

          -  Patients must be â‰¥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must be able to receive standard radiation therapy (external beam radiation
             and brachytherapy) with or without chemotherapy.

          -  Patients with distant metastatic disease are eligible provided the estimated survival
             of the patient is at least one year.

          -  Patients must be scheduled to undergo or have already undergone FDG-PET/CT imaging for
             clinical staging cervical cancer at Barnes-Jewish Hospital Clinical PET facility on
             the Siemens Biograph 40 True Point Tomograph Scanner or elsewhere in the WUSM Nuclear
             Medicine department using the quality controls instituted by Nuclear Medicine.

          -  Patients must be able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with another known active malignancy.

          -  Patients who have received treatment for any malignancy (with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer) in the past 5 years.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding patients.

          -  Patients whose tumors are not FDG avid on baseline standard of care FDG-PET/CT
             imaging.

          -  Patients with contraindications to MRI scanning.
