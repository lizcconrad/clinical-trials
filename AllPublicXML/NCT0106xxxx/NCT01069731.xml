  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to quantitatively assess the development of non-nutritive suck (NNS)
      and feeding readiness in preterm infants using a novel device, the NTrainerÂ©, and to compare
      this with two clinical assessment tools, NOMAS and EFS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen minutes before feeding, the mobile NTrainer recording station will be positioned
      cribside. Following a brief exam of physiologic state, using the Oral Feeding Readiness
      Assessment portion of the EFS, the infant will be cradled in a supportive inclined posture,
      swaddled, with limbs positioned at midline, and background/overhead lighting dimmed in the
      area to promote eye contact with the tester. Sampling of NNS behavior will not be initiated
      until the infant is in an optimal behavioral state, i.e., drowsy to active alert (state 3 or
      4 or 5 as described by the Naturalistic Observation of Newborn Behavior, Newborn
      Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program; NIDCAP). The infant will be
      presented with the NTrainer pacifier, and several contiguous 30-second blocks of NNS nipple
      compression data will be sampled using the NeoSuck RT software. The infant will remain
      connected to the usual NICU monitors at all times for observation of respiration, heartbeat
      and oxygen saturation.

      After the NTrainer data collection is completed, the baby will be fed by his or her nurse or
      parents as directed in the care plan. If the baby is able to feed by mouth, one of the
      investigators will observe the feeding, and perform 1) a NOMAS evaluation during the first 2
      minutes of the feeding, and 2) an EFS assessment after the feeding is completed.

      Infants will be studied in 2 sessions each day beginning at Day 4 to 7 of life, then twice
      weekly (2 sessions per day, 2 days per week) until hospital discharge.

        Infants born prematurely may suffer multiple adverse events in the NICU, and these
        experiences may negatively impact normal developmental processes of immature
        cardiorespiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. As a result, many infants
        have at least transient difficulties learning to successfully manage oral feedings. Oral
        feeding difficulties in the NICU may prolong the time to discharge, cause significant
        parental anxiety, and persist throughout infancy.
