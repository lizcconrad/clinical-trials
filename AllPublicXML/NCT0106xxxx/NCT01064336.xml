      Since Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) affects women who are of reproductive
      capacity and taking into account the lack of data concerning Eltrombopag (Promacta) use
      during pregnancy, the Eltrombopag (Promacta) Registry will be an essential component of the
      ongoing risk management for Eltrombopag (Promacta). The Registry will detect and record the
      events (live births, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, elective terminations, therapeutic
      terminations, any serious pregnancy outcome, major and minor congenital anomalies, outcomes
      including preterm, small for gestation age, or intrauterine growth restriction adverse
      adverse effects on the following: immune system development, platelet number and function,
      neoplasm formation, bone marrow reticulin formation, thrombotic events) in the mother and/or
      the neonate/infant. The adverse events in the infant will be assessed through at least the
      first year of life. The Pregnancy Registry will compare the pregnancy and fetal outcomes of
      women exposed to eltrombopag Tablets during pregnancy to an unexposed control population.
      This study will be a prospective observational, exposure follow-up study.

      The outcomes of pregnancy are: live births, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, elective
      terminations, therapeutic terminations, any serious pregnancy outcome, major and minor
      congenital anomalies, outcomes including preterm, small for gestation age, or intrauterine
      growth restriction adverse effects on the following: immune system development, platelet
      number and function, neoplasm formation, bone marrow reticulin formation, thrombotic events
      in the mother and/or the neonate/infant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Documentation that Eltrombopag is being taken during pregnancy. Timing of the prenatal
        exposure to Eltrombopag (i.e. best estimation of which trimester in pregnancy that there
        was exposure to Eltrombopag for stratification and reporting purposes). Sufficient
        information to determine whether the pregnancy is being prospectively or retrospectively
        registered. Whether the outcome of pregnancy was known at the time of the report. Source of
        the report (i.e. health care professional, patient). Full provider contact information to
        allow for follow-up (name, address, etc.)
