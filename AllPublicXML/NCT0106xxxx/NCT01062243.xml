      The Brain Injury Inpatient Guide for Families and Caregivers (BIIG-FACS) is a comprehensive
      intervention to meet the needs of family members and significant others of patients who are
      undergoing acute, inpatient brain injury rehabilitation.

      The Brain Injury Inpatient Guide for Families and Caregivers (BIIG-FACS), developed by J.
      Niemeier and J. Kreutzer, is a comprehensive intervention to meet the needs of family members
      and significant others of patients who are undergoing acute brain injury rehabilitation.
      Program development was guided by considerable clinical experience, research review, and
      solicited consumer feedback.

      The intervention has been manualized to facilitate efficient and effective administration.
      Now, a rigorous investigation involving randomized assignment to treatment and control groups
      is needed to empirically examine outcomes. Helping family members to cope more effectively
      has the potential to improve outcomes for persons with ABI. Strengthening families can enable
      persons with ABI to live more independently, achieve greater community integration, and live
      healthier lives. The investigation serves as a logical next step forward in advancing our
      understanding of standardized interventions designed to serve the family unit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Family members/caregiver friends of patients with ABI will be eligible to participate
             in the present investigation. ABI is defined as damage to brain tissue caused by
             stroke, aneurysm, anoxia, non-progressive brain tumor, infection, or an external
             mechanical force as evidenced by: loss of consciousness, post traumatic amnesia (PTA),
             objective neurological findings, or skull fracture.

          -  Lacerations and/or bruises of the scalp or forehead without other criteria listed
             above will be excluded.

          -  All family member participants and patients must be at least 18 years of age or older
             and able to understand and provide consent (or assent in the case of the patients).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Family members at imminent risk of psychiatric hospitalization, or in imminent danger
             of hurting themselves or others, as judged by the investigators, will be excluded from
             the study.
