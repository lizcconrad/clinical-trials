    <measure>To measure the impact of different horizontal mandibular advancements, achieved through a stepped mouthpiece design, on the size of the upper airways in subjects with and without Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).</measure>
    <time_frame>one 60 minute session</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of the habitual mandibular position in (edge-to-edge, millimetres) relation to the front upper teeth</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of the upper airways through acoustic pharyngometry during slow and deep breathing while the subject uses a stepped mouthpiece. The acoustic pharyngometry measurement will be performed at mid inhalation</measure>
    <time_frame>one 60 minute session</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of the most comfortable position when using the stepped mouthpiece during both &quot;tidal&quot; and &quot;slow and deep breathing&quot;. The scoring of the &quot;comfortable position&quot; will be performed through a Likert-style questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>one 60 minute session</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The most &quot;comfortable position&quot; established as outlined above will be evaluated for comfort while holding that position for 3 minutes. After the 3 minutes, the subject's level of comfort will be re-evaluated through a Likert-style questionnaire</measure>

        The study will be performed as an open investigation including 60 subjects. The 60 subjects
        will be stratified such that 30 subjects should have been diagnosed with OSA, and 30
        subjects should not have been diagnosed with OSA.
