  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing of the population is a major event in the world. Gerontological/geriatric literature
      unanimously indicate that physical exercise and diet are at present the two available
      fundamental approaches to contrast/prevent most of the age associated alterations. In the
      elderly the inflammageing, the oxidative stress and the alteration of the intestinal
      microbiota can be influenced by nutritional status and possibly corrected by an appropriate
      dietetic intervention:

      Nowadays the nutraceutical food supplements become an opportunity for the consumer to improve
      the quality of individual diet for specific needs This study will focus on the development of
      a specific dietary approach through an E-Health dietary service, associated or not to
      nutraceutical food supplements intake, to modulate the oxidative stress, inflammageing and
      gut microflora in the elderly people.
