  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Same day discharge is safe and feasible in selected troponin negative patients undergoing
      coronary planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or ad hoc PCI via the transfemoral
      approach.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility and safety of same day discharge post PCI will be examined. Study data will
      be compared to national registries and national or regional databases of PCI in Troponin
      negative patients with overnight stay. As part of the registry we will also assess compliance
      with dual antiplatelet therapy at six months and at 1 year and will record any reasons for
      premature discontinuation as well as any associated adverse events.
