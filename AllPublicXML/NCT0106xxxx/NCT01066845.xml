    <textblock>
      To investigate the long-term safety and effectiveness of Adcirca (tadalafil) in Pulmonary
      Arterial Hypertension (PAH) patients in the clinical practice －focused topics－

        1. To evaluate the incidence of adverse events for the patients with long-term use

        2. To evaluate the incidence of adverse events of decreased blood pressure, bleeding
           (including uterine hemorrhage), visual disturbance and sudden hearing loss.
