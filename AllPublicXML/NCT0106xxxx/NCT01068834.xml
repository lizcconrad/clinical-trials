  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients prescribed statins to lower their cholesterol stop taking their statin over
      time. The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing subjects their KIF6 carrier
      status (associated with increased cardiovascular event risk) will improve adherence to statin
      medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) remains a significant problem in the US, causing about 1 of
      every 5 deaths in 2005. In 2009, approximately 1.3 million Americans will have a
      new/recurrent myocardial infarction. Coronary heart disease (CHD) includes myocardial
      infarction, stable or unstable angina, demonstrated myocardial ischemia detected by
      noninvasive testing, and a history of coronary artery procedures (such a stent or bypass).
      Currently, &quot;statins&quot; are recommended by the AHA to manage elevated low-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). Unfortunately, the discontinuation of statins is quite
      substantial. For example, a large cohort study of older patients found that 2-year statin
      adherence rates were approximately 40% for acute coronary syndrome patients, 36% for chronic
      coronary artery disease, and 25% for primary prevention and is associated with increased
      mortality, hospitalizations, and costs. Recently, the kinesin 6 (KIF6) gene has been
      associated with a 30-55% increase in cardiovascular events in individuals carrying one or two
      risk variants (~57% of the white population) in multiple prospective studies. Furthermore,
      KIF6 carriers receiving a &quot;statin&quot; have a substantial greater cardiovascular risk reduction
      (-34 to 50%) when using a &quot;statin&quot; compared to those that are non-carriers using a statin (6
      to 20%). In this prospective, open label, trial, recruited subjects recently started on
      statin therapy will be provided information about their KIF6 carrier status and followed for
      6 months to determine their &quot;statin&quot; adherence. Additionally, quality of life and factors
      adherence will be measured at baseline and after 6 months. Finally, pharmacy records will be
      evaluated for up to 1-year to determine statin discontinuation rates.
