  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the efficacy and safety profile of exenatide has been well established, few data
      exist on the real world results of exenatide treatment in specific populations and clinical
      settings. This study is intended to fill this gap through observing and collecting
      prospective data from a population of Italian patients initiating treatment with either
      exenatide or basal insulin formulations after failure to achieve glycemic control with oral
      antihyperglycemic agents (OHA).

      Observational studies represent noninterventional research; therefore, this study does not
      involve randomization of patients to particular comparator arms or therapies. The term
      &quot;noninterventional&quot; means that the healthcare providers decisions regarding the proper
      treatment and care of the patient are made in the course of normal clinical practice.
      Patients enrolled in this study are enrolling for the collection of their data on
      observations made during normal clinical practice.

        <title>Factor of Longer Duration of Diabetes Associated With Treatment Choice at Baseline</title>
        <description>The Factor of longer duration of diabetes at baseline (diagnosed 1 year longer) was analyzed for association with treatment choice at baseline. A total of 12 factors were evaluated. A multivariate logistic regression model using the full analysis set (FAS) population was performed for each of the factors to determine if exenatide treatment was more likely to be initiated in the presence of the specific factor. Duration of diabetes was measured in years since the date of diabetes diagnosis.</description>

          <title>Factors of Higher Creatinine, Higher Fasting High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol, Higher Fasting Cholesterol, and Higher Fasting Triglycerides Which Were Associated With Treatment Choice at Baseline</title>
          <description>Factors of higher creatinine: 1 milligram per deciliter higher (mg/dL) and higher fasting lipids (HDL cholesterol: 1 mg/dL higher; total cholesterol: 1 mg/dL higher; triglycerides: 1 mg/dL higher) were analyzed for association with treatment choice at baseline. A total of 12 factors were evaluated. A multivariate logistic regression model using the full analysis set (FAS) population was performed for each of the factors to determine if exenatide treatment was more likely to be initiated in the presence of the specific factor. Creatinine and fasting lipids were measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).</description>
          <population>Full analysis set (FAS) population: all patients who provided consent to release information and who fulfilled the study entry criteria. FASS=444 and 438 in each arm respectively but the number of patients with creatinine and fasting lipids data at baseline varied. N is presented with each category.</population>
