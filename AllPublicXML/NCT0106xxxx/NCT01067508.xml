  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research study is to determine by laboratory analyses the effects of drinking
      silicon-rich water on bone health. This will be determined from blood and urine samples from
      subjects who will be asked to drink 1 liter per day of either silicon-rich water or water
      without silicon for 12 weeks.

    <measure>To measure changes in 12 weeks of biomarkers of bone formation and bone resorption, blood levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and urinary silicon.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess whether the silicon in Fiji water increases bone formation parameters and/or reduces the bone resorption parameter, thus suggesting a benefit in bone health.</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30

          -  Postmenopausal women with no evidence of osteoporosis by dual energy X-ray
             absorptiometry (DEXA) scan (T ≥ -2 in the total hip and lumbar spine).

          -  Pre- or peri-menopausal women with osteopenia but no evidence of osteoporosis by DEXA
             scan (−1.5 ≤ T ≤ −2 in the total hip and lumbar spine)

          -  No estrogens or corticosteroids

          -  No prior history of bisphosphonate medication

          -  Otherwise in good health with no significant illnesses which could affect bone
             metabolism such as hypercortisolism, untreated hypothyroidism, treatment with statins
             or other drugs affecting bone metabolism other than calcium and vitamin D3.

          -  No change in exercise regimen or calcium intake in the past 3 months.

          -  Subject must sign the Institutional Review Board-approved written informed consent
             prior to the initiation of any study specific procedures or randomization. A subject
             will be excluded for any condition that might compromise the ability to give truly
             informed consent for participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Males

          -  Premenopausal women with DEXA T scores ≥ -1.5 or ≤ -2.

          -  Postmenopausal women with DEXA T scores ≤ -2.
