  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  In the formative stage of the project, we have investigated through qualitative and
           quantitative studies to identify a potential intervention to promote partner referral
           for sexually transmitted patients in Bangladesh.

        -  We conducted a quasi-randomised trial to evaluate if single session counseling is
           effective in improving partner referral for patients with sexually transmitted
           infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a quasi-randomized trial, alternating partner referral counselling and standard
      of care approach for each subsequent patient. First patients was randomly assigned by the
      project research physician in each clinic then alternative patients allocation was maintained
      by the study interviewers assigned in each clinic. For index cases assigned to the
      counselling arm, a same sex counselor conducted 10-15 minutes individualized sessions.
      Counselors were specifically trained to deliver partner referral counselling focusing on five
      issues related to STI prevention and transmission: (1) risk of re-infection if partners are
      not treated concurrently; (2) risk of developing complications; (3) risk of further spread of
      infection in the community; (4) the asymptomatic nature of infection; and (5) social
      obligations and personal coping with an STI. Patients in the standard care group received the
      existing services in the respective clinics, which included clinical consultation,
      prescription for medication but there was no partner referral counselling per se. In the
      public clinics, both the counselling and non-counselling group of clients received free
      medications, while in the NGO clinics they received subsidized fee medications. Both groups
      also received standard, pre-tested anonymous partner referral cards along with a short
      briefing by the interviewers that index clients need to hand over this card to their
      partner(s) to bring them to the respective clinics for assessment of STI status. Partner
      referral cards were used to follow-up partner referral by tracking the patient identification
      number and disease code of cards provided by referred patients. In addition, referral cards
      were useful for the partners to locate the study clinic, to be entitled to free or subsidized
      medication, and to distinguish the partners from index cases coming to the clinics.
