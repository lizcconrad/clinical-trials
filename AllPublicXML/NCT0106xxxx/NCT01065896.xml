  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although conventional risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) have been identified and
      routinely used to determine risk for CHD in the general population, a systematic approach to
      determine population-specific risk for CHD has not been performed prospectively in those with
      SCI. CHD is a leading cause of death in spinal cord injury, occurring at younger ages than in
      the able-bodied population. Conventional risk factors for CHD are high serum concentrations
      of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), low serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL),
      diabetes mellitus (DM), positive smoking history, and positive family history of premature
      CHD.

      Coronary calcification (CAC) is a commonly occurring phenomenon that does not necessarily
      indicate significant obstructive disease. Studies have shown that a strong association exists
      between coronary calcification and coronary heart disease. The purpose of this study is to
      compare the CAC scores in persons with SCI with a historical control group of able-bodied
      persons from a national data base who will be matched for conventional risk factors for
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and to determine the relationship between CAC scores and
      conventional and emerging risk factors for CAD.
