      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of treatment with NAC, compared to
      treatment with placebo, on cue- and methamphetamine (MA)-induced craving and MA subjective
      effects in non-treatment-seeking MA-dependent human volunteers. We also aim to determine the
      effects of treatment with NAC, compared to treatment with placebo, on the reinforcing effects
      of MA by measuring MA self-administration in non-treatment-seeking MA-dependent human
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) treatment is associated with reduced susceptibility to
      reinstatement of cocaine seeking behavior in rats (Baker et al 2002) and with reduced
      cue-induced craving in cocaine-dependent human volunteers (LaRowe et al 2006). We propose
      these aims to evaluate the potential of NAC as a treatment for methamphetamine (MA)
      dependence: Specific Aim 1: To determine the effects of treatment with NAC(placebo, 1800 and
      3600mg daily), compared to treatment with placebo, on cue- and MA-induced craving and MA
      subjective effects in non-treatment-seeking MA-dependent human volunteers. We hypothesize
      that treatment with NAC will reduce craving for MA reported following exposure to MA cues and
      will reduce craving and MA subjective effects reported following non-contingent
      administration of MA (0mg,9mg, and 30 mg, IV). Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of
      treatment with NAC (placebo, 1800 and 3600mg daily), compared to treatment with placebo, on
      the reinforcing effects of MA by measuring MA self-administration in non-treatment-seeking
      MA-dependent human volunteers. We hypothesize that treatment with NAC will reduce the number
      of choices made for MA during choice sessions.

    <description>On days 3-5, participants will take part in active cues and neutral cues. On days 4 and 5, they will make choices to receive MA/placebo in a self-administration paradigm. Participants will also rate craving, desire, and would take MA if available on a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale.</description>

    <measure>The effects of treatment with NAC (placebo, 1800 and 3600 mg daily), compared to treatment with placebo, on the reinforcing effects of MA by measuring MA self-administration in MA-dependent human volunteers.</measure>
    <description>On days 4 and 5, participants will make choices to receive MA/placebo in a self-administration paradigm. Any alterations in the reinforcing effects of MA associated with NAC treatment will be evident as changes in the number of choices made for MA.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be English-speaking non-treatment-seeking volunteers.

          -  Be between 18-55 years of age.

          -  Meet DSM-IV TR criteria for MA dependence.

          -  Have a self-reported history of using MA by the smoked route.

          -  Have vital signs as follows: resting pulse between 50 and 90 bpm, blood pressures
             between 85-150mm Hg systolic and 45-90mm Hg diastolic.

          -  Have a breathalyzer test indicating an undetectable blood alcohol level upon
             admission.

          -  Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within normal (+/- 10%) limits
             with the following exceptions: a) liver function tests (total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and
             alkaline phosphatase) &lt; 3 x the upper limit of normal, and b) kidney function tests
             (creatinine and BUN) &lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal.

          -  Have a baseline ECG that demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, normal conduction, and no
             clinically significant arrhythmias.

          -  Have a medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no clinically
             significant contraindications for study participation, in the judgment of the
             admitting physician and the principal investigator. Adult ADHD is allowable, as long
             as symptoms do not interfere with participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any previous medically adverse reaction to MA, including loss of consciousness,
             chest pain, or epileptic seizure.

          -  Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as: a. episode of major depression
             within the past 2 years as assessed by MINI; b. lifetime history of schizophrenia,
             other psychotic illness, or bipolar illness as assessed by MINI; c. current organic
             brain disease or dementia assessed by clinical interview; d. history of or any current
             psychiatric disorder which would require ongoing treatment or which would make study
             compliance difficult; e. history of suicide attempts within the past year and/or
             current suicidal ideation/plan. f. history of psychosis occurring in the absence of
             current MA use.

          -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for abuse or dependence on alcohol or other drugs, except for
             nicotine.

          -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for dependence on marijuana.

          -  Have evidence of clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined
             by the PI.

          -  Have evidence of untreated or unstable medical illness including: neuroendocrine,
             autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or active infectious disease.

          -  Have HIV and are currently symptomatic, have a diagnosis of AIDS, or are receiving
             antiretroviral medication.

          -  Be pregnant or nursing. Other females must either be unable to conceive (i.e.,
             surgically sterilized, sterile, or post-menopausal) or be using a reliable form of
             contraception (e.g., abstinence, birth control pills, intrauterine device, condoms, or
             spermicide). All females must provide negative pregnancy urine tests before study
             entry, upon hospital admission, and at the end of study participation.

          -  Currently use alpha or beta agonists, theophylline, or other sympathomimetics.

          -  Have any other illness, condition, or use of medications, which in the opinion of the
             P.I. and/or the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion
             of the study.

          -  Have sulfur allergy.

        Criteria for Discontinuation Following Initiation:

        Participants will be discharged if they have a positive urine toxicology or breath test
        indicating illicit use of drugs while on the Research Commons, if they do not comply with
        study procedures, or if they do not tolerate MA. MA will not be administered if
        participants do not continue to meet inclusion criteria listed above or if the study
        physician believes there may be any reason to withhold MA.

        Rationale for Subject Selection Criteria:

        Participants are required to have used MA by the intravenous route in order to avoid
        exposing participants to new routes of administration. Participants with asthma or who take
        medications for asthma are excluded due to potential adverse interactions between treatment
        medications and MA. Participants who use alcohol heavily are excluded due to the potential
        of withdrawal symptoms in the hospital. Participants with active HIV disease are excluded
        to avoid potentially exacerbating their underlying illness.
