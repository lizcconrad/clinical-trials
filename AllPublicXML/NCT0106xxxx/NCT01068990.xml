  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observation study for lower respiratory tract infections in
      medical intensive care unit. Microbiologic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of
      patients with severe pneumonia in medical intensive care unit will be monitored and analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients admitting medical ICU will be monitored for pneumonia. Both community-acquired
      (including health-care associated pneumonia) and hospital-acquired pneumonia will be
      included. Collecting data will include patient demographic characteristics, clinical
      features, microbiological characteristics including molecular work, and outcome.
