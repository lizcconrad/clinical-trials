      The main aim of the study is to determine whether a homeopathic drug in the potency C12
      provokes more characteristic homeopathic proving symptoms after three weeks compared to a
      placebo in healthy volunteers.

      Secondary aims are to develop and to test a qualitative analysis methodology on which to base
      a definition for drug-specific (characteristic) symptoms and to compile a profile of
      characteristic homeopathic proving symptoms of the drug being trialled for therapeutic
      purposes.

      This study protocol adapts the traditional homeopathic drug proving methodology to a modern
      clinical trial design.

    <description>Subjects in the intervention group are instructed to take five globules of the trial drug (potency C12), five times per day for a maximum of five days (5×5×5). The study medication is obtained from DHU (Germany), produced according to the Hahnemannian method. Subjects are asked to stop taking the medication, in agreement with their investigator, if they experience any of a predefined set of proving symptoms</description>
