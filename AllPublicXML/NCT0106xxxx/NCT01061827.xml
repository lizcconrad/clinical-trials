  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major public health issues of today's aging population is the development of knowledge and
      expertise in geriatric medicine and psychiatry of the elderly. The depressive disorders and
      dementia, are among the psychiatric conditions most common in older age. They are the subject
      of much clinical research, in which brain imaging techniques used to establish correlations
      anatomo-clinical and radiological-clinical. The prerequisite for the realization of such work
      locally, is the validation in their French version of clinical assessment tools most commonly
      used internationally, ensuring reliability, acceptability and comparability of results. Among
      these tools, &quot;Geriatric Mental Schedule (GMS) Package&quot;, is the reference tool for research in
      psychiatry of the elderly. It is a standardized and structured questionnaire that allows to
      establish with reliability and reproducibility on the basis of answers to questions, major
      psychiatric diagnoses in the elderly. It has been validated in several languages (German,
      Spanish, Italian, Dutch, but also Chinese, Korean ...), but is still not available in French.

      Hypothesis: Validate the the French version of &quot;Geriatric Mental Schedule (GMS) Package&quot;, to
      establish diagnoses of dementia and depressive disorders.
