  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reducing drug side effects is a key issue in transplantation. One class of drugs commonly
      used, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), is associated with negative side effects, namely,
      toxicity to the transplanted kidney. In some patients, this toxicity is thought to be
      associated with loss of transplant function in those who have had their transplants for many
      years. The introduction of new immunosuppression medications however, has provided the
      opportunity to minimize or avoid CNIs, which may reduce the occurrence of toxicity to the
      kidney.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is clear that minimizing the use of CNIs may be beneficial to some or all kidney
      transplant recipients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether minimization of
      these CNI drugs will improve patient survival rates and long-term kidney function.

      If the subject agrees to participate in this research project, they will be randomly assigned
      to one of two different immunosuppression drug combinations. All of the drugs used in this
      study are standard FDA Approved immunosuppressive drugs currently in use by transplant
      patients. It is unclear however, which combination provides a better long-term outcome.

      If after six months of being on the study the subject has not experienced a rejection episode
      that excludes them from participating in the second phase of this study, they will asked
      whether or not they would like to continue the study. If they decide to participate in Phase
      II, there will be another randomization to one of two different immunosuppression drug
      combinations. This will involve either being assigned to a group that will have their CNI
      dose lowered or a group that will have their CNI drug stopped and replaced with a non-CNI
      drug called Sirolimus. Phase II begins at 6 months post-transplant and a second consent will
      be obtained for those who participate in Phase II.
