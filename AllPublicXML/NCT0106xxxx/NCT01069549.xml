  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      India is the &quot;Diabetes Capital of the World&quot; with 41 million Indians having diabetes, with
      every fifth diabetic in the world being an Indian and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
      constitutes the major chunk of diabetes. One of the most severe complications of diabetes is
      the development of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. There are many identifiable risk factors of
      diabetic nephropathy like hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and proteinuria, the
      genetic factor is the main among all. Long-term observational studies show that nearly 30-35%
      of type 2 diabetic patients develop nephropathy, irrespective of glycemic control. The
      regional variation in diabetes prevalence and in the proclivity for diabetes induced renal
      disease; along with reports of familial clustering of nephropathy suggest a possible genetic
      basis. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of
      progressive renal diseases. In addition, the blockage of angiotensin II with either ACE
      inhibitor or an angiotensin type-I receptor antagonist has been found to prevent or delay the
      progression of renal injury associated with diabetes 5 and now these drugs are first-choice
      drugs for the treatment of diabetic subjects with hypertension. The genes encoding the
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensinogen
      (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), have been reported to be the most probable
      candidate genes for diabetic nephropathy. As there is no data available for AGTR1
      polymorphism and DN in the north Indian T2DM, its out attempt to fill the scientific gap.
