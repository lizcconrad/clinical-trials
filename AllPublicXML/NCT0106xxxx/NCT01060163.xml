  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of platelet aggregation inhibitors, including aspirin and clopidogrel(CPDG), has
      become a standard management strategy for patients with acute coronary syndrome. On this
      background, an increasing percentage of patients presenting for surgical coronary
      revascularization is the subject to irreversible platelet inhibition.

      Investigations on the effect of antiplatelet treatment on postoperative bleeding after
      cardiac surgery have shown that patients treated with antiplatelet agents until surgery have
      increased postoperative bleeding, and also an increased need for transfusions of blood
      products. As a result of the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, the frequency of serious
      bleeding complications has increased significantly, as seen in patients requiring coronary
      artery bypass grafting(CABG), especially when they received clopidogrel until surgery.

      Tranexamic acid(TA) is a widely used antifibrinolytic agent, and is a promising substitute
      for aprotinin when the latter has seceded in 2007.The release of plasmin during
      cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) activates fibrinolysis and may contribute to platelet
      dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of the fibrinolytic system may therefore ameliorate
      platelet dysfunction and fibrinolysis after CPB and decrease postoperative bleeding.
      Tranexamic acid prevents plasmin formation and inhibits fibrinolysis.

      Concerning the cessation of aprotinin and the increasing proportion of patients with
      persistence on clopidogrel until their surgery, evolutional work is expected, especially in
      the eastern population.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with
      clopidogrel and asprin ingestion until surgery. The investigators working hypothesis was that
      tranexamic acid would lower postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in these
      patients and would attenuate bleeding complication of antiplatelet therapy.
