    <textblock>
      A double blind placebo controlled Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of the Live Attenuated Tetravalent (G1-G4) Bovine-Human Reassortant Rotavirus Vaccine
      [BRV-TV]in Indian infants. The study would be carried out in 90 healthy infants. Three doses
      of the rotavirus vaccine or placebo would be administered orally to each infant at 6-8, 10-12
      and 14-16 weeks of age. The rotavirus vaccine would be administered at one of the two planned
      virus concentrations (10e5.5 or 10e6.25 FFU of each constituent serotype per 0.5 ml). Each
      administration of the vaccine/placebo would be preceded by oral administration of 2.0 mL of
      antacid.
