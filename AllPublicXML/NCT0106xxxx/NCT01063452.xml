      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the Atkinson Product Design
      urinary slide valve on patient morbidity and freedom as measured by impact on activities of
      daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QOL). Secondary objectives include assessing the
      impact of the device on bacteruria and evaluating the impact of the primary treatment on ADL
      and QOL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several indications exist in urologic practice where urinary drainage via a urethral catheter
      is required and an estimated 4 million patients in the United States undergo urinary
      catheterization per year.(1) Though it is common for urine to be continually collected in a
      bag attached to the catheter by plastic tubing, catheter valves offer an alternative method
      of storing and voiding urine. Catheter valves are small devices that fit into the external
      end of the urethral catheter. Rather than continuous drainage, urine is stored in the bladder
      and emptied on regular intervals by opening the valve.

      This method of drainage may offer several benefits including preserving bladder capacity,
      function and tone, reducing catheter blockage in cases of urine bacterial colonization, and
      decreasing traction forces on the bladder neck by removing the downward weight of a
      collecting bag.(2-4) The use of a catheter valve may offer improvements in social functioning
      and mobility.(5) Studies to date suggest that catheter valves are well tolerated by patients,
      but these studies have used non-standardized questionnaires and have not assessed overall
      quality of life.(5, 6) Additionally, there may be an associated cost benefit to utilizing
      catheter valves compared to drainage bags.(5)

      Further study in this area, focusing on quality of life and social functioning, will enable
      the clinician to better counsel patients on the risks and benefits of the various methods of
      urinary drainage.
