      The purpose of this research study is to study a device called an electroencephalograph (EEG)
      in the diagnosis of treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults.
      People with ADHD have symptoms such as difficulty sustaining attention, organizing, and
      managing impulsivity. They can have trouble in school, at work, and at home. Subjects with
      ADHD who participate in this study will be given a once daily stimulant medication called
      osmotic release methylphenidate (Concerta) for 6 weeks, and have EEG testing done before and
      after the treatment period. Subjects will perform a computer based cognitive task during EEG
      testing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved osmotic release methylphenidate
      (Concerta) for the treatment of ADHD in adults and children. Similar procedures, without
      medication, will be performed with a sample of healthy adults without ADHD.

    <description>An 18-item scale rating a subject's level of impairment from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) for each symptom of DSM-IV ADHD, with a maximum possible score of 54. The measure was collected at Baseline and 6 weeks, and a total score was calculated to gauge treatment response of ADHD subjects to open-label Concerta.</description>

    <measure>Percent Errors in Visual Go/NoGo Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Single Point (Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Go/NoGo visual task was completed by subjects with ADHD as well as healthy controls. The Go/NoGo task is used to assess inhibitory control, and targets response inhibition, executive functions, and sustained attention. The 'Go' stimulus occupies 80% of the trials, and requires the subject to perform a motor response each time it appears on the screen. A rare 'No Go' stimulus (occupies 20% of all trials) requires the subject to refrain from responding. The percentage of errors were measured for each group.</description>

Efficacy and tolerability assessments are completed, in addition to EEG and cognitive testing. Healthy adults without ADHD will not receive medication.</description>

        <title>Percent Errors in Visual Go/NoGo Task</title>
        <description>The Go/NoGo visual task was completed by subjects with ADHD as well as healthy controls. The Go/NoGo task is used to assess inhibitory control, and targets response inhibition, executive functions, and sustained attention. The 'Go' stimulus occupies 80% of the trials, and requires the subject to perform a motor response each time it appears on the screen. A rare 'No Go' stimulus (occupies 20% of all trials) requires the subject to refrain from responding. The percentage of errors were measured for each group.</description>
