      SUMMARY:

      The purpose of this study is to learn how to better educate patients about oral health
      procedures and treatments through an improved informed consent process. We will gather
      information from patients and health care providers, and design and test a computerized
      consent system called SmartConsent.

      HYPOTHESIS:

        1. Subjects who use SmartConsent will have increased knowledge (cognitive achievement)
           about oral health disease and treatment than patients who view the standard consent

        2. Subjects who use SmartConsent will have less decisional conflict in their decision
           regarding an oral health procedure than those who view the standard consent form

        3. Subjects who use SmartConsent will have greater visit satisfactions scores than those
           who view the standard consent form

      Communicating personalized information to patients about the risks, benefits and other
      critical information about dental disease and treatment is often difficult for providers. In
      this proposal we seek to develop a novel informed consent system that can accurately
      translate and communicate information to patients in a standardized and effective manner
      based on their diagnosis and prescribed treatment. We aim to integrate SmartConsent into the
      institutional electronic patient record (EPR). This research is translational as it seeks to
      determine how providers can better communicate information to patients so they can make
      appropriate decisions about dental treatments and options.

      The advent of electronic health records allows an informed consent document to be
      automatically personalized based on a patient's demographic profile, literacy level, language
      preference, and prior medical history. A computerized consent also allows the presentation of
      information in a format beyond text such as through the use of multimedia. Further, in a
      computer-based consent, we can quickly test a patient's knowledge about a diagnosis and
      procedure to ensure that key information has been delivered. In this proposal we seek to
      discover if a computer-based informed consent is more effective in educating patients about
      common oral health disease and treatment (e.g., reason for extracting a tooth, causes of
      periodontal disease, risks associated with dental implants). We also seek to determine its
      feasibility in a real clinical practice by measuring time taken and impact on workflow
      compared to the traditional consent process.
