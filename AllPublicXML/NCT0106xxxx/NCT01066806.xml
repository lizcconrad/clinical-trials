      SPECIFIC AIM The aim of this study is to determine if increasing calcium intake to
      recommended levels with dairy foods in adolescent females with habitually low calcium intake
      and above-the-median body mass index (BMI) for sex and age will decrease body fat gain
      compared to similar females who continue their low calcium intake. .

      HYPOTHESIS Post-menarcheal adolescent girls with habitually low calcium intake who consume
      dairy foods providing at least 1200 mg of calcium per day will have a smaller increase in
      percent body fat, as measured by dual energy absorptiometry, during one year than
      post-menarcheal adolescent girls on a usual diet of 600 mg of calcium per day or less.
