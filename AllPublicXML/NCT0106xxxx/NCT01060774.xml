  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing a local anesthetic (numbing medicine) to suppress pain. Bupivacaine and
      lidocaine are FDA approved local anesthetics that may decrease pain following surgery.
      Patients will receive either 2% lidocaine, 0.5% bupivacaine, or placebo with epinephrine
      1:200,000 as a numbing medicine at the end of root canal surgery. Small pieces of gum will be
      taken before and after surgery and 2 days later to analyze chemicals that may be related to
      pain sensation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the use of the LLA bupivacaine will promote local inflammation leading to
      increased pain and central sensitization as evaluated by increase in pain at later time
      points. Hence our main hypothesis to be evaluated and statistically tested for our primary
      endpoint (Aim 1) is:

      HO: There is no difference in mean levels of biochemical mediators of inflammation between
      groups.

      HA: The bupivacaine group has higher levels of biochemical mediators following surgery.
