  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether subjects following a high protein diet will
      gain less in weight after smoking cessation compared to subjects following a low fat diet due
      to the effects of protein on metabolic rate and hunger.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sustained smoking cessation is one of the most effective therapies to avoid premature
      morbidity and mortality. However, weight gain associated with nicotine withdrawal may
      attenuate some of the beneficial health effects and is cited as a major obstacle to quit
      smoking. The mechanism for the weight gain is not elucidated but reduced resting metabolic
      rate, reduced total energy expenditure, increased caloric intake and changes in fat
      metabolism may be involved. Elucidating effective strategies to prevent or reduce
      post-cessation weight gain may improve health outcomes of smoking cessation.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The high protein diet (25% energy from protein, 55% energy from fat, 20% energy from carbohydrate) will be hypo-caloric and achieved by restricting the amount of sugar containing foods and drinks, reducing the intake of bread, rice, pasta, fruits and fruit-juices and increasing the intake of vegetables (instead of bread, rice, pasta and potatoes) and increasing the amounts of protein (from chicken, fish, and meat) and fat from oil and dressings for lunch and dinner and by choosing nuts and protein-rich yoghurts, egg, cheese, chicken wings, shellfish, fish and fish products as snacks.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>The Low Fat Diet Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The low fat diet (30% energy from fat, 20% energy from protein, 50% energy percent from carbohydrate) will be hypo-caloric and achieved by choosing low-fat diary and meat products, restricting amounts of visible fat and fatty snacks and increasing intake of whole meal bread, muesli, brown rice, whole meal pasta in the main meals and by choosing yoghurt with muesli, oat porridge with milk, fruits and hard bread with jam and soft gout-cheese as snacks.</description>
