  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication after LAR with high morbidity and mortality
      rates. Early diagnosis and treatment is mandatory. The primary aim of the present study is to
      investigate the clinical use of peritoneal microdialysis and whether is able to detect
      anastomotic leakage prior to clinical symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing LAR for rectum cancer is subjected to peritoneal microdialyses during the
      postoperative period until the 7. postoperative day. Samples are collected every 4-hour.
      Samples will be analyzed continuously but the results will not be included in the clinical
      evaluation of the patient. Before removing the microdialysis catheter a CT whit rectal enema
      is preformed. Every day the patient will be evaluated whit a standardised clinical scoring
      system with attention at anastomotic leakage.

      A total of 150 patients will be included in this study. The results of the peritoneal
      microdialyses will be compared with the clinical scorings system in each patient. The results
      form the uncomplicated courses will be used to define the normal variations in peritoneal
      microdialysis. This will be compared to results from patients with various complications.

      The study is approved by the local scientific ethical committee No. ------
