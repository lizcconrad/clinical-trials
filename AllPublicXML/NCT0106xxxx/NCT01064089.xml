          2. Patient's disease must be evaluable using the RECIST criteria

          3. Patients must be 18 or older in Korea or 20 or older in Japan

          4. Patients must be relatively healthy as measured by their performance status

          5. Patients must have acceptable laboratory values as measured by blood tests

          6. Patients must be able to swallow capsules

          7. Patients must understand the study and give written permission to enter study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             inhibitor medicine

          3. Patients must not be classified as a &quot;poor or intermediate CYP2C9 metabolizer&quot; as
             measured using a sample of their blood

          4. Patients must have recovered from all previous anti-cancer therapy

          5. Patients must have finished taking their previous anti-cancer therapy before entering
             study
