      Background:

      - The CB1 receptor is a protein in the brain that is targeted by the active ingredients in
      cannabis (marijuana). Brain systems that react to cannabis may be involved in the causes and
      symptoms of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. For instance, research studies have
      shown that the number of CB1 receptors may be different in people with schizophrenia, and
      there may be differences in the receptors themselves. Researchers are interested in using
      positron emission tomography (PET) to study CB1 receptors in people with and without
      schizophrenia, using a chemical tracer that attaches specifically to CB1 receptors.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether the CB1 receptor brain protein is different in people with and without
      schizophrenia.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who either have been diagnosed with
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder or are healthy volunteers.

      Design:

        -  Participants in the study must have previously enrolled in the National Institute of
           Mental Health protocol A Neurobiological Investigation of Patients with Schizophrenia
           Spectrum Disorders and Their Siblings (95-M-0150).

        -  Participants will provide blood samples to test for the gene that contains information
           on the specific type of CB1 receptor each participant has.

        -  Participants will have a PET scan and/or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

        -  The PET scan will last approximately 2 hours. Participants will receive an injection of
           a small amount of chemical tracer to improve the quality of the images taken during the
           scan.

        -  The MRI scan will last approximately 1 hour.

    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder with a complex and multifactorial etiology.
      The exact pathophysiological mechanisms have remained elusive, but a large body of evidence
      points toward abnormalities in a number of brain neurotransmitter systems: dopamine,
      glutamate, and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Pharmacological studies have shown that acute
      exposure to cannabis is able to induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and
      exacerbate symptoms in patients with an established psychotic illness. In addition,
      epidemiological studies have established that cannabis use in early adolescence is associated
      with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia later in life. Together, this evidence
      suggests that the neural systems targeted by cannabis may be involved in the pathophysiology
      of schizophrenia.

      The brain endocannabinoid (EC) system is a recently discovered brain neurotransmission
      system, which involves endogenous cannabinoid agents (ECs) that act upon specific receptors
      (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptor is abundant in the human brain and acts as an inhibitory
      modulator of classical neurotransmitters. ECs and CB1 receptors appear to be involved in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. EC levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of
      patients with schizophrenia, and post-mortem studies have shown increased density of
      radioligand binding to brain CB1 receptors. To what extent CB1 receptors are involved in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia in the living human brain is currently unknown. The lack of
      suitable methods to reliably quantify CB1 receptors in the living human brain have to date
      hindered the progress in this field.

      In this protocol, we outline studies aiming at elucidating the role of CB1 receptors in
      schizophrenia by using positron emission tomography (PET) and the recently developed
      radiotracer for CB1 receptors, [18F]FMPEP-d(2). The aim of this project is to explore CB1
      receptor abnormalities in human patients with schizophrenia. The primary hypothesis is that
      CB1 receptor density is increased in patients with schizophrenia in comparison with healthy
      subjects. Insight into the role of CB1 receptor function in schizophrenia may help guide
      future development of pharmacotherapies.

        Patients with Schizophrenia:

          1. All subjects must be 18-55 years of age and be able to give written informed consent.

          2. All subjects must be healthy based on history and physical examination.

          3. Subjects must fulfill DSM-IV criteria (American Psychiatric Association 1987) for
             schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizo-affective disorder.

          4. About half of the patients with schizophrenia will be carriers of the C allele of the
             rs2023239 SNP and half will not.
