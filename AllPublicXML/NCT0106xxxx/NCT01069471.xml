      Healthy volunteers will receive a 2-dose vaccination with Shigella dysenteriae candidate
      vaccine spaced 8 weeks apart. The objective is to demonstrate the safety and reactogenicity
      of the Shigella dysenteriae bioconjugate vaccine (GVXN SD133) alone or in combination with an
      adjuvant (Aluminium Hydroxide). The safety and reactogenicity of the GVXN SD133 vaccine will
      be also evaluated at two different concentrations of antigen, Shigella polysaccharide O1.
      Blood samples will be collected at intervals to examine systemic vaccine antigen-specific
      immune responses.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of both sexes, aged between 18 and 50 years.

          -  Subjects who have undergone a detailed medical history, clinical checkup and are in
             good health.

          -  Subjects who have understood the purpose of the study and have freely signed the
             informed consent.

          -  Subjects who consent with repeated blood samples taking.

          -  Subjects who will be available to perform the follow-up visits, are reachable by
             telephone, and are able to complete the diary cards throughout the study duration.

          -  For female volunteers, a negative pregnancy test and an adequate contraception
             throughout the study duration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known history of recent contact Shigella infection or long-term residence in a
             Shigella endemic region (Central America, Africa, and India).

          -  Known history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine (EPA; Aluminium
             Hydroxide).

          -  Subjects with compromised immune system.

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  Chronic administration of an immunosuppressive treatment or other immune-modifying
             drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose.

          -  Subjects that received any other vaccine during the 1 month preceding the 1st
             injection and may receive before the 2nd injection. If the subject needs to be
             vaccinated during this period, he/she will be withdrawn from the study.

          -  Subjects suffering of a disease at the time of enrolment. 'Disease' is defined as the
             presence of a mild or severe illness with or without fever.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening
             tests.

          -  Any laboratory data collected during the screening phase found to be outside the
             normal range defined by the laboratory.

          -  Positive test for HIV, and evidence of HBV or HCV.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.

          -  History of alcohol, drug or psychotropic drug abuse (which interferes with a normal
             lifestyle) during the previous year.

          -  Subjects for which follow-up is compromised due to socio-cultural, geographic or
             psychological reasons.

          -  Any other significant finding that in the opinion of the Investigator that would
             increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participating in the study.

          -  Subjects that are participating or have participated in another clinical trial in the
             last 6 months.
