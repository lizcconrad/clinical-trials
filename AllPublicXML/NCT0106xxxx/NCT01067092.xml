    <textblock>
      The MATCH study (Mexican-American Trial of Community Health Workers) tests the hypothesis
      that the use of indigenous Community Health Workers (CHWs), recruited from the target
      community and trained to provide culturally appropriate diabetes education, can promote
      pro-active self-management among inner-city dwelling Mexican-Americans with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. The study aims are to demonstrate that a CHW, compared to an attention control,
      will: 1) result in improvement in short term physiologic outcomes (Hemoglobin A1c levels and
      blood pressure), and 2) result in increased frequency of self-management behaviors (daily
      self blood-glucose monitoring, medication adherence, adherence to diet and physical activity
      recommendations). The study design is a single site, partially blinded, randomized controlled
      trial of 144 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Eligibility criteria include a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, residence in target community
      areas in the Chicago area, and Mexican or Mexican-American ethnic heritage. Participants are
      randomized to either an experimental group receiving 36 home visits over a two year period in
      which a CHW delivered diabetes education and self-management skills training, or to an
      attention control consisting of 36 bilingual diabetes education newsletters covering the same
      curriculum as the CHWs. The curriculum covers recommended diabetes self-management behaviors
      including glucose self-monitoring, responding to abnormal blood glucose levels, working
      effectively with health care providers, medication adherence, foot care, daily physical
      activity, and reducing fat content of diet. CHWs also deliver training in behavioral skills
      of self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, engagement of social support, stress
      management, and problem-solving skills to facilitate the self-management activities.
      Consistent delivery of the CHW intervention is documented by audiotapes and Documentation of
      Intervention worksheets.
