  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After radical prostatectomy nerve damage in the pelvic floor usually occurs. This causes side
      effects in the form of incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

      It has previously been shown that one can stimulate the nerves of the pelvic floor by means
      of transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation (TMNS) done through vibration. This study will
      examine the effect of TMNS in the preservation and restoration of urinary continence and
      erectile function and in the treatment of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction in
      conjunction with radical prostatectomy.

      The theory is that by means of TMNS one can stimulate the nerves of the pelvic floor and the
      penis which may improve their function and there by prevent or minimize the occurrence of
      incontinence and erectile dysfunction following pelvic surgery. Vibration may also help to
      eliminate these symptoms once they have occurred. It is possible that TMNS will also directly
      increase the blood flow in the cavernosal tissue thus aiding in the preservation of this
      tissue. In case the improved nerve function is not great enough to secure satisfactory
      erectile function in itself it may still improve the effect of PDE-5-inhibitors.

      In pilot studies TMNS has already shown an effect in the treatment of urinary continence.

      In this study the patients will be randomized to either TMNS treatment or no TMNS treatment.
      In both groups the patients will participate in a pelvic floor muscle training program. In
      the group receiving active treatment this will be supplemented by TMNS treatment. The two
      groups will be evaluated and compared with regard to erectile function time to continence
      after surgery.

    <description>Device: Transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation by A medical vibrator (FERTI CARE personel, Multicept A/S, Albertslund, Danmark)
A medical vibrator (FERTI CARE personel, Multicept A/S, Albertslund, Denmark) will be used. The stimulation works through a vibrating disc of hard plastic with a diameter of 3.5 cm. The stimulation point will be the frenulum. A stimulation sequence consisting of 10 seconds of stimulation followed by a 10 second pause repeated 10 times will be used. The treatment will be initiated 1 to 4 weeks before the radical prostatectomy and re-initiated 0 to 14 days after the operation. The treatment will then continue for 6 weeks. The stimulation will be preformed daily by the patients in their own homes.</description>
