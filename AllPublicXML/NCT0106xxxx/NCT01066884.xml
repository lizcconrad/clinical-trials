    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the safety and efficacy of Tarceva monotherapy in patients
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will receive Tarceva 150mg p.o. daily. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size
      is 100-500 individuals.
