    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to compare reattachment rates among
      patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment who underwent scleral buckle surgery with
      retinopexy by cryotherapy versus postoperative (one month) laser photocoagulation.

      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to compare reattachment rates, visual
      acuity results and epiretinal membrane formation among patients with rhegmatogenous retinal
      detachment who underwent scleral buckle surgery with retinopexy by cryotherapy versus
      postoperative (one month) laser photocoagulation.

    <description>the cryopexy was performed by placement of a normal spherical probe under the bucklings, around the break. The number of cryo applications was limited in number of 3. Freezing was stopped at the beginning of retinal whitening.</description>

    <description>Laser-retinopexy was performed after proper positioning the patients; laser energy was delivered by depressing a foot pedal. Short burn duration (0.1 seconds) and low (300-miliWatts) power settings were used initially, and both the burn duration and power were gradually increased as determined by observation.</description>
