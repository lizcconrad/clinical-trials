    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate equivalence in terms of molecule removal between continuous
      hemodialysis using an &quot;enhanced middle molecule clearance&quot; membrane(Ultraflux EMiC2) and
      continuous hemofiltration using a standard membrane (Ultraflux AV1000S) in ICU patients
      requiring continuous renal replacement therapy.

    <textblock>
      In sepsis, the removal of middle molecular weight molecules such as cytokines (also called
      blood purification), has shown a great interest in intensive care during the last decades.
      Indeed, these cytokines are involved in the development of the multi-organ failure syndrome
      when patients are in septic shock. There is some evidence to suggest that extracorporeal
      therapies (hemofiltration-hemodialysis)are interesting tools to modulate the inflammatory
      response and to restore the immune homeostasis.

      However, hemodialysis using &quot;conventional&quot; membranes does not allow the removal of middle
      molecules. Conversely, high-volume hemofiltration is an appropriate therapy but it has a lot
      of drawbacks due to the high ultrafiltration rates (removal of beneficial small molecules,
      technical and economical issues due to the use of large amounts of fluid replacement).
      Finally, high cut-off hemofiltration has been reported to be associated with significant
      albumin loss.

      Therefore, continuous &quot;enhanced middle molecule clearance&quot; hemodialysis could be an
      interesting alternative, making possible the removal of these middle molecules without
      significant albumin loss and with some theoretical advantages (reduced cost due to the
      possibility to produce the dialysate from a water circuit, decreased nursing workload).

      The aim of this study is to assess the clearances of different kind of molecules (small,
      middle and large) when continuous enhanced middle molecule clearance hemodialysis is applied
      to septic patients.
