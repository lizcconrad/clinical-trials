    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to further evaluate the efficacy of two treatment
      regimens for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa. This is a randomized controlled
      study. Patients will be randomly assigned to an arm of the study.

      Histological studies suggest that HS is a disease of the follicles with apocrine involvement
      as a secondary event. The investigators have identified in a previous study that the Nd Yag
      laser is highly effective for decreasing the inflammation, pain, suppuration and frequency of
      recurrence of HS. Oral antibiotic therapy with Clindamycin and Rifampin has also been
      reported in previous studies to be a highly effective treatment regimen for HS and is
      commonly used by physicians in medical management of HS. The investigators would like to
      compare the efficacy of NdYag laser treatment combined with antibiotics versus treatment with
      antibiotics alone. The goal is to evaluate the success of these two treatment regimens on
      existent HS lesions as well as prevention of recurrence. There will be approximately 18
      people in this research study at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be at least 16 years old and weigh a minimum of 80lbs. Weight requirement is for the
             purpose of maintaining safe clindamycin and rifampin dosing regimens.

          2. Be otherwise healthy

          3. Have a diagnosis of HS

          4. Patients must have Hurley stage II HS, with one or more widely separated recurrent
             abscesses, with tract and scarring. Involvement should be bilateral and symmetric on
             axillae, inguinal regions or inframammary regions

          5. Agree to abide by the Investigator's guidelines regarding photosensitizing drugs

          6. Be able to understand the requirements of the study, the risks involved, and be able
             to sign the informed consent form

          7. Agree to follow and undergo all study-related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with HS Hurley stage I and III will be excluded from participation in the
             study

          2. Patients who are currently pregnant will not be able to take part in the study due to
             the unknown effects of antibiotics

          3. Concomitant use of systemic or topical treatments for HS not involved in current
             study. Patients must discontinue all forms of oral therapy as systemic and topical
             antibiotics and retinoids for 2 weeks prior to the start of any treatment

          4. Exacerbation of the patient's original condition expressed clinically by a shift from
             Hurley Stage II to Stage III

          5. Patient is unable to take antibiotic therapy

          6. Any reason the investigator feels the patient should not participate in the study
