  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When we age, we lose muscle. It is not exactly clear why this happens, but we do know that
      this muscle loss can increase health risks and lead to health problems. Lifting weights (i.e.
      performing resistance exercise) and proper nutrition, in particular eating enough high
      quality protein, can help slow the loss of muscle mass or potentially even reverse it.
      Protein and resistance exercise are thought to do this by stimulating your muscle to make
      more proteins and/or potentially by slowing down the rate at which your body breaks proteins
      down. Whey protein is a high quality protein isolated from milk and is known to stimulate new
      protein synthesis for all proteins in your body. However, to date, the effect that whey
      protein has on muscle protein synthesis, particularly in the elderly has yet to be
      determined. Thus the purposes of this study are: 1) to determine if whey is an effective
      source of protein that will stimulate muscle protein synthesis in the elderly, similar to
      what we have previously seen in young persons; 2) to determine the smallest amount of whey
      protein to consume to maximally stimulate your muscle to make new proteins; 3) to see if
      performing resistance exercise will augment the increase in new muscle protein synthesis with
      whey consumption; and 4) to try and found out if whey is more effective than soy protein in
      stimulating new muscle protein synthesis and suppressing muscle protein breakdown in the
      elderly, similar to what we have previously seen in young persons
