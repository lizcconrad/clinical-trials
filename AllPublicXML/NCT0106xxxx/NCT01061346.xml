  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the effects on liver fat of varying fat intake in the presence
      of fructose or glucose. We hypothesize that higher dietary fat when eaten with fructose as
      compared to glucose will increase the amount of hepatic lipid as measured by magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy.

      After 2 screening visits including an exercise test, DEXA and CT scan, qualifiers begin a 7
      day diet with 20% fat, 65% carbohydrate (with 20% glucose) and 15 % protein. Participants
      consume 2 meals per day at PBRC with lunch and weekend meals packed to go. Following a test
      day, participants are randomized to one of 3 diet assignments and then test again:

      1)20% fat, 65% carbohydrate (with 20% glucose beverage), 15% protein 2)40% fat, 45%
      carbohydrate (with 20% glucose beverage), 15% protein 3)40% fat, 45% carbohydrate (with 20%
      fructose beverage), 15% protein On Day 7 and again 14 days later participants have labs, an
      oral Glucose tolerance test, hepatic and intramuscular lipid measures by MRS, vital signs and
      waist measurement.
