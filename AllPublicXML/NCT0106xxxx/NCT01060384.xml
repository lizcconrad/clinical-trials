    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy (how well the drug works) of
      ofatumumab and lenalidomide in patients with lymphoma and to investigate if any possible
      unwanted side effects may occur. The purpose of the Phase I portion of this trial will be to
      determine the maximum dose of these medications that can be given with minimal side effects.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of CD20+ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is recurrent
             or refractory after at least one prior therapy and for which no other potentially
             curative therapy is available.

          -  Subject, age &gt; or = 19 years

          -  Patients must have relapsed or refractory disease after at least one prior systemic
             therapy, with at least a 3 week interval from the completion of the most recent
             chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen (unless the patient has had progressive disease
             prior to the 3 weeks). Patient has resolved all toxicities to ≤ grade 1, felt to be
             related to prior therapy.

          -  Patients must be ineligible or relapsed after an autologous or allogeneic stem cell
             transplant if clinically appropriate.

          -  Adequate Laboratory Parameters:

               -  ANC ≥ 1500/μL

               -  Platelet count ≥75,000/μL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)- unless
                  due to NHL

               -  Hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT ) ≤ 2.5 times the institutional ULN - unless due to NHL

               -  Serum Creatinine &lt; 3.0 times the institutional ULN - unless due to NHL

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥60ml/min during phase I (See Appendix A) Creatinine
                  clearance ≥ 30ml/min during phase II and patients with creatinine clearance ≥
                  30ml/min and &lt; 60ml/min should start Lenalidomide at a reduced dose. See Section
                  5.3.1

          -  Females of child-bearing potential (FCBP) must agree to:

        Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
        with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to and again within 24
        hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and
        must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO
        acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional
        effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide.
        FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. See Appendix B: Risks of Fetal Exposure,
        Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods.

        Note: A FCBP is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or
        bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e., amenorrhea
        following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24
        consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive
        months).

        Male patients must:

          -  Agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a FCBP, even if they have had a
             vasectomy, throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption and 28 days
             after cessation of study therapy.

          -  Agree to not donate semen during study drug therapy and for a period after end of
             study drug therapy

          -  ECOG Performance status of 0-2 (See Appendix C)

          -  Signed written informed consent including HIPAA according to institutional guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No malignancy [other than the one treated in this study] which required systemic
             treatment within the past 3 years.

          -  Patients not willing to take DVT prophylaxis

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B (HB) defined as positive test of HBsAg. In addition,
             if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a HB DNA test
             will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded. Patients with
             documented vaccination against Hepatitis B will not be considered positive.

          -  Known seropositive for active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are seropositive because of hepatitis B virus
             vaccine are eligible.

          -  Patients with ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy

          -  Active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome,
             asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per
             investigator assessment)

          -  Known CNS involvement with lymphoma

          -  Significant concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition, that in the judgment of the
             investigator, may affect the patient's ability to sign the informed consent and comply
             with study procedures.
