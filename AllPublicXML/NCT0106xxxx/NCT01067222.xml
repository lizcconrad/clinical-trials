      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BF2.649 administered by
      individual titration in narcoleptic patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)

    <textblock>
      BF 2.649, a new experimental drug, significantly decreases, in patient with narcolepsy, the
      excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) evaluated by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), according the
      results of two previous clinical studies.

      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of BF2.649 administered
      by escalating dose (10, 20 or 40 mg/d) in narcoleptic patients with excessive daytime
      sleepiness versus placebo and Modafinil as assessed by both of objective and subjective
      measures including ESS, MWT, patients sleep diary.

      60 patients with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy will be included.
