      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) after Billroth-I
      reconstruction (B-I) following distal gastrectomy, compared with Roux-en Y reconstruction
      (R-Y) in patients with gastric cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) after Billroth-I
      reconstruction (B-I) following distal gastrectomy, compared with Roux-en Y reconstruction
      (R-Y) in patients with gastric cancer. There is no prospective randomized study of the two
      operative procedures focusing on postoperative QOL. The investigators conducted a prospective
      randomized trial on 120 patients who underwent distal gastrectomy comparing Billroth-I
      reconstruction and Roux-en Y reconstruction.

      The primary endpoint was the postoperative QOL. The secondary endpoints were the incidence of
      postoperative complications, nutritional status, and the incidence of the remnant gastritis
      and the reflux esophagitis. Patients were recruited into this study before surgery, on the
      basis of whether distal gastrectomy was anticipated at Wakayama Medical University
      Hospital(WMUH) for gastric cancer, and appropriate informed consent was obtained. Exclusion
      criteria was 1) patients with severe complications which were possible to prolong hospital
      stay, 2) patients with history of other organ malignancies, 3) patients who were diagnosed
      inadequacy for this study by a physician, and 4) patients without an informed consent.
