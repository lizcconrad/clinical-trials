      This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human growth
      hormone (r-hGH) treatment in young girls with Turner Syndrome.

  <detailed_description>

      The study started as an interventional clinical trial. Following primary completion of the
      trial, the sponsor together with the investigators decided that it was interesting to perform
      an observational follow up of the patients, who participated in the interventional part of
      the study, in order to retrieve more outcome results and safety information on this cohort of
      young turner patients for whom treatment started before the age of 4. The follow up period
      was then to be performed until end of GH treatment as decided by the treating physician
      according to usual clinical practice. More recently, it was agreed to also collect
      information on final adult height and weight for patients not lost to follow up.
