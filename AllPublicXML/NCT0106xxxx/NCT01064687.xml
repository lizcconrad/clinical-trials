  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if LY2189265 is effective and safe in reducing
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), as compared to placebo (no medicine), or exenatide in participants
      with Type 2 Diabetes. The participants must also be taking metformin and pioglitazone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the study, if a participant developed persistent, severe hyperglycemia despite full
      compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, the participant received additional
      therapeutic intervention or initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication
      following study drug discontinuation (rescue therapy). Participants who received rescue
      therapy were included in the analysis population, but only measurements obtained prior to the
      beginning of rescue therapy were included in specified analyses.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life - 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. It consists of 2 parts: the first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 3 possible levels of response (no problem, some problem, or extreme problem). These dimensions are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score. The EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK) score ranges from -0.59 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health and negative values are valued as worse than dead. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale (VAS) on which the participants rated their perceived health state on that day from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health). Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted by treatment, country, and baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version (DTSQs) is used to assess participant treatment satisfaction at each study visit. The questionnaire consists of 8 items, 6 of which (1, and 4 through 8) assess treatment satisfaction. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale. Scores from the 6 treatment satisfaction items are summed to a Total Treatment Satisfaction Score, which ranges from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 36 (very satisfied). The DTSQ change version (DTSQc) was not collected at 26 weeks. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate.</description>

    <description>The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status (DTSQs) and change (DTSQc) versions are used to assess participant treatment satisfaction at each study visit and relative change in satisfaction from baseline, respectively. Both questionnaires consist of 8 items, 6 of which (1, and 4 through 8) assess treatment satisfaction. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale. The change version has the same 8 items as the status version with a small alteration of the wording of Item 7. Scores from the 6 treatment satisfaction items are summed to a Total Treatment Satisfaction Score, which ranges from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 36 (very satisfied) for the DTSQs and from -18 (much less satisfied) to +18 (much more satisfied) for the DTSQc. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living (renamed the Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living [APPADL]) questionnaire contains 7 items that assess how difficult it is for participants to engage in certain activities considered to be integral to normal daily life, such as walking, standing and climbing stairs. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = &quot;not at all difficult&quot; and 1 = &quot;unable to do&quot;. The individual scores from all 7 items are summed and a single total score is calculated and may range between 7 and 35. A higher score indicates better ability to perform activities of daily living. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <description>Information on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors was collected at baseline. Data on any new CV event was prospectively collected using a CV event electronic case report form. At prespecified visits, participants were asked about any new CV event since the previous inquiry. Deaths and nonfatal cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) were adjudicated by an external committee of physicians with cardiology expertise. Nonfatal cardiovascular AEs to be adjudicated included myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, coronary interventions, and cerebrovascular events, including cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and transient ischemic attack. The number of participants with CV events confirmed by adjudication is summarized cumulatively at 52 weeks. Serious and all other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality are summarized in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue therapy was defined as any additional therapeutic intervention in participants who developed persistent, severe hyperglycemia despite full compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, or initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication following study drug discontinuation. Participants who had no rescue therapy within specified study period were considered as censored observations at the last available contact date up to specified study period. Time to start first new glucose-lowering intervention due to hyperglycemia (&quot;rescue therapy&quot;) was analyzed between the groups using the semi-parametric proportional hazard regression model with treatment group and country as fixed effects and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26 Weeks in Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell Function (HOMA2-%B) and Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA2-%S)</title>
        <description>The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) quantifies insulin resistance and beta-cell function. HOMA2-B is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady-state beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). HOMA2-S is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate insulin sensitivity (%S) as percentages of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference populations were set at 100%. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Weeks in Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell Function (HOMA2-%B) and Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA2-%S)</title>
        <description>The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) quantifies insulin resistance and beta-cell function. HOMA2-B is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady-state beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). HOMA2-S is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate insulin sensitivity (%S) as percentages of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference populations were set at 100%. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26 Weeks in the EuroQol 5</title>
        <description>The European Quality of Life - 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. It consists of 2 parts: the first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 3 possible levels of response (no problem, some problem, or extreme problem). These dimensions are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score. The EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK) score ranges from -0.59 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health and negative values are valued as worse than dead. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale (VAS) on which the participants rated their perceived health state on that day from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health). Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted by treatment, country, and baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Weeks in the EuroQol 5</title>
          <description>The European Quality of Life - 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. It consists of 2 parts: the first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 3 possible levels of response (no problem, some problem, or extreme problem). These dimensions are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score. The EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK) score ranges from -0.59 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health and negative values are valued as worse than dead. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale (VAS) on which the participants rated their perceived health state on that day from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health). Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted by treatment, country, and baseline.</description>
          <population>Participants who were randomized at baseline to LY2189265 or Exenatide and received at least 1 dose of study drug with evaluable EQ-5D data. Only pre-rescue measurements were used. LOCF was used to impute missing postbaseline values. If there were no data after the date of randomization, the endpoint was considered missing.</population>

        <description>The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status (DTSQs) and change (DTSQc) versions are used to assess participant treatment satisfaction at each study visit and relative change in satisfaction from baseline, respectively. Both questionnaires consist of 8 items, 6 of which (1, and 4 through 8) assess treatment satisfaction. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale. The change version has the same 8 items as the status version with a small alteration of the wording of Item 7. Scores from the 6 treatment satisfaction items are summed to a Total Treatment Satisfaction Score, which ranges from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 36 (very satisfied) for the DTSQs and from -18 (much less satisfied) to +18 (much more satisfied) for the DTSQc. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate.</description>

        <description>The Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living (renamed the Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living [APPADL]) questionnaire contains 7 items that assess how difficult it is for participants to engage in certain activities considered to be integral to normal daily life, such as walking, standing and climbing stairs. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = &quot;not at all difficult&quot; and 1 = &quot;unable to do&quot;. The individual scores from all 7 items are summed and a single total score is calculated and may range between 7 and 35. A higher score indicates better ability to perform activities of daily living. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Weeks in the Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living</title>
        <description>The Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living (renamed the Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living [APPADL]) questionnaire contains 7 items that assess how difficult it is for participants to engage in certain activities considered to be integral to normal daily life, such as walking, standing and climbing stairs. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = &quot;not at all difficult&quot; and 1 = &quot;unable to do&quot;. The individual scores from all 7 items are summed and a single total score is calculated and may range between 7 and 35. A higher score indicates better ability to perform activities of daily living. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <description>Information on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors was collected at baseline. Data on any new CV event was prospectively collected using a CV event electronic case report form. At prespecified visits, participants were asked about any new CV event since the previous inquiry. Deaths and nonfatal cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) were adjudicated by an external committee of physicians with cardiology expertise. Nonfatal cardiovascular AEs to be adjudicated included myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, coronary interventions, and cerebrovascular events, including cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and transient ischemic attack. The number of participants with CV events confirmed by adjudication is summarized cumulatively at 52 weeks. Serious and all other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality are summarized in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26 Weeks on Electrocardiogram Parameters, Fridericia Corrected QT (QTcF) Interval and PR Interval</title>
        <description>The QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave and was calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG) data using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT/RR^0.33. Corrected QT (QTc) is the QT interval corrected for heart rate and RR, which is the interval between two R waves. PR is the interval between the P wave and the QRS complex. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <description>Hypoglycemic events (HE) were classified as severe (defined as episodes requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer resuscitative actions), documented symptomatic (defined as any time a participant feels that he/she is experiencing symptoms and/or signs associated with hypoglycemia, and has a plasma glucose level of less than or equal to 3.9 millimoles/liter [mmol/L]), asymptomatic (defined as events not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but with a measured plasma glucose of less than or equal to 3.9 mmol/L), nocturnal (defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurred between bedtime and waking), or probable symptomatic (defined as events during which symptoms of hypoglycemia were not accompanied by a plasma glucose determination). The number of self-reported hypoglycemic events is summarized cumulatively at 26 weeks. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Requiring Rescue Therapy Due to Hyperglycemia at 26 Weeks</title>
        <description>Rescue therapy was defined as any additional therapeutic intervention in participants who developed persistent, severe hyperglycemia despite full compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, or initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication following study drug discontinuation. Participants who had no rescue therapy within specified study period were considered as censored observations at the last available contact date up to specified study period. Time to start first new glucose-lowering intervention due to hyperglycemia (&quot;rescue therapy&quot;) was analyzed between the groups using the semi-parametric proportional hazard regression model with treatment group and country as fixed effects and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as a covariate.</description>
