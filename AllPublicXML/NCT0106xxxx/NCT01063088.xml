          -  Subject is generally healthy, as determined by the investigator's clinical judgment
             through collection of medical history and performance of a physical examination, such
             that the investigator would not hesitate to provide routine influenza immunization to
             the subject in the course of routine medical practice

          -  Subject agrees to keep a daily record of symptoms for the duration of the study

             test immediately prior to vaccination on Study Day 1 and agrees to employ adequate
             birth control measures for the duration of the study

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

             site reaction rating

          -  Subject has received a live vaccine within 4 weeks or an inactivated or subunit
             vaccine within 2 weeks of study entry

          -  Subject has been vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2009/2010 season

          -  Subject has a disease or is currently undergoing a form of treatment or was undergoing
             a form of treatment within 30 days prior to study entry that can be expected to
             influence immune response. Such treatment includes, but is not limited to, systemic or
             high dose inhaled (&gt; 800 μg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent)
             corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs.

          -  Subject has a functional or surgical asplenia

          -  Subject has a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse

             product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to study enrollment or is
