  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      biodegradable polymer based limus-eluting stents (BPDES) with permanent polymer based
      everolimus eluting stents (PPDES).

      Restenosis affects 20-40% of de novo coronary lesions treated with bare-metal stents.
      Although it is often considered a benign process, recent data indicate that in-stent
      restenosis has a negative impact on long-term survival of patients treated with coronary
      stents. Drug eluting stents have emerged as the most effective strategy for the prevention of
      restenosis. A large number of studies showed that drug-eluting stents significantly reduce
      in-stent restenosis and the subsequent need for target vessel revascularisation compared with
      bare-metal stents. Available evidence shows that all 3 limus drugs − rapamycin, everolimus
      and biolimus − are very effective in suppressing neointima formation after coronary stenting.
      Drugs are fully released within a few weeks from the majority of current DES. However, most
      of the DES use permanent polymers, which continue to remain in the vessel wall even after
      accomplishing their drug-release mission. Their permanent presence may be associated with
      persistent inflammatory reaction and delayed neointimal proliferation and vessel thrombosis.
      Clinical trial evidence with biodegradable polymer DES is still limited, but there are great
      expectations that this DES technology might be the dominant one in the years to come.
