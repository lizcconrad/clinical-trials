  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 10-week, placebo-controlled, randomized study to investigate the effect of
      injectable IL-1B antagonist, Canakinumab , in participants with impaired glucose tolerance or
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) already treated on different background diabetes therapies.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) score, measures insulin sensitivity which is the inverse of insulin resistance. The score is calculated by the equation: 1 /(log(fasting insulin µU/mL) + log(fasting glucose mg/dL)). In normal subjects the mean score ± SE is 0.366 ± 0.029.

        <description>Blood samples were drawn after a test meal at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min. Insulin levels over 4 hrs were shown as Area Under the Curve,(AUC). AUC was calculated as: x=1 AUC ΣAx n Where Ax = AUC for the 240 min.interval, and X = 1 for the 1st interval. A mixed model with treatment fitted as fixed effect, and population and the interaction of population and treatment fitted as random effects were used for the comparison of Canakinumab vs placebo within each T2DM group.
