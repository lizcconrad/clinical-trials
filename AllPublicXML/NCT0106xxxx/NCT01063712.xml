      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the effectiveness of the device
      &quot;Nit-Occlud® PDA-R&quot; in the percutaneous closure of patent ductus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the years 2003 to 2008, the Cardiological Medical Center &quot;Kardiozentrum&quot; evaluated
      1136 patients with echocardiographic studies, 14.7% of the patients were diagnosed with
      patent arterial duct. The PDA is an abnormal communication between the aorta and pulmonary
      artery. Untreated it can rise the intrapulmonary pressure and lead to serious complications
      like cardiac insufficiency.

      The incidence of ducts as an isolated heart disease is between 3.6 and 7% of all congenital
      heart diseases at sea level, and 10 - 14% at high altitude; rising up to 20% in cities at
      more than 2.500 m about sea level. The ducts at high altitude are generally wider and larger
      than at sea level.

      One treatment alternative is a percutaneous transluminal implantation of a permanent implant
      which closes the defect. The device under investigation &quot;Nit-Occlud® PDA-R&quot; is developed for
      closure of the PDA with a minimal diameter of 2-8 mm.

      The device performs the function of generating the defect occlusion by the body itself. The
      implant stimulates the body to generate an epithelium over the implant so that the PDA
      closes.

    <description>The closure rate is an effectiveness outcome. Complete closure without a residual shunt is defined as absence of color flow (an echocardiographic technique used to observe the flow of blood in the heart) between the aorta and the pulmonary artery through the duct. Additionally, the position of the device, regression of the dilation of the left ventricle and left atrium and assessing of unrestricted doppler flow in the descending aorta and left pulmonary artery were documented. Clinical status was also assessed.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With a Decreased Dilation of the Left Heart Chamber (Time Frame: One Year After Treatment). Dilation of the Left Ventricle and Left Atrium Was Measured Before and One Year After Implantation by Echocardiography.</measure>
    <time_frame>one year after percutaneous closure</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were examined clinically and echocardiographically after 24 hours, one month, three months and six months after the percutaneous closure. Dilation of the left ventricle and left atrium are consequences of the hyperflow through the ducts. Regression of both ventricle and atrium are expected after closure of the ducts and can be documented by echocardiography. Additionally, the position of the device and the doppler flow in the descending aorta and left pulmonary artery were documented.</description>

    <description>Transcatheter implantation of a PDA Device (Nitinol) The catheterism was done under sedation, using a protocol established by inserting a catheter through a femoral artery and/or vein directed to the heart and great vessels. Invasive measurements are obtained in the descending aorta and pulmonary artery. Once in ductal position, we inject iodinated contrast medium that allows us to observe via X-ray the ductal morphology; obtaining accurate measurements to choose the appropriate device. The device is then inserted via the catheter, closing the ductus.
The catheterism provides measures of aortic and pulmonary pressure, before, during and after the closure.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Prospective clinical study between June 2009 and December 2010 in La Paz, Bolivia. 29 out of 59 patients selected with inclusion and exclusion criteria(≥ 10 Kg, Patient Arterial Duct of 2 – 8 mm minimal diameter, &quot;Nit-Occlud® PDA-R&quot; used, systolic pulmonary pressure ≤ 67% of systolic aortic pressure and absence of any other chronic disease).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>30 patients were excluded. Four and eight patients with Patent Arterial Duct bigger than 8 mm or smaller than 2 mm, eleven patients with pulmonary pressure elevated more than 67% of systolic pressure, nine patients lighter than 10 Kg and three patients with atypical ducts. Some were excluded for more than one reason.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Children born with patent arterial duct develop cardiac insufficiency early in life, show failure to thrive and frequent respiratory infections. Pulmonary hyperflow through the duct can lead to changes in the pulmonary vasculature and irreversible pulmonary hypertension. This can be prevented if we close the ducts on time. The classical method is open thorax surgery, which involves deep anaesthesia, a scar, possible complications (thorax deformities and instability) and a long stay in hospital. With the Interventional Closure of Patent Arterial Duct technique the patients stay only one day in hospital, the thorax is not open, and only slight sedation is needed. The device closure and the surgery have similar closure rates, but there are fewer complications using the intervention method, and it is also less expensive.
This group of patients were chosen because they have ducts in mean sizes (2-8 mm), haven´t developed pulmonary hypertension and have enough weight to be treated.</description>

        <description>The patients were examined clinically and echocardiographically after 24 hours, one month, three months and six months after the percutaneous closure. Dilation of the left ventricle and left atrium are consequences of the hyperflow through the ducts.

            <description>Children born with patent arterial duct develop cardiac insufficiency early in life. Pulmonary hyperflow through the duct can lead to changes in the pulmonary vasculature and irreversible pulmonary hypertension. This can be prevented if we close the duct on time. The device closure and the surgery have similar closure rates, but there are fewer complications using the intervention method.
This group of patients had 2-8 mm ductus, haven´t developed pulmonary hypertension and have enough weight to be treated.
Patients with left to right shunt show a dilation of left ventricle and left atrium. The quotient Left atrium/aortic ring is a well known method to estimate the grade of the dilation of the left atrium. The M-Mode method, is useful to assessed the regression of the ventricle after the ducts is closed. These observations were made at the beginning of the study and after six months.</description>

          <title>Effectiveness of the Device: &quot;Nit-Occlud® PDA-R&quot;</title>
          <description>Children born with patent arterial duct develop cardiac insufficiency early in life, show failure to thrive and frequent respiratory infections. Pulmonary hyperflow through the duct can lead to changes in the pulmonary vasculature and irreversible pulmonary hypertension. This can be prevented if we close the ducts on time. The classical method is open thorax surgery, which involves deep anaesthesia, a scar, possible complications (thorax deformities and instability) and a long stay in hospital. With the Interventional Closure of Patent Arterial Duct technique the patients stay only one day in hospital, the thorax is not open, and only slight sedation is needed. The device closure and the surgery have similar closure rates, but there are fewer complications using the intervention method, and it is also less expensive.
This group of patients were chosen because they have duct in mean sizes (2-8 mm), haven´t developed pulmonary hypertension and have enough weight to be treated.</description>
