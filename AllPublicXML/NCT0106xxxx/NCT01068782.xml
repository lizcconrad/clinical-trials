    <textblock>
      This is a study of multiple regimens of single-agent XL184 in subjects with grade IV
      astrocytic tumor in first or second relapse. The Randomized Phase of the study will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of four XL184 dosing regimens in separate
      study arms. Subjects will be randomized to one of the study arms, which will not be blinded.
      After the Randomized Phase, additional subjects will be enrolled to further expand one study
      arm in the Expansion Phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has histologically confirmed diagnosis at any time of grade IV astrocytic
             tumor as determined by the investigator. Tumor samples will be required for pathology
             review.

          -  The subject has received prior standard radiation for any grade astrocytic tumor.

          -  The subject has received prior temozolomide (Temodar) therapy

          -  The subject has had one or two progressions as grade IV astrocytic tumor from any
             grade, as determined by investigator

          -  The subject must have a qualifying brain MRI scan within a specific timeframe prior to
             start of study treatment

          -  For subjects with recent tumor resection or biopsy, starting on study must occur a
             specified amount of time after the surgery and the subject must have recovered from
             the effects of surgery

          -  The subject has a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung
             disease
