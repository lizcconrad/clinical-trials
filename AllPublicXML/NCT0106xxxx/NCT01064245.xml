  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is a common, disruptive and at times disabling symptom which often prompts patients to
      seek medical attention. Determining the cause(s) of chronic cough can be challenging, and
      costly. Asthma and other airway disorders are among the most common causes of chronic cough;
      and cough can be the sole symptom of asthma. Little is known about why some patients with
      asthma primarily cough and do not develop the other symptoms of asthma such as shortness of
      breath or wheeze. Improved understanding of the reasons for these different manifestations
      may lead to new and more effective treatment strategies. We have notices differences in
      pressure measurements inside the chest in patients who mostly cough during induced
      bronchoconstriction, which might be part of the explanation for varying symptoms. This study
      will compare lung mechanical responses during methacholine and mannitol-induced induced
      airway narrowing between typical asthma, cough variant asthma (CVA) and an airway
      inflammatory disorder that is not asthma.The purpose of this research is to explore the
      pathophysiology and sensory-mechanics of cough in individuals with asthma, CVA and
      methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity using mannitol and high-dose
      methacholine bronchoprovocation testing.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with asthma or suspected CVA who have previously participated in or who have
             expressed interest in participating in studies will be invited to participate in the
             study. Previous treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids is not an exclusion
             criterion, but medication use will be recorded and examined in the analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. An exacerbation necessitating any alteration in medication, emergency department visit
             or hospitalizations within the previous 4 weeks;

          2. Inability to perform acceptable quality spirometry;

          3. Medical contraindications to methacholine challenge testing 35, including:

               1. Severe airflow limitation (FEV1 &lt;50% predicted or &lt;1.0 L);

               2. Heart attack or stroke in last 3 months;

               3. Uncontrolled hypertension, systolic BP &gt; 200 or diastolic BP &gt; 100;

               4. Known aortic aneurysm;

               5. Moderate airflow limitation &lt; 60% predicted or &lt;1.5 L);

               6. Inability to perform acceptable quality spirometry;

               7. Current use of cholinesterase inhibitor medication (for myasthenia gravis); and

               8. Pregnant or nursing mothers.

          4. Smoking history in excess of 10 pack years;

          5. Medical contraindications to mannitol challenge testing, including:

               1. Aortic or cerebral aneurysm;

               2. Uncontrolled hypertension; and

               3. Myocardial infarction or a cerebral vascular accident in the previous six
                  months).

          6. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding because the effects of a possible
             hyperresponsiveness reaction to mannitol in mothers and/or fetuses are unknown and
             many compounds are excreted in human milk therefore caution should be taken.
