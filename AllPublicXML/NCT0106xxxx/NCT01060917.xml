  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous monitoring of the skin tissue glucose concentration on two different study days
      using glucose sensors that work on the principle of impedance spectroscopy, with systematic
      alteration of the blood glucose concentration using the glucose clamp technique in healthy
      subjects and subjects with type 1 diabetes. Simultaneous determination of electrolyte
      concentrations in the blood by taking frequent blood samples.

      A completely non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring device is considered as a major
      target of glucose sensor development. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of
      a non-invasive glucose sensor (wristwatch) under controlled conditions (glucose clamp) at
      hyperglycemia (study day 1) and at hypoglycemia (study day 2). Measurements of the
      non-invasive glucose monitoring device are compared to those obtained from a minimally
      invasive glucose monitoring device (GlucoDay, microdialysis principle). In addition, changes
      in blood electrolyte concentrations as well as their impact on the measurements of the
      non-invasive glucose sensor are evaluated.

    <intervention_name>Hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic glucose clamp</intervention_name>
    <description>The automated glucose clamp technique was used to control glucose levels at baseline glycemia for 1h, hyperglycemia (300 mg/dL) for 1.5 h, and euglycemia (100 mg/dL) for another 1.5 h. A continuous somatostatin infusion was initiated after the 2 h run-in period to suppress endogenous insulin secretion. A glucose solution was infused to increase blood glucose towards the hyperglycemic target level. At the end of the hyperglycemic level the somatostatin infusion was stopped and blood glucose was controlled at the euglycemic target level. On a second study day a hypoglycemic clamp took place, where blood glucose after the run-in period of 2 h was lowered by means of intravenous insulin administration over a period of appr. 30 min to a hypoglycemic level of 45 mg/dL, where it was kept constant for appr. 30 min, after which blood glucose was raised to euglycemia (100 mg/dL) again by means of an intravenous glucose infusion and was kept there for 1.5 hours. .</description>
