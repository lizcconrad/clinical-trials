    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy (how does it work) and safety of
      gadobutrol when used for obtaining MR images of both breasts.Women with a recent diagnosis of
      breast cancer by mammogram (X-ray examination of the breasts) may benefit from MRI of the
      breasts as MRI may detect additional breast cancers.

    <measure>Difference for Sensitivity for Detection of Full Extent of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM Per Reader</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
    <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the clinical investigators and the 3 blinded readers using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value. For ease of expression, the following abbreviations will be used: Magnetic Resonance Mammography (MRM), Unenhanced MRM (UMRM), combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM), X-ray mammography (XRM).</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
    <description>A non-malignant breast was defined as false positive (FP), when the reader assessed at least one breast region as malignant. When all breast regions were assessed as non-malignant, the breast was defined as true negative (TN). Breast level specificity was first defined in participant as number of TN-breasts in participant divided by number of non-malignant breasts in participant. Subsequently the specificity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the specificities across all participants who contributed with at least one non-malignant breast.</description>

    <measure>Categorical Accuracy Difference of Extent of Malignant Disease Verified by SoT by Majority Reader, Breast Region Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
    <description>For each region the reader chose the category which best described the extent of malignant disease, i.e. no, unifocal, or multifocal malignant breast disease. The proportion of correct matches of each defined image set to the SoT for the extent of malignant breast disease was referred to as the categorical accuracy. The majority read value for the 3 blinded readers was determined at the disease state level (no disease, unifocal, multifocal). If 2 of 3 or all 3 readers gave the same categorical determination of malignant disease for a breast region, the majority reader response was that category. If all 3 readers gave different categorical determination, the majority reader response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The disease state &quot;bilateral malignant disease&quot; was derived from the assessment of the different regions for each breast (right and left) for investigators for each imaging modality (UMRM, CMRM, XRM, UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM) based on the following rule: If the participant had at least one breast with no malignant region, the assessment of bilateral malignant disease was categorized as &quot;No&quot;. If the participant had at least one malignant lesion in both breasts, the assessment of bilateral malignant disease was categorized as &quot;Yes&quot;. The proportion of correct matches of each different image set to the SoT for the existence of bilateral malignant disease was derived. The analysis was based on the difference in accuracy for the evaluation of bilateral malignant disease for the following image comparisons on a participant level. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

    <description>The 3 blinded readers each recorded his/her confidence in diagnosis for each breast region based on a 4-point scale (1=not confident, 2=somewhat confident, 3=confident, and 4=very confident). The majority read value for the 3 readers was determined at the disease state level (no disease, unifocal, multifocal). If 2 of 3 or all 3 readers gave the same categorical determination of malignant disease for a breast region, the majority reader response was that category. If all 3 readers gave different categorical determination, the majority reader response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers, i.e. multifocal. For each participant, the mean of the confidence responses for the diagnosed breast regions was calculated, and rounded to the nearest 0.5. value respectively. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

          <description>Participants first received an unenhanced magnetic resonance mammography (MRM), followed by a gadobutrol-enhanced MRM. Gadobutrol was administered at the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (bw) [0.1 ml/kg bw] as an intravenous injection (i.v.) at a rate of 2 ml/sec. Unenhanced MRM (UMRM) and combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM) image sets were evaluated in a randomized fashion. After the evaluation of the UMRM or CMRM the respective X-ray mammography (XRM) was added and evaluated together with the UMRM images.</description>

        <title>Difference for Sensitivity for Detection of Full Extent of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM Per Reader</title>
        <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the clinical investigators and the 3 blinded readers using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value. For ease of expression, the following abbreviations will be used: Magnetic Resonance Mammography (MRM), Unenhanced MRM (UMRM), combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM), X-ray mammography (XRM).</description>
        <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
        <population>The analyses were based on 388 participants in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) who had regions with malignant disease verified by Standard of Truth (SOT).</population>

        <title>Breast Level Specificity of CMRM for Non-malignant Breasts by Reader</title>
        <description>A non-malignant breast was defined as false positive (FP), when the reader assessed at least one breast region as malignant. When all breast regions were assessed as non-malignant, the breast was defined as true negative (TN). Breast level specificity was first defined in participant as number of TN-breasts in participant divided by number of non-malignant breasts in participant. Subsequently the specificity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the specificities across all participants who contributed with at least one non-malignant breast.</description>

        <title>Categorical Accuracy Difference of Extent of Malignant Disease Verified by SoT by Majority Reader, Breast Region Level</title>
        <description>For each region the reader chose the category which best described the extent of malignant disease, i.e. no, unifocal, or multifocal malignant breast disease. The proportion of correct matches of each defined image set to the SoT for the extent of malignant breast disease was referred to as the categorical accuracy. The majority read value for the 3 blinded readers was determined at the disease state level (no disease, unifocal, multifocal). If 2 of 3 or all 3 readers gave the same categorical determination of malignant disease for a breast region, the majority reader response was that category. If all 3 readers gave different categorical determination, the majority reader response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

        <title>Sensitivity Difference in the Determination of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM, CMRM+XRM vs UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM vs XRM Verified by SoT, Breast Region Level</title>
        <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the reader using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The majority read value for the 3 blinded readers was determined at the disease state level (evaluable regions for sensitivity). If 2 of 3 or all 3 readers gave the same categorical determination of malignant disease for a breast region, the majority reader response was that category. If all 3 readers gave a different categorical determination, the majority response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers.

        <title>Sensitivity Difference in the Determination of Unifocal Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM, CMRM+XRM vs UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM vs XRM Verified by SoT, Breast Region Level</title>
        <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the reader using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The majority read value for the 3 blinded readers was determined at the disease state level (evaluable regions for sensitivity). If 2 of 3 or all 3 readers gave the same categorical determination of malignant disease for a breast region, the majority reader response was that category. If all 3 readers gave a different categorical determination, the majority response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>
        <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
        <population>For unifocal malignant disease, sensitivity analyses were performed for a total number of 576 regions (i.e. regions with unifocal disease verified by SoT), 390 participants in FAS.</population>

        <title>Specificity Difference in the Determination of Unifocal Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM, CMRM+XRM vs UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM vs XRM Verified by SoT, Breast Region Level</title>
        <description>A malignant breast was defined as FP, when the reader using the respective imaging modality assessed more breast regions as malignant as were present according to SoT. Otherwise the breast was assessed as TN. Specificity was then defined as TN/(TN+FP). The majority read value for the 3 blinded readers was determined at the disease state level (evaluable regions for specificity). If 2 of 3 or all 3 readers gave the same categorical determination of malignant disease for a breast region, the majority reader response was that category. If all 3 readers gave a different categorical determination, the majority reader response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>
        <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
        <population>For unifocal malignant disease, specificity analyses were based on a total number of 3307 regions (i.e. regions with no disease or multifocal malignant disease), 390 participants in FAS.</population>

        <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the reader using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The majority read value for the 3 blinded readers was determined at the disease state level (evaluable regions for sensitivity). If 2 of 3 or all 3 readers gave the same categorical determination of malignant disease for a breast region, the majority reader response was that category. If all 3 readers gave a different categorical determination, the majority response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

        <population>The analyses were based on a total number of 53 evaluable breasts with multicentric malignant disease.</population>

        <title>Accuracy Difference of Presence of Bilateral Malignant Disease Verified by SoT by Majority Reader, Participant Level</title>
        <description>The disease state âbilateral malignant diseaseâ was derived from the assessment of the different regions for each breast (right and left) for investigators for each imaging modality (UMRM, CMRM, XRM, UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM) based on the following rule: If the participant had at least one breast with no malignant region, the assessment of bilateral malignant disease was categorized as âNoâ. If the participant had at least one malignant lesion in both breasts, the assessment of bilateral malignant disease was categorized as âYesâ. The proportion of correct matches of each different image set to the SoT for the existence of bilateral malignant disease was derived. The analysis was based on the difference in accuracy for the evaluation of bilateral malignant disease for the following image comparisons on a participant level. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

        <title>Difference of Confidence in Diagnosis for Breast Region Diagnosis Using CMRM vs UMRM, CMRM+XRM vs UMRM+XRM and CMRM+XRM vs XRM by Majority Reader, Participant Level</title>
        <description>The 3 blinded readers each recorded his/her confidence in diagnosis for each breast region based on a 4-point scale (1=not confident, 2=somewhat confident, 3=confident, and 4=very confident). The majority read value for the 3 readers was determined at the disease state level (no disease, unifocal, multifocal). If 2 of 3 or all 3 readers gave the same categorical determination of malignant disease for a breast region, the majority reader response was that category. If all 3 readers gave different categorical determination, the majority reader response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers, i.e. multifocal. For each participant, the mean of the confidence responses for the diagnosed breast regions was calculated, and rounded to the nearest 0.5. value respectively. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

        <description>Intra-reader variability was assessed using a kappa on the match to SoT for the different regions within each participant (match, no match SoT). For each of the 3 readers, intra-reader agreement was assessed by considering each breast region to have 2 possibilities for an assessment by CMRM: matched SoT or did not match SoT. Kappa value varies from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement).</description>
