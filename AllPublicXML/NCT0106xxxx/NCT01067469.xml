      The Study Drugs:

      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the
      growth of blood vessels.

      Lomustine is designed to damage the DNA (genetic material of cells) of tumor cells, which may
      cause the tumor cells to die.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being in either
      group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive a higher dose of bevacizumab.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive lomustine and a lower dose of bevacizumab

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each treatment cycle is 42 days.

      If you are in Group 1:

      On Days 1, 15, and 29 of every cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 90 minutes.

      If you are in Group 2:

        -  On Days 1 and 22 of every cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 90 minutes.

        -  On Day 3 of every cycle, you will take lomustine by mouth 1 time a day. You should take
           lomustine at bedtime 1 hour before or 2 hours after your last meal of the day with 1 cup
           (about 8 ounces) of water.

      Study Visits:

      If you are in Group 1 or 2, every 6 weeks:

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had any side
           effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have an MRI scan.

        -  If you are on anti-seizure drugs, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure the
           amount of anti-seizure drugs in your blood.

      If you are in Group 1:

        -  During Weeks 1-6, blood (about 3 teaspoons) drawn for routine tests 1 time a week.

        -  After Week 6, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests every 2 weeks.

        -  On Weeks 2, 4, and 6, and then every 6 weeks after that, urine will be collected to
           check your kidney function.

      If you are in Group 2:

        -  During Weeks 1-6, blood (about 3 teaspoons) drawn for routine tests 1 time a week.

        -  After Week 6, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests every 3 weeks.

        -  On Weeks 3 and 6, and then every 6 weeks after that, urine will be collected to check
           your kidney function.

      Length of Study:

      You may stay on study treatment of lomustine and/or bevacizumab for up to 1 1/2 years. After
      that, you may continue taking bevacizumab for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in
      your best interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or you
      experience intolerable side effects.

      End of Study Treatment Visit:

      After you are off study treatment, you will have an end of study treatment visit. At this
      visit, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures performed:

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had any side
           effects.

        -  You will have physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

      Long-Term Follow-up:

      After the end of study treatment visit, the study staff will call you every 3 months to check
      how you are doing. Each phone call will take about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab and lomustine are FDA approved drugs and
      commercially available for the treatment of brain tumors. The use of these drugs in this
      combination is investigational.

      Up to 102 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

          2. Age &gt;/= 18 years

          3. Histologically confirmed glioblastoma in first, second or third relapse. A pathology
             report constitutes adequate documentation of histology for study inclusion. Subjects
             with an initial diagnosis of a lower grade glioma are eligible if a subsequent biopsy
             is determined to be glioblastoma. The amount of prior systemic therapy for this
             population is, nevertheless, restricted to three regimens, with one including
             temozolomide.

          4. Radiographic demonstration of disease progression following prior therapy

          5. Bi-dimensionally measurable disease with a minimum measurement of 1 cm (10 mm) in one
             diameter on MRI performed within 14 days prior to registration (Day 1). Baseline MRIs
             for subjects who underwent salvage surgery after first or second relapse must be
             obtained &gt;/= 4 weeks after the procedure. If receiving corticosteroids, subjects must
             be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids for &gt;/= 5 days prior to baseline
             MRI.

          6. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: 1) They have recovered from
             the effects of surgery. 2) Evaluable or measurable disease following resection of
             recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study. 3) To best assess the
             extent of residual measurable disease post-operatively, a MRI should be done no later
             than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or 4-6 weeks post-operatively. .

          7. An interval of &gt;/= 4 weeks since surgical resection is required prior to starting
             protocol therapy.

          8. Prior standard radiation for glioblastoma

          9. Prior chemotherapy: All first-relapse subjects must have received temozolomide. All
             second- and third-relapse subjects must have received temozolomide. Patients may not
             have received prior nitrosoureas.

         10. Recovery from the effects of prior therapy, including the following: Four weeks from
             cytotoxic agents (3 weeks from procarbazine, 2 weeks from vincristine); Four weeks
             from any investigational agent; One week from non-cytotoxic agents(eg accutane,
             thalidomide); Eight weeks from radiotherapy to minimize the potential for MRI changes
             related to radiation necrosis that might be misdiagnosed as progression of disease, or
             4 weeks if a new lesion, relative to the pre-radiation MRI, develops that is outside
             the primary radiation field; Patients may have had gliadel wafers during their
             original surgery but they must be &gt;/= 9 months post their original surgery date.

         11. Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal high-dose radiation is allowed, but the
             subject must have subsequent histologic documentation of recurrence or positron
             emission tomography (PET) or MR Spectroscopic documentation of tumor, unless the
             recurrence is a new lesion outside the irradiated field

         12. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC &gt;/= 3,000/µl, absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500/mm^3, platelet count of &gt;/= 100,000/mm^3, and
             hemoglobin &gt;/= 10 gm/dl), adequate liver function (SGPT &lt; 3 times normal and alkaline
             phosphatase &lt; 2 times normal, bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dl), adequate renal function
             (creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 cc/min/1.73 m^2) and a urine
             protein:creatinine ratio of &lt;/=1 before starting therapy. These tests must be
             performed within 14 days prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may
             be reached by transfusion.

         13. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) equal or greater than 60

         14. Use of an effective means of contraception in males and in females of childbearing
             potential. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative β-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test documented within 14 days prior to registration.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         15. Ability to comply with study and follow-up procedures

         16. Patients receiving treatment with other antiepileptic medications will not be
             excluded. Patients should preferably be treated with non-enzyme inducing
             anti-epileptic medications to avoid any potential interactions with lomustine.
             However, the use of non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications is not mandatory.
             If enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs are used, monitoring of drug levels should be
             considered, as considered clinically appropriate by the treating physician.

         17. Patients on the following medications will be included: Anticoagulants/Anti-platelets:
             Patients on stable dose anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, low molecular-weight heparin)
             and in-range international normalized ratio (INR) (2-3) are eligible. Patients are
             allowed to take aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, Aggrenox, ibuprofen and other
             NSAIDS.

         18. Patients must be willing to forego other cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic drug therapy
             against the tumor while enrolled in the study.

         19. This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to
             measure differences of intervention effects. Males and females will be recruited with
             no preference to gender. No exclusion to this study will be based on race. Minorities
             will actively be recruited to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:
