      Mesenchymal stem cells have capability to differentiate into hepatocyte and will be useful
      for liver regeneration. Adipose tissue is relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cell
      compared to bone marrow tissue. In this trial, eligible liver cirrhosis patients will receive
      autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells through intrahepatic arterial
      catheterization.

    <textblock>
      The population of the liver cirrhosis patients is enormous in Japan and the only radical
      treatment for them is liver transplantation: however, the number of giving donor is extremely
      limited. Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into mesodermal-lineage
      cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as hepatocytes. They reside in the mesenchymal
      tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues. The latter tissues are relatively
      enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow cells. In this study, the
      cirrhotic patients will undergo intrahepatic arterial administration of autologous adipose
      tissue derived stromal cells through catheter.
