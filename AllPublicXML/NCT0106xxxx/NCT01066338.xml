  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most reliable prognostic marker of acute myeloid leukemia(AML) is cytogenetics by
      karyotyping. According to cytogenetic results, the patients with AML are classified as
      better, intermediate and poor prognosis groups. The normal karyotype AML was reported in
      about 50% of all AML and classified as intermediate risk group. However, the patients with
      normal karyotype AML showed various prognosis. Therefore, the further studies about subgroup
      analysis of normal karyotype AML are needed. Recently, the understandings of human genome
      polypmorphism using SNP array have been accumulated. However, the advanced researches for
      clinical application are not enough.

      The study design is a retrospective and single-center study. The patients with normal
      karyotyping AML who were diagnosed from 1994 to 2008 at Samsung Medical Center (South Korea)
      will be enrolled. The stored bone marrow samples of enrolled patients are used for genome
      wide scanning by SNP array.

      The purpose of present study is to develop predictive pharmacogenemic biomarkers model
      associated wit clinical outcomes including efficacy and toxicity in patients with AML with
      normal karyotype treated with chemotherapy using pharmacogenetic SNP array. And secondly, to
      develop enrichment clinical trial based on predictive pharmacogenomic model.
