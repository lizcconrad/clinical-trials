  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test and evaluate the effectiveness of a parent-only
      treatment for childhood obesity. This study provides state-of-the-art treatment for childhood
      obesity. Parents and children will participate in treatment groups for 6 months. These
      treatment groups include recommendations to decrease overall caloric intake (by increasing
      fruits and vegetables), increasing physical activity, decreasing sedentary behavior and
      changing the home food environment. We are currently implementing this treatment in the
      Healthy Choices Program which is part of the Childhood Obesity Clinic at the University of
      Minnesota. Len Epstein at the University of Buffalo has been publishing on this treatment
      protocol for 30 years.

      The objective of this study is to pilot test and evaluate the efficacy of a parent-only
      treatment for childhood obesity. The central working hypothesis is that the parent-only
      treatment will result in greater weight loss for the overweight child as compared to the
      parent + child treatment. The specific aims of this application focus on comparing a
      behavioral parent-only intervention to a parent + child intervention for childhood obesity.

      The primary aim of the proposed study is to compare the efficacy of the parent-only treatment
      to the parent + child treatment for childhood obesity.

      The secondary aim is to compare treatment groups on change in the child and parent diet and
      exercise behavior, change in the home food environment, and parent weight post-treatment and
      at 6-months post-treatment.

      This study is a randomized, clinical pilot trial evaluating two 6-month treatments for
      childhood obesity; parent + child and parent-only groups, with 6-months of post-treatment
      follow-up. The two treatments will differ in terms of the designated recipient of treatment,
      which will be delivered either to parents-only or to parents and children separately. Study
      outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and 6-months
      post-treatment.
