      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the effect of the new gel pad on the quality of

      the quality of life of incontinence persons.

      The devices available today on the market serve two polar incontinence conditions: those who
      have severe urinary incontinence and need to use diapers several times per day, or those who
      have mild urinary incontinence and can use pads.

      Such circumstances call for a search of new solution that may provide the benefit of freeing
      those with moderate incontinence from changing pads several times a day or staying constantly
      very near a bathroom, as well as freeing those with severe incontinence from using cumbersome
      diapers.

      A larger gel containing pad was developed, suitable to absorb up to half a litter liquid, it
      eliminates odors and enables the users to wear ordinary clothes . It was presented for
      clinical trial.

      The objectives of the clinical trial, proposed hereafter is to assess to what extent the new
      gel pad presents an advantage over the existing means of coping with urinary incontinence in
      cases when medicinal treatment or surgery is not appropriate.
