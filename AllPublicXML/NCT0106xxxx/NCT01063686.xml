  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) complicates 0.7% of pregnancies. When
      PPROM occurs before the 24th week,the risk of fetal and neonatal death is 70%. There is also
      a high risk of neonatal and maternal morbidity. When the diagnosis of PPROM is uncertain by
      physical examination, additional tests are needed. These tests have false positive and false
      negative rates. The gold standard for diagnosing PPROM is amniocentesis and dye test. This
      procedure has a risk of infection and abortion.Our hypothesis is that by using a cervical cap
      for 6 hours and repeated ultrasound exams we can diagnose or rule out PPROM in cases which
      are uncertain. Our study group will be pregnant women gestational age 14-23, suspected of
      having PPROM.

    <description>Primary abdominal ultrasound (US) for amniotic fluid index (AFI), Single vertical pocket, and dimensions of pocket below the presenting part. Speculum vaginal examination. In a sterile manner a cervical cap is adjusted on the cervix. the patient is kept recumbent for 6 hours. A repeat US exam is performed. The cervical cap is removed. After one hour another US is performed.</description>
