      Purpose: The study null hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation will not influence time
      to acute respiratory tract infection in sheltered accommodation residents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will comprise sheltered accommodation residents and staff fulfilling
      eligibility criteria. Half of the sheltered accommodation schemes will be randomly allocated
      to 2-monthly oral bolus vitamin D supplementation (Vigantol oil) over a period of one year,
      and half to placebo.

      Participants will be followed for one year.
