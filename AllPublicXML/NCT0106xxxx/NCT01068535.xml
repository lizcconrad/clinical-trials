  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the vascular permeability of blood vessel walls (of
      the carotid artery) in pre-menopausal women who have metabolic syndrome (syndrome of having
      at least 3/5 following features- increased abdominal fat, low good cholesterol (HDL-C),
      elevated fasting blood fats (triglycerides), elevated blood pressure, an elevated fasting
      glucose) versus those women who are normal weight and with normal cholesterol, blood fats,
      blood pressure, and blood sugar. We are using a novel technology to measure vascular
      permeability known as dynamic contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). The
      primary variable is ktrans ratio which is a mathematically derived quantity obtained from
      DCE-MRI. We are trying to identify novel markers of early atherosclerosis in young women.

      This study involves a phone screen &amp; 2 study visits:

        -  Screening visit, which includes a quick finger stick cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides
           test (cholestech) to determine qualification, waist measurement, weight. Results are
           provided regardless of qualification. If the volunteer qualifies, a full blood draw
           (approximately 45cc or 3 Tablespoons) will occur. A snack is provided once blood is
           drawn. Additional study visit procedures include a medical history questionnaire
           including menstrual history, height &amp; weight measurement, vital signs, and waist &amp; hip
           measurements. This study lasts up to 90 minutes.

        -  MRI visit (to occur within a week of screening visit) occurs once serum pregnancy &amp;
           creatinine results are received &amp; only if approved to continue by P.I. (e.g. negative
           serum pregnancy and eGFR&gt;60). An IV catheter is placed in the antecubital vein to
           administer an injection of (gadolinium) contrast medium. A coil is placed on each side
           of the subject's neck while laying flat on a bench, with her upper body inside the MRI
           scanner. The entire MRI procedure takes approximately 60 minutes.
