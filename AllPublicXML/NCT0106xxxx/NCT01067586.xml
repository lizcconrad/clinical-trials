  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The extent of toxicity varies considerably across different brands of smokeless tobacco (ST)
      products and data suggest that greater toxicity may result in greater health risks. However,
      little is known about the actual extent of exposure to toxicants from current smokeless
      tobacco products and factors that might moderate the extent of this exposure. The goals of
      this project are to address the following questions:

        1. What are the characteristics of the range of smokeless tobacco products in current use
           and how do these products impact user behavior;

        2. What are novel and the best measures of smokeless tobacco use, behavior and exposure;
           and

        3. What are some of the determinants of smokeless tobacco use.

      Study 1 is a multi-site descriptive study assessing tobacco toxicants in various smokeless
      tobacco products and tobacco toxicant exposure found in 600 subjects in three sites:
      University of MN Twin Cities, Oregon Research Institute in Eugene OR, and at West Virginia
      University in Morgantown, WV (200 subjects per site). The study will examine the relationship
      between brands of U.S. smokeless tobacco products that contain different levels of
      tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), other carcinogens and nicotine, and biomarkers of
      exposure and effects on health (e.g., cardiovascular risk factors). Additionally, the study
      will examine factors that influence the extent of toxicant exposure and effect besides the
      levels of toxicants in the product. Subjects will attend an orientation where they will sign
      a consent form and then return for one clinic visit where they will provide blood (UMN only),
      urine samples, buccal samples and expectorated chews to be examined for nicotine levels,
      toxicant exposure and potential for tobacco-related health risks. A subsample of subjects (10
      per brand of smokeless tobacco) will be asked for a tin of their unused product for testing
      (they will be reimbursed for the cost of their tin) and will be asked for three samples of
      expectorated chews that will be collected, frozen and shipped to the CDC where they will be
      analyzed for tobacco constituents. Subjects will complete several questionnaires on their
      tobacco use history, alcohol, diet, physical and mental health. Subjects will also keep a
      daily diary of their tobacco and alcohol use.
