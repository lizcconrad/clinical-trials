      This study is designed to characterize the early effects of ApoA-I synthesis with RVX000222
      on coronary atherosclerotic disease when administered to patients with coronary artery
      disease and have a low HDL-C level, as assessed by Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) in
      addition to standard background therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-third of the US population, almost 80 million adults, have cardiovascular disease and
      mortality associated with heart disease still remains as a leading cause of death around the
      world. The major risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with atherosclerosis is
      dyslipidemia, characterized by high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or low levels
      of high density lipoprotein (HDL). The widespread use of statins in patients at risk for
      cardiovascular disease has led to lower LDL levels but has had little effect on HDL levels.
      HDL has a well established role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease protection. HDL
      mediates the removal of cholesterol from the atherosclerotic plaques for elimination from the
      body. The major component of HDL consists of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA I). Recent intervention
      studies with synthetic HDL particles and recombinant ApoA-I have shown that HDL has the
      capacity to reverse coronary atherosclerosis. Increasing ApoA-I is likely to have a favorable
      effect on atherosclerotic plaque stability and size and on cardiovascular diseases. RVX000222
      is a member of a novel class of small molecules that are candidates for the treatment of
      dyslipidemia by increasing plasma levels of HDL through increased ApoA-I transcription.

             control (for example, use of oral contraceptives or Norplant; a reliable barrier
             method of birth control (diaphragms with contraceptive jelly; cervical caps with
             contraceptive jelly; condoms with contraceptive foam; intrauterine devices; partner
             with vasectomy; or abstinence) during the study and for one month following the last

          5. In the opinion of the investigator patients currently on statin therapy other than
             atorvastatin (10 mg, 20mg or 40mg) or rosuvastatin (5mg, 10mg or 20 mg) can be
             switched to rosuvastatin (5mg, 10mg or 20 mg) at Visit 1.

          6. Patients must meet all of the following criteria at the qualifying coronary
             catheterization procedure:

             A. Entire Coronary Circulation: Angiographic evidence of coronary heart disease as
             defined by at least one lesion in any of the three major native coronary arteries that
             has &gt;20 percent reduction in lumen diameter by angiographic visual estimation or prior
             history of PCI. This vessel need not be the target coronary artery for IVUS. Any
             vessel with previous PCI may not be used as the target coronary artery.

             B. Left Main Coronary Artery: Must not have a &gt;50 percent reduction in lumen diameter

             a &lt;50 percent reduction in lumen diameter by angiographic visual estimation throughout
             a segment of at least 40 mm in length (the &quot;target segment&quot;). A lesion of up to 60
             percent stenosis is permitted, distal to the target segment. A single branch of the
             &quot;target vessel&quot; may have a narrowing up to but &lt;70 percent by visual estimation, as
             long as the target segment contains no lesion &gt;50 percent, provided that the branch in
             question is not a target for PCI or CABG. Has not undergone prior percutaneous
             coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The target vessel is
             not currently a candidate for intervention or a likely candidate for intervention over
             the next 6 months. The target vessel may not be a bypass graft. The target vessel may
             not be a bypassed vessel. The target vessel may not be the culprit vessel for a
             previous MI.

          7. Have given signed informed consent to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
