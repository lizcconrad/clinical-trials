  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of psychosocial treatment in patients with
      newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and/or diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research and clinical experience show that adaptation to chronic disease is affected by
      individuals' psychological and social situations and subjective experiences of threat to
      identity, autonomy, and life. It is important to identify persons whose psychosocial
      situation and reaction to the diagnosis is such that they may not be able to adjust to the
      illness or take adequate responsibility for adherence to treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to identify such at-risk persons, and with the help of
      psychosocial treatment, strengthen their resistance resources and help them work through
      emotional and social problems that hinder adequate adaptation and adherence to treatment.

      Beginning in 2001, 200 consecutive patients between 18 and 65 years who are newly diagnosed
      with either rheumatoid arthritis (n = 100) or diabetes (n = 100) at the Karolinska Hospital,
      Solna, Sweden, will be included in the study. Each person will be interviewed by a medical
      social worker about their psychosocial situation and possible problems. Every other patient
      with psychosocial problems will be offered intensive, personalized psychosocial treatment.
      The rest of the patients with problems will be given minimal required measures. The
      psychosocial well-being and medical situation of all patients (intensive treatment group,
      minimal treatment group, and the group without need of psychosocial measures) will be
      followed for 2 years and evaluated at the conclusion of that time.
