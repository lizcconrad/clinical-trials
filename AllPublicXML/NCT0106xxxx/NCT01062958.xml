  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, retrospective chart review to determine the effect of Neevo® or
      Neevo®DHA (with higher folate and B12) versus standard prenatal vitamins on hemoglobin (Hgb)
      levels in pregnant women throughout the course of pregnancy. Neevo® is a prescription medical
      food indicated for the dietary management of women under a doctor's care who face high risk
      pregnancies, older overactive bladder (OB) patients and patients unable to fully metabolize
      folic acid. Data will be collected from existing patient charts of subjects administered
      Neevo® or Neevo®DHA daily compared to subjects administered a prenatal vitamin daily.
