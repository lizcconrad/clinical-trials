  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a new metallic cannula to
      inject hyaluronic acid for dermal augmentation in the nasolabial folds compared to standard
      needle.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a monocentric, prospective, randomized, phase II and double-blind study.

      At the baseline visits, one investigator rated the severity of nasolabial folds on both left
      and right sides according to the mentioned scale, and a standard set of six photographs of
      the face (frontal, left side and right side for both the whole face and the lower face) were
      taken.

      On the day of the injection, the main investigator injected 1ml of dermal filler - hyaluronic
      acid (Restylane速, Q-Med, Uppsala, Sweden) - for each subject. The injected amount was 0,5ml
      for the right nasolabial fold and 0,5ml for the left nasolabial fold. The sides will be
      randomized.

    <description>The sides of injection were randomized and both the subject and the evaluator were blind to it. The injections were performed according through two different devices:
In one of the sides, the hyaluronic acid (Restylane速) was injected in its conventional pharmaceutical presentation, with a standard needle which is part of the product's kit;
In the other side, the hyaluronic acid (Restylane速) was injected through a metallic cannula, which replaced the needle of the product's kit.
Local analgesia was provided for both applications: topical analgesics 4% Lidocaine, for the application with the standard needle, and nerve block (Lidocaine 2%), where the application was performed with the metallic cannula.</description>
