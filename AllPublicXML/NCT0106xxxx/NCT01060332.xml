      300 patients with Diabetic neuropathy will be recruited in Taichung Veterans General Hospital
      endocrine and metabolism clinics. Body Constitution Questionnaire(BCQ), Diabetes Impact
      Measurement Scales(DIMS), Short Form -36(SF-36) will be asked to filled up, neurological
      examination (NE), AC sugar, HbA1c, lipid profiles, liver and kidney functions will be
      measured in order to evaluate the correlation between body constitution and quality of life
      on patients with diabetic complication.

      Diabetic Mellitus is the fifth cause of death by the report of Department of Health in 2008,
      and it often cause the severity of other chronic diseases. Neuropathy, retinopathy and
      renopathy are the most prevalent complications of DM, and they often influence the quality of
      life.

      Traditional Chinese Medicine was often prescribed to treat diabetic complications and improve
      the quality of life .But the study of objective evaluation of diagnostics of Traditional
      Chinese Medicine was few . It is important to analyze population of specific disease with
      well developed Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnostic tool with good validation and
      consistency.
