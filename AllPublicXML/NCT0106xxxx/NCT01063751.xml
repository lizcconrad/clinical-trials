  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, non-randomized evaluation of the Tritanium® Acetabular
      Shell for primary total hip replacement (THR) with a cementless application in a consecutive
      series of patients who meet the eligibility criteria. Half of the cases will use the X3®
      polyethylene insert alone as the bearing surface; the other half will use the MDMTM liner
      coupled with a compatible ADM/MDMTM X3® insert as the bearing surface.

      The success rate, defined as freedom from acetabular revision for any reason, for hips
      implanted with the Tritanium® Acetabular Shell, is no worse than for hips implanted with
      similar technology as reported in the literature and Trident® X3® Study historical control at
      5 years postoperative.

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) assesses pain, function, joint deformity and range of motion. Scores can range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best score. A score of 80-100 is considered good-excellent and a score of less than or equal to 79 is considered fair-poor. 90-100 = excellent 80-89 = good 70-79 = fair 0-69 = poor</description>

    <measure>SF-12 Heath Survey Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12-item patient completed questionnaire to measure general health and well-being. It includes a physical and mental status component score; each ranging from 0-100. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good health state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The LEAS is completed by the participant to assess activity level. Activity levels were ordered in terms of intensity from 1 to 18, with 18 indicating the highest activity level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>1,2,3,4, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess subject health state values. The EQ-5D consists of 2 areas; the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) and EQ-5D descriptive system. The EQ VAS collects health state values using a 20 cm visual analogue scale with the endpoints labeled best imaginable health state at the top and worst imaginable health state at the bottom, having numeric values of 100 to 0 respectively. The EQ-5D Time Trade-off (TTO) descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems and extreme problems, where an overall score of 1 represents full health.</description>

    <measure>Follow-Up Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Follow-up Questionnaire is a short patient questionnaire intended to provide information on patient satisfaction, pain, and whether or not there have been any revisions or removals since the last follow-up visit. It consists of three questions:
Patient satisfaction with the hip replacement
Presence of any pain in the study hip
Any surgeries performed on the study hip</description>

    <measure>Acetabular Shell Radiographic Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 1, 3, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Numerous parameters will be reviewed by zone, including radiolucency and migration. All data will be evaluated in order to classify each case as stable or unstable.</description>
