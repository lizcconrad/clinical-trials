  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to examine the rate at which elevated body
      temperature (fever) is relieved by an itraconazole injection administrated to patients
      experiencing neutropenic fever . A neutropenic fever is an elevated body temperature that
      occurs at a time when the patient's white blood cell count is low. White blood cells aid the
      body's normal defenses against infection, so a fever during this period might make it
      difficult for the patient to fight infections.

      This study is a multi-center, open-label, prospective and observational study enrolling
      approximately 440 patients. The primary objective of this study is to examine the fever
      response rate after itraconazole IV (directly into the vein) is administered for more than 3
      days to patients with neutropenic fever based on investigator's discretion. Follow-up will be
      performed before and after administration and for 7 days after administration. Study
      population consists of the patients who visit a study center during the study period and are
      judged to have neutropenic fever associated with hematologic malignancy such as acute
      leukemia, hodgkin's lymphoma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and multiple
      myeloma. The decision to treat patients with itraconazole is as per physician discretion and
      doses are determined based upon approved labeling recommendations and physician discretion.
      The safety and efficacy of itraconazole administered beyond 29 days is not yet been
      established in the treatment of fever in neutropenic patients suspected of systemic fungal
      infection. Itraconazole 200 mg IV twice daily for 2 days, for a total of 4 doses, then 200 mg
      IV once daily for 12 days. After the administration for a total of 14 days, itraconazole oral
      solution 200 mg (20 ml) twice daily should be continued for a total of 14 days
