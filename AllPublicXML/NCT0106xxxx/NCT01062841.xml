  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study aimed at reducing multi-drug resistance and infections in
      nursing home (NH) residents. Each year, a staggering 1.5-2.0 million infections occur in NHs.
      Many of these infections are caused by multiple drug resistant organisms (MDROs) including
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE),
      and multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli (R-GNB). Antimicrobial resistance among common
      bacteria are adversely affecting the clinical course and exponentially increasing healthcare
      costs. Recognizing a need for action, legislators, policy makers, and consumer groups are
      advocating for pathogen-based universal preemptive screening for these MDROs, particularly
      MRSA in hospitals and NHs. However, implementing this sweeping mandate is controversial,
      costly, reactive, and not based on empirical evidence. It can result in a 10-20-fold increase
      in the number of NH residents placed in isolation precautions with the potential for reduced
      attention by healthcare workers, isolation and functional decline. The investigators proposal
      evaluates a novel focused approach between 'do nothing' and 'search all and destroy'
      strategies by targeting a subgroup of NH residents with indwelling devices who are at a high
      risk of acquiring MDROs and infections.

      The investigators hypothesize that the investigators targeted infection control program (TIP)
      will reduce MDRO colonization and infections in NH residents with indwelling devices. This
      cluster randomized trial will involve 12 NHs; 6 will be randomized to the TIP arm and 6 to
      the routine care arm. The investigators TIP intervention will include four components.

      Component 1: Institute enhanced barrier precautions for all NH residents with indwelling
      devices; active screening for MDROs (monthly) using cultures collected from multiple body
      sites to identify asymptomatic MDRO carriage in these residents; and dissemination of results
      to clinical staff and administration.

      Component 2: Structured, active surveillance for infections using standardized definitions in
      residents with indwelling devices and dissemination of results to clinical staff and
      administration.

      Component 3: A hand hygiene promotion program.

      Component 4: A structured educational program pertaining to indwelling device care for
      healthcare workers.

          <title>Charlson's Comorbidity Score</title>
          <description>Charlson's comorbidity score is a weighted index that takes into account the number and seriousness of comorbid disease. It is a classification of comorbid conditions what might alter the risk of mortality in longitudinal studies. 19 conditions are scored with 1, 2, 3, or 6 points. Total Score Range 0 to 37, with increasing scores indicating increasing burden of comorbidity (by increased number of comorbid conditions present, or increased severity of conditions present).</description>

          <description>Functional disability was assessed using Lawton and Brody’s physical self-maintenance scale. Patients are evaluated on their ability to perform six activities of daily living (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing, physical ambulation), with 1 = independent, 2 = needs reminders, 3 = needs moderate assistance, 4 = needs extensive assistance, 5 = needs full assistance or resistant to care. The total physical self-maintenance scale ranges from 6 to 30, with increasing scores indicating increasing disability to perform activities of daily living.</description>
