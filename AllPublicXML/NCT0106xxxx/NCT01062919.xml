  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing colon open
      surgery. The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different analgesic techniques
      on functional recovery after surgery.

      Twenty five patients will receive thoracic epidural analgesia plus patient controlled
      analgesia (PCA) (epidural analgesia group) and 25 patients wound infiltration of local
      anesthetic plus PCA (wound infusion group).

      Hypothesis: the postoperative recovery of patients receiving local anesthetic wound infusion
      will be faster than patients receiving thoracic epidural analgesia.

      Functional recovery, pain intensity, opioid consumption and side effects, length of hospital
      stay and biological markers of inflammation after surgery will be measured in both groups.

      This is double blinded randomised study of patients undergoing colon open surgery. One group
      of patients will receive thoracic epidural analgesia plus patient controlled analgesia (PCA)
      (epidural analgesia group) and the other group will receive infiltration of local anesthetic
      plus PCA (wound infusion group). Functional restoration, assessed by self-administered
      quality of Life questionnaires (SF-36, CHAMPS, ICFS) and 2 and 6 min walking test will be
      assessed in the two groups at 3 and 8 weeks after the surgery.
