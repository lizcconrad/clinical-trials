  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity causes frailty in obese older adults by exacerbating the age-related decline in
      physical function. However, appropriate management of obesity in older adults is
      controversial. Weight loss without exercise could worsen frailty by accelerating the usual
      age-related decline in muscle and bone mass that leads to sarcopenia and osteopenia,
      respectively. Because of the important problem of frailty in obese older adults, it is
      important to determine the most efficacious approach in reducing, or even reversing frailty
      in this population. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate which distinct type
      of physical exercise (resistance, aerobic, or combined resistance + aerobic) is most
      efficacious in preventing the weight-loss-induced reduction in muscle and bone mass and
      reversing frailty in obese older adults.
