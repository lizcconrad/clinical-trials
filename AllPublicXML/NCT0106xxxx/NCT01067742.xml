      identify potential clinical outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is an autosomal recessive disorder typically characterized by
      severe psychomotor delay evident by the end of the first year of life and slowly progressive
      visual impairment during the first decade as a result of a combination of corneal clouding
      and retinal degeneration. By the end of the first decade of life, and always by their early
      teens, individuals with typical MLIV develop severe visual impairment as a result of retinal
      degeneration. MLIV is an under-diagnosed and unique lysosomal disorder in that it often is
      mistaken either for cerebral palsy or for a retinal dystrophy of unknown cause. In addition,
      it is caused by a defect in a cation channel rather than by a lysosomal hydrolase. This study
      represents the only prospective clinical study in this patient population. Now that an animal
      model has been created and novel therapies will likely be tested, it is particularly
      important to define the natural history of this disorder and identify potential clinical
      outcome measures.
