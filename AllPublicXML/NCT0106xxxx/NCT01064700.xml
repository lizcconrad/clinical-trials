    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research was to examine the influence of bright light on anxiety in
      high-anxious young adults. In an acute exposure study, participants were randomly assigned to
      45 min of either (1) bright light (3,000 lux) or (2) a placebo inactivated negative ion
      generator. Treatments were initiated ≤1 hr after awakening. At 10 min before and 30 min after
      the treatments, state anxiety, mood, and blood pressure were assessed.

      Following the acute exposure study, participants performed a 5-week study. Following a a
      1-week baseline, participants were randomly assigned to four weeks of daily exposure to
      either (1) bright light (45 min/day; 3,000 lux) or (2) placebo inactivated negative ion
      generator, which were initiated ≤1 hr after awakening. Before and after the experiment,
      clinical ratings were conducted with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Hamilton Depression
      Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI). Following baseline, and following
      each week of treatment, blood pressure, as well as questionnaires for state anxiety,
      depression, mood, sleep, and side effects were assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Having a level of trait anxiety [Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form
             Y1)]{23642} that was ≥ the 75th percentile for their age (i.e., ≥ 46 and ≥ 44 for
             women and men, respectively)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current treatment for anxiety or depression;

          -  History of bipolar disorder, mania, or psychotic disorders;

          -  History of winter depression, which might bias towards positive response to light;

          -  Hypertension;

          -  Ophthalmic abnormalities; and

          -  Usual exposure to high levels of light such that the intervention would add little to
             usual exposure.
