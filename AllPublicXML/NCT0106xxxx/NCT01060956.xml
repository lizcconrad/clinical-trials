  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether identification of two different bacteria in
      urine culture of patients with indwelling catheter has a clinical impact - change in
      antibiotic, duration of antibiotic, days to clinical resolution and length of stay in
      hospital.

      The microbiology laboratory will randomized urine cultures with two bacteria from indwelling
      catheter to either reporting identity and susceptibility of the bacteria or reporting &quot;mixed
      growth&quot;.
