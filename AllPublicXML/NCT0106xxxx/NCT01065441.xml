    <textblock>
      A Phase I/II study of an in-situ therapeutic cancer vaccine. Vaccines contain a source of
      antigen and and adjuvant. In this study the source of tumor antigen comes from the killing of
      a selected tumor by cryoablation (killing using extreme cold) and the adjuvant is
      intentionally mis-matched immune cells (AlloStim-TM) engineered to produce inflammatory
      cytokines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical study to investigate the optimal protocol and indication for
      creating a personalized anti-tumor vaccine within the body of patients with cancer. The aim
      of the study is to evaluate the safety of administration and anti-tumor effect of a vaccine
      protocol that has three separate steps. Cancer patients generally present with an immune
      response to cancer biased to a Th2 response, while a Th1 response is considered necessary for
      mediating anti-tumor immunity. The first step of the study consists of multiple intradermal
      priming doses of AlloStimTM. The aim of this step is to create Th1 immunity to the
      alloantigens in AlloStimTM, thus increasing the number of Th1 cells in circulation. The
      second step of the protocol involves the cryoablation of a selected tumor lesion followed by
      an intratumoral AlloStimTM injection. The aim of this step is to generate tumor-specific CTL
      killer cells in the circulation. The final step is an intravenous infusion of AlloStimTM. The
      aim of this step is to activate circulating Th1 cells, killer cells, and natural killer
      cells. The further aim of this step is to create an inflammatory environment that can
      break-down the ability of the tumor to avoid an anti-tumor immune response. In patients with
      partial responses and recurrence of disease, additional intravenous &quot;booster&quot; infusions are
      utilized to reactivate the circulating immune cells.

             ovarian or other gynecological cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic or other GI cancer,
             melanoma, head or neck cancer or lymphoma/plasmacytoma.

          -  Measurable disease determined upon review of abdominal and/or chest CT scan within 60
             days of evaluation for study inclusion with a target tumor lesion for cryoablation or
             alcohol ablation located in liver, kidney, bone, lung, adrenal, pancreas, lymph node,
             skin, neck or prostate deemed to be accessible for percutaneous access or

             for ablation must have adequate distance from adjacent vasculature and other organs to
             permit safe application of cryoprobe (generally, more than a 2.5cm clearance of the
             cryoprobe from any vital structure such as the bowel, inferior vena cava, or aorta).
             The safety assessment of the cryoprobe placement will be made an attending radiologist
             based on imaging studies.

          -  No concurrent medication known to interfere with platelet function or coagulation
             (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, clopidogrel, or warfarin) unless such medications can be
             discontinued for an appropriate time period based on the drug half-life and known
             activity (e.g., aspirin for 7 days) prior to cryoablation procedure

          -  No low molecular weight heparin preparations unless can be discontinued 8 hours prior

             allowed to participate. For patients on warfarin, the INR should be monitored weekly
             prior to the cryoablation day to assure INR is stable. However, heparin or warfarin
             must be withheld prior to cryoablation such that the above criteria are met.
