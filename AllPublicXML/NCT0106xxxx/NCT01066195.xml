  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemetrexed was known to be effective to pulmonary adenocarcinoma and gefitinib was known to
      be more effective to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with clinical
      characteristics such as adenocarcinoma, never smoker and female.

      The investigators try to evaluate which drug (pemetrexed vs gefitinib) is more efficious to
      NSCLC patients with clinical characteristics such as adenocarcinoma and never smoking history
      as second- or further-line therapy.
