  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether surgical treatment of chronic sinusitis improves asthma control in
      patients with poorly controlled asthma. This is a randomized trial of surgical plus medical
      sinus therapy versus medical therapy alone.

        defined by the following criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of asthma confirmed either by demonstrating a positive methacholine
             challenge test (defined as a decrease in FEV1 by at least 20%, following
             administration of 8mg or less of inhaled methacholine) or a positive bronchodilator
             response (defined as a change from base line of &gt;12% and at least 200ml in either FEV1
             or FVC, following administration of a short-acting, inhaled bronchodilator).

          2. Either:

               -  Asthma Control Questionnaire score &gt; 1.5 or

               -  Use of inhaled rescue ÃŸ-agonist &gt;/= 16 puffs per week (excluding use as a
                  pre-medication for exercise; 1 nebulizer treatment = 2 puffs of inhaler) at any
