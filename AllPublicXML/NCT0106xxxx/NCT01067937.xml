  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that appendicitis is one of the most frequent surgical pathology in
      children, its clinical management is still debated. Previous reports have shown rate of
      appendectomy in children without appendicitis up to 30 %. Morbidity, due to infectious
      complications or intestinal obstruction, is often between 5 and 10 % of published cases, and
      increase medical and social costs. Evidence-based medicine concept could therefore be
      worthwhile in that context, in order to promote rational diagnosis and treatment of that
      frequent medical condition.An algorithm describing management of children with suspicion of
      appendicitis was established, based on recent published data, in order to reduce delay
      between first clinical signs and confirmation of the diagnosis, and to define therapeutic
      indication such as conservative management and interval appendectomy or patient requiring
      laparoscopic approach. The main objective of the study is to decrease morbidity and
      unnecessary appendectomy rates, and secondly to decrease costs, by the use of that algorithm.
