      The investigators propose a project of preventive medicine with concern of local context in
      Taiwan. The target population includes all staff and faculty members, students, and alumni of
      a university in Northern Taiwan, with chronic hepatitis B infection. The intervention of this
      project includes standardized lectures, sports courses, nutrition courses, and an information
      platform. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy after the intervention, like the
      reduction of hepatitis B viral load and the associated anthropometric parameters. The results
      of this project will be initially served as a pilot study for this cohort, and applicated as
      a promising basis for health promotion.
