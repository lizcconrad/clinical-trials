  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      JNJ-42160443 compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe, chronic bladder pain
      from interstitial cystitis and/or painful bladder syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned drug) study to evaluate the
      analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of JNJ-42160443 compared with placebo in
      patients with moderate to severe, chronic bladder pain from Interstitial cystitis (IC) and/or
      painful bladder syndrome (PBS). Interstitial cystitis (IC) and PBS are urological disorders
      characterized by symptoms of bladder pain, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and the need
      to get up during the night in order to urinate. The study has 3 phases: a screening phase (up
      to 3 weeks), a double-blind treatment phase (12 weeks), and a post-treatment phase that ends
      26 weeks after the last dose of study medication. The study duration will be approximately 36
      to 46 weeks.

      A single dose of JNJ-42160443 (9 mg/ml) or matching placebo given as an injection under the
      skin once every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks.
