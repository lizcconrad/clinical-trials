  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bevacizumab, capecitabine and oxaliplatin
      are an effective and safe first line of treatment for elderly patients with metastatic
      colorectal adenocarcinoma.

      The efficacy will be determined by objective response rate following RECIST criteria.

      In several clinical trials with Bevacizumab, there has been demonstrated that elderly
      patients benefits as well as the younger of a combination therapy with chemotherapy plus
      Bevacizumab, but these results have come from subgroup analyses of trials not specifically
      design to test the effect of these combinations on the elderly. This clinical trial is
      specific only for elderly patients and we expect to confirm the benefits demonstrated in
      other clinical trials where the elderly patients were a number reduced.

      This clinical trial includes 3 substudies:

      - Assessment of tumor response of CRC liver metastases to treatment with Avastin in
      combination with Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin as first line treatment by dynamic ultrasound
      contrast.

      Main objective: Assess the performance of dynamic contrast ultrasonography (CEUS, Contrast
      Enhanced UltraSound) with quantification of tumor perfusion in the evaluation of tumor
      response of liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma to treatment with Avastin in combination
      with Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin.

      -Evaluation of the antiangiogenic activity of bevacizumab combined with oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine in first line treatment using MDCT perfusion studies in liver metastases of
      colorectal cancer in patients over 70 years.

      Main objective:Determine whether the observed changes in perfusion CT studies performed at 2
      weeks of starting treatment compared to baseline are significant predictors of free time to
      disease progression in patients in the trial and defined as the time since the start of
      treatment until objective progressive disease by RECIST criteria.

      -Characterization of resistance to bevacizumab in colon cancer in elderly patients.

      Main objective: To evaluate the involvement of serum markers and markers in the primary tumor
      in the resistance to bevacizumab.
