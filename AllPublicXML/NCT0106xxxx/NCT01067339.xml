    <textblock>
      AIM III is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial. The study is
      directly connected to IRB 08-008161 as a specific aim of the National Institute of Health
      (NIH) grant. Participants may either consent to and qualify for AIM I and AIM II (IRB
      08-008161) or have a cardiac catheterization with acetylcholine testing in the Cardiac
      Catheterization Laboratory at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota to be considered for this
      study.

      The main goal of AIM III is to assess and quantify the effect of long-term administration of
      darapladib 160 mg once a day, a selective, reversible, orally active inhibitor of plasma and
      vascular Lp-PLA2, on coronary endothelial function, progression of coronary atherosclerosis
      as determined by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and atherosclerosis in patients with early
      atherosclerosis. Patients with evidence of coronary endothelial dysfunction, as determined by
      intracoronary administration of acetylcholine during angiography and IVUS, will be followed
      for 6 months during once daily dosing of darapladib. Coronary endothelial function is
      determined by the changes in coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow response to the
      intracoronary administration of acetylcholine and adenosine. The patients will be followed in
      clinic 6 months. They will have follow-up angiography, assessment of endothelial function,
      and IVUS during the six month visit.
