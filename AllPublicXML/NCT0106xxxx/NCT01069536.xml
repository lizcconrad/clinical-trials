      Study Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of metoclopramide administration in bolus
      versus slow infusion medications in ED patients complaining of nausea for the determination
      of the therapeutic effect and prevention of akathisia.

      Methods:

      This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. The investigation was held between 01
      March 2007 and 01 May 2008, in the Emergency Department of Pamukkale University Faculty of
      Medicine. The patients with moderate to severe nausea randomized and divided into two groups
      as for the previously planned administration type of drug. Ten mg metoclopramide was
      administered in one group with slow infusion (SIG) in 15 minutes, via 2 minutes bolus
      infusion (BIG) into the other group. Whole procedure was observed, akathisia and nausea
      scores and vital changes were recorded.
