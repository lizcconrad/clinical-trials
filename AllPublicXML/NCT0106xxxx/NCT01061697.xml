  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of pregabalin (Lyrica) on nerve pain
      caused by degenerative neck problems. Pregabalin is a new drug registered for use in nerve
      pain worldwide

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of neuropathic pain is clinically challenging, and pain from cervical
      spondylosis (CS) is a common variant. This may result from degenerative spinal canal/cord
      stenosis (cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM)) or lateral recesses compromise, leading to
      nerve root compression (cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR)).

      Pregabalin is a newly registered drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Its efficacy has
      been proven in randomised, placebo-controlled trials for post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic
      neuropathy. However, its efficacy in CS with underlying CSR or CSM has not been established.
      Additionally, there are no data to date on its use in Asian patients.

      In this study, we prospectively evaluate its efficacy for treating neuropathic pain in
      degenerative CSR/ CSM 60 patients in an open-labelled, add on fashion. Self-evaluation and
      investigator rated scoring will be implemented.

      The results will be of value in the non-operative management of CS.
