  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans or TAO) is a rare disease (1/ 10
      000) characterized by the development of segmental thrombotic occlusions of the medium and
      small arteries of the extremities. Afflicted patients are mostly young, male, inveterate
      tobacco (or cannabis) smokers who present with distal extremity ischemia, ischemic ulcers, of
      the toes or fingers. Large arteries are typically spared, as are the coronary, cerebral, and
      visceral circulations. Patients with TAO often suffer from severe ischemic pain and tissue
      loss culminating in minor and major limb amputation. Clinical diagnostic criteria generally
      include history of tobacco abuse; age of onset less than 50 years; infrapopliteal, segmental
      arterial occlusions with sparing of the proximal vasculature; frequent distal upper extremity
      arterial involvement (Raynaud's syndrome or digital ulceration); superficial phlebitis; and
      exclusion of arteriosclerosis, diabetes, true arteritis, proximal embolic source, and
      hypercoagulable states.

      While the cause of Buerger's disease remains unknown, the disease onset and clinical course
      are inextricably linked to tobacco (or cannabis) abuse. Tobacco abstinence generally results
      in disease quiescence and remains the mainstay of treatment. For some unknown reason,
      clinicians observed that TAO patients rarely discontinue smoking even though amputation is
      usually the inevitable consequence and the only method available of controlling pain and
      ulceration. Few studies were realized and Hofer-Mayer and coll. found remarkable personality
      features comparing to coronary patients: TAO patients significantly changed their place of
      work more often, had more absenteeism from work, smoked more before the illness and continued
      to smoke more frequently during their illness, were more often single or divorced and had
      more conflicts in their relationships. Those facts led us to explore their psychopathology
      and their addictive profile.

      Purpose: Search the prevalence of personality disorders in Buerger's patients who present
      with tobacco or cannabis smoking.

      Hypothesis: Patients with Buerger's disease show remarkable personality features
      (psychological and addictive profile) which are vulnerability factors to stop smoking
      (tobacco or cannabis) compared to patients with atheromatous arteritis.

      We include 200 Buerger's disease patients and 200 atheromatous arteritis patients, smoking
      tobacco or cannabis. First visit explores psychiatric disorders with MINI DSM IV (Lecrubier
      et al 1997), personality disorders with SCID II (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV);
      Addictive profile and Substance Use (or abuse) is evaluated with specific questionnaires
      (Rapid Addictive Profile, Fagerström and Cannabis questionnaire); Neuropsychological tests
      (Frontal Assessment Battery at bedside Dubois et al 2000; Stroop test , Stroop 1935);
      clinical assessment of the illness (Buerger and Atheromatous arteritis); and psychoactive
      substance and cotinine detection in urine. A second visit one year later will be realized
      with same assessments.
