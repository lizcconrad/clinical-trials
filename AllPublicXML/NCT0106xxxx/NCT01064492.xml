  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF 04620110 is an acylCoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) inhibitor that is being
      developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is anticipated that PF
      04620110 will have anti diabetic effects through inhibition of intestinal triglyceride
      absorption and potentially weight loss. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of multiple oral formulations of PF 04620110
      administered to healthy volunteers.
