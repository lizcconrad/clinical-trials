    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot patients with chronic limb ischemia and without the option for surgical or
      interventional revascularization were recruited and randomized to the transplant groups or
      the control group within this clinical trial. These patients are randomized to control or
      intervention group, whereas the intervention is divided into bone marrow cells administered
      intramuscular or intraarterial or expanded bone marrow cells administered intramuscular or
      intraarterial resulting in five distinct groups. To measure the therapeutic effects of the
      various treatment arms patients were evaluated for (ankle brachial index (ABI),
      transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (TcPO2), and reactive hyperemia (Blood Oxygen Level
      Dependent [BOLD]). Patients also underwent imaging with angiographic methods.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot (DF) is a concomitant illness of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is one of the main
      causes of non-traumatic amputation worldwide due to severe peripheral arterial occlusive
      disease with chronic critical limb ischemia being the most abundant problem. Ulceration
      occurs as failure of oxygenation, nutrient supply and progressive occlusion of larger blood
      vessels often exacerbates pre-existing microvascular abnormalities.

      Purified bone marrow mononuclear cells or expanded bone marrow cells enriched in Cluster of
      Differentiation 90+ (CD90+) mesenchymal stem cells (named tissue repair cells, [TRCs]) are
      used in the treatment of diabetic ulcers in comparison to bone marrow derived stem cells to
      induce revascularization of the affected limb and to enhance local perfusion. Cells are
      administered intramuscular or intraarterial. A control group of patients treated according
      national guidelines without stem cells serves as comparator.
