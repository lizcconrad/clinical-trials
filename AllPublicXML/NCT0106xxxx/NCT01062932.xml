    <textblock>
      Psychosocial treatments for drug abuse benefit some patients (Rawson et al 2004), but there
      is an urgent need for new treatment approaches that can improve treatment outcomes. One new
      approach involves facilitation of extinction of conditioned responses through the use of
      d-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the NMDA glycine site. This approach has proved useful
      for the treatment of several anxiety disorders. For example, treatment with d-cycloserine
      enhanced the efficacy of behavioral treatments for acrophobia (Ressler et al 2004) and social
      phobia (Hofmann et al 2006) by enhancing extinction of conditioned fear responses. This
      suggests that d-cycloserine has potential to enhance the efficacy of behavioral treatments
      for drug dependence by enhancing extinction of conditioned responses to drug cues. In this
      Phase I Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA) application we propose a proof-of-concept
      study to examine effects of treatment with d-cycloserine for facilitating extinction of
      craving provoked by exposure to cigarette smoking cues. The benefits of this treatment
      approach together with cognitive behavioral treatment for reducing cigarette smoking will
      then be determined. Smoking cues will be presented using an established virtual reality
      simulator(Bordnick et al 2004; Bordnick et al 2005a)

    <measure>The effects of four weeks of single dose treatment with d-cycloserine or placebo on craving elicited by exposure to &quot;virtual reality&quot; smoking cues</measure>
    <description>The study will evaluate the effects of treatment with d-cycloserine (50mg administered prior to each exposure treatment) or placebo (n=20 per cell), on the efficacy exposure therapy using a virtual reality cue for smoking cessation when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Craving ratings will be assessed using standard questionnaires, which will be completed prior to and following virtual reality cue exposure. Smoking cessation and cocaine use will be assessed at three follow-up visits.</description>

    <description>Study sessions will include assessment of urinary cocaine and breath CO, and participants will self-report cigarette smoking and cocaine use over the previous week. Smoking cessation and cocaine use will also be assessed at three follow-up visits.</description>
