  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study, of post pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) patients to
      determine the clinical utility of the Implantable Loop Recorder. These type of patients
      either are monitored with weekly transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) or implantable loop
      recorder (ILR). The Medtronic Reveal XT loop recorder will be implanted at the time of the
      PVI or at the 3-4 month PVI follow-up visit and patient care will be managed based on
      randomization to a blinded or unblinded group. Outcome measures will be compared to aid in
      decision making regarding anticoagulation and overall post ablation clinical management.

      This is a randomized pilot study, of post pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) patients to
      determine the clinical utility of the Implantable Loop Recorder. The Medtronic Reveal XT
      implantable Loop Recorder is a market released device indicated for patients with clinical
      syndromes or situations at increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, and patients who experience
      transient symptoms that may suggest a cardiac arrhythmia. These type of patients either are
      monitored with weekly transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) or implantable loop recorder (ILR).
      Neither approach has been shown to be superior. As both approaches are currently being
      performed based on physician preference, the investigators propose to study and compare both
      approaches in a randomized fashion for evidence based practice. The Medtronic Reveal XT loop
      recorder will be implanted at the time of the PVI or at the 3-4 month PVI follow-up visit and
      patient care will be managed based on randomization to a blinded or unblinded group. Outcome
      measures will be compared to aid in decision making regarding anticoagulation and overall
      post ablation clinical management.
