      Primary objective shared by the 3 registries : Describe the different pharmacotherapeutic
      management in patients :

        -  DB (Diabetes): with type 2 diabetes, treated with oral and / or injectable antidiabetics

        -  CP (Chronic Pain): with any disease leading to chronic pain (lasting for more than 3
           months)

        -  AF (Atrial Fibrillation): with ongoing AF or AF diagnosed within 12 months before
           enrollment

      Secondary objectives shared by the 3 observatories:

        -  Describe the occurrence of clinical events, hospitalizations and death, according to the
           different medical care conditions, and analyze their predicting factors

        -  Estimate the resources consumption according to the medical and non medical management
           of these patients,

        -  Analyze the impact of some factors (patient's cognitive status, autonomy, renal function
           ...) on the current practice

      Secondary objectives specific shared by DB and AF registries :

      - Analyze the geriatric pharmaco-genetic aspects

      Specific secondary objectives for each observatory :

        -  DB : Describe HbA1c level, percentage of responders and body weight evolution according
           to the different medical care conditions

        -  CP : Evaluate pain consequences on Daily Living Activities and patient autonomy
