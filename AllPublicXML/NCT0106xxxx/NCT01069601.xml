    <textblock>
      The trial investigates the efficacy of the adjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccine Focetria(R) in
      immunocompromised adults who have undergone solid organ or bone marrow transplantation. It is
      expected that when administered twice the vaccine fulfills all serological efficacy criteria
      required for the elderly population age 60 years and older.

    <measure>The adjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccine, when administered twice in transplanted patients, fulfils all serological efficacy criteria as required for the elderly population (aged 60 and older) according to the respective European guidance documents.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The adjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccine in transplanted patients, when administered twice, is at least as effective as the adjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccine in the healthy volunteers after only one administration.</measure>
