  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess migration of the MIS Stem compared to the Synergy
      Hip System, and to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of the study device using
      Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA). This study will document any device-related surgical or
      post-operative complications and adverse radiographic observations.

      Patients meeting the entrance criteria specified in this protocol will be randomized as they
      become available.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the current investigation is to compare migration of the device after
      implantation with a modular, short hip stem called the &quot;MIS Stem&quot; or a standard THA using the
      Synergy Hip System using Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA). The intended use of this product
      is for patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease who require
      a primary total hip replacement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has hip disease that requires a total hip arthroplasty.

          -  Patient is willing to consent to participation in the study.

          -  Patient plans to be available for follow-up through study duration.

          -  Patient is of stable health and is free of or treated and stabilized for any condition
             that would prose excessive operating risk.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has insufficient femoral bone stock.

          -  Patient has had major non-arthroscopic surgery to the study hip.

          -  Patient has physical, emotional or neurological conditions that would compromise the
             patient's compliance with postoperative rehabilitation and follow-up.

          -  Patient has a known sensitivity to materials in the device.
