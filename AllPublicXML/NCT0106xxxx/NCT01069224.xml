      Role of proinflammatory factors in Patients with Rotator Cuff Disease

      Objective:

      To measure the levels of various cytokines and metalloproteases in patients with rotator cuff
      disease, and control group and to determine the correlations among them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that cytokines and MMP's level will be significantly higher in patients with
      RC pathology than in control group and will be related to the time frame since injury (i.e. -
      higher levels as close to the injury). In addition we will examine possible relation of those
      levels to the pain curve by using Visual Analogue Scale.
