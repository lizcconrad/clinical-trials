  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is used to maintain adequate perfusion of vital organs in
      cardiac arrest patients and is fundamental for the neurological outcome and survival of these
      individuals. Unfortunately, the quality of CPR may be inadequate due largely to ineffective
      chest compressions resulting from rescuer fatigue and interruptions in compressions. The
      LUCAS device (Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System, Jolife, Lund, Sweden),
      introduced in 2002, is the most extensively tested and applied automated alternative to
      manual CPR for in-hospital care of cardiac arrest patients and during ambulance transfer; the
      feasibility of application of this device in helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS)
      operations, however, has never been addressed. The objective of this project is to equip the
      three active rescue helicopters in South Tyrol with the LUCAS 2 mechanical chest compression
      device to answer the question: What is the feasibility and efficiency of using this device
      for prolonged CPR in cardiac arrest patients requiring CPR during HEMS rescue operations and
      transport?

      This is a non-controlled, observational study. Physiological endpoints: MAP (mean arterial
      pressure); etCO2 (end-tidal expiratory pCO2); ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation); PaO2
      (arterial pO2); PaCO2 (arterial pCO2); endpoints to assess feasibility: time from arrival to
      start of mechanical compressions, problems during transfer into the helicopter and in-field
      manoeuvers, problems with application of device, problems with patient transfer to hospital
      premises, hands-off time, personnel requirements.
