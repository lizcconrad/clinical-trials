    <textblock>
      Smoking remains a major risk factor for chronic diseases and is a real problem for health
      systems. The use of emerging technologies, such as mobile phone , may have a important role
      in smoking cessation programs through sending reinforcement messages when patients quits
      smoking.

      Main objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined 6 months smoking cessation
      program including health advice provided by a doctor and sending support messages to mobile
      phone of patients.

      Methods: Study design: Randomized single blind clinical trial. Study population: Patients
      over 18 who are willing to start a smoking cessation program, who have mobile phone, who are
      able to receive and send messages, and who have a score greater than 5 or equal to 5 on the
      Richmond scale.

      Sample size: 160 patients per arm to detect a difference in the percentage of smoking
      cessation than 10% (14.9% vs. 4.9%) between the two groups. Intervention: Experimental group:
      Health advice and support messages to mobile phone patients.

      Control group: Health advice. Assessment of the primary endpoint: At 6 months
      (positive/negative coximetry test).

      Statistical analysis: The analysis of the primary endpoint (positive / negative coximetry
      test) will be performed using logistic regression.
