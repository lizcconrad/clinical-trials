    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the change in pulmonary function and exercise
      capacity in lung cancer patients after pulmonary resection. Furthermore, to study the effect
      of training on aerobic capacity, muscular strength, morbidity and survival. Physical activity
      level by accelerometers, body composition by DXA and quality of life will also be reported.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five year after surgery, all included patients will be reinvited to undergo a fourth health
      excame to study the long-term effects of exercise training on physical fitness, morbidity and
      survival.
