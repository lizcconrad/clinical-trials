  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, active and placebo controlled,
      parallel group study to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral arbaclofen in MS
      patients with spasticity.

      Eligible subjects will be removed from anti-spasticity mediations for at least one week and
      then begin study drug treatment with daily doses increasing up to the target dose which will
      then be maintained for at least 12 weeks. A down-titration will then occur over two weeks
      with the final study visit occuring at 19 weeks from start of achieving the target dose or 22
      weeks from the Study Visit 1.

    <time_frame>Change in baseline from Visit 1 through Visit 9 (120 days) or end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline through end of treatment in the pre-dose, morning TNmAS of the most affected limb. The most affected limb is determined at baseline using the sum of scores for three major motor groups. High scores indicate more severe spasticity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) through end of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 9 (120 days) or end of study</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC is a global rating scale that captures the investigator's assessment of the subject's change in overall functional performance since starting the study. Scores range from -3 (significant worsening) to +3 (significant improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale (MSSS-88)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Visit 9 (120 days)</time_frame>
    <description>This MSSS-88 is a self-administered questionnaire for the subject to assess overall functional performance and sense of impairment with respect to the level of spasticity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the TNmAS for the most affected limb</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to visits 4 (22 days), 5 (36 days), 6 (50 days), 7 (71 days), and 9 (120 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Ashworth Scale is a six (6)-point rating scale that measures abnormality in tone or the resistance to passive movements. Measurements are made in three muscle groups of each limb. The most affect limb is determined at baseline, based on the sum of scores from each limb. Higher scores indicate more severe spasticity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the TNmAS for the sum of all limbs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to visits 4 (22 days), 5 (36 days), 6 (50 days), 7 (71 days), and 9 (120 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The sums of scores from all limbs are compared to the baseline sum. Higher scores indicate more severe spasticity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Visit 9 (120 Days)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is based on an examination by a neurologist with a scale that ranges from zero (0) to ten (10) in half point (0.5) unit increments. Higher scores represent higher levels of disability.</description>

Maximum muscular strength is the maximum amount of tension or force that a muscle or muscle group can voluntarily exert in one maximal effort. Scores for each muscle or muscle group range from 0 (no detectable activity) to 5 (normal activity).</description>
