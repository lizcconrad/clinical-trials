  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine whether or not physical changes or
      adaptations occur in response pregnancy or to the higher intakes of folic acid from
      supplementation typically consumed during the reproductive period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Higher folate requirements during pregnancy to support growth and development are well
      established but it is unknown what metabolic changes occur in 1-carbon metabolism to provide
      sufficient nucleotides for DNA/RNA synthesis. Periconceptual folic acid (FA) supplementation
      and fortification of the food supply have been shown to reduce the risk of pregnancies with
      neural tube defects but conversely expose women to high FA intakes for extended periods of
      time. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to establish if physiological adaptations
      occur in folate metabolism in response to pregnancy or higher intakes of FA typically
      consumed among women during the reproductive period. A convenience sample of thirty-two women
      (n=8/group) were recruited to compare the total concentrations and forms of folate
      (tetrahydrofolate [THF], 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF and 5, 10-methenylTHF) in red blood cells
      in four groups: a) pregnant women (PW, 30-36 weeks gestation) taking 1.0 mg of FA b)
      non-pregnant women (NPW) taking 0 mg of FA c) NPW taking 1.0 mg FA and d) NPW taking 5.0 mg
      FA. Blood samples were taken at a single time point and compared across groups. Total red
      blood cell concentrations were measured using both microbiological assay and liquid
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis. LC/MS/MS analysis was used to
      determine folate form concentrations.

          1. pregnant women-

               -  between 30 to 36 weeks gestation

               -  taking 1 mg folic acid in a multisupplement

          2. non-pregnant women-

               -  not pregnant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking any medications known to interfere with folate absorption at the time of
             sampling (ie. Antibiotics [ can be enrolled into study if they will be off them at
             least two weeks prior to study commencement], methotrexate, aminopterin)

          -  Those with a history of any disorders or conditions that could interfere with folate
             absorption or metabolism from either dietary or supplement sources such as the
             history/presence clinically significant gastrointestinal disease (chronic diarrhea,
             inflammatory bowel disease, partial gastrectomy), unresolved GI
             symptoms(diarrhea/vomiting), steatorrhea or other conditions that interfere with
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of folic acid.

             diabetes; previous child with neural tube disorder (NTD), cleft-lip/palate or heart
             defect; epilepsy and/or seizure disorders) that can increase the risk of pregnancy
