  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data suggest that progesterone may improve smoking cessation outcomes perhaps by reducing
      impulsive behavior. However, the clinical literature on this topic is lacking. Therefore, in
      Project I we are proposing a double-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the role of
      exogenous progesterone on impulsivity and smoking cessation in a sample of males and females
      who are motivated to quit smoking.

      Subjects will be stratified by sex and then randomly assigned to active progesterone (PRO) or
      placebo (PBO).

      Telephone screening and visit invitation leads to the consent process and in-person screening
      including medical-psychiatric evaluation for inclusion/exclusion, then randomization and
      medication induction, stable medication with medication reduction and final evaluation for
      secondary outcomes.

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome is the binary indicator of relapsed yes/no at the week 4 visit. An unadjusted assessment of the treatment effect will come from a logistic regression of this binary outcome on randomized treatment assignment, separately by sex. All persons randomized and with a measured primary outcome at the week 4 visit will be included in this analysis, regardless of whether or not they ever took any of their assigned treatment (intent-to-treat analysis).</description>

Behavioral Inhibition/Activation scales (BIS/BAS): These short 20 items forms commonly used scales to study externalizing tendencies.

Brief Self Control Scale (BSCS): This item consists of 13 questions rated on a 4-point scale from &quot;very true&quot; to &quot;very false&quot; on items reflecting the ability to control problematic behaviors.</description>
