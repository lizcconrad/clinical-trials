      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. The key to prevention of
      visual loss from glaucoma is early detection of the disease or its progression and timely
      treatment. The proposed study will investigate the role of various tests in improving
      detection of disease progression in advanced glaucoma. Evaluation of the peripheral field of
      vision (visual field examination) remains the current standard for detection of progression
      in glaucoma. However, there is a lot of variability or inconsistency in eyes with advanced
      glaucoma, which could make it difficult to detect worsening of glaucoma with visual fields.
      The optic nerve demonstrates significant damage in such eyes and hence oftentimes repeat
      imaging of the optic nerve head is not helpful for detection of change. Therefore, imaging of
      the central retina (the innermost sensitive tissue lining the inside of the eye), called
      macula, has been proposed to supplant imaging of the nerve in eyes with severe glaucoma. The
      macula aids in detailed central vision. Since the macular retinal neural cells are the last
      ones to be affected in glaucoma, measurement of macular retinal thickness could provide
      significant information with regard to the course of glaucoma. In the proposed study,
      glaucoma patients will be tested and followed with various measurements done with newer
      versions of optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and visual field machines. The
      patients will undergo repeat imaging and visual field testing every 6 months over the course
      of 5 years. Rates of change will be estimated. We will explore if changes in various outcome
      measures derived from imaging are correlated with the corresponding visual field changes in
      glaucoma, and whether the former can be used as an alternative method for detecting
      simultaneous or subsequent glaucoma progression. The hypothesis for this proposed research is
      that macular OCT parameters are valid structural measures that can be used especially in
      advanced disease to follow the course of glaucoma.

      Glaucoma is a major public health issue worldwide and manifests clinically as a chronic
      progressive optic neuropathy with concomitant visual field (VF) loss. Glaucoma can cause
      significant visual disability and decreased quality of life (1). Based on WHO's report in
      2002, glaucoma is the second cause of blindness. The key to prevention of visual loss from
      glaucoma is early detection of the disease or its progression and timely treatment. Glaucoma
      can be quite advanced at the time of initial detection. The prevalence of advanced glaucoma
      at the time of diagnosis varies but can be quite high. For example, the average VF mean
      deviation (MD) in patients diagnosed with glaucoma in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study was
      âˆ’9.6 dB (2), which represents moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. Detection of
      progression in advanced stages of glaucoma continues to be challenging. Visual field
      examination remains the gold standard for detection of progression in advanced glaucoma.
      However, long-term VF variability or noise in such eyes is significant, which could confound
      detection of change. The optic nerve head and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)
      demonstrate significant damage in such eyes and hence are not helpful for detection of
      change. About 50% of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are located within 4-5 mm of the macular
      center (3). Since the macular RGCs are the last ones to be affected in glaucoma, measurement
      of macular retinal thickness or retinal sublayers could provide significant information with
      regard to the course of advanced glaucoma.

      The macular retinal sublayers can now be measured with reasonable accuracy with SD- OCTs.
      There is some evidence that measurement of the macular ganglion cell complex (GCC, combined
      thickness of RNFL, RGC and inner plexiform layer or IPL), or macular retinal thickness or
      volume may detect early glaucoma with a performance that approximates that of circumpapillary
      RNFL thickness measurements (4,5). In addition, such macular measurements have proved to be
      very reproducible (4,6). Given this excellent reproducibility, macular outcome measures would
      be the main candidates for following glaucoma eyes with advanced damage, in which the macular
      region is essentially the only retinal area with residual RGCs.
