      An open, single group, single center Study to confirm CTC-Actiwise™ as a means to record and
      monitor the progression of a patient's COPD.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects growing patient groups. Current
      knowledge about the disease limits the investigators ability to cure or interfere with the
      progression of the disease. COPD is often characterized by exacerbating infections requiring
      emergency care.

      The project aims to examine whether disease progression of COPD can be better controlled by
      continuously monitoring the patient's physical activity, along with the assessment of
      pulmonary symptoms and lung function. A key question is: can investigators find indicators
      that provides support for early intervention before severe symptoms arise.

      The patient carries a smartphone that records physical activity real-time, daily lung
      function measures, lung disease related symptoms, and use of medication.

      The experimental phase, the first part of the project, covers 25 COPD patients followed up to
      12 weeks where the primary objective is to examine and verify both new investigational
      methodology and technology.

    <description>Improved health following an exacerbation is expected to be reflected by an increase in patient's physical activity performance recorded real time. The physical activity trend is compared with the trends in twice-daily recordings of symptom scores, use of rescue medication, and lung function. The correlation between the trends is measured.</description>
