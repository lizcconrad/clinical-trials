    <textblock>
      Epirubicin is a common chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of breast cancer.
      However, chemotherapy dosing is calculated based on people's height and weight, which may not
      be the most accurate way. The purpose of this study is to see if epirubicin dosing based on
      people's genetic profiles is better than the usual methods.
