  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uganda is one of the countries with highest fertility rate in the world, 6.7 children per
      women. It is estimated that 56 percent of all pregnancies are unintended and the
      contraceptive prevalence rate in Uganda is 23 percent. Unwanted pregnancy is common and
      induced abortion is illegal. Unsafe abortion is responsible for significant morbidity and
      mortality among women in Uganda. Almost 40% of admissions to emergency obstetric care units
      in Uganda due to unsafe abortion is reported and considered high in international comparison.
      Studies have revealed that trained midlevel providers can deliver safe post abortion care for
      incomplete abortion and use manual vacuum aspiration. The prostaglandin E1 analogue
      misoprostol has been shown to be an effective tool in the treatment of incomplete abortions.
      This option is so far under-used in developing countries, especially outside the larger
      hospitals and private clinics. One significant limiting factor in providing safe post
      abortion care is the lack of providers. So far technical training has been mainly limited to
      physicians. Training of midlevel providers in misoprostol treatment of incomplete abortion
      will support task shifting in places where doctors are costly and scarce. By evaluating the
      effectiveness of mid-level providers (midwives); conducting MVA and administering misoprostol
      treatment of incomplete abortion the project is attempting to contribute to the reduction of
      maternal mortality and morbidity and safeguard high quality of post-abortion care.

      Women with incomplete abortion will be randomly allocated to undergo a clinical assessment
      and treatment (MVA or misoprostol) either by physician or midwife with safety and efficacy as
      main outcomes in a RCT carried out in hospital setting in Uganda. Our hypothesis is that
      there are no significant differences in effectiveness and safety between manual vacuum
      aspiration and misoprostol treatment of incomplete abortion provided by physicians and
      midwife.

      The involvement of midlevel providers in treatment of incomplete abortion has previously not
      been systematically evaluated in African health care setting.

    <textblock>
      The project concerns a randomised controlled trial (RCT) aiming to determine whether midwives
      and physicians can perform medical treatment for incomplete abortion equally safely at
      primary care level. All patients included are women admitted due to incomplete abortion and
      will undergo clinical examinations and treatment in accordance with standard procedures
      (Bluhm et al., 2007, WHO, 2010). A total of 880 women seeking with symptoms of incomplete
      abortion will be included after giving their informed consent and randomised to diagnosis and
      care provided by either midwives or physicians. The study will be conducted at the National
      referral hospital (Mulago in Kampala). A coordinating centre will be established at the
      Mulago Hospital in Kampala in order to monitor the study. Included in the coordinating team
      physicians will be involved and have the ultimate responsibility for the medical care
      provided within the study. The coordinating physicians will evaluate and monitor the midwives
      and physicians performance to safeguard that the care provided is safe and thus do not put
      women at risk or the health care provider in any legal inconvenience. All health care
      providers at the study site included will be provided training that follows the structure of
      Ipas who have updated standardized training modules within abortion and post abortion care
      which is used internationally. Dr Charles Kiggundu, one of the principal investigators is
      currently involved in training for providers at national level in Uganda and thus has
      adequate competence and experience. The health care provider's attitude and communications
      skill is one core component in the training. The importance of the study and the study
      procedure will be another important aspect of the training in order to motivate health care
      providers involved in the care at the selected study sites.
