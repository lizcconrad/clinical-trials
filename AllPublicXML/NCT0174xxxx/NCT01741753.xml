    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of
      an investigational drug, in this case an investigational drug combined with standard drug
      therapy. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug
      to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and
      taht research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has
      not approved the drug for use in patients, including people with your type of cancer.

      BKM120 is a drug that inhibits the ability of tumors to grow and survive, which may lead to
      better outcomes in many types of cancer.

      Abiraterone acetate is a drug that is approved for the treatment of prostate cancer, and
      works by inhibiting an enzyme found in prostate tumor tissue. While taking abiraterone
      acetate, individuals must also take a glucocorticoid such as prednisone.

      Most patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer will receive treatment with docetaxel,
      after which treatment with the combination of abiraterone and prednisone has been shown to be
      effective. Evidence has shown an interaction between the pathways through which BKM120 and
      abiraterone act on cancer. Therefore, it is thought that the treatment of castrate-resistant
      prostate cancer will be enhanced by combining BKM120 with abiraterone plus prednisone. The
      purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose for the combination of daily oral BKM120,
      abiraterone acetate, and prednisone in patients with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate
      cancer who have received prior treatment with docetaxel.

      You will undergo a screening process to determine if you are eligible to participate in this
      trial. This process will include the following procedures: Tumor Biopsy, including a bone
      marrow biopsy, which is used to determine the kinds of cancer cells in your tumor and a
      Physical Examination, including weight, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body
      temperature.

      Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely
      without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have docetaxel resistant
      CRPC, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the
      study drug. The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled
      in the study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses.

      If you take part in this research study, you will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for
      each treatment cycle. There will be a 14 day lead in phase of BKM120 alone to assess for
      toxicity from this agent. After the lead in phase, the standard dose of abiraterone and
      prednisone will be added to the BKM120 treatment regimen. Treatment cycles will last 4 weeks
      (28 days), during which time you will be taking the study drug in combination with the
      standard drug therapy once daily. Your time of participation in the study will be based on
      how well you tolerate the experimental drug. You could be participating in the study for a
      period of days, or years, depending on the course of your cancer.

      During each treatment cycle, you will be required to return to see your research doctor for a
      study visit on Day 1 of each cycle. For Cycle 1, you will also need to return on Days 8, 15
      and 22.

      The following procedures will be performed and samples will be collected at 1 or more study
      visits: Evaluation of side effects, Vital sign measurement, Heart function tests,
      Neuropsychologic exams, Performance status assessment, Tumor biopsy, Assessment of tumor,
      Blood samples.

      We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life. We would
      like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you are doing. Keeping
      in touch with you and checking your condition every year will help us look at the long-term
      effects of the research study. You will be required to return to see your research doctor for
      an end of study visit, which will take place 4-8 weeks after you undergo prostatectomy.
