      Evaluate visual outcomes and contrast sensitivity for subjects undergoing bilateral myopic
      LASIK procedure using the 200 kHz WaveLight® FS200 Femtosecond Laser and the WaveLight®
      Allegretto Wave® Eye-Q Laser. The use of advanced technology may decrease the loss of
      contrast sensitivity and improvement of postoperative visual acuity results.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Male or female in good general health, 18 years of age or older at the time of the
             pre-operative examination

          -  Patient must be able to read, comprehend and willing to give HIPPA and informed
             consent

          -  Patient is planning to undergo a bilateral LASIK procedure

          -  Both eyes must have a manifest refractive error from -1.00 D to -7.00 spherical
             equivalent with less than or equal to 3.00D of refractive astigmatism as expressed in
             spectacle minus cylinder form

          -  Both eyes must have a BSCVA of 20/20 or better

          -  Both eyes must demonstrate refractive stability confirmed by clinical records,
             previous glasses, or investigator's discretion.

          -  Patient must be willing to comply with study dosing and complete the entire course of
             the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  A patient with evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal
             videokeratography in either eye

          -  A patient seeking monovision

          -  A patient with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the procedural or
             post-LASIK medications

          -  A patient requiring the use of any ocular drop(s) and/or medication(s) in either eye
             during the study period with the exception of ocular drops and/or medications provided
             by the investigator

          -  A patient having any surgical procedure within a week preceding the scheduled LASIK
             surgery

          -  A patient with any UNCONTROLLED systemic disease (i.e., a potential patient in whom
             therapy for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized )

          -  A patient with a history of prior intraocular or corneal surgery (including cataract
             extraction), active clinically significant ophthalmic disease or abnormality
             (including, but not limited to, blepharitis, recurrent corneal erosion, dry eye
             syndrome, neovascularization &gt; 1mm from limbus), clinically significant lens opacity,
             clinical evidence of trauma (including scarring) inside the visual axis, or evidence
             of glaucoma or propensity for narrow angle glaucoma in either eye

          -  A patient with a significant history or current evidence of a medical, psychological
             or other disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, may increase the risk
             associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study
             results

          -  A patient with a history of any of the following medical conditions, or any other
             condition that could affect wound healing: uncontrolled diabetes, collagen vascular
             disease, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency diseases, ocular herpes zoster or
             simplex, endocrine disorders (including, but not limited to unstable thyroid disorders
             and diabetes), lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Current participation or participation within 30 days prior to the start of this study
             in a drug or other investigational research study.
