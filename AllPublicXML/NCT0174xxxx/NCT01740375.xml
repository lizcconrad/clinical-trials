  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the role of esophagectomy in complete responders to preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, patients will be randomized to
      either observation or esophagectomy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, patients will be reassed and visited to
      multidisciplinary clinic, then, randomized to either observation or esophagectomy.

             medical illnesses

         13. New York heart Association Class III/IV and history of active angina. Documented
             myocardial infarction within the 6 months preceding registration. Patients with a
             history of significant ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or congestive heart
             failure. History of 2nd or 3rd degree heart blocks.

         14. Active infection or other serious underlying medical condition which would impair the
             ability of the patient to receive the planned treatment

         15. Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding and giving of
             informed consent

         16. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus: fasting glucose &gt;150 mg/dL or patients requiring
             insulin therapy for glycemic control; fasting glucose &gt;150 mg/dL or patients requiring
