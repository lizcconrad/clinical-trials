  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for the frontline treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphomas
      (PTCL) is induction chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).
      However, many patients are unable to get to ASCT or relapse after ASCT, with a poor
      prognosis. Recently, a novel ASCT conditioning regimen of gemcitabine, busulfan and melphalan
      (Gem/Bu/Mel) has been reported to lead to favorable outcomes in this disease. We therefore
      designed a frontline regimen of CHOEP induction followed by Gem/Bu/Mel ASCT, and report the
      results of a phase 2 study of this regimen in patients with PTCL.

      Objectives:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 24 months after
           beginning induction therapy

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the response rate (complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)) after
           CHOEP x 6 and after Gem/Bu/Mel ASCT

        -  To estimate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), cumulative incidence
           of relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM)

        -  To estimate the toxicity (grade 3 and above)

        -  To estimate the rate of successful stem cell mobilization after CHOEP in responding
           patients

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients who can successfully complete the entire
           treatment regimen

        -  To estimate the time to engraftment of neutrophil and platelet engraftment after ASCT

        -  To determine whether tumor DNA can be detected in peripheral blood of patients before
           therapy

        -  To evaluate the changes and prognostic relevance in detectable tumor DNA in peripheral
           blood after induction chemotherapy (CHOEP) and after Gem/Bu/Mel ASCT

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>24-month Progression-Free Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was re-staged at cycles 3 and 6 during induction, at day 100 post-ASCT, and in long-term follow-up at months 12, 18, 24 and 36. All patients were evaluable up to month 24.</time_frame>
    <description>24-month progression-free survival rate is defined as the proportion of patients remaining alive and progression-free at 24 months from start of induction therapy. Disease progression was assessed using a combination of CT scans and PET scans. Progression was categorized according to standard lymphoma response criteria, specifically the Revised Response Criteria (Cheson 2007).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Induction Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was re-staged at cycles 3 and 6 during induction. Median duration of induction therapy in this study cohort was 6 cycles/18 weeks (range 2-6 cycles).</time_frame>
    <description>Induction response is the defined as the proportion of patients who achieve complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) during 6 cycles of induction therapy. Reponse was assessed was using a combination of CT scans and PET scans. Partial and complete response were categorized according to standard lymphoma response criteria, specifically the Revised Response Criteria (Cheson 2007). Given the cycle length of 3 weeks, induction duration per protocol was 18 weeks.</description>

    <description>Patients received 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Etoposide and Prednisone (CHOEP) (5 if previously received 1 cycle of CHOP). CHOP was given at standard doses, with a dose of etoposide of 100 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) or 200 mg/m2 orally added on days 1-3 of each cycle. Patients who did not achieve a partial (PR) or complete (CR) remission at restaging after either 3 or 6 cycles were taken off study. Responders after 6 cycles had stem cell (SC) mobilization using filgrastim and plerixafor (if necessary) within 4 weeks of the end of induction. SC mobilization, harvesting, and reinfusion were performed per standard institutional protocol. A minimum collection of 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg was required to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant. Conditioning was comprised of gemcitabine 2700 mg/m2 on days -8 and -3, IV busulfan 105 mg/m2 days -8 to -5, and melphalan 60 mg/m2 given daily on days -3 and -2 (per MD Andersen protocol).</description>

        <title>24-month Progression-Free Survival Rate</title>
        <description>24-month progression-free survival rate is defined as the proportion of patients remaining alive and progression-free at 24 months from start of induction therapy. Disease progression was assessed using a combination of CT scans and PET scans. Progression was categorized according to standard lymphoma response criteria, specifically the Revised Response Criteria (Cheson 2007).</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was re-staged at cycles 3 and 6 during induction, at day 100 post-ASCT, and in long-term follow-up at months 12, 18, 24 and 36. All patients were evaluable up to month 24.</time_frame>

            <description>Patients received 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy: Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Etoposide and Prednisone (CHOEP) (5 if previously received 1 cycle of CHOP). CHOP was given at standard doses, with a dose of etoposide of 100 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) or 200 mg/m2 orally added on days 1-3 of each cycle. Patients who did not achieve a partial (PR) or complete (CR) remission at restaging after either 3 or 6 cycles were taken off study. Responders after 6 cycles had stem cell (SC) mobilization using filgrastim and plerixafor (if necessary) within 4 weeks of the end of induction. SC mobilization, harvesting, and reinfusion were performed per standard institutional protocol. A minimum collection of 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg was required to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant. Conditioning was comprised of gemcitabine 2700 mg/m2 on days -8 and -3, IV busulfan 105 mg/m2 days -8 to -5, and melphalan 60 mg/m2 given daily on days -3 and -2 (per MD Andersen protocol).</description>

Median duration of induction therapy was 6 cycles/18 weeks (range 2-6 cycles). 3 patients continued to ASCT within 7 months of study enrollment.</time_frame>
      <desc>Maximum grade toxicity by type was first calculated. Serious AEs were defined as events with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definitely and grade 3 or higher per CTCAEv4.
