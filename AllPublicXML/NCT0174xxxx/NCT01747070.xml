  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) and electro acupuncture (EAC) compared to sham treatment in reducing pain,
      improving functional capacity and functioning of the neuro-immune-endocrine system in
      patients with chronic pain due to knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The knee osteoarthritis has high prevalence, which tends to increase with the aging
      population. The limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions stimulates the search for
      other options, in order to increase the therapeutic success. Acupuncture is widely used for
      pain control in several pathologies. A modality of intramuscular stimulation to quantify the
      intensity of the stimulus is electro acupuncture (EAC) that the intensity of 2 Hz accelerates
      the release of enkephalins, endorphins and beta-endorphins. The application of electric
      currents to modify brain function is a very old technique. The transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) is based on applying transcranial direct weak current (usually above 2mA)
      through electrodes in a non-invasive, simple and painless. Other advantages include low cost
      and the possibility of a placebo reliable. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      ability to reduce pain and improve functionality in chronic pain for knee osteoarthritis with
      two techniques, one that promotes a bottom-up approach (EAC) and other top-down (tDCS). We
      will seek to analyze the efficacy of them separately and together, seeking summation of
      results.
