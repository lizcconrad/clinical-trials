    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to analyze the radiographic density of digital subtraction
      radiographs after SMART restoration with partial caries removal in primary molars at 6 and 12
      months.

      In management of deep caries in primary teeth, the partial caries removal approach favored
      the arrest of dentin carious lesions, reduced cariogenic micro-organisms and the risk of pulp
      exposure. The carious tissue at the lateral walls of the cavity at the enamel dentin junction
      (EDJ) was removed by a spoon excavator without carious tissue removal at the pulpal site.
      After caries removal, restoration using glass ionomer cement (GIC)(GC Fuji IXâ„¢GP extra) was
      completed. Such an approach is called SMART restoration. The serial radiographs of each
      restoration consisted of three radiographs; immediately after restoration, at the 6-month
      follow-up and at the 12-month follow-ups. Digital subtraction radiography(DSR) was used to
      evaluate dentin remineralization following partial caries removal. Image-Pro Plus software
      was used to evaluate DSR. For evaluating the changes in DSR, areas with increase density show
      higher radiopacity, whereas areas with decreased density show higher radiolucency. The
      6-month and 12-month follow-up radiographs were subtracted from the baseline radiograph.
