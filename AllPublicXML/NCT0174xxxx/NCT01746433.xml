    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the percentage of patients that successfully
      pass from a laying position to a sitting position in less than 10 seconds between study arms:

        -  experimental arm: these patients will use the ERGONOME device to help them sit up

        -  standard arm: these patients will use traditional hanging triangle bar to help them sit
           up
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following between study arms:

        -  The average time (s) required to sit up

        -  How the patient's center of gravity moves in relation to a fixed axis

    <description>The patients randomized to this group will use the &quot;l'ERGONOME&quot; device for aid in sitting up exercises.
Commercial name of the device: SAM ERGONOM (TM)
Manufacturer: Medicatlantic groupe Winncare, Le Pas du Château, 85680 Saint-Paul-Mont-Penit</description>

    <intervention_name>Sitting up</intervention_name>
    <description>The patient is positioned on a Winncare type bed dressed with a pressure-sensor sheet and equipped with either a hanging triangle bar (supporting arm of the bar is adjusted to 30 degrees) or an ERGONOME device according to randomization.
The patient is first installed on the bed in a strictly supine position, the pelvis centered, and the greater trochanter over the fold of the backrest.
The investigator then gives instructions on how to use the randomized device (correct hand placement).
The patient is asked to sit up twice (two consecutive attempts). The first attempt is a learning attempt. The observations necessary for this study will be taken on the second attempt. Thus the second sitting attempt is timed, video-taped and recorded via the pressure-sensor sheet beneath the patient.</description>
