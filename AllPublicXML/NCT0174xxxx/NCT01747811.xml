  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) or &quot;concussions&quot; are an increasingly prevalent injury in
      our society. Patients with post-concussion syndrome have been shown to have deficits on tests
      of short term memory, divided attention, multi-tasking, information processing speed, and
      reaction time, as well as alteration in mood and emotional functioning. Many patients have
      other vague complaints including fatigue, dizziness, irritability, sleep disturbances, and
      chronic headaches. Furthermore, sleep disruption of one of the most common complaints in
      patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries, with as many as 40 to 65% of patients with
      mTBI complaining of insomnia. Sleep problems in these patients are associated with poorer
      outcome, while resolution of the sleep disturbance is associated with improvement in
      cognitive functioning.

      Despite recent evidence of the correlation between sleep quality and recovery from traumatic
      brain injury, and the well-established role of sleep in neural plasticity and neurogenesis,
      there have been virtually no direct studies of the causal effects of sleep on recovery
      following mTBI. However, it is quite likely that sleep plays a critical role in recovery
      following brain injury.

      A particularly promising non-pharmacologic approach that shows potential in
      improving/modifying abnormalities of the circadian rhythm and sleep-wake schedule is bright
      light therapy. For the proposed investigation, we hypothesize that bright light therapy may
      be helpful in improving the sleep of patients with a recent history of mTBI and may also have
      other mood elevating effects, both of which should promote positive treatment outcome in
      these individuals. Bright light therapy may increase the likelihood that they will recover
      more quickly, benefit more extensively from other forms of therapy, and build emotional and
      cognitive resilience.

    <measure>Performance on Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline performance at 6 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSLT is a objective measure of sleepiness. Participants will take a brief nap 3 times during the 1st and second visit. The period of time between wake and sleep onset will be utilized as an objective measure of sleepiness (in minutes). A mean value will be calculated for the entirety of the pre-treatment napping periods and for the post treatment visits.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 6 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self report measure of sleep quality. The overall score takes into account many different facets of sleep, such as sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disturbances, etc. The scores range from 0-21, and any score that is equal to or greater than 5 is indicative of poor sleep quality.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 6 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy is an objective measure that determines sleep vs. wake. It is a watch with an accelerometer worn on the wrist. Sleep quality is determined by the amount of time in bed divided by the amount of time sleeping (in minutes).</description>

    <description>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a neuropsychological assessment that measures different facets of memory including the following: immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, attention, and delayed memory. This is given to all participants on both pre and post treatment visits. The total range for this scale is 40-160. Lower values represent a worse outcome, and higher values represent an improved outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 6 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) is a self report scale utilized for measuring the severity of depression. Scores can range from 0-63 (0 meaning minimal depressive symptoms, and 63 being severe depressive symptoms). Participants are given this on baseline and post treatment.</description>
