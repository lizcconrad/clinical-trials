  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 1 year study is to see if the ICCAN program is working, and to compare
      the ICCAN program to the standard hospital services provided in New York City hospitals, like
      meeting with a Social Worker or a Patient Navigator (a person who provides personal hospital
      guidance).

        Eligible cancer patients will be recruited in person by multilingual ICCAN research
        assistants for participation in the study at Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and
        Prevention (RLCCP), Lincoln Hospital (LH) and Lutheran Medical Center (LMC). In the event
        that MSKCC staff is not present when an eligible patient is identified on site, potential
        patients may be referred to MSKCC for screening and enrollment using a Referral/Permission
        to Contact Form.
