      ABSTRACT The purpose of the study is to investigate if a monetary incentive can increase the
      response rate for vulnerable children and youth in a postal survey. A secondary purpose is to
      test if monetary incentive has an effect on the content of answers in a postal survey. The
      study is a randomized controlled trial where participants will be randomly allocated to
      receive a questionnaire together with a €15 voucher for a supermarket or to only receive a
      questionnaire. Data are taken from an intervention study aiming at creating network for
      different groups of vulnerable children and youth aged 8-23 years. The questionnaire survey
      in the present study is a follow up survey of the original study which are performed 1-2½
      years after the participant have left the study. Recruitment to the original study is still
      ongoing and the investigators expect the total participation to be around 250. In the primary
      analysis the investigators will estimate the relative risk (RR) to assess whether there is a
      difference between group allocation and questionnaire response rate. The investigators will
      adjust for age in the analysis. In the secondary analyses the investigators will test whether
      scores on the five SDQ scales are different between group allocations. The investigators will
      adjust for the covariates age and gender, since the scores may depend on age and gender (4).

      ABSTRACT The purpose of the study is to investigate if a monetary incentive can increase the
      response rate for vulnerable children and youth in a postal survey. A secondary purpose is to
      test if monetary incentive has an effect on the content of answers in a postal survey. The
      study is a randomized controlled trial where participants will be randomly allocated to
      receive a questionnaire together with a €15 voucher for a supermarket or to only receive a
      questionnaire. Data are taken from an intervention study aiming at creating network for
      different groups of vulnerable children and youth aged 8-23 years. The questionnaire survey
      in the present study is a follow up survey of the original study which are performed 1-2½
      years after the participant have left the study. Recruitment to the original study is still
      ongoing and The inestigators expect the total participation to be around 250. In the primary
      analysis the investigators will estimate the relative risk (RR) to assess whether there is a
      difference between group allocation and questionnaire response rate. The investigators will
      adjust for age in the analysis. In the secondary analyses the investigators will test whether
      scores on the five SDQ scales are different between group allocations. The investigators will
      adjust for the covariates age and gender, since the scores may depend on age and gender (4).

      BACKGROUND Non-responders in questionnaire surveys may introduce bias and lower the validity
      of the studies. A Cochrane review has identified trials evaluating different ways of
      increasing response rates (1). The odds of responding on postal questionnaires were almost
      doubled using monetary incentive, and the odds were higher when the incentive was given with
      the questionnaires compare to only given after participants had responded. However, to our
      knowledge none of the studies concerned vulnerable children and youth. The purpose of the
      study is to investigate if a monetary incentive can increase the response rate for vulnerable
      children and youth in a postal survey. A secondary purpose is to test if monetary incentive
      has an effect on the content of answers in a postal survey.

      METHODS/DESIGN Study design The study is a randomized controlled trial. To study the effect
      of incentive on survey response participants will be randomly allocated to receive a
      questionnaire together with a €15 voucher for a supermarket or to only receive a
      questionnaire.

      Participants Inclusion criteria: Participants are taken from an established intervention
      study aiming at creating network for different groups of vulnerable children and youth aged
      10-23 years. The groups comprise: children in foster care, former foster youth, children of
      mental ill parents, children of parents with alcohol abuse and children raised in violent
      families. Participants who have given informed consent to take part in the evaluation of the
      established intervention study and thereby agree to fill out questionnaires and report their
      unique personal identification number are eligible to take part in the study.

      Exclusion criteria: Based on the participants unique personal identification number
      (CPR-number in the Danish Civil Registration System) the Central Office of Civil Registration
      will provide us with addresses of the participants. Participants, who are not available in
      the Civil Register either because participants are dead, immigrated or have requested survey
      exemption, are excluded from the study. Participants who have reported incomplete
      identification number will also be excluded.

      Participant recruitment At the moment 215 children and youth have given informed consent that
      they will participate in the evaluation of the original study. Recruitment to the original
      study is still ongoing and the investigators expect the total participation to be around 250.
      The questionnaire survey in the present study is a follow up survey of the original study
      which will be performed 1-2½ years after the participant have left the original study. The
      present study will be performed in 4 waves. The first wave will be performed in November 2012
      and will include participants who have left the original study 1-2½ years ago. The second,
      third and fourth waves will be performed May 2013, November 2013 and May 2014, respectively,
      1-1½ years after the participants have left the original study. The outcome will be measured
      over a perod of 1½ years.

      Randomisation The randomization will be performed within each wave of the survey. The
      participants are given a unique identification number in the original study and this number
      will also be used for the present study. The first 3 digit in the identification number
      identifies the municipality of the participants and the last digit are given in the order the
      participants enters the original study. Within each wave of the study participants will be
      sorted according to their identification number and will be assigned a random number between
      0 and 1. The investigators will use the Rand ('uniform') function in SAS to create the
      randomization sequence. If the numbers are less than 0.5 the participants will be allocated
      to control otherwise participants will be allocated to treatment.

      Blinding Neither participant nor researchers are blinded to the intervention.

      INTERVENTION The intervention group will receive a postal questionnaire together with a
      voucher worth €15 for the largest supermarket chain in Denmark. Non-responders will after
      three weeks receive a reminder together with another copy of the questionnaire. In both cases
      the questionnaire will be sent with a cover letter and a reply paid return envelope.

      The control group will only receive a postal questionnaire. Non-responders will after three
      weeks receive a reminder together with another copy of the questionnaire. In both cases the
      questionnaire will be sent with a cover letter and a reply paid return envelope.

      After 10 weeks duration the study period will be over and the participants in the control
      group will receive a similar voucher as the intervention group. This is done for ethical
      reason, so both groups are treated equal. Any responses after 10 weeks will be reported, but
      will not be included in the primary and secondary analyses.

      OUTCOME MEASURES The postal questionnaire consists of 91 items. The core of the questionnaire
      is the strengths and difficulties questionnaire SDQ (3) covering children and young people's
      behaviours, emotions, and relationships. Further topics in the questionnaire are: Family and
      housing; education and training; leisure time; alcohol consumption and evaluation of the
      intervention in the original study.

      The primary outcome measure will be questionnaire response rate which is defined as the
      proportion of questionnaires returned by participants. The secondary outcomes will be scores
      on the five multiitems scales in the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (3).

      POWERCALCULATION The sample size calculation is determined by the sample size recruited to
      the original study. Consequently, the investigators did not undertake a formal power
      calculation to determine the sample size.

      DATA ANALYSIS In the primary analysis the investigators will estimate the relative risk (RR)
      to assess whether there is a difference between group allocation and questionnaire response
      rate. The investigators will adjust for age in the analysis. The analysis will be performed
      using PROC GENMOD in SAS. Level of significant will be at 5% significance level.

      In the secondary analyses the investigators will test whether scores on the five SDQ scales
      are different between group allocations. The investigators will adjust for the covariates age
      and gender, since the scores may depend on age and gender (4). If scores are normally
      distributed the investigators will use GLM in SAS, otherwise the investigators will use
      ordinal logistic regression (PROC GENMOD).

      ETHICS The study is registered with the Danish Data Protection Agency. In Denmark studies of
      this kind do not need approval by the local ethical committee. This has been verified by the
      Ethical committee, protocol: H-1-2012-FSP.

      The trial will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov

      PUBLICATION The study will be published in a peer reviewed international journal as for
      instance Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry or similar.

      The first participant will be included in November 2012 and the last participant will be
      included in May 2014. The overall time frame of the study will be 1½ years.
