  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway
      hyper-responsiveness (respiratory hypersensitivity), airway inflammation, and intermittent
      airway obstruction. One of the characteristics of the disease is an inflammatory reaction of
      the immune system caused by cytokine production. A substantial number of asthma patients do
      not satisfactorily respond to steroid therapy and consequently have an unmet medical need for
      novel targeted therapies with improved specificity, tolerability, and compliance.

      Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by targeting
      early disease-causing mechanisms are a promising approach for the treatment of asthma. The
      transcription factor GATA-3 plays a key role in mediating the asthmatic immune response and
      has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the production of cytokines interleukin
      (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The active drug substance of the investigational medicinal product
      SB010 is hgd40. SB010 belongs to a new class of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, the
      10-23 DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)zymes (antisense oligonucleotide).

      DNAzymes are catalytically active nucleic acids that cleave complementary RNA (ribonucleic
      acid) molecules. By cleaving GATA-3 mRNA, hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and
      thereby reduces key features of allergic airway inflammation. DNAzymes are generated
      completely by chemical synthesis and can be produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
      controlled conditions. The DNAzymes are not biological drugs, i.e. they are not generated by
      use of any living organism including cell culture or bacteria. The molecules are highly
      water-soluble and will be applied as solution directly in their synthesized form.

      This proof-of-concept study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of inhaled SB010 in male
      patients with mild asthma.

    <measure>Change in late phase response after allergen challenge (AC), following multiple doses of inhaled SB010</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -1 and Day 28 (monitoring for 7 h after AC).</time_frame>
    <description>After 28 days of treatment with SB010 or placebo, patients will undergo allergen bronchoprovocation [allergen challenge (AC)]. The results from AC on Day 28 will be compared to results obtained on Enrolment (Day -1).
Allergen for AC will be selected based on skin prick test performed at Screening. The dose of selected allergen will be determined based on skin prick dilution test.
After the AC, serial spirometry will be used to assess the influence of inhaled SB010 on the area under the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) curve during the late asthma response (LAR, 4 - 7 hours); measurement time points will be at 4, 5, 6, and 7 hours after AC.
The spirometric parameters FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC), obtained during pulmonary function testing, will be used to derive the primary efficacy variable AUC4-7 FEV1.</description>
