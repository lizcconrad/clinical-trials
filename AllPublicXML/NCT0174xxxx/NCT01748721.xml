      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MORAb-004 in treating young
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such
      as MORAb-004, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to
      grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing
      substances to them

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of MORAb-004
      (anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004) administered as an intravenous infusion
      every week to children with refractory solid tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of MORAb-004 administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MORAb-004 in children with refractory cancer.

      IV. To monitor for the development of human anti-human antibody (HAHA) in children receiving
      MORAb-004.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of MORAb-004 within the confines of a phase
      1 study.

      II. To examine tumor endothelial marker-1 (TEM-1) and PDGFRB levels in tissue and plasma
      samples as potential biomarkers of MORAb-004 activity.

      III. To correlate baseline expression of TEM-1 and PDGFRB (in issue and plasma)with clinical
      parameters including disease response in an exploratory manner.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004 intravenously (IV) on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
