    <textblock>
      Sunshine Heart is sponsoring a prospective, multi-center, randomized trial to assess the
      safety and efficacy of the C-Pulse® System (&quot;C-Pulse&quot;).

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the use of the C-Pulse as a treatment for
      patients in moderate to severe heart failure (HF) has demonstrated safety and efficacy, such
      that the C-Pulse System merits Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market the
      device in the United States.

    <textblock>
      The C-Pulse® System is indicated for use in patients with moderate to severe heart failure
      while on optimal heart failure drug and on device therapies. The C-Pulse® System is intended
      to relieve the symptoms of heart failure, improve quality of life and cardiac function, and
      reduce the need for heart failure hospitalization. It is intended for use in hospital and at
      home. It is not intended as a replacement for heart function; it is not life sustaining or
      life-supporting therapy. It does not preclude the use of other heart failure therapies, such
      as valve surgery, heart transplantation or LVAD.

      The Sunshine Heart C-Pulse System is an implantable, non-blood contacting, non-obligatory,
      heart assist device. The system provides cardiac assistance through an extra-aortic balloon
      Cuff and ECG sense lead connected by means of a Percutaneous Interface Lead (PIL) to an
      external pneumatic Driver. The PIL is held secure externally, at the exit site, with a simple
      adhesive clip (C-Patch or similar) for immobilization of the external part of the PIL. The
      Driver is adjusted using a dedicated notebook computer (Programmer) with specialized
      software.

      The non-blood contacting feature of the C-Pulse® System also allows the device to be
      intermittently turned off as tolerated. This allows the patient freedom for personal hygiene.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% (by transthoracic ECHO within 90 days
             prior to randomization)

          2. ACC/AHA Stage C and NYHA III to ambulatory Class IV

          3. Age ≥ 18 years

          4. Must have cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) when clinically indicated, implanted
             ≥90 days prior to randomization.

          5. Must have an implanted cardio-defibrillator (ICD) when clinically indicated, implanted
             at least 30 days prior to randomization.

             Note: If a subject is clinically indicated for an ICD but refuses the ICD, he/she may
             be enrolled. Please document the refusal of the ICD in the medical record and the
             eCRFs.

          6. Patient must be on stable, up-titrated medical therapy as recommended according to
             current guidelines (Circulation. 2009; 119 (12): 1977-2016) which minimally includes:

               -  ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I) at stable doses for 1 month prior to enrollment, if
                  tolerated, AND

               -  a beta blocker (carvedilol, sustained release metoprolol succinate, or
                  bisoprolol) for 3 months prior to enrollment, if tolerated, with a stable
                  up-titrated dose for 1 month prior to enrollment.

               -  This also includes an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) at stable doses for 1
                  month prior to enrollment, if tolerated, when ACE-I is not tolerated.

               -  Stable is defined as no more than a 100% increase or a 50% decrease in dose. If
                  the patient is intolerant to ACE-I, ARB, or beta blockers, documented evidence
                  must be available.

               -  In those intolerant to both ACE-I and ARB, combination therapy with hydralazine
                  and oral nitrate should be considered. Therapeutic equivalence for ACE-I
                  substitutions is allowed within the enrollment stability timelines.

               -  Aldosterone inhibitor therapy should be added. Eplerenone requires dosage
                  stability for 1 month prior to enrollment.

               -  Diuretics may be used as necessary to keep the patient euvolemic.

          7. Functional limitation due to heart failure as defined by a 6 Minute Walk test of ≥ 175
             ≤ 375 meters, measured within 30 days prior to randomization

          8. At least one hospitalization for decompensated heart failure as defined below, while
             on heart failure medications, within 12 months prior to randomization or BNP level &gt;
             300 or NTproBNP &gt; 1500

             Heart failure related hospitalization is defined by the following:

               -  signs and symptoms of worsening heart failure; and

               -  treatment with intravenous heart failure therapy (including but not limited to
                  diuretic or inotropic therapy) and

               -  a minimum of one date change in the hospital

          9. Patient understands the nature of the procedure and on-going device therapy, is
             willing to comply with associated follow-up evaluations, and provide written informed
             consent prior to the procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

               1. Ascending aortic calcification on posterior-anterior or lateral chest x-ray

               2. Calcific ascending aortic disease as detected by non-contrast CT scan

               3. Ascending aorto-coronary artery bypass grafts, history of aortic dissection,

               4. Has had an ascending aortic composite graft or root replacement

          2. Aorta not conforming to specified dimensional constraints defined by CT scan, most
             specifically mid ascending aortic outside diameter less than 28 mm or greater than 42

          4. ACC/AHA Stage D heart failure or non-ambulatory NYHA Class IV subject

          5. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial
             disease, amyloidosis, active myocarditis, diastolic heart failure or technically
             challenging congenital heart disease
