    <textblock>
      Thus study consists of evaluating the effect of low level therapy on pain induced by
      insertion of an orthodontic device (the &quot;quadhelix&quot;). Each day during the first seven days
      post procedure, the level of pain will be reported on an analogic visual scale.

      As secondary objectives, intake of antalgics and type of swallowed food (soft or tough) will
      also be daily registered.

      Patient will be randomized into one of the 3 following arms :

        -  arm 1 (experimental) : administration of Low Level Laser Therapy just after insertion of
           the quadhelix.

        -  arm 2 (sham procedure) : material necessary to perform Low Level Laser Therapy will be
           installed but the laser will not be activated.

        -  arm 3 (no intervention): material necessary to perform Low Level Laser Therapy will NOT
           be installed
