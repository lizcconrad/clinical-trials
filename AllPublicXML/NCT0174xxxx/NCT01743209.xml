    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to describe the french population of individuals with
      paraphilia who have committed a sexual offence in whom androgen antagonists was prescribed.
      The secondary objectives are the description of social demographic profiles, the personal and
      family histories,psychiatric co-morbidities, the side effects of androgen antagonists
      treatment. This study, the first of its kind in France, may allow to better understand the
      social demographic and clinical profile of sexual offenders with paraphilias treated with
      androgen antagonists.

      To be included, the subject must have committed a sexual offense and must present a diagnosis
      of paraphilia with an indication of treatment with androgen antagonists. Paraphilia is
      defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a sexual behavior disorder characterized
      by &quot;sexually arousing fantasies, needs or recurrent and intense sexual behaviors generally
      involving (1) of non-human objects, (2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or partner,
      (3) children or other persons without their consent, occurring during a period of at least
      six months &quot;(Criterion A). This disorder is responsible for sexual behavior which is
      &quot;clinically significant disturbances in social, occupational or other important areas of
      functioning&quot; (Criterion B).

      The inclusion of approximately 200 subjects is expected in this study. The inclusion period
      will last for 12 months.

      Data will be codified and only a few investigators will have access to these data. The
      statistical analyse will use the usual descriptive parameters: mean, standard deviation,
      median, interquartile range and range for quantitative variables, frequencies and cumulative
      frequencies (if applicable) for qualitative variables.
