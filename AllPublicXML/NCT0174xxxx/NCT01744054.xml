  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The successful localization of the y90 microspheres by PET/MR and/or PET/CT scans would be a
      useful tool in individualizing patient care after the radioembolization procedure. The
      information from a PET/MR or PET/CT scan would allow for early evaluation of the technical
      success of the procedure.
