      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and effect of a program including
      information, counseling and an individualized physical activity program on physical and
      psychological health during and after chemotherapy in patients with testicular cancer. It is
      hypothesized that the patients are able to complete the intervention with individual
      adjustments.
