      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating
      patients with stage III-IV melanoma that has spread to other places in the body and usually
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Vaccines made from peptides or
      antigens may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and clinically appropriate dose of human heat
      shock protein (hsp)110-gp100 chaperone complex melanoma vaccine (recombinant hsp110-gp100
      chaperone complex vaccine) to recommend a phase II dose in stage IIIB/C and stage IV
      metastatic melanoma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effect of the recombinant human hsp110-gp100 chaperone complex vaccine on
      measurable clinical tumor.

      II. To determine gp100 and hsp110 specific cell mediated and humoral immune responses
      elicited by the chaperone complex vaccine.

      III. To determine the effect of dose and serial administration of the chaperone complex
      vaccine on cell mediated and humoral immune responses.

      IV. To quantify patient characteristics (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] subtype, immune cell
      function, etc.) that may correlate with immune response to the chaperone complex vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive recombinant hsp110-gp100 chaperone complex vaccine intradermally (ID) on
      days 1, 15, and 43 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
