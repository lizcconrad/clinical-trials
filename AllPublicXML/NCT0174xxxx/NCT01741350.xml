  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a community-friendly behavioral intervention
      designed to reduce HIV risk behavior among injection drug users (IDUs) in drug treatment by
      comparing risk-behavior outcomes of four weekly intervention sessions with a
      time-and-attention-matched control condition.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test the effects of CHRP, a community-friendly risk reduction
      intervention, which is based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model of health
      behavior change (IMB; Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992), and, thus, is designed to enhance knowledge,
      motivation, and behavior skills for reducing drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors.
      Outcomes assessed will include urine toxicology screens, self-reported HIV drug- and
      sex-related HIV risk behavior, HIV/AIDS knowledge, risk reduction motivation, and risk
      reduction behavioral skills.

      To measure the effects of CHRP, the investigators are proposing a two-condition (standard of
      care plus the CHRP intervention vs. standard of care plus a time-and-attention matched
      control condition) randomized design, balancing for participant gender. The investigators
      will assess participants at baseline, immediately post-intervention (i.e., at 4 weeks), and
      at 3-, 6-, and 12-month measurement points following the intervention. This assessment
      approach will allow the investigators to examine the trajectory of HIV risk reduction change
      including the decay or emergence of intervention effects.

            <description>Patients assigned to Community-friendly Health Recovery Program (CHRP) will receive a weekly HIV risk reduction group level intervention led by two facilitators trained and supervised by the PI, a licensed clinical psychologist. The CHRP intervention is a substantially shortened version of the comprehensive Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP)-based interventions that have been identified as demonstrating evidence of effectiveness in two randomized clinical trials. The CHRP, which includes four 50-minute groups (1 group per week), will contain only content that relates explicitly to drug- or sex-related HIV risk reduction. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).

The CHRP intervention is a substantially shortened version of the comprehensive Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP)-based interventions that have been identified as demonstrating evidence of effectiveness in two randomized clinical trials. The CHRP, which includes four 50-minute groups (1 group per week), will contain only content that relates explicitly to drug- or sex-related HIV risk reduction. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).

            <description>Patients assigned to Community-friendly Health Recovery Program (CHRP) will receive a weekly HIV risk reduction group level intervention led by two facilitators trained and supervised by the PI, a licensed clinical psychologist. The CHRP intervention is a substantially shortened version of the comprehensive Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP)-based interventions that have been identified as demonstrating evidence of effectiveness in two randomized clinical trials. The CHRP, which includes four 50-minute groups (1 group per week), will contain only content that relates explicitly to drug- or sex-related HIV risk reduction. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).

            <description>Patients assigned to Community-friendly Health Recovery Program (CHRP) will receive a weekly HIV risk reduction group level intervention led by two facilitators trained and supervised by the PI, a licensed clinical psychologist. The CHRP intervention is a substantially shortened version of the comprehensive Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP)-based interventions that have been identified as demonstrating evidence of effectiveness in two randomized clinical trials. The CHRP, which includes four 50-minute groups (1 group per week), will contain only content that relates explicitly to drug- or sex-related HIV risk reduction. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).

            <description>Patients assigned to Community-friendly Health Recovery Program (CHRP) will receive a weekly HIV risk reduction group level intervention led by two facilitators trained and supervised by the PI, a licensed clinical psychologist. The CHRP intervention is a substantially shortened version of the comprehensive Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP)-based interventions that have been identified as demonstrating evidence of effectiveness in two randomized clinical trials. The CHRP, which includes four 50-minute groups (1 group per week), will contain only content that relates explicitly to drug- or sex-related HIV risk reduction. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).

            <description>Patients assigned to Community-friendly Health Recovery Program (CHRP) will receive a weekly HIV risk reduction group level intervention led by two facilitators trained and supervised by the PI, a licensed clinical psychologist. The CHRP intervention is a substantially shortened version of the comprehensive Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP)-based interventions that have been identified as demonstrating evidence of effectiveness in two randomized clinical trials. The CHRP, which includes four 50-minute groups (1 group per week), will contain only content that relates explicitly to drug- or sex-related HIV risk reduction. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).

            <description>Patients assigned to Community-friendly Health Recovery Program (CHRP) will receive a weekly HIV risk reduction group level intervention led by two facilitators trained and supervised by the PI, a licensed clinical psychologist. The CHRP intervention is a substantially shortened version of the comprehensive Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP)-based interventions that have been identified as demonstrating evidence of effectiveness in two randomized clinical trials. The CHRP, which includes four 50-minute groups (1 group per week), will contain only content that relates explicitly to drug- or sex-related HIV risk reduction. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).

Thus, each participant will be asked to attend four 50-minute weekly group sessions led by two trained facilitators. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).

          <description>The time-and-attention-matched control condition for the proposed research will be a time and contact-matched, non-contaminating support group for individuals in recovery modeled after similar groups offered in the community. There will be no overlap between the content of the comparison intervention and experimental intervention although the basic structure will be the same. Thus, each participant will be asked to attend four 50-minute weekly group sessions led by two trained facilitators. Participants in both conditions will receive routine clinical services (i.e., daily methadone and case management).
