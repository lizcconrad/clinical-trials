  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a side effect prevention training (SEPT) that
      optimizes patients' response expectations before the start of adjuvant endocrine treatment
      (AET) to prevent nocebo side effects and enhance quality of life during longer term drug
      intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of breast cancer patients discontinue today's standard adjuvant treatment
      (endocrine therapy) due to side effects and reduced quality of life. Thereby, most side
      effects are unspecific, thus, not related to the specific pharmacological action of the drug,
      but to the individual treatment context and patients´ expectations (nocebo effects). The aim
      of this study is to evaluate a side effect prevention training (SEPT) that optimizes
      patients' response expectations before the start of pharmacotherapy to prevent nocebo side
      effects during longer term drug intake. Using a randomized trial, we will study the time
      course of response expectations and side effects in breast cancer patients receiving either
      SEPT, standard medical care or an attention-control intervention (&quot;supportive therapy&quot;)
      before the start of adjuvant endocrine therapy. We will analyze the effects of changing
      pre-treatment expectations on cancer-treatment related side effects, quality of life and
      adherence 3 and 6 months after the start of endocrine therapy. Moderator analyses will be
      used to determine predictors of non-specific medication side effects and patients that are at
      high risk of experiencing them. Furthermore, we will explore the mediating influence of
      coping behaviours, thereby providing insights into pathways of clinical nocebo effects. The
      study findings promise significant advances in the clinical application of nocebo research
      with strong implications for clinical and research practice.

    <description>SEPT is aimed to optimize patients' response expectations before the start of pharmacotherapy to prevent nocebo side effects during adjuvant endocrine treatment. SEPT is a three session cognitive-behavioural training. It includes psychoeducation about AET to provide a realistic view on AET, reduction of concerns about side effects and strengthening of necessity beliefs. Further contents are side effect management training and problem solving to enhance self-efficacy expectations about coping as well as imagination training to integrate positive aspects of medication into daily life.</description>

    <description>Supportive therapy includes common or unspecific factors such as elicitation of affect, a treatment context, empathy, reflective listening, and feeling understood. Supportive therapy thus provides a control condition for common factors and therapist attention, while lacking the specific intervention part. It will be delivered in the same frequency and at the same time points as the side effect prevention training (three individual sessions and three booster telephone calls).</description>
