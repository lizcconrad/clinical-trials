    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to report the radiographic, clinical, and functional outcomes of
      a consecutive series of patients diagnosed with single or bilateral degenerative disc disease
      between L4 and S1, that have been treated with an anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF),
      anterior only surgical approach, and InQu Bone Graft Extender and Substitute for bony fusion
      and instrumentation.

      Patients that decide to undergo an Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (ALIF) surgery [a
      surgical procedure that joins two or more lumbar vertebrae (small bones of the spine)
      together into one solid bony structure by approaching the spine through the abdomen (front of
      the body) and placing a bone graft in between the vertebral bodies where the disc usually
      lies], are invited to participate in an orthopaedic research study.

      This study will compare patients that have been treated with an anterior lumbar interbody
      fusion using InQu Bone Graft Extender &amp; Substitute to published data for a stand alone spinal
      fusion surgery, where InFuse bone graft is placed between the transverse processes [small
      bony projections off the right and left side of each bone in your spine] of the affected
      vertebrae.

      X-rays, daily activities, and how patients are doing will be evaluated at specific time
      points during this study.

      The hypothesis of this study is that patients diagnosed with degenerative disc disease
      treated with an anterior lumbar interbody fusion, anterior only surgical approach (incision
      through the abdomen), using InQu Bone Graft Extender and Substitute and instrumented fixation
      have comparable radiographic (x-rays), functional (daily activities), and clinical (how the
      patient is doing) outcomes when compared to published data for use of InFuse in stand-alone
      fusion.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study; evaluating outcomes of patients that have elected
      to receive surgical intervention in order to treat degenerative disc disease. In order to be
      eligible for enrollment into this study, patients have already elected to be treated with an
      anterior lumbar interbody fusion, an anterior only approach for single or bi-level
      degenerative disc disease between L4 and S1 with instrumented fusion, using a combination of
      InQu Bone Graft Extender and Substitute, local bone, and Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate
      (BMAC) to promote bony fusion. Only after the patient and physician determine the surgical
      procedure, can the patient be eligible for enrollment. A consecutive series of 60 patients
      will be offered enrollment if all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.

      Data will be collected by chart review to include pre-operative, surgical, functional,
      post-operative, and radiographic imaging charted data, collected as part of the routine
      clinical visit, and standard of care.

      Follow-up data will include newly charted clinical, functional, and radiographic imaging
      data, including dynamic x-rays and CT scans to be obtained prospectively at a minimum of one
      (1) year post-operatively. During the routine post-surgical visits, patient pain outcomes are
      measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, function is measured by
      the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Short Form-12 Version 2 (SF-12 Version 2 Health
      Survey). A physician investigator will also perform routine clinical evaluations.

      The patients will undergo standard radiographic procedures to obtain x-rays (including
      lateral, anterior-posterior, and dynamic flexion/extension) as part of the standard of care.
      A CT scan will be performed for research purposes as indicated in the protocol follow-up
      procedure. X-rays and CT scans will be evaluated by an independent radiologist and a
      physician investigator to determine anterior fusion status and the status of the anterior
      hardware constructs.

      The National Center of Innovation for Biomaterials in Orthopaedic Research and Medical
      Metric, Inc. will assist with imaging analysis of x-rays and CTs.

      ISTO Technologies, Inc. will be providing a grant to cover costs associated with the research
      components of this study.

    <description>X-rays and CTs will be analyzed for fusion based on the following criteria:
Bridging trabecular bone connecting the two vertebral bodies either through the dowels or around the dowels as evaluated by thin-cut CT scans and radiographs;
No angular motion of 5 degrees or more on dynamic plain radiographs;
No sagittal translation of more than 3 mm on dynamic plain radiographs; and
No radiolucencies that involve more than half of the interfaces between the dowels and the host vertebral end plates.
Criteria is based on the Burkus, Transfelt, et. al study titled &quot;Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes of Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion Using Recombinant Human Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2.&quot;</description>
