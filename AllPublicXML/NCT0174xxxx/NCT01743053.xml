      This is a prospective, randomised, open label, controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety
      and preliminary effectiveness of the ReCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (ReCell) for
      the management of chronic leg ulcers associated with venous insufficiency. Outcome will be
      compared between study participants receiving standard care (debridement, compression
      therapy) and participants receiving ReCell in addition to standard care.
