  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The purpose of this study is to determine whether docosahexaenoic acid is effective in
           the prevention or reducing severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm
           neonates &lt; 1500 g at birth who are starting enteral feeding.

        -  if NEC is prevented, this study will measure whether hospital stay is also reduced in
           neonates who receive Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Preterm neonates with birth weight less than 1500 g are in higher risk to develop NEC.

        -  NEC is an inflammatory condition that:

             1. Is the medical urgency most frequent of gastrointestinal tube that requires
                neonatal intensive care

             2. may perforate infant´s bowel requiring surgery from 20% to 60% of the cases

             3. may cause infant's death in 20% to 42% of the cases.

             4. has no adequate treatment worldwide, therefore prevention is needed

        -  DHA by enteral feeding has been administrated by our research group to attenuate
           inflammatory response in septic and surgical neonates.

        -  Our results showed:

             1. lower Interleukin(IL)-1 beta in septic neonates, but in surgical neonates, they
                also showed less IL-6 and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1ra, after
                adjusting by confounders

             2. increased weight, length and fat mass gain in septic neonates

             3. decreased organic failures in surgical neonates, and

             4. lower stay at neonatal intensive care in surgical neonates

      DHA has not been used as unique intervention at a high but physiological dose; in addition,
      our previous results found an anti-inflammatory effect in neonates.Therefore, we expect that
      preterm infants may have a reduced bowel inflammatory response and lower NEC events and or
      severity
