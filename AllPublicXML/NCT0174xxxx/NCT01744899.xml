  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of prolonged sitting duration and three
      different sitting postures (erect, slumped, and slouched sitting postures) on spinal nerve
      root function by measuring the soleus (SOL) H-reflex amplitude. In addition, the pressure
      under the ischial tuberosities during the three sitting postures were assessed and correlated
      with the SOL H-reflex amplitude.

      Participants were assigned to two groups (prolonged sitting group and controls) based on
      their daily sitting duration with 15 participants in each group. The outcome measures were
      recorded during erect, slumped and slouched sitting postures. The differences between the two
      groups and the three sitting postures in the outcome measures were examined for statistical
      significance.
