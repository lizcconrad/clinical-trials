      The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the knob-tipped knife
      and needle knife for precut papillotomy in difficult common bile duct (CBD)cannulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Precut sphincterotomy is an alternative technique used to facilitate CBD cannulation
      following the failure of conventional bile duct cannulation. Needle knife papillotomy is the
      most widely practiced precut technique. However,Pre-cutting the papilla with a needle-knife
      is difficult, requiring experience and dexterity to control the axis and depth of the cut.
      Due to the increased rate of complications associated with this procedure, including
      pancreatitis, hemorrhage, and perforation, it was recommended to be performed only by
      experienced endoscopists.

      The knob-tipped knife, a novel instrument utilizing a 2mm or 1.5mm cutting knife, is usually
      used for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Its knob-shaped tip and nonadjustable length
      make the knife less likely to slip and penetrate the tissue during the resection. Since the
      process of precut papillotomy is similar to ESD, the precutting procedure with the
      knob-tipped knife may be easier to be performed, as well as be safer. The efficacy and safety
      of this instrument in precut papillotomy have not been reported. We therefore assessed the
      efficacy and safety of the knob-tipped knife in precut papillotomy in difficult CBD
      cannulation.
