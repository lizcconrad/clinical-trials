  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational research study whose purposes are to see the effects of repeated
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatments on the levels of stem/progenitor cells in peripheral
      circulating blood following five days of treatment, 90 minutes per day at 2.0 atmospheres
      absolute in 100% USP Grade Oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen has a greater oxygen concentration than
      air at sea level. In this research, the concentration of oxygen will be twice the level of
      oxygen at sea level.

    <description>Six treatment subjects and two control subjects will have two daily blood draws. Exposures of hyperabric oxygen (HBO) will occur daily over 5 consecutive days. The blood draws will occur prior to starting HBO exposure and after finishing with the HBO exposure. Control subjects will have their blood drawn at the same time as the treatment subjects, in ordert to establish a non-treatment baseline. The stem cell population that is resident in the peripheral blood will be analyzed using the cell sorting and cell identification system at Aldagen. Mononulcear cells will be gated on the basis of forward and side laser light scatter, and 250,000 events will be analyzed to determine the percentage of ALDHbr cells, and the expression of additional stem cell markers, such as CD45, CD34, and CD105.</description>

    <description>Six healthy adult individuals (18-65 yrs), with no current, ongoing infection or chronic disease will be recruited for this study. Treatment study subjects will undergo a daily exposure to 2.0 ATA, 100% Oxygen for 90 minutes over 5 days.</description>

    <description>Hyperabric oxygen will be delivered via a PerryPerry-Sigma Monoplace Hyperbaric Chambers. Oxygen is supplied by Air Gas, Seattle.
All gases will meet Health Standards for oxygen and air. The hyperbaric chamber technicians employed by Restorix Health are trained health personnel who will be assisting our study participant and monitoring the HBO treatment. Oxygen will be delivered at a pressure of 2.0 ATA for 90 minutes, once a day for 5 consective days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients recruited will be healthy volunteers with no current, ongoing infection or chronic
        disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        We will exclude or delay the treatment if our patients have an active lung infection,
        develops cancer, if the patient cannot undergo pressurization/ depressurization because of
        eustachian-tube dysfunction and confinement anxiety. Any patient that cannot breathe
        without a respirator will be excluded.
