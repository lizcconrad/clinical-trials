  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main pathogen of nosocomial respiratory infections. Its
      increasing resistance to antibiotics requires the development of new strategies for
      prevention and control, demanding a better understanding of the modes of transmission and
      evolutionary dynamics of this bacteria. In patients under invasive mechanical ventilation,
      the main mode of contamination by Pseudomonas remains debated, with 3 modes of contamination
      (endogenous, crossed transmission between patients, or environmental origin) of varying
      importance, mainly depending on the endemic situation of the place of study.

      The emergence of new genotyping technologies (DiversiLab) can now facilitate studies of
      molecular epidemiology. Thanks to the multidisciplinary collaboration and innovative
      techniques, the investigators wish to study the impact of the mode of contamination on the
      outcome of ICU patients, intubated and ventilated for more than 72 hours.

      The presence of environmental reservoirs can cause infections and multidrug-resistant P.
      aeruginosa colonization with P. aeruginosa is itself a prognostic factor, but the impact of
      the route of infection on the evolution of the history and future of the infectious patient
      is not established.

      A second factor that may influence the evolution infectious is the degree of genetic
      heterogeneity of the bacterial population. Multiple exposure pathways could also influence
      the genetic diversity.

      In order to achieve an antibiogram according to conventional methods and PCR genotyping Rep
      (DiversiLab ®) to assess the clonality of bacterial populations, there will be taken 5
      different isolated colonies (possibly diluted)from each clinical sample of bronchial
      secretion, selected according to morphological criteria or randomly if no visible differences
      are noted.
