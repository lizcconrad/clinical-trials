  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microcirculatory disturbances following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
      have been thought to be at the origin of organ dysfunction. Though, few studies correlated
      microvascular alterations with outcome. Investigators aimed at firstly describing
      microcirculation with near infra red spectroscopy (NIRS) and secondly correlating NIRS
      parameters with intensive care length of stay and organ dysfunction.

      40 patients at high risk of post operative systemic inflammatory response syndrome after an
      elective cardiac surgery with CPB were included in this prospective observational study.
      Patients were studied during the first 48 postoperative hours. Microcirculation of the thenar
      eminence was analyzed by NIRS technology, through the StO2 and the resaturation slope after
      an ischemic challenge. Organ dysfunction was assessed with the SOFA score.
