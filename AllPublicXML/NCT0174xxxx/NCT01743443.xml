      To evaluate corneal sensitivity changes following corneal cross-linking (CXL) in patients
      with progressive lower stage keratoconus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty eight eyes of 19 patients (11 women, 8 men) were included in a prospective,
      nonrandomized clinical study. Mean patient age was 22 years (range, 18-26 years). Inclusion
      criteria were low stage bilateral progressive keratoconus, transparent cornea and thinnest
      corneal thickness ≥ 440 µm. Using the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer central corneal sensitivity
      was measured preoperatively, after 7 days, and once a month after surgery until recovery of
      the baseline preoperative level. Normal levels of central corneal sensitivity were considered
      above 40mm.

             product.

          -  Having topographic evidence of keratoconus which is graded as lower stage progressive
             keratoconus

          -  Presence of central or inferior steepening on the Pentacam map

          -  Steepest keratometry (Kmax) value greater than or equal to 51.00D

          -  BSCVA of 80 letters or fewer for keratoconus on ETDRS chart

          -  Contact lens wearers only: remove contact lenses one week prior to the screening
             refraction

          -  Contact lens wearers only: manifest refraction must be stable between two visits that
             occur at least 7 days apart

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications, sensitivity or known allergy to the use of the test articles(S) or
             their components

          -  If female, be pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy or have a positive urine
             pregnancy test at Visit 2 prior to treatment or during the course of the study

          -  Eyes classified as either normal,atypical normal,keratoconus suspect or mild
             keratoconus on the severity grading scheme

          -  A history of the insertion of INTACS in the eye to be treated

          -  Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye to be treated that
             may predispose the eye for future complications.

             concurrently enrolled in another investigational drug or device study within 30 days
             of the study
