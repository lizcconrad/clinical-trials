      This study will test whether 3H+ (Holistic Health for HIV) is comparable to the original
      HHRP+ (Holistic Health Recovery Program) in reducing HIV risk behaviors and improving ART
      (Antiretroviral Therapy) adherence in a randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial
      among 256 HIV+ persons in drug treatment who report unsafe injection drug use practices or
      sexual risk behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected drug users (DUs) remain a target population as they represent a significant
      vector for the transmission of new HIV infections (Avants et al., 2004; Margolin et al.,
      2003), which occur through preventable drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors. Though
      numerous evidence-based HIV risk reduction interventions are now widely available as complete
      intervention packages, few evidence-based interventions have been designed for implementation
      within common drug treatment community-based organizations (CBOs), such as methadone
      maintenance programs (MMPs), where many high-risk HIV-infected drug users seek treatment.
      Moreover, the few evidence-based interventions that are applicable to drug treatment CBOs are
      not designed to be &quot;community-friendly&quot; and, hence, are unlikely to be implemented as
      intended or durable within these critical settings.

      The investigators have developed a significantly shortened version of the comprehensive
      evidence-based Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP; Avants et al., 2004; Margolin et al.,
      2003). This shortened version, Holistic Health for HIV (3H+), has demonstrated feasibility
      and acceptability as well as preliminary evidence of effectiveness in an uncontrolled study
      within a resource-limited drug treatment CBO. Therefore, this randomized controlled
      comparative effectiveness trial (RCT) will test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 3H+
      versus the original gold standard evidence-based intervention(EBI), Holistic Health Recovery
      Program for HIV+s (HHRP+), targeting HIV+ drug users (DUs).

    <description>A self-reported assessment will measure several aspects of HIV risk-taking behaviors, including a measurement of any high risk behavior (sexual or injection-related) as well as measurements of event-level (i.e., partner-by-partner) behaviors. &quot;Any&quot; risk behavior will be dichotomously parsed as those who have engaged in HIV transmission risk behaviors with those of unknown or HIV negative status. Urine toxicology tests will also be used to collect substance use data.</description>

    <description>Viral load (VL) will be measured in terms of mean change in VL from baseline to the final (9-month) follow-up point. An alternative approach will be the proportion of subjects with a non-detectable (&lt;400 and &lt;50 copies/mL) VL, and mean change in cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) lymphocyte count. Missing VL will be treated as VL&gt;400 or VL&gt;50 copies/mL.</description>

    <description>Non-adherence factors will be measured these using standardized instruments including the following: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for substance use disorders, Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for depressive symptoms, active drug use (urine toxicology screening using the National Institute on Drug Abuse's 4-panel test measuring heroin, cocaine, oxycodone, benzodiazepines and marijuana levels), and neurocognitive impairment (using the Neurocognitive Impairment Scale).</description>

    <description>3H+ (Holistic for HIV) group patients will receive the standard of drug treatment care (i.e., methadone maintenance treatment and case management) plus four weekly 60-minute HIV risk reduction groups, and a 60-minute booster session at 12 weeks, led by two facilitators trained and supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist. 3H+ is an HIV risk reduction and ART adherence intervention that provides coping skills training and is delivered in a group modality, addressing high risk drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors and ART adherence for opioid-dependent individuals living with HIV.</description>

    <description>HHRP+ (Holistic Health Recovery Program) is comprised of 12 two-hour weekly manual-guided group sessions with comprehensive HIV risk reduction content that addresses the medical, emotional, and spiritual needs of opioid-dependent individuals living with HIV. Each session is designed to last 2 hours and is co-facilitated by two trained facilitators, who address potential motivational conflicts of HIV+ individuals by providing them with self-protective as well as altruistic reasons for examining and changing their HIV risk behaviors and improving adherence behavior. Material is presented using cognitive remediation strategies.</description>
