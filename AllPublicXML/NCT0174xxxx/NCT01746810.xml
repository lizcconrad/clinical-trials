  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy when given together with ablation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer or lung metastases. Ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation uses a
      high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells. Ablation therapy, such as microwave
      ablation kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature.
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and
      cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving ablation therapy together with stereotactic body
      radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      This is a dose-escalation study of stereotactic body radiation therapy.

      Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy once daily (QD) for a total of 5
      fractions and then undergo IRGA (either radiofrequency ablation or microwave ablation) 1 week
      later.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathological (histologically or cytologically) diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer
             (NSCLC); or if lung tumor is considered to be metastases (even from primary NSCLC),
             then clinical diagnosis is sufficient

          -  For NSCLC: Staging workup at initial diagnosis demonstrates T2-T4N0M0, or
             T2-T4,N1-3,M1; node-positive patients will be allowed on study only if they have M1
             disease; clinical diagnosis of M1 disease is sufficient

          -  Patient is deemed (a) to be medically inoperable after evaluation by thoracic surgeon
             based on, but not limited to the following: baseline forced expiratory volume in one
             second (FEV1) &lt; 40% predicted, post-operative FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted, severely reduced

             evaluation

          -  International normalization ratio (INR) of &gt; 1.5

          -  Platelets of &lt; 50,000 /uL
