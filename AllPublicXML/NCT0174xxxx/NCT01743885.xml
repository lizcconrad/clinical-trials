  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no effective treatment for hemangioma regardless of immediate severity. That is in
      this respect a orphan disease. These hemangiomas, sometimes large, will have a phase of
      proliferation of several months (very scary for parents) and regression over several years.
      The natural history is peppered with local complications (ulcers) and aesthetic and
      psychological sequelae (sometimes major for the child and the family). The effects of
      acebutolol and propranolol on the proliferative hemangiomas were discovered accidentally by
      two French teams (Montpellier for acebutolol and Bordeaux for propranolol). Acebutolol and
      propranolol have been used for many years for the treatment of hypertension and congenital
      heart disease, including infants, with few side effects. The effects of acebutolol and
      propranolol were immediately visible with reduced volume and skin whitening of the
      hemangioma. In a preliminary study, acebutolol was administered to 20 patients in Montpellier
      with big regression of hemangiomas. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy
      of acebutolol (10mg/Kg/jour) and propranolol (3mg/Kg/j) on the proliferative phase of
      infantile hemangioma in infants.
