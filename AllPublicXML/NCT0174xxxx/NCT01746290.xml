  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Sudden cardiac arrest&quot; occurs when someone's heart stops beating unexpectedly. Each year,
      more than 45,000 Canadians have a cardiac arrest. A bystander can do three things to improve
      survival: Call 911,start chest compressions and apply a defibrillator. Together, these
      actions can increase survival by up to 800%. The problem is that bystanders to cardiac arrest
      only provide CPR in about 3 of every 10 cardiac arrest cases and AED use in about 3 of every
      100 cardiac arrest cases. There are many people in the community who are trained and willing
      to provide help for cardiac arrest victims such as off-duty paramedics, fire fighters,
      nurses, etc. When a cardiac arrest occurs in the city, it is likely that one of these people
      is nearby, but unaware of the emergency. The PulsePoint smartphone application enables these
      people to be notified by the local emergency 911 service when there is a cardiac arrest near
      to them. It can be freely downloaded to several common types of smartphones. When there is a
      cardiac arrest emergency, all nearby PulsePoint users are sent an alert from the 911 service.
      When the phones receive the alert, they ring, vibrate and display a text message saying &quot;CPR
      NEEDED&quot;. The user's current location and the exact location of the cardiac arrest are then
      displayed on a map. Nearby public access AEDs are also indicated on the map. The smartphone
      users can then go to provide chest compressions and use an AED while paramedics are on their
      way. A video at www.pulsepoint.org shows how this works. The objective of the investigators
      is to measure whether the PulsePoint smartphone application increases bystander CPR or AED
      use for victims of cardiac arrest outside the hospital. This project will happen in the City
      of Toronto. The investigators have a plan to get as many people as possible to download the
      application, focusing on health care professionals who know CPR. The investigators will set
      up a webpage that helps people download the software to their phone. The investigators will
      randomize 911 calls to have a PulsePoint alert sent or not. The investigators will use
      statistical analysis to measure whether sending an alert to a smartphone increases the
      chances of bystander resuscitation.

    <description>Conventional Emergency Dispatch PLUS The PulsePoint notification. In the event of a potential cardiac arrest identified by 911call-takers, data will be automatically pushed to PulsePoint smartphone application users within very close proximity to the emergency. This will be done in parallel with normal emergency dispatch of paramedics and fire fighters to the scene of the emergency. The activation radius around the emergency is somewhat variable, depending on phone signal strength, climate conditions and whether the phone is inside or outside, but is approximately 200-500 meters.</description>

After acknowledgement of the alert by the user, the application presents a map and text information to direct the user to the exact location of the emergency. Using local AED registry data, the application can also reveal exact AED locations in the vicinity of the emergency</description>
