      To examine the effectiveness of a &quot;need-based nutritional intervention&quot; strategy in improving
      the nutritional and physical functional status of nursing home elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety-two nursing home residents aged 65 years or older and BMI &lt;25 were randomly assigned
      to the intervention or control groups. Subjects in the treatment group received a
      soy-protein-based nutritional supplement, if his/her BMI was &lt;24kg/m2 and nutritional score
      was &lt;24 according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment. The supplementation would be suspended
      if both conditions were not met. At baseline and every 4 weeks up to 24 weeks, thereafter,
      all subjects were measured for anthropometric parameters. At baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks
      subjects were measured for blood biochemical indicators, handgrip strength and Barthel's
      index.
