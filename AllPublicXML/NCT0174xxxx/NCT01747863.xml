  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter observational pilot study will be conducted to determine the natural history of
      infants with early diagnosis (≤ 6 hrs of age) of mild neonatal encephalopathy (NE) who are
      not qualified for therapeutic hypothermia. The intervention includes: neurologic examination
      by using modified Sarnat score at ≤ 6 hrs of age, 24 hrs and before discharge home,
      amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) at 6 ± 3 hrs of age, brain MRI at before
      discharge home to 30 days of age and follow-up at 18-22 months of age. Primary outcome is the
      percentage of mild NE infants with evidence of brain injury defined by the presence of at
      least 1 abnormality of brain MRI, aEEG or neurologic examination in the neonatal period.
      Secondary outcome is the percentage of brain MRI, aEEG and neurological exam abnormalities,
      seizure, length of hospital stay, need of gavage feeds or gastrostomy at discharge home,
      death and long-term outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, an estimated 1.8 to 7.7 infants per 1000 live term births suffer from perinatal
      asphyxia, which remains an important cause of neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and
      neurodevelopmental impairment. Over the last six years, several randomized control trials
      have demonstrated that prolonged and moderate therapeutic hypothermia (TH) reduces the rate
      of death or disability at 18 months of age among infants who survived. In these trials,
      infants were eligible if there was evidence of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia and a moderate or
      severe degree of encephalopathy on neurological evaluation performed at ≤ 6 hrs of age.
      However, it has been recognized that the level of NE may change over time. Preliminary and
      unpublished observations from our group indicated that some infants who were not classified
      as moderate or severe NE had neurological abnormalities at discharge or evidence of brain
      injury on MRI performed during the neonatal period. Unfortunately, precise data on the
      outcomes of this specific population is not clear. Since TH is not offered to this
      population, the outcomes of infants that do not qualify for TH based on neurological
      evaluation performed ≤ 6 hrs of life requires a more precise investigation.

Moderate disability will be defined as the Bayley Cognitive score is 70-84 and either seizures, moderate CP (defined by GMFCS grade level 2) or a hearing deficit requiring amplification to understand commands. Mild disability will be defined by a cognitive score 70-84, or a cognitive score ≥ 85 and either presence of mild or moderate CP (GMFCS grade levels 1 or 2), a seizure disorder or hearing loss with or without amplification. Normal will be defined as Bayley III Cognitive score ≥ 85 without any visual or hearing impairment, or CP.</description>

        Infants with evidence of a perinatal event and NE who do not qualify for therapeutic
        hypothermia. NE will be defined as the presence of abnormal neurological findings on the
        modified Sarnat Score performed at ≤ 6 hrs of life. Evidence of a perinatal event will
        include criteria described in details in the whole body hypothermia trial (NEJM, 2005). The
        level of NE will be defined by the neurological exam performed by certified neonatologists
        working at the 6 centers.
