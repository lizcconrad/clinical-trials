  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is very common for hemodialysis patients to have problems with low blood pressure while on
      hemodialysis. Low blood pressure on dialysis is not a good thing and it is associated with an
      increased risk of death and hospitalizations. It might be possible to minimize or even
      prevent these low blood pressure episodes with a software that can be added to the dialysis
      machine which detects the patient's changes in blood pressure and automatically slows down
      how much fluid is being removed from the person.

      The investigators hypothesize that a blood pressure guided biofeedback system (called
      BioLogics RR) will result in a 30% reduction in the number of hypotensive episodes on
      hemodialysis.

      This is a randomized cross over trial in which 30 chronic hemodialysis patients with a
      history of intradialytic hypotension, IDH will be randomized to receive either standard
      hemodialysis or hemodialysis with blood pressure guided biofeedback (BioLogics RR Comfort, B
      braun). After the initial period of 8 weeks patients will cross over to the other group for
      the final 8 weeks of the study.

      The primary outcome is the reduction in the number of IDH episodes associated with patient
      symptoms or nursing symptoms.

    <description>A 30% reduction in the frequency of HD sessions complicated by IDH. IDH is defined as a reduction in systolic BP of &gt; = 20 mmHg if the pre-dialysis BP is &gt;= 100 mmHg and with patient symptoms or nursing intervention. IDH is defined as a reduction in systolic BP of &gt;=10 mmHg if predialysis BP &lt; = 90mm Hg and with patient symptoms or nursing interventions</description>
