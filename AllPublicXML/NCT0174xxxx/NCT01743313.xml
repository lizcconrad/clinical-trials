  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis patients undergoing primary hip and knee replacement are followed-up and
      changes in their glucose metabolism and other metabolic parameters (obesity, cholesterol
      levels) are examined. Persistent postoperative pain is examined as secondary outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucose metabolism disorders (diabetes and pre-diabetes) and metabolic syndrome are common in
      joint replacement recipients. Improved physical activity following joint replacement could
      lead to better glucose control in diabetes and ameliorate impaired glucose and cholesterol
      levels. In this study patients previously recruited to &quot;Perioperative Hyperglycaemia in
      Primary Total Hip and Knee Replacement&quot; study are being followed-up for one year in order to
      analyze if joint replacements have an effect on these metabolic abnormalities. In addition,
      the effect of glucose metabolism disorders on occurrence of persistent pain after surgery is
      analyzed.
