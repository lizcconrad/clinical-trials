  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Absorption of therapeutic proteins taken orally has remained the major hurdle for treatment
      in humans. The proteins are generally degraded by enzymes in the stomach and intestine and
      the intestine lining that prevents absorption into the circulation. Administration of
      PRX-112, a plant recombinant human glucocerebrosidase (prGCD) using plant cells as carrier
      vehicle, may help overcome many of these hurdles. The plant cell wall protects the protein
      from degradation in its transport through the upper GI and allows release in the lower
      intestine. Studies in animals have shown that prGCD delivered in this way can be found in the
      blood stream in an active form.

      This exploratory, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study is designed to assess the
      delivery of prGCD after oral administration of PRX-112 in Gaucher subjects. Subjects will
      receive an oral dose of PRX-112 in a single administration and followed by 3 consecutive
      daily administrations at the same dose. prGCD levels in plasma will be determined at selected
      time points. Safety parameters will also be assessed at selected time points. Enrollment will
      proceed into the next dosage cohort after the pharmacokinetic and safety data of the previous
      cohort have been reviewed. A different dosage may be selected based on the pharmacokinetic
      results of the first cohort.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females, 18 years or older.

          -  Historical diagnosis of Gaucher disease with leukocyte GCD activity level ≤3
             nmol/mg*hr (≤30 % of the mean activity of the reference range)

          -  Subjects who have not received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate
             replacement therapy (SRT) in the past or patients who have not received ERT in the
             past twelve months

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) 19 to 25 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Non-smoking (by declaration) for a period of at least 6 months prior to screening
             visit.

          -  Subjects in generally good health in the opinion of the investigator as determined by
             medical history, vital signs and a physical examination.

          -  Negative hepatitis B or hepatitis C serology tests at screening.

          -  Ability to provide a written informed consent

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential or male subjects with female partners of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use two methods of contraception, one of which
             must be a barrier method. Acceptable methods of contraception include hormonal
             products, intrauterine device, or male or female condoms.

             study specific GI questionnaire

          -  Subjects with an inability to communicate well with the investigators and study staff
             (i.e., language problem, poor mental development or impaired cerebral function).

          -  Subjects who are non-cooperative or unwilling to sign the consent form.

          -  Pregnant or nursing or planning to be pregnant during the study period.

          -  Have used any medication (excluding paracetamol), within 7 days of study drug
