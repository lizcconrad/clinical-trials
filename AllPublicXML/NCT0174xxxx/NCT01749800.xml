  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed project is to perform a preliminary study to assess the
      potential effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) on the outcomes of a cognitive
      test of attention and the outcomes of robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to explore the use of GVS on the severity of attention span deficits and motor
      training delivered using a spring-based robot. We intend to carry out the study in a small
      cohort of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors (20 subjects). Subjects with attention span
      deficits but no significant motor impairments will solely undergo a cognitive test of
      attention with/without GVS. Subjects with both attention span deficits and significant motor
      impairments will undergo a cognitive test of attention and robot-assisted upper-limb
      rehabilitation with/without GVS.
