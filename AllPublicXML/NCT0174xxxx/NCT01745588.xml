  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether pomalidomide (also known as Pomalyst) reduces the
      number of myeloma cells in the bones, and to see what is the best way to use pomalidomide in
      patients with myeloma. To do this, the investigators want to compare two types of treatment
      using pomalidomde. This is a randomized trial which means that the decision as to which
      treatment the patient will receive will be made by a computer, much like flipping a coin.

      All patients start by receiving 4 cycles of clarithromycin, pomalidomide and dexamethasone
      (ClaPD). After 4 cycles, half of the patients will undergo an autologous stem cell transplant
      followed by pomalidomide (Group 1). The other half of the patients will continue to receive
      ClaPD for 9 cycles to be followed by pomalidomide maintenance. (Group 2).

      At the end of the study, the two groups will be compared to see if there is a difference in
      disease outcome.

          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study because the risks to an
             unborn fetus or potential risks in nursing infants are unknown.
