  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how different physical therapy interventions
      affect the use of certain abdominal muscles in patients with low back pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with low back pain will undergo ultrasound imaging of the lateral abdominal wall to
      measure resting and contracted thickness of the transversus abdominis muscle. Following the
      pre-intervention measurement, patients will receive one of two physical therapy interventions
      (side lying thrust joint manipulation or side lying non-thrust oscillations into slight
      rotation) which will have been randomly assigned. Immediately after intervention, ultrasound
      imaging will be repeated on the resting and contracted thickness of the transversus
      abdominis.
