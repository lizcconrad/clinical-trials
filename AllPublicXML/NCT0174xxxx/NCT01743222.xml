    <description>Pain in administration area will be assessed by a visual analogical scale.
Medical exploration of the administration area will be performed to identify any skin reaction.
Inguinal scan will be performed to assess any lymphatic node modification.
Systemic tolerability will be measured by number of AE (Adverse Event) recorded at any time, including any alteration in laboratory parameters and/or physical exploration.</description>
