  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During their lifetime, approximately 50% of Canadian women and 30% of Canadian men will
      experience at least one fracture due to bone fragility (FF). Evidence is growing regarding
      prevention programs' effectiveness to prevent falls, but prevention of fractures through fall
      prevention programs has enjoyed limited success. Falls prevention programs and post-fracture
      screening programs leading to pharmacological treatment are very different strategies, with a
      shared ultimate goal. Coordination between those who repair fractures and those who manage
      the patient to prevent the next fracture is critical. The overarching aim of this proposal is
      to generate evidence-based knowledge about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an
      integrated FF prevention program, as well as a portrait of the barriers and facilitating
      factors for such programs. More specifically, the objectives are: 1) to combine existing fall
      prevention and post-fracture management programs in the province of Quebec into integrated FF
      prevention programs; 2) to compare the performance of these integrated programs to control
      sites, using a pragmatic study design; 3) to identify barriers as well as factors that
      improve effectiveness across different implementation milieu; and 4) to develop and engage in
      active knowledge transfer activities in Quebec regions where integrated FF prevention
      programs are neither adequately nor successfully implemented. Drawing upon the literature on
      integrated healthcare, fall and fracture prevention, we hypothesize that an integrated FF
      program can reduce the risk of a subsequent fracture by at least 30% in the population of
      interest. The proposed team is poised to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations among
      healthcare practitioners and decision makers involved in the prevention of FFs. The program
      is built upon existing healthcare and structures and programs and in turn, will truly measure
      the effectiveness of an integrated FF prevention program. The results will ultimately lead to
      improvements in the existing knowledge base, address policy-relevant and health systems
      problems, and assist in the design and implementation of FFs prevention programs.
