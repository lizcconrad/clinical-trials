    <textblock>
      The total duration of the study was 18 weeks, comprising a 2-week screening period and a
      16-week treatment period. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria for provisional
      enrollment received the study drug for the screening period (solifenacin) at the same dose as
      that before the start of the study (2.5 or 5 mg), once daily after breakfast orally for 2
      weeks. After the screening period, patients meeting the eligibility criteria for formal
      enrollment received the study drugs for the treatment period (solifenacin 2.5 or 5 mg and
      mirabegron 25 mg), once daily after breakfast orally for 16 weeks. Mirabegron dose could be
      increased to 50 mg at week 8 visit if the patients met all of the following criteria: (1) had
      an inadequate response to mirabegron at the dose of 25 mg; (2) was judged by the investigator
      or coinvestigator to have no safety concerns; and (3) agreed to increase the dose.

        <title>Change From Baseline in OABSS Total Score</title>
        <description>The OABSS questionnaire was a questionnaire completed by participants with 4 questions regarding their OAB symptoms. For each participant, the OABSS total score was calculated from the sum total of the score of each question. The total score ranges from 0 to 15 with higher score indicating more symptoms. The OABSS data obtained at week 0 were used as baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and week 8, 16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS participants with available data at each time point are included in the analysis. A last visit analysis (at the end of study) was performed to ensure all patients with postbaseline data were included in the analyses. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used for the end of study analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Short Form (OAB-q SF) Severity Score</title>
        <description>The OAB-q SF questionnaire was a questionnaire completed by participants composed of 2 sections: Severity Symptom and the Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL). The Severity Symptom section included 6 questions. For each participant, the symptom severity score was derived as a sum of scores for Questions 1 to 6. The total score ranges from 6 to 36 with higher symptom severity score indicating greater symptom bother. OAB-q SF data obtained at week 0 visit were used as baseline.</description>

        <population>FAS participants with available data at each time point are included in the analysis. A last visit analysis (at the end of study) was performed to ensure all patients with postbaseline data were included in the analyses. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used for the end of study analysis.</population>

        <description>Participants completed the patient diary (paper document) for 3 days immediately before each visit. An urgency episode was defined as a complaint of a sudden, compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer. The mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours was calculated by taking the sum of all marked episodes in the patient diary where the variable &quot;urgency&quot; was indicated, divided by the number of days on which episodes were recorded.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Number of Incontinence Episodes Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>Participants completed the patient diary (paper document) for 3 days immediately before each visit. An incontinence episode was defined as the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine. The mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was calculated by taking the sum of all marked episodes in the patient diary where the variable &quot;urinary incontinence’&quot; was indicated, divided by the number of days on which episodes were recorded. Only participants who had an incontinence episode at baseline was included in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Number of Urge Incontinence Episodes Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>Participants completed the patient diary (paper document) for 3 days immediately before each visit. An urge incontinence episode was defined as any episode when both urgency and incontinence occurred concurrently. The mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was calculated by taking the sum of all marked episodes in the patient diary where the variable &quot;urgency&quot; and &quot;urinary incontinence’&quot; were indicated, divided by the number of days on which episodes were recorded. Only participants who had an urge incontinence episode at baseline was included in the analysis.</description>

The mean volume per micturition was calculated by taking the sum of the urinary volumes where the volume voided was &gt; 0 and where &quot;urinary incontinence&quot; was not indicated in the patient diary, divided by the number of micturitions where the volume voided was &gt; 0 and where &quot;urinary incontinence&quot; was not indicated. Only participants who had volume voided was &gt; 0 at baseline was included in the analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and week 8, 16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS participants with available data at each time point are included in the analysis. A last visit analysis (at the end of study) was performed to ensure all patients with postbaseline data were included in the analyses. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used for the end of study analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Number of Nocturia Episodes Per Night</title>
        <description>Participants completed the patient diary (paper document) for 3 days immediately before each visit. A nocturia episode was defined as waking at night 1 or more times to void. Night time was defined as the period between bedtime and the wake-up time the following day (micturitions at the same time as the wake-up time were excluded). The mean number of nocturia episodes per night was calculated by taking the sum of nocturia episodes in the patient diary where the variable &quot;urinated&quot; was indicated during the night time, divided by the number of nights. Only participants who had a nocturia episode at baseline was included in the analysis.</description>
