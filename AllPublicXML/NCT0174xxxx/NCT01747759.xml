  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefit of preoperative rehabilitation treatment combining physiotherapy and targeted
      education for patient undergoing Total Knee replacement (TKR) is now well known. Thus, there
      is lack of validated booklet containing evidence based informations.

      Our aim is to assess the impact of an evidence based education pre-operative booklet on
      patient's knowledge and beliefs. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of the
      booklet on patient's satisfaction on the information received, the length of stay in
      orthopedic surgery and the transfer rate to rehabilitation wards.

      To show a difference of 2 points on the knowledge score (range 0-10) between the two groups,
      with a = 0.05 and a power of 90%, we considered that 44 patients are needed. The evaluations
      will take place at baseline, the day before surgery and 6 weeks post-surgery on knowledge and
      beliefs scores at each visit and on a satisfaction score on the last one. Quantitative data
      will be compared between groups by the Kruskal-Wallis and qualitative parameters via Fisher
      exact test.

      The study protocol was approved by the local Ethic Committee.
