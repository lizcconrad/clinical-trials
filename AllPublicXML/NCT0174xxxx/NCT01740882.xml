  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic incisional hernia repair a variety of fixation methods has been proposed to
      ensure the correct and stable intra-abdominal placement of the mesh, in order to prevent
      recurrence, but on the other hand avoiding long-term pain and discomfort. The optimal method
      is unclear.

      In Denmark the investigators have a nationwide database that records 80% of all ventral
      hernia repairs. The investigators combine data from the Danish Hernia Database, the National
      Patient Registry, and prospective questionnaire and clinical follow-up in order to get the
      true recurrence rate (clinical and reoperation rate) and the degree of long-term discomfort.

      Purpose The purpose of this national prospective kohort study is to compare the risk of
      developing recurrence of incisional hernia after laparoscopic incisional hernia repair with
      either absorbable or non-absorbable tacks, and to investigate possible. late complaints in
      terms of pain and discomfort after the two mesh fixation devices.

      The investigators include 355 laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs with absorbable tacks
      and 726 with non-absorbable tacks. It is expected that about 300 patients will be offered
      physical examination.

      Material and Method Register-based cohort study of perioperative entry of patient data and
      prospective questionnaire follow-up and depending on the answer to any. clinical trial.

      Follow-up is done by searching the Danish Hernia Database and the National Patient Register
      (to ensure data completeness) and distribution of patient questionnaire as reoperation for
      hernia recurrence is an underestimate of the true recurrence risk.

      Statistics There will be performed frequency analyzes and Kaplan Meyer statistics on the 2
      groups supplemented with multivariate Cox regression analysis. Using non-parametric
      statistics. P &lt;0.05 considered statistically significant.

        During the period 1 January 2008 to 31 June 2012 were recorded 355 laparoscopic incisional
        hernia operations with absorbable tacks and 726 with non-absorbable tacks were registered
        in the Dansih Hernia Database. Thus, we include 1081 patients in the study. It is expected
        that about 300 patients will be offered physical examination.
