  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of CUDC-907 in patients with refractory
      or relapsed lymphoma or multiple myeloma. CUDC-907 is a multi-targeted agent designed to
      inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)and histone deacetylase (HDAC). The study is designed
      to assess the safety, including the maximum tolerated dose, biologically effective dose, the
      pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer activity of CUDC-907.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and
      tolerability of CUDC-907 as a single agent administered orally, once daily, to patients with
      relapsed or refractory lymphoma or multiple myeloma. The following dosing schedules may be
      examined, all consisting of 21-day cycles and including:

      (i) continuous once daily (QD), (ii) twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 (BIW) (iii)
      thrice weekly on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19 (TIW) (iv) four days on/three days off
      on Days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18 (4/3), and (v) five days on/two days off on Days 1-5, 8-12, and
      15-19 (5/2)

      Sequential dose escalation cohorts of oral CUDC-907 are planned. Subject enrollment and dose
      escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design. In the absence of DLT, each
      subject will be treated for a minimum of 21 days, and may continue to receive additional
      treatment until disease progression has been documented or other treatment discontinuation
      criteria have been met.

      MTD or BED expansion cohorts of up to 36 evaluable (e.g., up to 12 subjects in each of 2 or 3
      specific tumor types or subtype) to better define the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      antitumor and pharmacodynamic activity of the study treatment, as well as suitability as an
      RP2D and schedule.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events as
      determined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE v4.03). A Safety Review Committee (SRC) comprised of the Medical Monitor, Principal
      Investigators, and Sponsor representatives, will be convened to review safety information and
      to decide upon dose escalation and further subject enrollment.

      The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to standard response
      criteria as appropriate for each individual subject's tumor type (e.g., Revised Response
      Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple
      Myeloma).

      Exploratory biological markers of activity will be assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC), plasma and tissue specimens (skin, tumor and bone marrow samples, where
      available).
