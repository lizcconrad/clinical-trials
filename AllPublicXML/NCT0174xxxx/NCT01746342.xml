  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is highly prevalent among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and has pervasive adverse
      effects on daily functioning and quality of life. The investigators found in a recent study
      that obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea (OSAH) is the most common sleep abnormality in multiple
      sclerosis (MS) patients. There was also a significant relationship between OSAH and higher
      fatigue scores in MS patients. Preliminary work from the investigators in this group of
      subjects shows that treatment of sleep disorders (mostly OSAH) can improve fatigue and other
      symptoms in some MS patients. However, it is now necessary to systemically test the effect of
      OSAH treatment in a randomized, controlled study, to be sure that it really does improve
      fatigue and other symptoms. The best treatment for OSAH in the general population is
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This treatment has been well tolerated by most MS
      patients who have used the device at the investigators' center. This project will therefore
      be a randomized, controlled, clinical trial of CPAP in MS patients with OSAH. The effects of
      six months of CPAP treatment on fatigue as well as sleep quality, somnolence, pain,
      disability, and quality of life will be studied.
