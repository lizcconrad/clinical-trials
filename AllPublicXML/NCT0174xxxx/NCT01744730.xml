  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how clindamycin works in children who fall
      in the 85th percentile or higher for body mass index (BMI - a ratio of weight to height). The
      results of the study will help better understand if children in higher BMI ranges process the
      medication differently and whether dosing should be adjusted in these children.

      This is a prospective, open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study of multiple doses of IV
      and oral clindamycin in overweight and obese children ages 2 to 17 years of age. The total
      study duration is expected to be approximately 24 months; each subject will participate in
      the study for up to 18 days (screening day; treatment days 1-14 [may be as short as 2 days]
      followed by an observation period of 3 days post discontinuation of clindamycin therapy or
      after day 17 (on day 18) of therapy in those who are treated with more than 14 days of
      clindamycin).

    <time_frame>After first study dose of IV Clindamycin through Day 14 (minimum of 3 samples; maximum of 6).</time_frame>
    <description>In order to understand the impact of obesity on clindamycin PK, PK data were combined to build a PK model from 3 studies that included both obese and non-obese children: 1) PTN_Clinda Obese study (clinicaltrials.gov/ct.gov identifier NCT01744730) n = 21; 2) PTN_POPS study (ct.gov identifier NCT01431326) n = 178; and 3) Staph Trio study (ct.gov identifier NCT01728363) n = 21. The data from the Staph-Trio study were only included for PK modeling and not intended to be compared in the analysis.
PK sampling schedule for PTN_Clinda Obese was: Pre-dose 0 (within 15 minutes prior to IV clindamycin dose), 0.5 (± 5 minutes) after dose was administered, 1-1.5 hours (hrs) after dose, 3-4 hrs after, 5-6 hrs after, and pre-next dose. Samples were collected on multiple days and averaged to arrive at a single value. Comparison of empirical Bayesian Estimates (EBE) for clearance by age cohort are presented below.

        <title>Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Clearance (Cl) in Participants Who Received Multiple Doses of Intravenous (IV) Clindamycin.</title>
        <description>In order to understand the impact of obesity on clindamycin PK, PK data were combined to build a PK model from 3 studies that included both obese and non-obese children: 1) PTN_Clinda Obese study (clinicaltrials.gov/ct.gov identifier NCT01744730) n = 21; 2) PTN_POPS study (ct.gov identifier NCT01431326) n = 178; and 3) Staph Trio study (ct.gov identifier NCT01728363) n = 21. The data from the Staph-Trio study were only included for PK modeling and not intended to be compared in the analysis.
PK sampling schedule for PTN_Clinda Obese was: Pre-dose 0 (within 15 minutes prior to IV clindamycin dose), 0.5 (± 5 minutes) after dose was administered, 1-1.5 hours (hrs) after dose, 3-4 hrs after, 5-6 hrs after, and pre-next dose. Samples were collected on multiple days and averaged to arrive at a single value. Comparison of empirical Bayesian Estimates (EBE) for clearance by age cohort are presented below.
Sampling schedule details for PTN_POPS and Staph Trio were comparable.</description>
        <time_frame>After first study dose of IV Clindamycin through Day 14 (minimum of 3 samples; maximum of 6).</time_frame>
        <population>In order to determine the impact of obesity and the best weight measure for dosing, only children ≥ 2 years of age were compared (PTN_Clinda obese study n = 21; PTN_POPS study n = 104; and Staph Trio study n = 0). The PK model suggested dosing should be based on Total Body Weight (TBW) regardless of obesity status.</population>

          <title>Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Clearance (Cl) in Participants Who Received Multiple Doses of Intravenous (IV) Clindamycin.</title>
          <description>In order to understand the impact of obesity on clindamycin PK, PK data were combined to build a PK model from 3 studies that included both obese and non-obese children: 1) PTN_Clinda Obese study (clinicaltrials.gov/ct.gov identifier NCT01744730) n = 21; 2) PTN_POPS study (ct.gov identifier NCT01431326) n = 178; and 3) Staph Trio study (ct.gov identifier NCT01728363) n = 21. The data from the Staph-Trio study were only included for PK modeling and not intended to be compared in the analysis.
PK sampling schedule for PTN_Clinda Obese was: Pre-dose 0 (within 15 minutes prior to IV clindamycin dose), 0.5 (± 5 minutes) after dose was administered, 1-1.5 hours (hrs) after dose, 3-4 hrs after, 5-6 hrs after, and pre-next dose. Samples were collected on multiple days and averaged to arrive at a single value. Comparison of EBE for clearance by age cohort normalized to 1 kg of body weight are presented below.
Sampling schedule details for PTN_POPS and Staph Trio were comparable.</description>
          <population>In order to determine the impact of obesity and the best weight measure for dosing, only children ≥ 2 years of age were compared (PTN_Clinda obese study n = 21; PTN_POPS study n = 104; and Staph Trio study n = 0). The PK model suggested dosing should be based on Total Body Weight (TBW) regardless of obesity status.</population>

        <title>PK - Volume of Distribution (V) in Participants Who Received Multiple Doses of Intravenous (IV) Clindamycin.</title>
        <description>In order to understand the impact of obesity on clindamycin PK, PK data were combined to build a PK model from 3 studies that included both obese &amp; non-obese children: 1) PTN_Clinda Obese study (clinicaltrials.gov/ct.gov identifier NCT01744730) n = 21; 2) PTN_POPS study (ct.gov identifier NCT01431326) n = 178; and 3) Staph Trio study (ct.gov identifier NCT01728363) n = 21. The data from the Staph-Trio study were only included for PK modeling and not intended to be compared in the analysis.
PK sampling schedule for PTN_Clinda Obese was: Pre-dose 0 (within 15 minutes prior to IV clindamycin dose), 0.5 (± 5 minutes) after dose was administered, 1-1.5 hours (hrs) after dose, 3-4 hrs after, 5-6 hrs after, and pre-next dose. Samples were collected on multiple days and averaged to arrive at a single value. Comparison of EBE for volume of distribution by age cohort normalized to 1kg of body weight are presented below.
