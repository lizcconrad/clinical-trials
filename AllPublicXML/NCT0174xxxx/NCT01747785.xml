  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to study how well the heart contracts and relaxes during exercise.
      In addition to traditional measures of heart function, we will use a new computer program
      that may improve understanding of why people feel shortness of breath or fatigue.

    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is not well understood, although account for
      nearly half of all heart failure cases. This study aims to collect data about systolic
      (contracting portion of a heart beat) and diastolic (relaxing portion of a heart beat)
      dysfunction at rest and during exercise. Participants with normal cardiac function will serve
      as a control group and compared to participants who are at risk of heart failure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean cardiac reserve as measured by strain rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Myocardial deformation imaging (e.g. strain, strain rate, torsion) requires clear 2-dimensional echocardiography images that will be obtain at rest and during mild and moderate intensity exercise. Images will be captured during 6-10 minute bouts of exercise on a tilting exercise table. Comparisons will be made on resting and exercise values between groups. Our hypothesis is that strain rate will not increase in patients at risk of heart failure demonstrating lack of cardiovascular reserve.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean cardiac stroke volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke volume is the volume of blood (in milliliters) ejected during each heart contraction, It is measured by combined Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiography. A surrogate measure of stroke volume (oxygen-pulse) can also be obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing by dividing the measured oxygen consumption by the heart rate. Our hypothesis is that stroke volume will plateau early after exercise onset in patients at risk of heart failure and this plateau will correlate with a reduction in strain rate.</description>

    <description>Individuals without history of cardiovascular disease and at least 18 years of age will take a baseline (at rest) cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) and have a cardiac echocardiogram to measure myocardial deformation. CPX and echocardiograms will be repeated during exercise sessions at 3 visits over a 12 week period.</description>

    <description>Individuals at risk of heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction of at least 50% will take a baseline (at rest) cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) and have a baseline cardiac echocardiogram to measure myocardial deformation. CPX and echocardiograms will be repeated during exercise sessions at 6 visits over a 12 week period. A cardiac rehabilitation exercise program will also occur over 12 weeks.</description>
