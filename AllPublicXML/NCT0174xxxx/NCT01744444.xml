  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different treatment trials have been published in acquired nystagmus in the last decade;
      gabapentin and memantine have been found to be efficient in treating pendular nystagmus in
      Multiple Sclerosis. The effects of treatments are measured on nystagmus velocity, amplitude,
      frequency and on visual acuity. None of the trials measured a functional visual score or
      oscillopsia score.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of gabapentin and memantine on the mean
      velocity, amplitude and frequency of pendular nystagmus, as well as on oscillopsia, visual
      acuity and vision-specific health-related quality of life score, in 10 patients with multiple
      sclerosis. The primary object is to find out the best variable to evaluate the efficiency of
      nystagmus treatment and the secondary, to compare the efficiency of both gabapentin and
      memantine in a common population of patients.
