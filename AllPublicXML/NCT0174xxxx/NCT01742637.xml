      The objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence and safety of
      Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide 0.1%/2.5% Gel (Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and Epiduo®
      (Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide 0.1%/2.5% Gel) (Galderma Laboratories, L.P.) in the treatment
      of acne vulgaris, and to demonstrate the superiority of the efficacy of the test and
      reference products over the vehicle (placebo) control in the treatment of acne vulgaris.
