  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia affects 0.7 to 3.3% of the adult population and 7-10 times more women than men.
      In France, the prevalence is 1.6% according to a French study conducted in 2009 and published
      in 2011 by Serge Perrot et al.

      The definition of fibromyalgia was recently amended with particular consideration of
      cognitive and somatic symptoms, factors not involved in the initial criteria of the ACR
      classification. Several factors are in favor of a malfunction of the central modulation of
      pain and poorer performance noxious inhibitory controls descendants (DNIC: diffuse noxious
      inhibitory controls) have been demonstrated. In fibromyalgia patients, the DNIC (diffuse
      noxious inhibitory controls) are altered with less pain inhibition than controls. Dysfunction
      of the central pain modulation is widely described in the literature and contributes to pain
      complained of fibromyalgia.

      According to the Recommendations of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2006,
      antidepressants have a genuine analgesic efficacy in controlled studies. Milnacipran is an
      antidepressant known and used in major depressive disorder according to its marketing
      authorization but is also part of the molecules used in the treatment of chronic neuropathic
      pain and fibromyalgia according to the recommendations of the EULAR. A review included five
      double-blind studies on 4,000 participants who took 100 mg or 200 mg milnacipran or placebo
      over a period of 8 weeks to 24 weeks. A moderate response was obtained for 40% of
      participants treated for each dose of milnacipran on the criteria of &quot;at least 30% pain
      relief&quot; Impression and global change. Substantial improvement with milnacipran compared to
      placebo has been shown.

      To date, the link between the weakening of DNIC in fibromyalgia and effectiveness of drug
      treatment has not been shown.

      This study aims to assess the degree of impairment of DNIC in fibromyalgia patients may be
      predictive of the efficacy of milnacipran.
