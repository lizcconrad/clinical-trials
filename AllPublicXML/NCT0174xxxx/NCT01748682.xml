  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the relative consensus on the benefits of pre-surgical weight loss, i.e., the
      reduction of comorbidities associated with surgical act, such as decreased visceral fat,
      liver volume, hemorrhage perioperative and surgical time, the characteristics of the diet to
      be employed in this period need to be defined more clearly. As there is no description of
      comparative studies on diet of normal consistency, using solids and liquids, there are doubts
      as to the real need for consistency liquid diet in preoperative bariatric surgery. The lack
      of robust evidence has made nutrition professionals adopt different procedures. There is
      still a belief that these patients are unable to lose weight in the preoperative period, the
      ongoing history of previous attempts without success.
