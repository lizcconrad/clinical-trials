  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ponatinib can help to control CML in
      chronic phase. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Ponatinib is designed to block the function of BCR-ABL, which is the abnormal protein
      responsible for causing CML. This may cause the cancer cells to die.

      Ponatinib may cause a blood clot to form in an artery or in a vein. Depending on the location
      of the clot, this could cause a heart attack, a stroke, severe damage to other tissue, or
      death. A blood clot may occur within 2 weeks after you start taking the drug. About 25% (1 in
      4) of patients taking the drug form an abnormal clot. Blood clots can occur in patients that
      do not have other known risk factors for forming clots. If you develop a blood clot, you will
      need to stop taking ponatinib. In some cases, emergency surgery could be needed to remove the
      clot and restore blood flow.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take ponatinib by mouth 1 time every day while you are on study with about a cup (8
      ounces) of water. You may take ponatinib with or without food. If you vomit a dose, you
      should not take ponatinib again to make up for that dose. You should wait until your next
      scheduled dose. You will complete a study diary in which you will record the date and time
      that you take the study drug each time. If you miss any doses, you will also note this in the
      study diary. You will bring this diary to every study visit.

      Study Visits:

      The study staff will help you schedule your study visits. The following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  Blood (about 1/2 tablespoon each time) will be drawn for routine tests every 1-2 weeks
           for the first 4 weeks, every 4-6 weeks for the first year, every 3-4 months for second
           year, then every 4-6 months after that. These tests can be done by your home doctor and
           sent to your study doctor.

        -  You will have an EKG every 3 months for the first year.

        -  You will have a physical exam and you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking
           and any side effects you may be having every 3 months for the first year, then every
           6-12 months after that.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease every 3-4
           months for the first year, then every 6-12 after that.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate for genetic testing and to check the status of the
           disease every 3-4 months for the first year, then every 6-12 months for the next 2
           years, then every 2-3 years after that.

      Length of Study:

      You may take the study drug for up to 5 years. You will be taken off study early if
      intolerable side effects occur, if the disease gets worse, or if you are unable to follow
      study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over when you have completed the follow-up visit/call
      (described below).

      If the disease gets worse or the disease never responds to treatment with ponatinib, blood
      (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn about 30 days after your last dose of ponatinib to check
      for changes in the BCR-ABL protein which may explain why there was no response to the study
      drug.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 30 days after you leave the study, you will be called or you will come to the clinic
      to learn about any side effects or symptoms you may be having. If you are called, this call
      will last about 2-3 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Ponatinib is FDA approved to treat patients with certain
      types of leukemia. Its use in this study is investigational.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

          8. Women of pregnancy potential must practice an effective method of birth control during
             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized: 1. Prior
             to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the
             importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation &amp; the potential risk
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy; 2. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential; 3. In addition,
             men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of
             childbearing potential &amp; should practice an effective method of birth control; 4.
             Women &amp; men must continue birth control for the duration of the trial &amp; at least 3

         10. Patients should have discontinued therapy with imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib or
             other anti-leukemia therapy (except hydroxyurea), at least 48 hours prior to start of
             study therapy and recovered from any toxicity due to these therapies to at least grade
             1. The use of hydroxyurea is allowed immediately prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior therapy with other BCR-ABL-targeted TKIs except imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib
             (e.g., bosutinib).

          2. NYHA cardiac class 3-4 heart disease.

          3. Cardiac Symptoms: Patients meeting the following criteria are not eligible: History of
             unstable angina, myocardial infarction, TIA, stroke, peripheral arterial occlusive
             disease, venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism; Any history of clinically
             significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
             fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes); Prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry
             electrocardiogram (&gt; 470 msec) on both the Fridericia and Bazett's correction;
             Congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) within 3 months prior to first dose of
             ponatinib.

          4. Patients with active, uncontrolled psychiatric disorders including: psychosis, major
             depression, and bipolar disorders.

          5. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained systolic blood pressure
             &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg).

          6. Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded.

          7. Patients with history of pancreatitis.

          8. Patients in accelerated or blast phase, or patients who have ever been documented to
             be in blast phase CML, are excluded. The definitions of excluded CML phases are as
             follows: a. Blastic phase: presence of 30% blasts or more in the peripheral blood or
             bone marrow; b. Accelerated phase CML: presence of any of the following features:
             Peripheral or marrow blasts 15% or more; Peripheral or marrow basophils 20% or more;
             Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 x 10(9)/L unrelated to therapy; Documented extramedullary
             blastic disease outside liver or spleen; c. Clonal evolution defined as the presence
             of additional chromosomal abnormalities other than the Ph chromosome has been
             historically been included as a criterion for accelerated phase.

          9. **continued from above: However, patients with clonal evolution as the only criterion
             of accelerated phase have a significantly better prognosis. Thus, patients with clonal
             evolution and no other criteria for accelerated phase will be eligible for this study,
             but analyzed separately.

         10. Patients who have received more than one FDA-approved TKI for CML, or any
             investigational, non-FDA approved TKI.
