  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) techniques
      have not been well studied. The investigators will conduct a randomized study comparing the
      diagnostic yield and specimen quality of EBUS-FNA performed with and without suction applied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with suspected malignant peribronchial masses or lymph nodes undergoing
      endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) will be
      enrolled. All participants will have 4 needle aspirations of each targeted peribronchial
      lesion. Two needle aspirations will be performed while applying suction and 2 needle
      aspirations will be performed without applying suction in random order. The investigators
      will compare the diagnostic yield and the quality of the specimens obtained using the two
      techniques.
