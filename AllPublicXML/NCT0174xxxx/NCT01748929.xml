  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women of reproductive age are considered a high-risk group for worm infections by the World
      Health Organization. Maternal infection and anemia contribute to infant malnutrition by
      affecting milk quality and quantity, and duration of exclusive breastfeeding. To date, no
      study has investigated the health benefits of postpartum deworming to infants or mothers. A
      randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Peru to investigate the effectiveness of
      integrating deworming into routine postpartum care. The primary measure of effect will be
      infant weight gain between birth and six months of age. Other infant and maternal health
      indicators will also be ascertained.

    <description>The prevalence of current, exclusive, predominant and partial breastfeeding will be used to assess breastfeeding practices. In accordance with WHO criteria, infants will be considered as exclusively breastfed if they ingest only breast milk (excluding vitamins and medications); considered as predominantly breastfed if, in addition to breast milk, they also ingest water, juice, teas, vitamins or medications, and considered as partially breastfed if their primary nutrition source is other than breast milk.</description>
