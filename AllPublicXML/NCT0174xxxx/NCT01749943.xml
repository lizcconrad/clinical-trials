      Evaluate a method of testing the strength of five key lower limb muscle groups using a
      hand-held strength gauge (dynamometer).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to assess the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of a hand-held
      dynamometer (HHD) in the assessment of lower limb strength in patients with Multiple
      Sclerosis.

      Also to establish a standardized strength testing procedure for key lower limb muscle groups
      using a HHD fo research and clinical purposes in Multiple Sclerosis.
