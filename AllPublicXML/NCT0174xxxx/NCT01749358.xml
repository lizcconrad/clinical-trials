  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about rehabilitation of arm function after a stroke. The investigators are
      testing the dosage of therapy that is needed for meaningful recovery of arm and hand
      function. Dosage of therapy refers to the amount of time (in this case, the total number of
      hours) that a person participates in treatment. The investigators hope to learn how much
      therapy time is needed in order for change to occur in arm and hand function after a person
      has had a stroke. Eligible candidates must have had a stroke affecting the use of an arm or
      hand at least 6 months ago.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bilateral Arm Reaching Test (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to up to 4 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>BART is a laboratory-based timed-reaching task for people with stroke that was developed to evaluate upper extremity use in free-choice and forced-use scenarios. BART will be performed two times per month for the four months following randomization, and one time a month for 6 months during the follow-up period to assess changes in upper extremity use relative to dosage of therapy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to up to 4 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Tests arm function based on time to complete 15 tasks performed with each arm. WMFT will be used to assess change in arm function relative to dose of physical therapy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Activity Log (MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to up to 4 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured interview in which participants are asked to rate the quality of movement (QOM) of their more affected arm for 28 activities of daily living. MAL is used to assess changes in participant perspective of arm use in daily life relative to dose of physical therapy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bilateral Arm Reaching Test (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to up to 10 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>BART is a laboratory-based timed-reaching task for people with stroke that was developed to evaluate upper extremity use in free-choice and forced-use scenarios. BART will be performed 2 times at Baseline, pre- and post- intervention and 1 time a month for 6 months during follow-up to assess changes in upper extremity use relative to dosage of therapy.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to up to 4 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure to assess the ways in which an individual's health and life are impacted after a stroke. SIS will be used to assess changes in participant self-report of the impact of the stroke on health and life relative to dosage of physical therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to up to 4 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>A test of motor function and sensation for the arm that is most affected by the stroke. UEFM will assess change in motor function relative to dose of physical therapy.</description>
