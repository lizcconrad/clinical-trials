    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an ophthalmic solution for the treatment of ocular
      itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis using the Conjunctival Allergen Challenge
      (CAC) model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants will be tested for the presence of common allergies using the
      Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC) model. Drops of increasing concentration of a
      solubilized allergen will be instilled in both eyes until a positive reaction occurred. The
      test will be repeated to confirm the allergic reaction. Participants with confirmed reactions
      will be administered the test article (Day 0) and undergo a CAC 24 hours post-instillation
      (Day 1). On Day 14, participants will be administered the test article and undergo an
      additional CAC.

    <description>A treatment efficacy CAC was performed 27 minutes after drop installation. Ocular itching was assessed by the participant on a 0-4 scale (0= none, 4 = incapacitating itch). A responder was defined as a participant with zero-itch (a score of zero on ocular itching for both eyes) or with at least 2 units reduction in ocular itching relative to the baseline confirmatory CAC score. Ocular itching score was averaged across both eyes and over the 3 post-CAC assessments (3, 5, and 7 minutes) for the calculation of units reduction. Proportion of Ocular Itching Responders is reported as a percentage.</description>

        <description>A treatment efficacy CAC was performed 27 minutes after drop installation. Ocular itching was assessed by the participant on a 0-4 scale (0= none, 4 = incapacitating itch). A responder was defined as a participant with zero-itch (a score of zero on ocular itching for both eyes) or with at least 2 units reduction in ocular itching relative to the baseline confirmatory CAC score. Ocular itching score was averaged across both eyes and over the 3 post-CAC assessments (3, 5, and 7 minutes) for the calculation of units reduction. Proportion of Ocular Itching Responders is reported as a percentage.</description>
