  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the inter-rater reproducibility of
      diaphragmatic excursion measures via time-motion-mode ultrasound (evaluation performed on the
      first measure) in patients experiencing acute respiratory distress emergencies.

  <detailed_description>

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the feasibility of measuring the diaphragmatic excursion in the context of
           emergency management (ratio of measured patients / included patients).

        -  To evaluate the time required for the measurement.

        -  To assess the intra-rater reproducibility of measurements of diaphragmatic excursion
           (comparison of first and second measures).

          -  The patient must be insured or beneficiary of a health insurance plan

          -  The patient has acute respiratory distress defined by a respiratory rate &gt; 25, and /
             or signs of struggle and hypoxia, oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;90% and / or pH &lt;7.35 and
             carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) &gt; 6 kPa (45 mm Hg)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is participating in another study

          -  The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study

          -  The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship
