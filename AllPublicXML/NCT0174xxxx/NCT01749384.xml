      This phase I trial studies the side effects of and best dose of tivantinib when given
      together with bevacizumab in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other
      areas of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Tivantinib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Bevacizumab
      may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving tivantinib
      together with bevacizumab may work better in treating tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab in combination with the allosteric met proto-oncogene
      (MET) inhibitor, tivantinib, in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with bevacizumab
      in combination with tivantinib as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) version (v) 4.0.

      II. Document anti-tumor activity of bevacizumab in combination with tivantinib in patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of tivantinib when administered in combination with
      bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      IV. Perform cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19) genotyping on all
      subjects and correlate with pharmacokinetics and toxicity.

      V. Assess the effect of bevacizumab plus tivantinib on plasma components of the
      hepatocellular growth factor (HGF)-MET signaling pathway (HGF, HGF activator [HGFA]) and VEGF
      signaling pathway (VEGF A, B, C, D and placental growth factor [PIGF]).

      VI. Assess tissue (tumor and skin) protein biomarkers before and after study treatment
      including MET, phospho-MET^tyrosine (Tyr)1349 and phosphor-focal adhesion kinase
      (FAK)^Tyr861.

      VII. Assess early therapy response by quantitative biomarker imaging fludeoxyglucose F 18
      (F-18 FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) on a
      smaller sample (n up to 15) of subjects willing to participate in the imaging assessment
      through UPCI 12-096.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tivantinib.

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days -15, 1, and 15
      (day -15 of course 1 only) and tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

             treated brain metastases are defined as having no ongoing requirement for steroids and
             no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment for at least 3 months, as
             ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging

             3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4); the metabolism and consequently overall
             pharmacokinetics of tivantinib could be altered by inhibitors and/or inducers or other
             substrates of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4; while inhibitors/inducers of these cytochrome P450
             isoenzymes are not specifically excluded, investigators should be aware that
             tivantinib exposure may be altered by the concomitant administration of these drugs;
             as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
             herbal product

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the
             following, are excluded:

               -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (HTN) (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt; 160
                  mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt; 90 mmHg despite antihypertensive
                  medication)

               -  History of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 6 months of start of protocol
                  therapy

               -  Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months of start of protocol
                  therapy

               -  New York Heart Association grade II or greater congestive heart failure

               -  Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia

               -  Significant vascular disease (e.g. significant aortic aneurysm, history of aortic
                  dissection)

               -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

               -  Untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) or DVT/PE which
                  has been treated with therapeutic anticoagulation for less than 6 weeks

             first dose of study drug

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study, and breastfeeding should be discontinued
             if the mother is treated with tivantinib; these potential risks may also apply to
             bevacizumab

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible
