    <measure>Dizzy: Area Under Effect Curve (AUE) From 0-36 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-dose, 36 h post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Dizzy visual analogue scale (VAS) assesses the effect experienced by the participant on a 100 point unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0) to 'extremely' (score of 100). AUE (0-36) = Area under the effect versus time curve from time zero to time of last quantifiable effect (0-36).</description>

    <measure>Pupillometry: Area Under Effect Curve (AUE) From 0-8 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 8 h post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pupillometry assessments measured change in pupil size (miosis) as an indicator of opioid pharmacological properties. The same eye for each participant was used for all measurements during the study. Participants had the size of their pupil measured (in mm) using a pupillometer. Measurements were made in a dimly lit (mesopic) room with controlled lighting conditions. AUE (0-8) = Area under the effect versus time curve from time zero to time of last quantifiable effect (0-8).</description>
