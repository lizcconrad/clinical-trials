  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has unparalleled efficacy in treating severe depression that
      is resistant to common modalities of treatment, such as antidepressant medication. Although
      treatment with ECT has benefited many individuals with treatment resistant depression (rates
      as high as 50-75%), its more widespread use is hindered by the social stigma associated with
      the treatment, as well as by its significant cognitive side effects. Moreover, ECT cannot be
      precisely targeted, since it produces a widespread activation of the brain surface, in turn,
      affecting many different functional areas. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is currently being
      investigated as an alternative to ECT, as it is more focused to one area of the brain. Rather
      than applying electrical stimuli to induce a seizure, as is done in ECT, MST uses repetitive
      magnetic stimulation to produce the seizure. Preliminary research suggests that MST can
      result in therapeutic effects comparable to those produced by ECT, but without the negative
      side effects on cognition. The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial, in which the
      efficacy and side effect profile of MST will be compared to those of ECT. If successful, the
      results of this study may lead to increased treatment availability and accessibility, as well
      as lessen the substantial health care costs associated with treatment resistant depression.

             features

          -  have failed to achieve a clinical response to adequate treatment trials of at least
             two antidepressants (with adequacy established according to a predefined criterion on
             the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF)) or have been unable to tolerate at
