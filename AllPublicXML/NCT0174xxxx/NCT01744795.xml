  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal invasive monitoring systems of central hemodynamics are gaining increasing
      popularity. The present study investigates the precision of the esophageal doppler (CardioQ)
      derived cardiac output and its agreement with pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution (PAC
      TD) for measuring CO during steady state and with induced hemodynamic changes in patients
      scheduled for elective cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five patients are planned to be enrolled. After induction of anesthesia, insertion of
      the PAC and the esophageal-doppler probe, the patient are placed in the following successive
      positions: a) supine, b) head-down tilt, c) head-up tilt, d) supine, e) supine with
      phenylephrine administration f) pace heart rate 80 bpm, g) pace heart rate 110 bpm, and CO
      are measured simultaneously using the CardioQ and PAC TD.
