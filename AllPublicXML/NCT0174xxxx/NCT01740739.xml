  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between the ClearView scan results
      and a variety of cardiovascular risk indicators such as the Coronary Calcium Score,
      Framingham Risk Factors, Reynolds Risk Score, and biomarkers of inflammation. The ClearView
      device is a bio-electrographic tool that may assist medical professionals in rapid assessment
      of the systemic origin of the patient's presenting symptom(s). The ClearView is a potentially
      valuable resource that may benefit a physician's office by offering expedited differentiation
      capabilities. The subsequent results have the potential to include more data that would allow
      rapid patient diagnosis, triage, and treatment; optimized precious resource expenditure
      (nursing, physician, etc.); lower costs to facility, patient and insurance company; and
      decreased office wait time.

             within 14 days after the ClearView Scan.

          -  The patient or legal representative is able to understand and provide signed consent
             for the procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with pacemakers or another implanted electrical device, such as an automatic
             internal cardiac defibrillator.

               -  Patients connected to an electrical device that cannot be removed or temporarily
                  powered off (i.e. monitor) during subject testing with the ClearView Device
