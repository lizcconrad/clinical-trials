        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Rutherford Category 2-4 (mild intermittent claudication (pain while walking)to
             ischemic pain (pain due to decreased blood flow) at rest).

          -  The target lesion(s) has evidence of narrowing or blockage and can be stented.

          -  The total length of the lesion or series of lesions is estimated to be less than or
             equal to 150 mm.

          -  The target vessel reference diameter is greater than or equal to 4.0 mm and less than
             or equal to 6.5 mm

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a known reaction (including allergic reaction) or sensitivity to blood
             thinning medications, or study device materials (nickel, titanium or tantalum)

          -  The subject has a known sensitivity to medical imaging substances (contract media)
             that cannot be pretreated with medications (steroids or/and antihistamines)

          -  The subject has a history of bleeding disorders (diatheses or coagulopathy).

          -  The subject has kidney failure or is having dialysis treatment.

          -  The subject has insufficient liver function, swelling of vein(s) caused by blood clot
             (thrombophlebitis), uremia, systemic lupus, or deep vein blood clots.

          -  Subject has Acute Limb Ischemia (a sudden loss of blood flow to the limb).

          -  Subject has a history of bypass surgery on the study vessel.

          -  Subject has a history of heart attack or stroke within 6 months of study procedure.

          -  The subject is receiving immunosuppressive therapy (medications that lower the body's
             normal immune response).

          -  The subject is diagnosed with a severe infection (septicemia).

          -  Principal investigator determines the subject's condition would prevent the subject
             from undergoing the study procedure or cannot support a vascular bypass graft.

          -  The subject with a stent previously implanted into the target vessel.

          -  Subject has disease in both legs where both limbs meet the inclusion criteria and it
             is planned to treat both limbs within 30 days.

          -  Pregnant, possibly pregnant and/or nursing female subjects are excluded, as are female
             subjects who are willing to have a baby during the trial.

          -  The subject is participating in an investigational drug or another investigational
             device study.

          -  Subject has a large amount of blood clot next to the study lesion.
