  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-Operative Cognitive Decline (POCD) is common after cardiac surgery and associated with
      increased morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of POCD is only poorly understood.
      Causes include hypoperfusion, microemboli and the systemic inflammatory response, which
      result in a reduction of cerebral oxygen delivery.

      Cerebral oxygenation can be monitored non-invasively by measuring frontal lobe oxygen
      saturation (rSO2).

      The bispectral index (BIS) of the electroencephalogram is widely known to measure depth of
      anaesthesia, and there is a high correlation between BIS, a dimensionless calculated number
      between 0 and 100, and clinical criteria of sedation. With BIS below 60 recall is extremely
      low.

      The investigators demonstrated recently that inappropriately high levels of anaesthesia may
      be associated with poorer long-term outcomes in cognition after non-cardiac surgery (Ballard
      et al. 2012). Whether optimisation of the depth of anaesthesia and cerebral oxygenation has
      an effect on postoperative cognitive function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is
      unknown.

      The investigators hypothesize that the incidence of POCD in elderly patients (&gt; 65 years old)
      at 6 weeks is less with mildly deep anaesthesia (BIS 50 +- 10) and optimised rSO2
      (interventions when rSO2 drops below 15% of baseline reading) when compared with current
      practice (BIS blinded anaesthesia, reflecting moderately to highly deep anaesthesia and
      blinded rSO2 measurements).
