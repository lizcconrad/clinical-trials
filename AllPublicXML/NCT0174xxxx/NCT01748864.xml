  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single arm, baseline-controlled (for safety) study in
      normal volunteers. Study will determine biodistribution and excretion of the radioactive drug
      substance and evaluate the safety and tolerability of 99mTC-Etarfolatide in normal
      volunteers.

          -  Subject is simultaneously participating in another investigative drug or device study.

          -  Subject must have completed the follow-up phase of any previous study at least 30 days
             prior to enrollment in this study.

          -  Subject has a known history of chronic abuse of drugs or alcohol or tests positive in
             pre-study urine drug abuse screen.

          -  Subject is currently taking folic acid supplements and cannot stop taking the
