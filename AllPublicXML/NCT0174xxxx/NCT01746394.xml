  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Delta Healthy Sprouts Project is a randomized, controlled trial evaluating the
      enhancement of an existing Mother, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program in 150
      African American women in their early second trimester of pregnancy. The control arm, Parents
      as Teachers, is an evidence-based approach to increase parental knowledge of child
      development and improve parenting practices. The experimental arm, Parents as Teachers
      Enhanced, builds on the Parents as Teachers curriculum by including nutrition and physical
      activity components specifically designed for the gestational and postnatal periods. Both
      arms of the intervention will be implemented by community-based, trained Parent Educators.
      The comparative effectiveness of the two intervention arms on weight status, dietary intake,
      and health behaviors of mothers and their infants will be assessed. The Delta Healthy Sprouts
      Project will determine if a novel, scalable, lifestyle intervention can improve the health of
      African American women and their children at high-risk for obesity and chronic disease.

    <description>Participants will receive the same monthly Parents as Teachers (PaT) lessons and materials at each home visit as the PaT arm. Additionally, these mothers will receive the enhanced nutrition and physical activity lessons and materials which will follow the family well-being format of the PaT lessons. The StartSmart lessons will focus on healthy gestational weight gain, diet, physical activity, breastfeeding, weight management, healthy eating, food shopping, meal preparation, physical activity, proper infant feeding, and infant activity time.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive monthly Parents as Teachers (PaT) lessons and materials at each home visit. The Parent Educator will first connect with the mother by discussing or reviewing content from the prior visit; reflect on the mother's experience with continuing the parent-child activity from the prior visit; and agree on what will happen during the current visit. For the lesson plan, the Parent Educator will cover the following three areas using discussion, activities, and handouts: parent-child interaction, develop-centered parenting, and family well-being. In closing, the Parent Educator will review and evaluate the visit, talk about the mother's next step, and plan for the next visit.</description>
