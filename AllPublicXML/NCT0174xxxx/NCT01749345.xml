  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study of six hundred adults with type 2 diabetes, (300 White and
      300 African-American) who will be recruited from two primary care sites to determine how
      social determinants of health impact diabetes outcomes. The first aim is to investigate the
      role of psychosocial factors and SES on diabetes care processes and outcomes. The second aim
      is to investigate the influence of community and neighborhood characteristics on diabetes
      care processes and outcomes. Finally, we will examine the contribution of social determinants
      of health to ethnic differences in diabetes care processes and outcomes. Clinical and
      metabolic measures will be abstracted from the electronic medical records. Outcome variables
      include hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, LDL-Cholesterol and quality of life.
