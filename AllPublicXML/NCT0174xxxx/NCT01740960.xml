  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of phase I Namisol® study (Klumpers et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2012), implicate
      that Namisol® may have a favorable PK and PD characteristics and is safe to use in people.
      However, the study included only young adults with a mean age of 21.4 years. In a previous
      THC study, subjects age has been associated with treatment response and tolerance of adverse
      reactions. This association was not supported by Lane et al. and Volicer et al.

      There is concern about the safety and tolerability of THC in the elderly population. This is
      because, elderly persons in general have higher risk of adverse drug reactions due to a
      combination of physiological factors such as decreasing in lean body mass, the reduction of
      renal and hepatic clearance, and medical comorbidity which can lead to polypharmacy and
      drug-drug interactions. Therefore, data from the phase I trial cannot be translated directly
      to an elderly (and likely more vulnerable) population. This makes it important to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability profiles of different Namisol® doses in the elderly. In our study
      in progress &quot;Delta-THC in Behavioral Disturbances in Dementia&quot;, the Namisol® doses of 0,75 mg
      and 1,5 mg are, until now, well tolerated by elderly subjects. These doses are, however, very
      low in comparison with the doses used in phase I study with young adults (5 mg, 6,5 mg and 8
      mg). The current study on the safety and tolerability of relatively high doses of Namisol®
      will help us in the future to provide broad advice on the therapeutic index and safety
      profile of Namisol® in the elderly population.

      Subjects will visit the site 5 times. The first visit, is a 2 hour screening visit for
      eligibility in which volunteers after signing informed consent will have a medical history,
      physical examination, ECG, hematological and biochemical blood tests, Mini Mental State
      Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression scale (GDS-30) and body sway test.

      Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive three doses Namisol® (3 mg or 5 mg or
      6,5 mg) and placebo in double-blind crossover design (visit 1 to 4). The wash-out period
      between visits will be at least 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 weeks. Each visit will be preceded
      by baseline assessment measures. The safety and tolerability profiles of Namisol® will be
      evaluated on each intervention visit by using a standardized THC adverse effects checklist
      and self-reporting, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, body sway, Visual Analogue Scales (subtest
      feeling high), and Test for Attentional Performance (TAP, subtest alertness) and a follow up
      phone call the following day. Four blood samples will be collected on each visit to determine
      the relationship between the pharmacodynamic effects (VAS-feeling high, TAP-alertness and
      body sway) and the plasma concentrations of THC and its active metabolites 11‐OH‐THC and
      THC-COOH. In addition, a blood sample will be only collected on the first intervention day
      for genotyping of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.

    <description>On each intervention visit the body sway will be assessed by using the SwayStar®.The SwayStar® device consists of 2 digitally-based angular velocity transducers and is worn on the lower back (at the level of the lumbar spine, lumbar 2-3). It is a wireless device, which makes it possible to examine subjects‟ balance while walking. The transducers can accurately assess angular movement and angular velocities in 2 directions: anterior-posterior (pitch plane) and mediolateral (roll plane)</description>

    <description>On each intervention visit the alertness of subjects will be measured by using the TAP. The TAP subtest &quot;Alertness&quot; measures the subject's ability to respond to a visual stimulus and to increase the attentional level in expectance of a stimulus of high priority. The computer-assisted test is given under 2 conditions: (1) Simple reaction time to a visual stimulus (Greek cross) appearing at randomly varying intervals on the monitor screen is measured. (2) In the second condition, the visual stimulus (= critical stimulus) is preceded by a cue sound presented as warning tone.</description>
