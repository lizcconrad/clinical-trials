      The purpose of this study if to determine the specific contributions of energy intake and
      energy expenditure to changes in body weight and fat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Changes in body weight and fat will be positively associated with increases in total
           energy intake.

        2. Changes in body weight and fat will be positively associated with decreases in total
           energy expenditure.
