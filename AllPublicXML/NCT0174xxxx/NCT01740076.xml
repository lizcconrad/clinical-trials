      The present study examines the effect of a whole soy food, soy nuts (dry roasted soybeans),
      added to the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change diet on blood pressure, lipids, inflammation and
      menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal hypertensive and normotensive women in a randomized
      crossover trial during an 8-week period. We sought to determine whether dietary soy had an
      additional benefit to the currently recommended heart healthy diet.

    <description>25 g of soy nuts provided daily to the subjects and they were counseled to replace 25 g of protein in their therapeutic lifestyle change (TLC) diet with the soy. TLC diet consisted of 30% of energy from total fat (&lt;7% saturated fat, 12% monounsaturated fat and 11% polyunsaturated fat), 15% from protein and 55% from carbohydrate; less than 200 mg of cholesterol per day and 1200 mg of calcium and 2 fatty fish meals per week. Those ingesting suboptimal dietary calcium were given calcium carbonate supplementation.</description>
