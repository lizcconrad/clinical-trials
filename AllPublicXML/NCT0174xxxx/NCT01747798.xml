    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies auranofin in treating patients with epithelial ovarian,
      primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Immunosuppressive therapy, such as auranofin,
      may be an effective treatment for epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a 10-patient pilot study in asymptomatic
      ovarian cancer patients with cancer antigen (CA 125) elevation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether oral gold therapy either stabilizes or lowers the CA 125 level and
      maintains patients in an asymptomatic state and to provide descriptive data on tumor response
      and duration of response.

      II. To acquire qualitative data on patients' perceptions of learning of CA 125 elevation.

      III. To explore whether immunohistochemical staining for PKC iota expression in resected
      tumor samples appears to be associated with clinical outcomes with auranofin.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
             fallopian cancer from any previous time point

          -  Completion of initial therapy of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian
             cancer from any previous time point (includes completion of surgery and/or followed by
             post-operative chemotherapy including maintenance) with no subsequent treatment for
             progressive disease

          -  An increase in serum CA 125 level, as defined as follows: 1) normalization of the CA
             125 during first-line chemotherapy followed by an increase of &gt;= 100 units/mL; OR 2)
             normalization of the CA 125 during first-line chemotherapy followed by a doubling of
             the CA 125 beyond the upper limit of normal with a confirmatory measurement within a
             period of 4 weeks or less that shows the same or higher CA 125 level

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1, or 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease, which in the judgment

             the opinion, of the treating oncologist are a direct result of cancer recurrence;

             and new abdominal pain)
