    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in Pain Severity Assessed Using an 11-point Likert Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period (Maintenance Period lasts 12 weeks ± 5 days after an up to 7 weeks Titration Period)</time_frame>
    <description>An 11-Point Likert Scale was used to assess patients' average daily pain. The subject rated his/her average pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever experienced).
The average pain experienced in the last 7 days was calculated by the mean of the daily Likert Pain Scores within the 7 days prior to the respective visit (ie, Likert Pain Scores with a date of assessment before the date of visit and on or after the date of visit - 7 days). A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period (Maintenance Period lasts 12 weeks ± 5 days after up to 7 weeks Titration Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) (Peto et al, 1998) is a self-administered questionnaire that provides a reliable measure of overall health status. The PDQ-8 contains 8 items of daily living, with 1 item selected from each of the following 8 scales: mobility, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), emotional well being, stigma, social support, cognitions, communication, and bodily discomfort. The total PDQ-8 score is the sum of all the individual items converted to a summary index score between 0 and 100, with lower scores indicating better health. A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the 7-Item Depression Subscore of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period (Maintenance Period lasts 12 weeks ± 5 days after up to 7 weeks Titration Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) is a 14-item self-assessment scale for detecting states of depression and anxiety in the setting of a hospital medical outpatient clinic. It comprises a 7-item anxiety subscale and a 7-item depressive subscale that are also measures of severity of the emotional disorder. The 14 items are scored between 0 and 3. The 7-item depression subscore and 7-item anxiety subscore were calculated as the sum of the 7 corresponding individual scores. A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period (Maintenance Period lasts 12 weeks ± 5 days after up to 7 weeks Titration Period)</time_frame>
    <description>Part II of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses the subject's activities of daily living. Part III assesses motor function. The UPDRS is completed by questioning the subject about his/her general state in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee) since the previous visit. Part II is subject-rated and Part III is physician-rated. The UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living) consists of 13 items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score was calculated as the sum of these 13 individual scores. The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) consists of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score was calculated as sum of these 27 individual scores. The sum score of UPDRS Parts II and III is the sum of the corresponding single sum scores. A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the 7 Domain Scores of Classification of Pain in Parkinson's Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period (Maintenance Period lasts 12 weeks ± 5 days after up to 7 weeks Titration Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The classification of pain in Parkinson's disease scale classifies pain in the following domains: musculoskeletal pain (item 1), chronic pain (items 2 and 3), fluctuation related pain (items 4, 5 and 6), nocturnal pain (items 7 and 8), oro-facial pain (items 9, 10 and 11), discoloration; edema/swelling (items 12 and 13), and radicular pain (item 14). Severity of the pain is measured on a scale from none (0) to severe (3) and frequency is measured on a scale from never (0) to very frequent (4).
A score of a single item was calculated by multiplying severity with frequency. A domain score was calculated as the sum of every individual score related to the respective domain. A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

Placebo: Placebo patches matched the size of active patches 20 cm^2, 30 cm^2, or 40 cm^2 and contained Placebo. Application of Placebo patches started at the Baseline Visit. Placebo patches were administered once daily starting with the equivalent of 4 mg / 24 h. Doses were then up-titrated in weekly equivalents to 2 mg / 24 h until either optimal dose or maximum dose was reached. The maximum dose was the equivalent to 16 mg / 24 h. The duration of the Titration Period varied from 1 to 7 weeks. The Maintenance Period lasted 12 weeks ± 5 days. During the De-Escalation Period, the dose of Placebo was decreased by the equivalent to 2 mg / 24 h every other day. The De-Escalation Period might have lasted up to 12 days.</description>

Rotigotine was administered once daily starting at 4 mg / 24 h. Doses were then up-titrated in weekly increments of 2 mg / 24 h until optimal or maximum dose (16 mg / 24 h) was reached and the Maintenance Period could be started. The duration of the Titration Period varied from 1 to 7 weeks ± 3 days. The Maintenance Period lasted 12 weeks ± 5 days. Thereafter, during the De-Escalation Period, the dose of study medication was decreased by 2 mg / 24 h every other day. The De-Escalation Period might have lasted up to 12 days.</description>

        <description>An 11-Point Likert Scale was used to assess patients' average daily pain. The subject rated his/her average pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever experienced).
The average pain experienced in the last 7 days was calculated by the mean of the daily Likert Pain Scores within the 7 days prior to the respective visit (ie, Likert Pain Scores with a date of assessment before the date of visit and on or after the date of visit – 7 days). A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The 8-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) (Peto et al, 1998) is a self-administered questionnaire that provides a reliable measure of overall health status. The PDQ-8 contains 8 items of daily living, with 1 item selected from each of the following 8 scales: mobility, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), emotional well being, stigma, social support, cognitions, communication, and bodily discomfort. The total PDQ-8 score is the sum of all the individual items converted to a summary index score between 0 and 100, with lower scores indicating better health. A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the 7-Item Anxiety Subscore of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</title>
        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) is a 14-item self-assessment scale for detecting states of depression and anxiety in the setting of a hospital medical outpatient clinic. It comprises a 7-item anxiety subscale and a 7-item depressive subscale that are also measures of severity of the emotional disorder. The 14 items are scored between 0 and 3. The 7-item depression subscore and 7-item anxiety subscore were calculated as the sum of the 7 corresponding individual scores. A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the 7 Domain Scores of Classification of Pain in Parkinson's Disease</title>
        <description>The classification of pain in Parkinson’s disease scale classifies pain in the following domains: musculoskeletal pain (item 1), chronic pain (items 2 and 3), fluctuation related pain (items 4, 5 and 6), nocturnal pain (items 7 and 8), oro-facial pain (items 9, 10 and 11), discoloration; edema/swelling (items 12 and 13), and radicular pain (item 14). Severity of the pain is measured on a scale from none (0) to severe (3) and frequency is measured on a scale from never (0) to very frequent (4).
A score of a single item was calculated by multiplying severity with frequency. A domain score was calculated as the sum of every individual score related to the respective domain. A negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

          <description>Placebo Transdermal Patches
Placebo: Placebo patches matched the size of active patches 20 cm^2, 30 cm^2, or 40 cm^2 and contained Placebo. Application of Placebo patches started at the Baseline Visit. Placebo patches were administered once daily starting with the equivalent of 4 mg / 24 h. Doses were then up-titrated in weekly equivalents to 2 mg / 24 h until either optimal dose or maximum dose was reached. The maximum dose was the equivalent to 16 mg / 24 h. The duration of the Titration Period varied from 1 to 7 weeks. The Maintenance Period lasted 12 weeks ± 5 days. During the De-Escalation Period, the dose of Placebo was decreased by the equivalent to 2 mg / 24 h every other day. The De-Escalation Period might have lasted up to 12 days.</description>

Rotigotine: Patches contained 4 mg / 24 h (20 cm^2), 6 mg/ 24 h (30 cm^2), or 8 mg /24 h (40 cm^2) of Rotigotine. Application of study medication started at the Baseline Visit. Rotigotine was administered once daily starting at 4 mg / 24 h. Doses were then up-titrated in weekly increments of 2 mg / 24 h until optimal or maximum dose (16 mg / 24 h) was reached and the Maintenance Period could be started. The duration of the Titration Period varied from 1 to 7 weeks ± 3 days. The Maintenance Period lasted 12 weeks ± 5 days. Thereafter, during the De-Escalation Period, the dose of study medication was decreased by 2 mg / 24 h every other day. The De-Escalation Period might have lasted up to 12 days.</description>
