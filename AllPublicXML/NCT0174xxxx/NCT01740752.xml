      Uniting Couples in the treatment of Anorexia Nervosa (UCAN2) is a collaborative treatment
      research study between the University of North Carolina (UNC) Eating Disorders Program and
      the UNC Department of Psychology and is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.
      The study examines two comprehensive treatments as couples face the challenges of anorexia
      nervosa (AN). The program helps patients with AN and their partners address AN symptoms and
      unique stresses that AN places on the romantic relationship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No single, conventional treatment has been shown to significantly benefit adults with AN,
      which ranks among the leading causes of disability and premature death in young women. The
      investigators propose to test the hypothesis that a novel, couple-based intervention
      developed for adult AN (UCAN) significantly enhances treatment outcome and reduces risk of
      relapse compared with treatment conducted entirely on an individual basis, the standard mode
      of treatment delivery in the community. The investigators plan to compare UCAN with
      individual treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). All participants with AN will
      receive a common set of core interventions, including medical management, nutrition
      counseling, and a base level of individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), with
      randomization either to: 1) UCAN couple-based intervention or 2) a higher &quot;dose&quot; of
      individual CBT. The partners are involved in varying ways and to varying degrees in
      treatment. In addition, progress will be followed for one year after completion of active
      treatment.

    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index (BMI) from baseline through 12 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>BMI is measured at baseline, weekly during the first 6 months (while in active treatment), and at each time point through 12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that the study is using to track weight changes throughout the course of the study. In AN, weight loss indicates the severity of the disease and weight gain is associated with recovery. Therefore, BMI is used to track progress in recovery.</description>

    <time_frame>The EDE is assessed at baseline and each time point from end-treatment through the 12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE measures the frequency in which a patient engages in behaviors indicative of an eating disorder over a 28 day period.</description>

    <measure>Relationship satisfaction as measured with the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) and DAS-4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 month follow-up. Also, all patients and partners in the UCAN + CBT group only rate relationship satisfaction weekly (up to 23 weeks) during active treatment.</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Cost effectiveness is measured at each time point from 3 month follow-up to 12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The cost effectiveness ratio will be calculated using utilization data from the McKnight Follow-up of Eating Disorders (MFED).</description>

    <description>This condition includes 22 UCAN sessions and 22 CBT sessions, totaling 44 psychotherapy sessions. UCAN is a manualized, 22-session Cognitive Behavioral Couple Therapy (CBCT) intervention that engages the couple to target the core psychopathology of AN and address the uniquely challenging stress that AN places on intimate relationships. The CBT proposed for this study is a 22 session adaptation of the manualized intervention that has been employed successfully as an outpatient post-hospitalization therapy and in an National Institute of Mental Health multisite study of fluoxetine with elements from the CBT manual used in McIntosh et al (PubMed 15800147).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this condition, participants will receive a higher &quot;dose&quot; of individual CBT, with 44 total sessions. Our experience with patients in the pilot strongly suggests that a higher dose of CBT will allow for further, fruitful discussion and exploration of key individual issues and is unlikely to be experienced as diluted or a slow approach to treatment. Most of these patients have complicated histories, long-standing eating disorders, and complex comorbid conditions.</description>
