      The general objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ophthalmic
      intravitreal injections of ALG-1001 in human subjects with wet age-related macular
      degeneration (Wet AMD). This study builds upon the safety and efficacy results of numerous
      animal studies and an earlier Phase I Human Study in end-stage diabetic macular edema
      patients.

      The general objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ophthalmic
      intravitreal injections of ALG-1001 in human subjects with wet age-related macular
      degeneration (Wet AMD). This study builds upon the safety and efficacy results of numerous
      animal studies and an earlier Phase I Human Study in end-stage diabetic macular edema
      patients.

      The specific objective of this six-month study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      three monthly ophthalmic intravitreal injections of ALG-1001 in human subjects with Wet AMD,
      and to follow these subjects for an additional four months off-treatment. Three cohorts have
      been established as part of the study design, utilizing three different doses.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is observation of dose limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose. The determination will be made by ocular adverse events by standard clinical ophthalmic evaluation, visual acuity changes at baseline by slit lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry, indirect ophthalmoscopy/ fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, OCT (optical coherence tomography) central macular thickness.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, 50 years of age or older.

          2. Active wet macular degeneration (AMD).

          3. Subfoveal CNV (choroidal neovascular membrane) secondary to AMD in the study eye less
             than or equal to 12 MPS disc areas.

          4. CNV greater than 50% of lesion area.

          5. CNV may be classic, minimally classic, or occult.

          6. For minimally classic and occult lesions in the study eye, must demonstrate decrease
             in BCVA (best corrected visual acuity) that must be assessed based on clinical
             exploration, macular thickening, presence of subretinal fluid or hemorrhage, and/or
             OCT findings consistent with CNV.

          7. Study eye has a BCVA of 20/50 to 20/320 ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
             Study )equivalent (65 letters to 23 letters), which in the opinion of the investigator
             is primarily due to Wet AMD.

          8. Decrease in BCVA must be assessed based on clinical exploration, macular thickening,
             and/or fluorescein angiography consistent with CNV.

          9. Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP) is under control, IOP ≤ 25 mm.

         10. Willing and able to return for all study visits.

             screening window.

             histoplasmosis syndrome), angioid streaks, choroidal rupture or multifocal choroiditis
             in the study eye.

          4. RPE (retinal pigment epithelium) rip or tear in the study eye.

          5. Patients with current or prior retinal detachments, retinal tears, or tractional
             detachments in either eye.

          6. A history of cataract surgery complications/vitreous loss in the study eye.

          7. A history of penetrating ocular trauma in the study eye.

          8. Chronic or recurrent uveitis.

          9. Has undergone a vitrectomy (anterior or pars plana) in the study eye.

         10. Ongoing ocular infection or inflammation in either eye.

         11. A history of intravitreal injections of any type in the study eye within the last 45
             days prior to study enrollment.

         12. A history of cataract surgery complications/vitreous loss in the study eye.

         13. Congenital malformations in the study eye.

         14. Mentally handicapped.

         15. Pregnant or a nursing female.

         16. Currently participating in any other clinical research study
