      1. (Primary) To compare the effectiveness of a patient guided choice of care using a
           patient decision support tool to clinical guided care within a novel care process for
           non-specific low back pain.

           (We hypothesize that the patient guided choice model will demonstrate significant
           improvements when compared to the clinician guided care approach)

        2. (Secondary) To qualitatively investigate which components of the patient choice
           educational methods were most effective for informed decision making among patients who
           participate in the patient guided choice of care approach (We hypothesize that dialogue
           method of patient guided choice will be identified as most useful)

      The purpose of this research study proposal is to evaluate patient choice within this
      physical therapist-led model for non-specific low back pain. Evidence exists that patients
      are eager to play an active role in decisions concerning their health. Recent evidence from
      research supports the benefit of decision aides for consumers, especially those that were
      accurate and refined to the specific problems of each patient. In our proposed randomized
      controlled trial (RCT), one group of patients in the study will have the opportunity to drive
      choices within their healthcare model; but only after receiving useful information on what
      the consequences of their selections will be. Patients will receive decision making
      information to assist in making an informed choice. The structured information will organize
      known results from the research literature to assist patients in understanding the likely
      outcome of their condition and what they need to adequately manage their own care. The
      control group of patients will receive the Physical therapist-directed care model that is
      presently used and has shown success. Patient outcomes will involve patient self report of
      improvement and whether or not the patient pursued care for the same condition over a 1 year
      period of time.

    <description>The experimental group will consist of typical care from the physical therapist (as with the control group) with the addition of the patient decision support tool and information dissemination. The process of information dissemination for informed decision making. Based on the literature, we have deemed three points of informational contact as necessary to improve informed decision making. We plan to inform patients through the use of a) pre-material, b) dialogue, and c) reinforcement means.</description>

    <description>A control group will receive typical care from the physical therapist. Typical care includes physical therapist directed care of patients with low back pain, using standardized treatment algorithms (guideline oriented) for referral to physicians during cases of concern. In this model, a physician is consulted when the physical therapists feel it is necessary; or when directly requested by a patient. Physician consult is not normally provided as an option for the control group, unless evidence exists within the examination to suggest the need from a mutually agreed upon examination scheme including identification of red flags between the PT and physician. In the current model, because most of patients seen are diagnosed with non-specific LBP and do not require imaging or prescriptive medications, a majority are treated actively by the physical therapists-only during the initial visit.</description>
