  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are only little data on the risk of chronic complaints (pain and discomfort) following
      open non-mesh sutured repairs of small umbilical or epigastric hernias. Our primary and
      secondary endpoints were long-term pain and discomfort at rest, respectively and thirdly
      recurrence. The setup was a retrospective two-centre study including patients â‰¥18 years
      undergoing primary elective open non-mesh sutured umbilical or epigastric hernia repairs. The
      survey included questions on suspicion of recurrence, reoperation for recurrence (if yes
      patients were examined by a consultant in patients home), pain, discomfort, work, and leisure
      activities. We analysed 295 consecutive patients through a non-validated structured
      questionnaire.
