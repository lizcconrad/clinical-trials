  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of Cisplatin and S-1 (CS) achieved a response rate of approximately 45% with
      the PFS being around 6 months and overall survival time being 13 months in Japanese and
      Chinese gastric patients. It remains unclear whether the addition of docetaxel to CS would
      further enhance the efficacy as it dose in DCF(docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil). This
      is a single center, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of docetaxel, cisplatin
      and S-1 (DCS) as first line chemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric and
      gastroesophageal junction cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm trial. All Patients will receive up to 6 cycles of triple chemotherapy
      with docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1. Given the severe toxicity of DCF regimen, here the total
      dose of docetaxel and cisplatin is both reduced to 60mg/m2. For patients with CR/PR/SD
      disease after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, maintenance therapy with S-1 are recommended.
      Antitumor activity will be evaluated every two cycles according to RECIST1.1.
