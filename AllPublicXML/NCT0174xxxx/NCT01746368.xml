      Objectives: The objectives of the pilot study were to (1) test the feasibility of
      recruitment, randomization, and retention; (2) test the feasibility of a standardized
      Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention; (3) evaluate the feasibility of the
      assessment process and data collection procedures; (4) evaluate the Veterans' satisfaction
      with the intervention and their Advance Directive decisions; and (5) evaluate preliminary
      effects of the Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention.

      Research Design: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded pilot study.
      Alabama Veterans who received care through the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center were randomized
      to either the Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention or Care-as-Usual in a 2:1
      ratio respectively. Data related to recruitment, randomization, and retention; study
      completion by subjects; completeness of data collection; Veterans' satisfaction; and
      preliminary effects of the intervention were collected, analyzed, and evaluated. The length
      of the study was one year.

      Methods: The setting for the study was Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center care sites. A convenience
      sample of fifty subjects was recruited from Tuscaloosa VA outpatient clinics including Selma,
      residential settings, Home Based Primary Care, and the Mobile Health Unit. The level of care
      of subjects was all-inclusive, excepting current Hospice or Palliative Care. Selection
      procedures included self-referral and referral by Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center staff. Entry
      requirements were the meeting of all inclusion criteria and verification of no exclusion
      criteria. The Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention was a manualized education,
      support, and guidance session provided by a Registered Nurse that included information about
      risks, benefits, and alternatives of specific choices. The Care-as-Usual was a session with
      the social worker who explained what the Advance Directive is, and guided the Veteran
      regarding the process of completing the Advance Directive document, without providing
      information about risks, benefits, and alternatives of specific choices. Study enrollment
      period was six months. The primary study outcome measure was Advance Directive completion
      rate. This pilot was not a hypothesis testing study. The underlying hypothesis of the
      eventual full study is that the Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention is
      associated with Advance Directive completion rates at least comparable to that of the
      As-Usual care.

      Significance: This study supports the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mission to provide
      Veteran-centered care. It provides important information needed to plan a full study of the
      effectiveness of a specific Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention to facilitate
      Advance Directive completion by rural Alabama Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The VHA mission to serve the health care needs of America's veterans assumes a
      veteran-centered approach - one that evolves not only from the health team's assessment of
      needs, but especially one that begins with the veteran's assessment of his or her own needs.
      Preliminary data from the Alabama Veterans Rural Health Initiative study suggest that
      approximately 30% of rural Alabama veterans do not have an Advance Directive and want help
      completing one. Rural Alabama veterans live in counties with a higher percent of African
      American minorities, lower levels of education, and higher family poverty rates, than the
      average for the US population at large. Prior studies have demonstrated that disparities in
      Advance Directive completion rates may be related to race, level of income, and level of
      education. VHA research priorities include addressing the challenges of minority health care
      needs and the disparities that arise in healthcare delivery. Although many studies evidence
      the effectiveness of education and counseling in facilitating Advance Directive completion,
      data are lacking that demonstrate the efficacy of resource-conservative nursing interventions
      to enable Advance Directive completion by rural, southern minorities. This pilot lays the
      groundwork to address this evidence gap.

      Objectives:

      The objectives of the pilot study were to (1) test the feasibility of recruitment,
      randomization, and retention; (2) test the feasibility of a standardized Nurse-Supported
      Advance Care Planning Intervention; (3) evaluate the feasibility of the assessment process
      and data collection procedures; (4) evaluate the Veterans' satisfaction with the intervention
      and their Advance Directive decisions; and (5) evaluate preliminary effects of the
      Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention.

      Methods:

      A prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study. Fifty Alabama veterans who receive care at
      the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center were randomized to either the Nurse-Supported Advance Care
      Planning Intervention or Care-as-Usual. The Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning
      Intervention was a manualized education, support, and guidance session provided by a
      Registered Nurse that included information about risks, benefits, and alternatives of
      specific choices. The Care-as-Usual was a session with the social worker who explained what
      the Advance Directive is, and guided the Veteran regarding the process of completing the
      Advance Directive document, without providing information about risks, benefits, and
      alternatives of specific choices. Data related to recruitment, randomization, and retention;
      study completion by subjects; completeness of data collection; Veterans' satisfaction; and
      preliminary effects of the intervention were collected, analyzed, and evaluated.

      Status:

      The Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) has approved this study.
      Study is closed.

    <description>Score on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8). The overall score is produced by summing all item responses. For the CSQ-8, scores range from 8 to 32, with higher values indicating higher satisfaction.
Response options differ from item to item, but all are based on a four-point scale.
All items are positively worded; however, the directionality of response options span the spectrum from very negative to very positive; and, the numerical anchors for items are reversed randomly (from high to low or low to high) from item to item to minimize stereotypic response sets. The CSQ-8 has no subscales and reports a single score measuring a single dimension of overall satisfaction.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Male or female

          -  Any race or ethnic origin

          -  19 years of age (i.e. minors are excluded)

          -  Veteran indicates he/she has no Advance Directive

          -  Speaks and understands English

          -  Any category of rurality through urbanity of home residence or place of habitation

          -  Veteran is willing to extend the screening/baseline visit or return within 30 days for
             the advance care planning (ACP) session

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of dementia (all causes) or other cognitive disorder documented in
             computerized patient record system problem list. (Note: this would include, for
             example, a mental disability that precludes informed consent capacity, e.g. a
             documented condition including an age level equivalency understanding of a child of
             age 6)

          -  Diagnosis of serious mental illness (i.e. schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
             bipolar I, major depression with psychotic features) documented in computerized
             patient record system problem list

          -  Actively considering plans of suicide or homicide per self report during screening
             interview direct question

          -  Psychotic symptoms that impair the subject's ability to give informed consent

          -  Current hospice care or palliative care recipient. (Note: The major predicted
             potential impact of this intervention is for Veterans who typically receive little or
             no ACP support. Veterans who receive palliative care/hospice care at Tuscaloosa VA
             Medical Center (VAMC) typically receive timely and full ACP support including Advance
             Directive completion support if desired. Veterans receiving palliative care and
             hospice care at Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center may tire easily and/or have
             pain/discomfort problems that could easily be exacerbated by research procedures.
             These research procedures themselves have the potential to add to end of life
             distress.)

        <title>Satisfaction</title>
        <description>Score on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8). The overall score is produced by summing all item responses. For the CSQ-8, scores range from 8 to 32, with higher values indicating higher satisfaction.
Response options differ from item to item, but all are based on a four-point scale.
All items are positively worded; however, the directionality of response options span the spectrum from very negative to very positive; and, the numerical anchors for items are reversed randomly (from high to low or low to high) from item to item to minimize stereotypic response sets. The CSQ-8 has no subscales and reports a single score measuring a single dimension of overall satisfaction.</description>

            <description>The Care-as-Usual was a session with the social worker who explained what the Advance Directive is, and guided the Veteran regarding the process of completing the Advance Directive document, without providing information about risks, benefits, and alternatives of specific choices. Subjects in this arm who desired information about risks, benefits, and alternatives of specific choices before randomization were scheduled for the Care-as-Usual session after they received that information from the Primary Care Provider.</description>

          <title>Satisfaction</title>
          <description>Score on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8). The overall score is produced by summing all item responses. For the CSQ-8, scores range from 8 to 32, with higher values indicating higher satisfaction.
Response options differ from item to item, but all are based on a four-point scale.
All items are positively worded; however, the directionality of response options span the spectrum from very negative to very positive; and, the numerical anchors for items are reversed randomly (from high to low or low to high) from item to item to minimize stereotypic response sets. The CSQ-8 has no subscales and reports a single score measuring a single dimension of overall satisfaction.</description>
