    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together
      with floxuridine in treating patients with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal cavity, or
      fallopian tube cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Veliparib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as floxuridine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving veliparib together with floxuridine may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of ABT-888 (veliparib) and
      intraperitoneal (IP) floxuridine in adult patients with advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal
      or fallopian tube cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event profile associated with this treatment combination.

      II. To assess for preliminary evidence of efficacy, such as tumor responses, of the treatment
      combination.

      III. To assess progression free survival (PFS) in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cohort.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-888 and floxuridine when given in combination.

      II. Assess whether the presence of mutations in the homologous recombination pathway or loss
      of expression of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components correlates with response to
      floxuridine + ABT-888.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 and floxuridine IP on
      days 3-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.

             malignancy that is metastatic and for which standard curative measures do not exist

          -  Disease confined to the intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal cavity; Note: nodal
             disease below the diaphragm, implants adherent to the surface of the liver or
             intrahepatic lesions will not be exclusionary; patients remain eligible if all
             intrahepatic tumor is debulked or ablated by the time treatment is initiated

             tissue acquisition at the time of port placement; note: if an intraperitoneal catheter
