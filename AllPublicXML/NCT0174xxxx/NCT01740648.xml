      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib when given together
      with fluorouracil and radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients with stage II-III
      rectal cancer. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving trametinib
      together with fluorouracil and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller
      and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximally tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of trametinib to be
      used in combination with 5FU (fluorouracil) and radiation in patients with rectal cancers.

      II. To determine a recommended phase II dose of trametinib to be used with 5FU chemoradiation
      in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluation of the tolerability and safety of the combination of trametinib and 5-FU
      chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer.

      II. Evaluation of post-therapy pathologic response.

      III. Evaluation of the rate of local control, disease-free survival and overall survival.

      IV. Analysis of biomarkers - total mutations in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
      homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1(BRAF), and neuroblastoma RAS
      viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS), as well as RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
      homolog 1 (AKT) pathway signaling pathways to potentially correlate with clinical benefit.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trametinib.

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -14 to -10 and 1-38 and
      fluorouracil intravenously (IV) continuously 5 days a week from days 1-38. Patients also
      undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week on days 1-33. Patients then undergo surgery 6-10
      weeks later.

      Patients achieving negative surgical margins after complete resection of tumor receive
      postoperative chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15 OR oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin
      calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then annually for 3 years.
