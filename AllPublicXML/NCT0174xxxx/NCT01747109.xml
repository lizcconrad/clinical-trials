    <textblock>
      Oro-tracheal intubation in intensive unit care(ICU) in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
      after crash induction remains a critical event.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether Nasal High Flow Therapy (HFT) Optiflow ® is
      more efficient than the face mask for preoxygenation before orotracheal intubation after
      crash induction in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure

      This study will be designed as followed : Patients will be randomized in 2 groups
      :&quot;PREOXYFLOW&quot; or &quot;STANDARD FACE MASK&quot;.

      Patients randomized in &quot;PREOXYFLOW&quot; group will received a four minutes preoxygenation period
      with Nasal High Flow Therapy (HFT) (60 l/mn FIO2 = 1) before orotracheal intubation under
      laryngoscopy after crash induction. Patients randomized in &quot;STANDARD FACE MASK&quot; group will
      received a four minutes preoxygenation period with standard face mask (15 l/mn) before
      orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash induction
