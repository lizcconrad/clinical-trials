      Polyphenols may have several favourable effects on health. Dark chocolate (DC) is one of the
      highest sources of polyphenols in foods. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of
      polyphenol-rich dark chocolate on insulin sensitivity in normal weight and overweight adults.
      Seventy four volunteers with no history of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases or diabetes
      will be recruited. Participants will randomly receive 20g daily of one of the two different
      types of DC: Placebo DC (low in polyphenols) or DC rich in polyphenols (500mg) for a period
      of four weeks. Participants will be asked to make two appointments to the university clinical
      lab. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist circumference), blood and saliva
      samples will be taken during each of the 2 visits. Compliance will be tested by the measure
      of total polyphenols in a 24-hour urine sample in some random samples before and at the end
      of the intervention. To monitor any fluctuations in the participants' diet or physical
      activity during the study period, a three-day diet diary and a physical activity
      questionnaire will be collected before the start of the study and after four weeks. Data will
      be analysed with an ANCOVA with time (pre- and post-) and treatment (DC and placebo) as
      between-subject factor.
