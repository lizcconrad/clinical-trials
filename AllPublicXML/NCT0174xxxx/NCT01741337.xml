      The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of an early treatment of
      sleep-disordered breathing by adaptive servo-ventilation in heart failure patient following
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery or other coronary reperfusion.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a pilot study, on patients with central sleep apneas syndrome and
      heart failure, undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery or other coronary reperfusion,
      and then randomized for the adaptive servo-ventilation treatment application or not after
      surgery.

      The first objective is to evaluate the effect of an early treatment of sleep-disordered
      breathing by adaptive servo-ventilation in heart failure patient, in terms of ventricular
      recovery (ejection fraction improvement). This treatment will be instaurated just after
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery or other coronary reperfusion.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Assessment of adaptive servo-ventilation effect on the endothelial function, the
           systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, the insulin resistance, after the surgery in
           comparison with non treated patient with heart failure and central sleep apneas.

        -  Assessment of the impact of nocturnal desaturation level on the vascular reactivity and
           atherosclerosis of mammary vessels collected only during coronary artery bypass graft
           surgery.

        -  Assessment of the impact of nocturnal desaturation level on the oxidative stress,
           inflammation and insulin sensitivity on abdominal and epicardiac adipose tissue
           collected during surgery.
