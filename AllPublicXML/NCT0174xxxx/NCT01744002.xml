  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether treatment directed at the neck and
      shoulder is more beneficial than treatment directed solely at the shoulder; for patients with
      shoulder impingement syndrome.

      (The hypothesis is that patients who receive neck mobilization will improve at a more
      significant rate than those who do not receive neck mobilization)

    <textblock>
      All treatment will be provided by licensed physical therapist within the United States. The
      clinicians affiliated with this study have experience in data collection and have
      participated in a recent trial that was sponsored by Walsh University.

      At baseline, after consent for the study, patients will be randomized into two groups: 1)
      shoulder treatment and active mobilization to the neck and 2) shoulder treatment and placebo
      mobilization to the neck. Baseline data will be collected including all self-report measures.

      Both groups will receive shoulder treatment with an emphasis on 1) range of motion
      activities, 2) joint mobilization, 3) rotator cuff strengthening and 4) a home exercise
      program that consists of shoulder strengthening exercises. The active neck group will receive
      UPA's to the cervical spine; applied as 3 X 30 seconds, to each comparable (stiff or painful)
      segment. The physical therapist will place their hands on the neck of the patient for the
      placebo group but will not perform the oscillations that are characteristic of mobilization.

      All patients will receive a home program designed to increase range of motion and strength.
      None of the home program focused exercises will be targeted to the neck. The shoulder
      exercises will be tailored to each specific patient and will not be standardized.

      Patients will be treated for the duration of their care using the same foci (1) range of
      motion activities, 2) joint mobilization, 3) rotator cuff strengthening and 4) a home
      exercise program that consists of shoulder strengthening exercises). The length of the
      treatment will be determined by the progress of the patient and by the attending therapist.

    <description>The QuickDASH is a shortened version of the DASH Outcome Measure. Instead of 30 items, the QuickDASH uses 11 items to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any or multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The tool has been validated and has similar psychometric properties to the DASH</description>

    <measure>Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of the treatment which is on average 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS will be used to capture the patient's level of pain. Patients will be asked to indicate the intensity of current, best, and worst levels of pain over the past 24 hours, using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; The average of the 3 ratings will be used to represent the patient's level of pain over the previous 24 hours.</description>

    <measure>Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of the treatment which is on average 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PASS is the symptom state in which the patients feel that their current well-being is acceptable. The question is dichotomous (yes or no)</description>
