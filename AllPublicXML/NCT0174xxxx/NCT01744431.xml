      Can thrombin generation measurement predict the risk of venous thromboembolism in acute ill
      patients

      Traditional coagulation tests do not assess the whole coagulation system. Thrombin generation
      assays measure the ability of plasma sample to generate thrombin following in vitro
      activation of coagulation. In contrast to the classical clotting assays, thrombin generation
      reflects and integrates all pro and anticoagulant reactions that regulate the formation and
      inhibition of thrombin.

      The aim of our study is to investigate whether thrombin generation would be able to predict a
      hypercoagulable state in acute ill patients admitted in the internal medical departments and
      how it correlates with the Padua prediction score, a score that could assists the risk for
      venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medical patients.

      In total 300 patients are planned for inclusion in this trial. After signing an informed
      consent a blood sample will be obtained from each participant. We will measure the thrombin
      generation over time in plasma assessed by the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT).
