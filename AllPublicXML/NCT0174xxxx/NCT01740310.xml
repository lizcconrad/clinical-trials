      The purpose of study will be to test two vaccine education strategies to learn how they
      impact flu and pertussis (Tdap) vaccination rates and attitudes regarding vaccination during
      pregnancy after participating in the intervention. The education strategies will be based on
      the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). This model is based on experimental psychology and
      has been previously used to increase breast cancer screening rates. These education
      strategies will be delivered through routine prenatal care visits to black/African-American
      women in Atlanta.

    <intervention_name>Maternal Vaccine Education</intervention_name>
    <description>It is assumed that the women will also receive vaccine education materials from the OB/GYN practices as part of routine care. The intervention for all three arms will be conducted during routine prenatal office visits. Participants will complete a baseline questionnaire to assess attitudes regarding vaccination and will then be randomized to one of three enrollment arms and will be exposed to an intervention designed to take no longer than 20 minutes, so that patients can complete it during the time they are waiting to be seen. While participants are completing the handheld/electronic tablet device-based intervention, the study recruiter will observe them and document dose exposure to the messages being presented. The enrolled women will be contacted a month after the expected date of delivery and a follow up interview will be conducted to ascertain their vaccination status for receipt of influenza vaccine in pregnancy and Tdap during pregnancy or immediately post-partum.</description>
