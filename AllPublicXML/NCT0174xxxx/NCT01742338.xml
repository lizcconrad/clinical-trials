  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a long-lasting lung disease usually caused by
      long-term smoking. COPD can get worse, making people sick enough to need hospitalization.
      Corticosteroids are very effective and are almost always used, but nobody knows the right
      dose. High doses may work better but could cause more side effects than low doses. Typical
      treatment lengths last at least one week. This study will be comparing two common regimens:
      either 40mg of corticosteroids daily (low dose), or 80mg of corticosteroids daily (high
      dose). It is unknown which regimen works better..

      The goal of the study is to determine whether a high-dose corticosteroid regimen in patients
      admitted to the hospital with COPD exacerbations is associated with better clinical outcomes
      and at acceptable risk of adverse effects compared to a low-dose corticosteroid regimen. Our
      hypothesis is that high-dose corticosteroids is associated with a decreased rate of treatment
      failure, shorter length of hospital stay, and improved quality of life with similar risk of
      adverse effects. The study population includes patients ≥ 40 years-old with a ≥ 10 pack-years
      smoking history and a diagnosis of COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis who present to the
      emergency room with increased dyspnea, increased sputum, or increased cough that requires
      admission to the hospital. We will perform a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to
      determine if a high-dose corticosteroid regimen, which is already in use in clinical
      practice, decreases treatment failure compared to a low-dose corticosteroid regimen that is
      based on national consensus guidelines.
