  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography has been unable to provide interpretable
      data of blood flow within the lung parenchyma because of air attenuation of Doppler signals.
      Recently, a transthoracic Doppler system known as the Sonara/tek Transcranial Doppler (TCD)
      System has been developed that can identify parenchymal pulmonary blood flow (PPBF) signals.
      The ability to non-invasively collect information regarding the pulmonary aspect of the
      cardio-pulmonary system may provide valuable information and new insights into the structural
      and functional characteristics of the lung parenchyma and vasculature in health and disease
      states.

      This new system was previously studied among 31 healthy volunteers and one subject with
      atrial fibrillation.1 Pulsed spectral Doppler signals were obtained over the chest wall using
      a signal processing and algorithm package in conjunction with a non-imaging Doppler device
      coupled with an electrocardiogram. Clear reproducible lung Doppler signals (LDS) originating
      from different elements and phases of cardiac activity that generate mechanical waves which
      propagate throughout the lung were expressed in pulsatile changes in ultrasound reflections.

      After the completion of the first 25 patients in our pilot study, we have received some
      valuable information. After assessing patients with CHF and pulmonary hypertension, we
      identified signals particular to the CHF group. There were unique features that were never
      observed in the normal patients. On top of the regular Lung Doppler signals seen in normal
      patients, high velocity &quot;disorganized&quot; variable signals that were not synchronous with the
      heart beat, but rather sometimes with respiration were observed. We believe that the signals
      may represent popping open of small bronchi surrounded by &quot;water filled&quot; parenchyma. These
      events that generate very strong reflector like signals may represent the movement of fluid
      at the blood vessel-alveolar air junction.
