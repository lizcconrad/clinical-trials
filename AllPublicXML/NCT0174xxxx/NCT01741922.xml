  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to investigate in patients with high blood pressure, BP, namely, those with
      systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, SBP/DBP higher than or equal to 140/90
      mmHg, and high cardiovascular risk, under treatment with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, ASA,
      whether changing the time they take the drug (same dose) to bedtime (from taking it at some
      point during the active part of the day) produces a drop in their blood pressure (mean
      systolic and diastolic over 24 hours) of at least 2.5 mm Hg; and also whether among
      non-dippers, under secondary treatment with low-dose ASA, there is be a greater decrease in
      their night BP when the drug is taken in the evening.

    <description>To evaluate the effect of evening administration of low doses of aspirin (100 mg) on the BP of hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk, comparing with the effect of day administration, we are going to measure the change in the mean SBP and DBP measured with Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) over a 24 hour period from baseline at the end of the study, five months later.</description>

    <description>Patients will be assigned in a blind and randomized way to one of two parallel groups: group I with the control treatment during the first two months, namely, administration of aspirin 100 mg, in the morning and placebo in the evening and group II initially receiving the intervention, of administration of aspirin 100 mg in the evening, between (20.00 and 22.00 hours) and placebo in the morning. After that, patients will then undergo a washout period of 15 days to one month, during which all patients participating in the study will take their ASA doses during the daytime. After the washout period, participants will exchange groups, i.e., patients randomly allocated to group I, so having taken aspirin in the morning and placebo in the evening, will now receive the intervention treatment, namely, administration of ASA in the evening and placebo in the morning for another two months and vice verse.</description>
