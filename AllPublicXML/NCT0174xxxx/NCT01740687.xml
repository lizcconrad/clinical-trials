          -  Women willing to accept the risk of pregnancy while relying on the Essure
             micro-inserts for prevention of pregnancy following a NovaSure ablation procedure for

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All exclusion criteria from the Essure Permanent Birth Control System Instructions for
             Use and/or the NovaSure Impedance Controlled Endometrial Ablation System Instructions
