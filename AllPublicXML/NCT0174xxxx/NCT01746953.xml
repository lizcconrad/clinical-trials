      We will evaluate the effect of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion on fatal and non fatal events
      according to baseline risk of death in an international cohort of trauma patients (CRASH-2
      trial). The following outcomes will be considered: death from all causes, death due to
      bleeding, death due to multiorgan failure, death due to vascular occlusive events and non
      vascular occlusive events. Non fatal outcomes include: myocardial infarction, stroke, deep
      vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

      Aims: Primary objective: Evaluate the effect of RBC transfusion on all cause mortality
      according to baseline risk of death due to bleeding. Secondary objectives: Evaluate the
      effect of RBC transfusion on specific causes of death. Evaluate the effect of RBC transfusion
      on non fatal vascular occlusive events.

      Sample: Patients from the Clinical Randomisation of an Antiﬁbrinolytic in Signiﬁcant
      Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial. The trial included 20,127 trauma patients with, or at risk of,
      significant bleeding, within 8 hours of injury, and was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40
      countries.

      Outcomes: Death from all causes, death due to bleeding, death due to multiorgan failure,
      death due to vascular occlusive events and non vascular occlusive events. Vascular occlusive
      events include: myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
      All events were measured at 28 days or hospital discharge Interventions and comparisons: We
      will compare the effect of red cells transfusion versus no red cells transfusion. We will
      also evaluate the effect of the number of units of red cells transfusion.

      Methods: We will stratify patients according to baseline risk of death from all causes into
      four strata (&lt;6%, 6%-20%, 21%-50% and &gt;50%). We will then evaluate the effect of RBC
      transfusion according to baseline risk on fatal and non fatal outcomes. Formal statistical
      test to detect heterogeneity will be conducted analyzing baseline risk as a continuous
      variable.
