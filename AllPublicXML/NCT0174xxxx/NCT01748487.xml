      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of OZURDEX (dexamethasone
      intravitreal implant) 0.7 mg administered immediately after phacoemulsification and
      intraocular lens implantation in type 1 or 2 diabetic patients to prevent the occurrence of
      post-surgical macular edema (ME).

      Treatment group: 24 patients will receive an intravitreal injection of OZURDEX at the end of
      cataract surgery Patients will be seen at 1 week pre-operatively (baseline visit), and on the
      same day post-surgery (visit 1), at 1 week (visit 2), 1 month (visit 3) and 3 months (visit
      4).

      BCVA, IOP and SD-OCT will be performed at each visit.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Type 1 or 2 diabetic patients for cataract surgery with &gt; grade 3 cataract type using
             the Lens Opacities Classification System III. Patients with onset of diabetes before
             the age of 30 years and minimal or absent endogenous insulin production were
             classified as having type 1 diabetes. The remaining patients were classified as having
             type 2 diabetes.

          2. Diabetics included must have at least level 20 (microaneurysms only) of diabetic
             retinopathy, defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).

          3. Patients must be healthy enough to undergo cataract surgery as decided by their
             physicians.

          4. Patients must be 18 years older and must be able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections including most viral
             diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, including active epithelial herpes simplex
             keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, mycobacterial infections, and
             fungal diseases.

          2. Patients with advanced glaucoma.

          3. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of this product or to other
             corticosteroids.

          4. Patients with ACIOL (Anterior Chamber Intraocular Lens) and rupture of the posterior
             lens capsule

          5. Patients who have aphakic eyes with rupture of the posterior lens capsule.

          6. Diabetic patients without any retinopathy and those with active uncontrolled
             proliferative disease will be excluded. We are excluding normal retinas of diabetics
             since we do not feel they are at particular risk for ME when compared to those who
             have some form of the disease. A grading of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is
             based on the criteria made by the ETDRS study, which includes presence of either 1/3
             optic disc neovascularization or Ã≠â√∂ optic disc area of neovascularization anywhere
             elsewhere in the retina.

          7. Patients with clinical significant macular edema (CSME) measured with OCT prior to
             surgery will be excluded.

          8. Panretinal photocoagulation within the prior 3 months or anticipated need for
             panretinal photocoagulation within the next 6 months.

          9. Patients with retinal diseases, other than diabetes, that can affect ME will be
             excluded from the study.

         10. Eyes with uveitis, a history of any other intraocular surgery or a history of
             uncontrolled glaucoma (baseline IOP higher than 21 mmHg or those using more than one
             type of glaucoma medication) or steroid responders will not be enrolled in the study.

         11. Eyes with cataract precluding proper optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement
             pre-operatively will also be excluded.

         12. Patients who will experience longer than usual operating time, complicated surgery,
             rupture of the posterior capsule, and iris or corneal burns will be managed
             accordingly but will be excluded from the study.

         13. Patients who are pregnant, breast feeding, or are unable to attend the schedules
             follow-up appointments will also be excluded
