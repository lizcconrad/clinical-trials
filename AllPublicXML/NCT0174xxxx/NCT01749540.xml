      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ACE-536 in patients with
      beta-thalassemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the proportion of β-thalassemia patients who have an erythroid response, defined
      as:

        1. a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL from baseline for ≥ 14 days (in the absence of red
           blood cell [RBC] transfusions) in non-transfusion dependent patients, or

        2. ≥ 20% reduction in RBC transfusion burden compared to pretreatment in transfusion
           dependent patients.
