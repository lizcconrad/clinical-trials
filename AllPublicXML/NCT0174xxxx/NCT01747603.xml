  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the feasibility of conducting a large randomized clinical trial
      (RCT) to examine the role of a novel, specialized follow-up clinic in preventing
      complications among late preterm infants (LPTB), born between 34 and 36 weeks gestational
      age. 1) Study Process: Success will be achieved if 80% of a target population of 100 subjects
      is met within the first 6 months of recruitment being initiated. 2) Study Resources: Success
      will be achieved if 80% of follow up appointments are scheduled in a timely manner and if
      specialized LPTB physicians in the intervention complete assessments 75% of the time in the
      allocated time frame and 3) Scientific: 95% data completeness on data collection forms will
      be identified as success

      A specialized LPTB follow-up clinic is innovative as no studies have evaluated such a
      programme and standardized follow-up and guidelines for the care of LPTB infants after
      discharge from hospital do not exist. Until recently, the incorrect assumption has been that
      these infants are healthy and have limited risks compared to term infants.

      The study's main question, in addition to assessing the feasibility of this pilot, is: &quot;Do
      differences exist in short-tem clinical and developmental outcomes among LPTB infants
      enrolled in an RCT who are randomized to a specialized LPTB follow-up programme when compared
      to infants randomized to current pragmatic management?&quot; A RCT will provide evidence for the
      development of guidelines for the follow-up of LPTB infants in the first 6 months of life to
      reduce complications, readmissions and developmental problems.

      The results of this study can be generalized to tertiary care and community hospitals and the
      general population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late preterm births comprise 70-75% of all preterm births in Ontario and 5.8% of all births
      in the province. These infants are at significant risk for complications but no guidelines or
      follow-up programmes exist for decreasing the short and long-term complications associated
      with LPTB. This project will lay the groundwork for gathering the research evidence to
      support:

        1. An RCT that will study if a specialized LPTB clinic is effective in reducing short-term
           medical and developmental complications and hospital readmissions,

        2. Development of a sustainable long-term follow-up programme supported by evidence,

        3. Development of a database to track long-term complications, with the goal of identifying
           potential risk factors earlier in late preterm infants,

        4. Creation and dissemination of Evidence-Based Guidelines, research results for frontline
           health care providers (GPs, Midwives, etc.), community hospitals and Local Health
           Integration Networks,

        5. Creation and dissemination of Parent Educational Resources for discharge of LPTB
           infants.
