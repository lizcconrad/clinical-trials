      This study aims to examine the relationship between mood and brain activity in adolescent
      girls in order to better understand the genetic and neural predictors of adolescent
      depression. The participants in this study will be healthy female adolescents aged 12-14 and
      their mothers. They will participate for a total of six months. Adolescent participants will
      have three study sessions at McLean Hospital, and during two of them, their mothers will also
      have assessments. Adolescent assessments will include interviews, questionnaires, computer
      tasks, and collection of a saliva sample for genetic analyses. Their second study visit will
      include an fMRI scan. Parent assessments will include an interview, questionnaires, and a
      computer task.

        This study will include two adult and two adolescent cohorts. The adult cohort includes two
        different groups of mothers: (a) MDD Mothers: Mothers with current or past major depressive
        disorder and (b) Healthy Control Mothers: Mothers with no history of psychopathology. The
        female adolescent cohorts are as follows: (c) High Risk Female Adolescents: Healthy female
        adolescents aged 12-14 with a mother reporting past or current MDD, (d) Healthy Female
        Adolescents: Healthy female adolescents aged 12-14 with a mother reporting no history of
        psychopathology.
