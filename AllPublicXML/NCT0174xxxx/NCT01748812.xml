    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Hypophosphatemia is a condition where a person has low levels of phosphorus in the
           blood. Low blood phosphorus can cause muscle and bone weakness (such as rickets) and
           teeth problems. One cause of the condition is having too much fibroblast growth factor
           23 (FGF23). FGF23 is a hormone that causes the kidney to get rid of phosphorus in the
           urine. It can also prevent the body from making vitamin D, which helps the body absorb
           phosphorus in food.

        -  Many people with low blood phosphorus take high doses of phosphorus and calcium
           medications. However, one side effect of these drugs is increased blood levels of
           parathyroid hormone (PTH). The drug cinacalcet can help lower PTH levels, which may
           decrease the amount of phosphorus lost in the urine and increase the phosphorus levels
           in the blood. Researchers want to see if cinacalcet can help blood phosphorus and
           decrease the amount of phosphorus supplements that people need to take.

      Objectives:

      - To see if cinacalcet can be a safe and effective treatment for people with low phosphorus
      conditions due to high FGF23.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who have different forms of hypophosphatemic
      rickets and tumor-induced hypophosphatemia

      Design:

        -  Participants will have up to 25 study visits over about 28 weeks.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  Up to three more lab visits for blood and urine tests will be required before treatment.
           Imaging studies of the bones, spine, and kidneys will be performed.

        -  Participants will have a 3-night hospital stay to start treatment. They will take
           cinacalcet once a day. Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging
           studies.

        -  Participants will continue to take cinacalcet once a day for 3 weeks. They will have
           regular study visits to monitor the treatment.

        -  There will be up to two other overnight hospital stays (1 to 3 nights) to adjust
           cinacalcet doses. The dose will increase until the maximum dose is reached, or side
           effects develop.

        -  After the end of the cinacalcet study, participants will have several more followup
           visits to monitor the effects of treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the tolerability of cinacalcet in
      individuals with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-mediated hypophosphatemia, using an
      open-label, dose-titration study of once-daily dosing. Secondary objectives are to evaluate
      the pharmacodynamics of cinacalcet in this subject population and to explore the efficacy of
      cinacalcet by comparing a) level of oral phosphate required at baseline to the level required
      at maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and b) change in renal phosphate handling from baseline to
      MTD. Tertiary objectives are to evaluate tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of
      twice daily dosing of each subject s MTD of cinacalcet after completion of the once-daily
      dose-titration phase. A final objective is to determine the length of time it takes for
      subjects to return to their pre-treatment steady state once treatment is complete.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Up to 17 subjects with FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia will be treated.

      DESIGN:

      This study is an open-label, dose-titration study of once-daily dosing of cinacalcet, with up
      to 4 escalating doses given at approximately 3 week intervals. After an initial standard of
      care optimization period of 2-9 weeks, subjects will proceed to the cinacalcet dose-titration
      period. Subjects who experience extended toxicity or study drug related serious adverse
      events or other related, intolerable adverse events will be down titrated to a lower dose of
      study medication. After subjects have achieved their own maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      completed the once-daily dosing phase, they will continue the study medication for
      approximately 3 additional weeks with twice daily dosing at their MTD. At the end of the
      cinacalcet treatment phase of the study, cinacalcet will be discontinued and standard of care
      (SOC) medications will be adjusted/restarted on an individualized basis. Subjects will
      continue in this final SOC safety follow-up period for up to 4 weeks until their SOC
      medications have been re-equilibrated.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Primary safety:

      Whether or not a subject discontinued the study due to a toxicity, related serious adverse
      event (SAE), or related intolerable adverse event (AE).

      Secondary safety:
