      That computed tomography (CT) screening of HIV-seropositive heavy smokers will detect early
      stage lung cancer at significantly higher rates than what is currently being observed.

      The study design is that of a prospective cohort study in which 200 smoking participants will
      be recruited from an existing HIV-seropositive cohort of 800 patients (the Human Oral
      Papillomavirus Etiology (HOPE) Study). Participants will be enrolled from the Johns Hopkins
      HIV (Moore) Clinic and the resources of the Johns Hopkins Adult Outpatient General Clinical
      Research Center (GCRC) and pilot project funding from the Lung Cancer SPORE will be utilized
      to fund the costs of the CT scans. An interdisciplinary team with expertise in HIV-associated
      malignancy, CT screening, lung cancer surgery, HIV infection, epidemiology and biostatistics
      has been assembled to test the hypothesis by accomplishing the following Specific Aims:
