  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of transdiagnostic
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (tCBT) in comparison to delayed-treatment for depression and
      anxiety in older people. CBT is a form of 'talking therapy' that has been recommended by the
      National Institute of Clinical Excellence for the treatment of mood disorders. While
      traditional disorder-specific CBT has been found to be effective at alleviating individual
      mood disorders, it may be less effective when multiple mood disorders are present (i.e. when
      there is psychological comorbidity). tCBT is a form of CBT that targets cognitive and
      behavioural processes common to a range of mood disorders. Consequently, it may be better
      placed to address comorbidity than traditional CBT, both in terms of clinical and
      cost-effectiveness.

      There is growing evidence that tCBT has beneficial effects on both depression and anxiety in
      working-age people. However, the potential benefits of this approach have not yet been
      examined in older people (in whom psychological comorbidity is a frequent problem).
      Therefore, this study will aim to recruit 22 older people who are experiencing symptoms of
      depression and anxiety from community mental health teams within the South London and
      Maudsley National Health Service Trust. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive
      either tCBT plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or 7-week delayed tCBT plus TAU. tCBT will be
      delivered on an individual basis in 12 sessions, each lasting 1 hour, over 14 weeks. It will
      be delivered in outpatient clinics or within the participants residence, depending on
      mobility issues. A number of outcome measures will be used to evaluate the feasibility,
      acceptability and efficacy of tCBT, including ratings on mood questionnaires, rates of
      dropout and reasons for dropout. Outcome measures will be collected before the tCBT
      intervention starts (week 0/baseline), midway through the intervention (after the 6th tCBT
      session/week 7), at the end of the intervention (after the final tCBT session/week 14) and at
      7-week follow-up (week 21) .

      The main hypotheses are:

      i. It will be feasible to adapt and establish a tCBT intervention for older people with
      comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders.

      ii. The tCBT intervention will be acceptable to older people with comorbid depressive and
      anxiety disorders.

      iii. The tCBT intervention will significantly reduce depression and anxiety symptoms relative
      to a delayed-treatment control condition.

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). This will assess symptom change over time in order to evaluate the efficacy of the tCBT intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>The HADS will be completed on a weekly basis throughout the tCBT intervention (from week 0 to week 14) and once again at 7-week follow-up (week 21).</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report questionnaire.
The HADS will be used to measure changes in anxiety and depression symptoms on a weekly basis over the course of the tCBT intervention (from week 0 to week 14), and once again at 7-week follow-up (week 21) to establish whether any treatment gains have been maintained.
For those participants allocated to the delayed-intervention arm of the trial the HADS will be also be completed each week during the 7-week delay period (week 0 to week 7) to monitor changes in symptoms and suicidal ideation. After the delay period these participants will crossover to the intervention arm and be evaluated accordingly (e.g. throughout the tCBT intervention; week 7 to week 21, and at 7-week follow-up; week 28).</description>

    <time_frame>The HARS will be completed before the tCBT intervention starts (week 0/7), mid-way through the intervention (week 7/14), after the final tCBT session (week 14/21), and at 7-week follow-up (week 21/28).</time_frame>

    <description>Participants randomised to the delayed-treatment arm will receive a brief telephone call and complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in order to monitor risk and symptom deterioration during the 7-week delayed treatment phase. They will also receive TAU (e.g. Community Mental Health Team appointments, case reviews, etc) during this time. At the end of 7 weeks, participants in the delayed-treatment arm will crossover into the treatment arm and receive the tCBT intervention. This arm will serve as a control condition in order to enable between-group comparisons.</description>

    <description>The UP comprises 4 main treatment components: 1) psychoeducation about emotions and behaviour; 2) changing misappraisals about probabilities and consequences of negative experiences; 3) preventing avoidance of negative emotion triggers; and 4) modifying emotion-driven behaviours (e.g. hypervigilance, withdrawal). The manualised tCBT intervention will be adapted in order to account for a United Kingdom (UK) audience (as the manual was developed in the United States) and older people (as the manual was developed for working-age people).</description>
