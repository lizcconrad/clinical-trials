    <textblock>
      Atypical Facial Pain is a chronic condition and presents controversies during diagnostic and
      treatment, between specialist not have consensus about the pathophysiology. It is possible
      consider this entitie a potential neuropathic cause without pathological signs. It knows the
      repetitive transcranial magnetic presents good results in the treatment of chronic pain
      coditions. The aim this study is evaluated the thresholds and excitability cortical in
      patients with AFP and verify the patterns of improvement in pain for patients undergoing rTMS
      compared to controls, as well as the therapeutic response to neuromodulation procedures. This
      enroll 20 patients with DAF and 20 controls treated with rTMS (5 sessions) and evaluated
      through questionnaires (EDOF clinical record, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Visual Analogue
      Scale, Inventory of symptoms of neuropathic pain, neuropathic pain DN4 questionnaire, SF -36,
      brief pain inventory). At the end of the data will be statistically analyzed and expressed as
      mean and standard deviation, and analyzed by Student's t test, analysis of variance (ANOVA),
      Tukey-Kramer and Pearson correlation. The level of significance is 5%. The results will be
      published in journals indexed in the area both nationally and internationally and presented
      at conferences and scientific meetings.
