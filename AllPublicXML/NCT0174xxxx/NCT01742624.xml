      To investigate the efficacy, safety, and drug compliance of Advagraf® (Extended Release
      Tacrolimus) by comparing the Advagraf® + steroid + Mycophenolate Mofetil combined therapy and
      the Prograf® + steroid + Mycophenolate Mofetil combined therapy in de novo kidney recipients
      1 month after kidney transplantation.

      This study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel, and comparative clinical
      trial. All the enrolled subjects will be treated with Prograf® (Tacrolimus), Basilixumab,
      Corticosteroids, and Mycophenolate Mofetil to suppress their immune system for one month (30
      days) after their kidney transplant. After the one month, the experimental group (30
      subjects) will be treated with Advagraf® (Extended Release Tacrolimus) instead of Prograf®
      (Tacrolimus), and the Corticosteroids and Mycophenolate Mofetil will be maintained. The
      control group (30 subjects) will continuously receive Prograf® (Tacrolimus), Corticosteroids,
      and Mycophenolate Mofetil. The clinical progress of the subjects in the experimental and
      control groups up to six months after their transplant will be investigated and compared.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are planning to receive a kidney from a deceased/cadaveric donor or a
             living non-related/related donor

          -  Patients who are planning to undergo kidney transplantation through a 15- 65-year-old
             donor

          -  Patients who are willing and able to participate in this study, who signed the
             informed consent form after following the appropriate informed consent process, and
             who can visit the center based on the study schedule in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             with the kidney or two kidneys

          -  Patients who will receive a kidney from a cadaveric donor whose heart is no longer
             beating or from an organ donor after cardiac death [Patients, however, who will
             receive a kidney from a marginal donor (based on KONOS) can be enrolled based on the
             principal investigator's judgment.]

          -  Patients who will receive a kidney from a donor whose ABO blood type is not compatible
             with that of the recipient or who had positive lymphocyte cross-match (LCM) results

          -  Patients who will receive a kidney from a related donor who showed HLA-0 mismatch
             (identical) (If the donor is not related to the patient or is deceased, however, the
             patient can be enrolled in this study even if the patient showed HLA-0 mismatch or
             HLA-6 antigen match.)

          -  Patients who previously underwent or are planning to undergo transplantation of their
             extra-renal solid organ or bone marrow/stem cell

          -  Patients who were diagnosed with cancer in the last five years [ Patients, however,

          -  Patients or donors who have positive HIV, HBsAg, or anti-HCV test results

          -  Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity or allergy [that required acute
             (within four weeks)/chronic treatment] to the investigated drug or another drug with a
             similar chemical structure (e.g., Tacrolimus).

          -  Patients who were treated with other investigated drugs within 30 days from their
             study enrollment

          -  Patients who are planning to be pregnant, or who are pregnant or breastfeeding and who
             are not planning to use any contraceptive method during the study period.

             impossible

          -  Patients who showed the following result in the assessment prior to the kidney
             transplantation

               -  Any of their liver panels (AST, ALT, ALKP, and total bilirubin) three times
                  higher than the normal range

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/mm3, leukocytes &lt; 2,500/mm3, or platelet &lt;
