  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the functional knee performance of Subjects
      who have undergone primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Data from Subjects who receive one
      of four contemporary knee configurations will be pooled to establish a contemporary dataset.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pre-operative (approximately -90 to -1
      day before surgery) to minimum one year (approximately 304 to 668 days) postoperative
      functional performance improvement for the Attune™ primary, cemented TKA system as measured
      by the activities of daily living (ADL)subscore of the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score
      (KOOS)questionnaire (KOOS-ADL sub-score). This will be carried out for all four implant
      configurations: cruciate retaining fixed bearing (Attune™ CR FB), cruciate retaining rotating
      platform (Attune™ CR RP), posterior stabilized fixed bearing (Attune™ PS FB), and posterior
      stabilized rotating platform (Attune™ PS RP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, single arm stratified, multi-center investigation.

      Approximately 20 study sites, worldwide, will enroll 1040 subjects (1040 knees). Each study
      is expected to enroll approximately 52 subjects (approximately 52 knees). An additional 10
      subjects per site may be recruited at sites which have Sub-Investigators participating in the
      study. Cohort reallocation is permitted. There will be no control group. One thousand and
      forty (1040)Subjects will be stratified into 4 subgroups of 260: cruciate retaining fixed
      bearing(CR FB), posterior stabilized fixed bearing (PS FB), cruciate retaining rotating
      platform (CR RP), and posterior stabilized rotating platform (PS RP). Treatment assignment in
      this study is not randomized.

      Each site will only enroll patients in one of the four knee configuration sub-groups most
      commonly used as their standard of care.

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) activities of daily living (ADL) sub-score change from baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year or later (approximately 304 days or later)</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS ADL will be measured before surgery and at a minimum 1 year after surgery. The KOOS is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 42 questions. The KOOS consists of 5 subscales; pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreational function and knee-related quality of life. Each question has 5 Likert-like response options. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The change from baseline is the minimum 1 year (approximately 304 to 668 days) measurement minus the baseline measurement.</description>
