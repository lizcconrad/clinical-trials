    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in substance abuse interventions, a large percentage of clients
      entering residential treatment for substance use will drop out of treatment prematurely, and
      of the remaining, many will relapse soon after treatment completion. Previous research
      indicates that an individual's ability to withstand psychological distress is a key factor
      necessary to maintain drug and alcohol abstinence and to remain in substance use treatment
      without absconding. In previous work, Dr. Bornovalova developed a specific distress tolerance
      treatment called Skills for Improving Distress Intolerance (SIDI). This intervention features
      skills training in behavioral and acceptance strategies and intentional clinical exposure to
      emotional distress. SIDI was developed and piloted with a sample of urban drug users seeking
      treatment in a residential facility. Individuals receiving SIDI exhibited greater improvement
      in distress tolerance than those in two comparison groups (receiving treatment-as-usual and
      supportive counseling).

      Current study. The investigators received NIDA funding to conduct a randomized clinical trial
      with 325 clients entering a residential substance use treatment facility. Study participants
      will be randomized into two treatment groups: (1) those receiving SIDI and (2) those
      receiving Supportive Counseling (SC). Participants will receive 10 treatment sessions over a
      period of 4 months. Then, the investigators will follow clients for one year to examine
      treatment retention and abstinence.
