  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with an objective response. An objective response (OR) was defined as a patient having a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of first documentation of tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival was assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant was known to have died, the time to death was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant was censored at the last date they were known to be alive.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of clinically active Interstitial Lung Diseases (Patients with chronic,

          -  Positive epidermal growth factor receptor mutation.

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to icotinib or any of the excipients of this product.
