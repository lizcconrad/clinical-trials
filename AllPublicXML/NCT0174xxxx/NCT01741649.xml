  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many solutions are used for cleaning the skin of a patient previous to a surgery. Although
      the efficacy of clorhexidine has been proved in other surgical procedures, there is only a
      retrospective study in cesarean section (they report no benefit of one solution over the
      other). The investigators would like to evaluate the difference in surgical site infection in
      patients after cesarean section comparing preparation of the skin with clorhexidine versus
      povidone.

    <description>The patients will be evaluated for evidence of surgical site infection before leaving the hospital, three (3) days after surgery. The presence of fever, suppurative secretion through the wound or cutaneous changes compatible witn infection will be considered a surgical site infection (SSI). This outcome will be evaluated with a qualitative variable (presence of SSI). The patients will be classified in accordance as &quot;With SSI&quot; or &quot;Without SSI&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be evaluated for evidence of surgical site infection 15 days post surgery. The need to admit the patient to the hospital for management of a surgical site infection will be classified with &quot;Hospitalization - Yes/No&quot;.</description>
