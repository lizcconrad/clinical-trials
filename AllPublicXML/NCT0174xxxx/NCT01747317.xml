      Fractional Flow Reserve derived from computed tomography(FFRCT) is a novel method for
      determining the physiologic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD), which will help
      physicians in clinical decision-making and decrease the medical cost, but its ability to
      identify patients with ischemia has not been adequately examined to date.

      Fractional Flow Reserve derived from computed tomography(FFRCT) is a novel method for
      determining the physiologic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD), which will help
      physicians in clinical decision-making and decrease the medical cost, but its ability to
      identify patients with ischemia has not been adequately examined to date.

      Available data from registered clinical trials has testified the diagnostic performance of
      FFRCT, but the diagnostic accuracy among them are not consistent.

      Thus, the investigators designed a collaborative individual patient-data pooled-analysis
      aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT and find the possible cause for
      inconsistency

Specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified;PPV, or precision rate is the proportion of positive test results that are true positives (such as correct diagnoses);NPV is defined as the proportion of subjects with a negative test result who are correctly diagnosed.</description>
