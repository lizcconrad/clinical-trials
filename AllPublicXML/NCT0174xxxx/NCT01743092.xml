      Research specific to women's gambling treatment needs is limited but suggests a critical need
      for women sensitive options and reduced barriers to access. This pilot will test the
      effectiveness of a Tutorial Workbook (TW) both as a self-help tool and used in combination
      with a webinar. Ontario women(n=48) over the age of 19, with gambling concerns, will be
      recruited through flyers, on-line and newspaper ads and randomly assigned to one of two
      groups: (a) TW or (b) TWW (TW plus Webinar). All will complete questionnaires addressing
      gambling behaviours, personal history and mood states prior to and after the 12 week study.
      Groups (a) and (b) will also provide feedback on the TW's content and relevance. Group (b)
      will, in addition, provide feedback on the Webinar Group. TW and TWW will be valuable
      additions to current treatments, of special importance to reduce barriers for women. The
      study will contribute to best practices in developing web-based treatments.

      Most gambling specific research involves men yet findings are typically generalized to women,
      a shortcoming addressed in the literature. Women are underrepresented in treatment. A
      previous study (Boughton and Brewster, 2002) with 365 Ontario women not in treatment,
      explored barriers and treatment needs. Many respondents indicated that women-only groups and
      self-help materials would be of value. Using web-based resources to increase treatment
      options has merit in a growing technological age. This study will introduce two unique forms
      of treatment, a women friendly tutorial workbook developed specifically to address issues
      commonly underlying women's gambling and a webinar based group facilitated by a gambling
      clinician. Group support has been demonstrated to be highly beneficial for women in reducing
      isolation and shame. The research will assist in developing Best Practices in the problem
      gambling field, especially for women, a neglected and vulnerable group.

      There are two questions:

        1. First, to what extent is the Tutorial Workbook effective by itself as a treatment option
           in helping women make changes to their gambling.

        2. What extent is the addition of the webinar discussion group option an incremental
           benefit to the participant in helping women make changes to their gambling.

      Web based therapy has proven effective in the treatment of addiction and mental health issues
      but more research is needed to assess its efficacy for problem gambling. Self-help tools have
      been demonstrated as effective in reducing gambling but no women specific tools are
      available. Evidence of the effectiveness of the TW and TWW treatment options will reduce
      barriers for hard to serve populations of women and expand options for clinical programs to
      meet the needs of women unable to attend face to face programs. The TW attends to the unique
      issues and treatment/support needs of women with gambling concerns.

      Ultimately the TW materials, once fully developed, can be made available to the general
      public as an online tool, used to assist n providing telephone counselling, individually or
      in a group (Webinar) format or be made available as a self-help paper based utorial workbook.

    <description>The questionnaire asks the client about their perceived stress. The Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, S., Kamarck, T., and Mermelstein, R. (1983). A global measure of perceived stress. Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 24, 386-396. December 1983) is a scale developed to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Psychological stress has been defined as the extent to which persons perceive (appraise) that their demands exceed their ability to cope. The PSS has become one of the most widely used psychological instruments for measuring nonspecific perceived stress.
The scale has ten questions asking respondents to circle a number between 0 and 4. (0 the feelings and thoughts during the last month: 0 = Never 1 = Almost Never 2 = Sometimes 3 = Fairly Often 4 = Very Often. The range of possible score is from 0 to 40. Scores around 13 are considered average. Scores of 20 or higher are considered to be indicative of high stress levels.</description>

    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21) is a 21 item self-report questionnaire developed by Lovibond, S.H. &amp; Lovibond, P.F. (1995, Manual for the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, 2nd. Ed., Sydney: Psychology Foundation).
The range of total scores for each subscale is from 0 to 21. Higher values represent a worse outcome. Depression Normal 0-4 Mild 5-6 Moderate 7-10 Severe 11-13 Extremely Severe 14+ Anxiety Normal 0-3 Mild 4-5 Moderate 6-7 Severe 8-9 Extremely Severe 10+ Stress Normal 0-7 Mild 8-9 Moderate 10-12 Severe 13-16 Extremely Severe 17+</description>
