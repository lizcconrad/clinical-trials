  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the transfer of nifurtimox into breastmilk of lactating
      women who receive the drug for the treatment of Chagas disease.

      Breastmilk and blood samples will be obtained from these patients at pre-specified times
      after they take the clinically indicated medication, and the concentrations in both matrices
      will be compared to estimate degree of transfer. Estimation of nifurtimox transfer into
      breastmilk will allow the evaluation of potential degree of exposure of infants breastfed by
      these women to nifurtimox. This study will help clarify safety of continuing breastfeeding
      while receiving treatment with nifurtimox for Chagas disease.
