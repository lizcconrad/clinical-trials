  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation is often inadequate due to poor
      guideline adherence. An integrated chronic care program (ICCP) at a specialized AF-clinic was
      found to be superior to usual care provided by a cardiologist in terms of cardiovascular
      hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality.

      Hypothesis: treatment at a specialized AF clinic is superior to usual care in terms of
      cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, cost-effectiveness, quality of
      life and guideline adherence.

      Objectives: primary objective is to show that an ICCP reduces cardiovascular hospitalizations
      and mortality. The secondary objectives include cost-effectiveness, guideline adherence,
      quality of life, patient knowledge and patient compliance in medication.

      Study design: randomized controlled trial with two study arms: usual care provided by
      cardiologists (control) versus integrated chronic care program at a specialized AF clinic
      (intervention) in 8 hospitals in the Netherlands. The RACE4 is an event driven study. A total
      number of 246 events is needed. In total 1716 patients with newly diagnosed AF will be
      included. Total duration of the study is 6 years with a minimal follow up of 1 year and
      maximum of 6 years. Data collected at inclusion, after 3, 6, 12 months and every year
      thereafter.

      Study population: Patients older than 18 year with newly diagnosed AF.

      Intervention: treatment through an ICCP at specialized AF clinics, consisting of a nurse
      specialist, cardiologist-supervisor and a guidelines-based information-communication
      technology (ICT) decision support program and a web-based patient centered medication
      management tool and tailored telemonitoring.

    <description>Management of AF patients in specialized AF Clinics according to the principles of an integrated chronic care program (ICCP) performed by nurse specialists, supported by an ICT decision support tool based on professional guidelines (CardioConsult AF®) and supervised by a cardiologist. In addition, a web-based patient centered medication management tool (Medication Manager(TM)and tailored telemonitoring at an outpatient AF clinic. In addition, the intervention is based on identifying risk factors and potential problems in patients, and addressing needs through dynamic use of personalized education and adjustment of treatment.</description>
