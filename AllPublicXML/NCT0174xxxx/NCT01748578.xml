  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First-In-Human (FIH) study to assess the safety and tolerability of ocular
      administration of EBI-005 in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the PK and immunogenicity of
      EBI-005 will be assessed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The planned dose levels are 5 mg/mL EBI-005 (Group 1) and 20 mg/mL EBI-005 (Group 2).

      A total of 8 subjects will be dosed in each group with subjects randomized in a ratio of 6:2,
      EBI-005:placebo. Treatment administration in Group 2 will proceed following a review of
      safety data from Group 1. In both groups, subjects randomized to active treatment will
      receive EBI-005 in the right eye and placebo in the left eye. Subjects randomized to placebo
      will receive placebo in each eye.
