  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no reliable, bedside, and non-invasive method for assessing connectivity
      changes in electrophysiological activity of the brain associated with brain-related
      pathologies, e.g., concussion, ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), etc. Event Related
      Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of
      cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a
      method, as they provide both a non-invasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs
      provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally
      been limited. However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial
      resolution for ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will
      combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern
      recognition methods (BNA) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and
      synchronization.

      The need of objective measures that will help the clinician in its decision making in
      brain-related pathologies is recognized. BNA is a new imaging modality that has been
      developed to fill this gap.
