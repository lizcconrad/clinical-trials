      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study to investigate the safety
      and efficacy of Lybridos in the domestic setting in healthy female subjects with hypoactive
      sexual desire disorder and maladaptive activity of sexual inhibitory mechanisms.

      In the present study, the efficacy of Lybridos will be evaluated in the domestic setting in
      healthy female subjects with HSDD and maladaptive activity of sexual inhibitory mechanism(s).
      Sexual satisfaction and other aspects of sexual functioning will be measured within 24 hours
      after each sexual activity. The following hypotheses will be tested:

      Lybridos, as compared to placebo, will significantly increase the number of satisfying sexual
      events.

      The number of satisfying sexual events will not differ significantly between subjects treated
      with placebo and subjects treated with 0.5 mg testosterone alone and/or 10 mg buspirone
      alone.

      Lybridos, as compared to placebo, will significantly increase sexual desire/arousal.

      Sexual desire/arousal will not differ significantly between subjects treated with placebo and
      subjects treated with 0.5 mg testosterone alone and/or 10 mg buspirone alone.

      Lybridos, as compared to testosterone alone and buspirone alone, will significantly increase
      the number of satisfying sexual events and sexual desire/arousal.
