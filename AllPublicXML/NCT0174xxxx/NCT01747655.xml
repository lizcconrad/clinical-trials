  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced Parkinson's Disease experience a range in the severity of their motor
      fluctuations. The rationale for this Post Marketing Observational Study is to demonstrate the
      benefits of Duodopa treatment on Parkinson's Disease patients entering the advanced stage of
      the disease whose motor fluctuations have become troublesome and complicate management with
      oral therapy. The aim of this post-marketing observational study is to assess the effect of
      Duodopa treatment on activities of daily living in advanced Parkinson's Disease participants
      characterised by either 2-4 hours of &quot;off&quot; time or 2 hours of non-troublesome or troublesome
      dyskinesia daily, supported by a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Total Score in the
      best &quot;on&quot; state of at least 40 points at baseline.

      Data are recorded from visits most closely aligned with the planned periods of Visit 0 (V0):
      Baseline (After decision to use the temporary naso-duodenal tube (approximately 2-14 days)
      and after signature of the Patient Authorization/Informed Consent Form); Visit 1 (V1): At
      discharge from hospital; Visit 2 (V2): 3 months after discharge; Visit 3 (V3): 6 months after
      discharge; Visit 4 (V4): 12 months after discharge.

      All participants have a temporary naso-duodenal tube used initially with the infusion pump to
      determine if the participant responds favorably to this method of treatment and to optimize
      the dose of Duodopa before permanent treatment is started.

      Participants who choose a treatment other than Duodopa after the temporary naso-duodenal test
      phase are considered for the Standard of Care group. Participants who go on to select
      Apomorphine pump or Deep Brain Stimulation at any stage are not eligible to continue in this
      group or to continue in the observational period of study.

      Participants who continue to with Duodopa treatment after the the temporary naso-duodenal
      test phase are the Duodopa group.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and 12 months after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The Part II score is the sum of the answers to 13 questions, each of which are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). The Part II score ranges from 0-52 and higher scores are associated with more disability. UPDRS scores during &quot;On&quot; time (when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug) are presented. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used for missing data.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and 3, 6, and 12 months after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS III questionnaire consists of 14 questions on motor examinations rated from 0 (absent/normal) to 4 (extreme impairment). Questions 20-26 are multi-part questions in that they are evaluated separately for multiple body parts (for example, for the left and right hand). Counting each of these assessments leads to a total of 27 answers. The UPDRS III score ranges from 0 to 108 with higher values indicating greater impairment and was calculated as the sum of the 27 answers provided to the 14 questions. Observed values are presented for each visit as well as LOCF at 12 months after discharge. n=the number of participants with data at baseline and given time point.</description>

    <description>Non-motor symptoms assessed over the previous month were scored with respect to severity (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) and with respect to frequency (1 = rarely, 2 = often, 3 = frequent, 4 = very frequent). The total NMSS score ranges from 0 to 360 with higher values indicating greater impairment and was calculated as the sum of all individual score values. Observed values are presented for each visit as well as LOCF at 12 months after discharge. n=the number of participants with data at baseline and given time point.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), at discharge from hospital, and 3, 6, and 12 months after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to state how often they had encountered certain problems over the past four weeks using the following rating scale: Never (0), occasionally (1), sometimes (2), often (3), always or cannot do at all (4). The PDQ-8 summary index was derived as the sum of the single items divided by 32. Scores range from 0 to 100. A higher summary index score indicates a higher impairment of quality of life. Observed values are presented for each visit as well as LOCF at 12 months after discharge. n=the number of participants with data at baseline and given time point.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The Part II score is the sum of the answers to 13 questions, each of which are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). The Part II score ranges from 0-52 and higher scores are associated with more disability. UPDRS scores during &quot;On&quot; time (when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug) are presented. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used for missing data.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS IV questionnaire consists of 4 individual items that assess the degree of dyskinesias (Item 32: duration; Item 33: disability; and Item 34: pain) and clinical fluctuations (Item 39: percentage of &quot;off&quot; times of the waking day). Individual UPDRS IV item scores range from 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate a higher complication of therapy. Observed values are presented for each visit as well as LOCF at 12 months after discharge. n=the number of participants with data at baseline and given time point.</description>

        <title>Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III (Motor Examination) Score: Mean Change From Baseline to 3, 6, and 12 Months After Hospital Discharge</title>
        <description>The UPDRS III questionnaire consists of 14 questions on motor examinations rated from 0 (absent/normal) to 4 (extreme impairment). Questions 20–26 are multi-part questions in that they are evaluated separately for multiple body parts (for example, for the left and right hand). Counting each of these assessments leads to a total of 27 answers. The UPDRS III score ranges from 0 to 108 with higher values indicating greater impairment and was calculated as the sum of the 27 answers provided to the 14 questions. Observed values are presented for each visit as well as LOCF at 12 months after discharge. n=the number of participants with data at baseline and given time point.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to state how often they had encountered certain problems over the past four weeks using the following rating scale: Never (0), occasionally (1), sometimes (2), often (3), always or cannot do at all (4). The PDQ-8 summary index was derived as the sum of the single items divided by 32. Scores range from 0 to 100. A higher summary index score indicates a higher impairment of quality of life. Observed values are presented for each visit as well as LOCF at 12 months after discharge. n=the number of participants with data at baseline and given time point.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>AbbVie requests that any investigator or institution that plans on presenting/publishing results disclosure, provide written notification of their request 60 days prior to their presentation/publication.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Results for the SoC group should be interpreted with care due to the small number of patients. Also, when comparing the SoC and Duodopa groups one should be aware that patients of the SoC group may have had Duodopa treatment before returning to SoC.</limitations_and_caveats>
