  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to record the effectiveness of sevoflurane for intubation in
      Egyptian, non-obstetric, difficult to intubate (DTI) patients undergoing surgery in regards
      to the rate of intubation success.

      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, post marketing, observational study to
      investigate the effectiveness of sevoflurane anaesthesia in difficult to intubate (DTI;
      Mallampati Score III or IV) Egyptian patients who had been prescribed sevoflurane for
      anaesthesia by their treating physician.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Successful Intubation (Clinical Success)</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of intubation to completion of intubation (up to 15 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were considered to have a successful intubation if intubation was achieved in less than 4 separate intubation attempts according to the guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). The number of intubation attempts was a maximum of 3 attempts, after which the intubation was considered a failure.</description>

    <measure>Mean Duration of Induction (in Seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of induction up to 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The mean duration of induction (in seconds) was defined as the time required to reach a Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) of 5 from start of induction. The RSS levels are defined as 1 = anxious, agitated or restless; 2 = calm, co-operative and communicative; 3 = response is quick to a voice command; 4 = response is slow to a voice command; 5 = slow or sluggish response; and 6 = no response at all.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Mallampati Score III and IV</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening</time_frame>
    <description>Mallampati classification correlates tongue size to pharyngeal size. The test is performed with the patient in the sitting position, head in a neutral position, the mouth wide open and the tongue protruding to its maximum, without phonation. Classification is assigned according to the extent the base of tongue is able to mask the visibility of pharyngeal structures: Class I = visualization of the soft palate, fauces; uvula, anterior and the posterior pillars; Class II = visualization of the soft palate, fauces and uvula; Class III = visualization of soft palate and base of uvula; and Class IV: only hard palate is visible, soft palate is not visible at all. A high score (Class III or IV) is associated with more difficult intubation.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Mallampati Score III and IV</title>
        <description>Mallampati classification correlates tongue size to pharyngeal size. The test is performed with the patient in the sitting position, head in a neutral position, the mouth wide open and the tongue protruding to its maximum, without phonation. Classification is assigned according to the extent the base of tongue is able to mask the visibility of pharyngeal structures: Class I = visualization of the soft palate, fauces; uvula, anterior and the posterior pillars; Class II = visualization of the soft palate, fauces and uvula; Class III = visualization of soft palate and base of uvula; and Class IV: only hard palate is visible, soft palate is not visible at all. A high score (Class III or IV) is associated with more difficult intubation.</description>
