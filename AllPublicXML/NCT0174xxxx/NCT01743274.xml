  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a recent imaging modality that yields cross-sectional
      images with a resolution 10 times greater than that of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). OCT
      uses a near-infra-red light source to obtain images of the interior walls of the coronary
      arteries and is increasingly used to evaluate vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques and assess
      placement and response to stenting. - To date, no study has evaluated whether optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) contributes to optimizing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      and stenting.

      The DOCTORS study is a randomized, open label study to evaluate whether OCT-guided
      angioplasty would provide useful clinical information beyond that obtained by angiography,
      and whether this information would subsequently modify physician behavior and treatment
      choices. In particular, we will evaluate the impact of changes in procedural strategy
      resulting from the use of OCT on the value of fractional flow reserve (FFR) obtained after
      angioplasty and stent implantation of a lesion responsible for non-ST segment elevation acute
      coronary syndromes.

    <description>Randomization will be performed after initial coronary angiography, once the operator has identified the lesion responsible for the ACS. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the &quot;Control&quot; Group, the angioplasty procedure will be guided by traditional fluoroscopy alone.
In both groups, fractional flow reserve (FFR) will be measured at the end of the procedure, once the operator considers the result of the angioplasty to be optimal. The average of three consecutive FFR measures will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Randomization will be performed after initial coronary angiography, once the operator has identified the lesion responsible for the ACS. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups.
In the &quot;OCT&quot; group, OCT will be performed to optimise the results of angioplasty. The procedure will be performed according to usual practice, with or without pre-dilation before implantation of one or more stents (drug-eluting or bare metal). In the OCT group, OCT will be performed after initial coronary angiography and at the end of the procedure and the operator will have the possibility to change procedural strategy according to the data immediately available on the OCT images, with the possibility of additional interventions (additional balloon inflations, addition stent implantation, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors and/or thromboaspiration and/or rotational atherectomy).</description>

    <description>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a recent imaging modality that yields cross-sectional images with a resolution 10 times greater than that of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). OCT uses a near-infra-red light source to obtain images of the interior walls of the coronary arteries and is increasingly used to evaluate vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques and assess placement and response to stenting.
OCT images are acquired by automated pullback over 2 to 3 seconds of the light source that yields a helicoidal image of a longitudinal segment of 50 mm. Intravascular imaging is obtained by injecting contrast medium or saline solution.</description>
