      Hemophilia is a recessive X chromosome linked genetic disorder of blood coagulation that
      affects about one in every ten thousand people. Hemarthrosis, which you can begin in
      childhood, promptly leads to degenerative changes of the articular cartilage which culminate
      in deformity and degenerative changes early, known as hemophilic arthropathy, which is the
      most common complication of hemophilia. Aside administration of clotting factor, treatment
      should address the degenerative changes already present in patients joints. Our objective is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of articular washing followed by infiltration with
      corticosteroids and hylan G-F 20, followed by a program of home exercises and/or academy as
      the previous level of hemophilia patients, in relation to pain relief, and improved function
      and quality of life.

      Hemophilia is a recessive X chromosome linked genetic disorder of blood coagulation that
      affects about one in every ten thousand people. There are two main types of hemophilia.
      Hemophilia A or classical hemophilia corresponds to 80% of the cases, and is caused by a
      deficiency or change of factor VIII. Hemophilia B is caused by deficiency or amendment of
      factor IX, and represents about 20%. Patients with hemophilia type A or B have the same
      clinical presentation. Cases with moderate or severe hemophilia exhibit a tendency to
      spontaneous bleeding or after minimal trauma, being the joints the most frequent sites of
      hemorrhage. The joints most commonly affected are the knees, followed by the elbows, ankles,
      shoulders and hips. Hemarthrosis, which you can begin in childhood, promptly leads to
      degenerative changes of the articular cartilage which culminate in deformity and degenerative
      changes early, known as hemophilic arthropathy, which is the most common complication of
      hemophilia. The hemophilic arthropathy is highly debilitating and consumes a large amount of
      resources for the treatment of hemophilic patients. Currently, by the adequate administration
      of the clotting factor, the hemophilic patient has a life expectancy of next to normal.
      Therefore other forms of treatment must be researched; they can be palliative or modifiers of
      the natural history of disease, to try to postpone the need for arthroplasty . Our objective
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment, consisting of articular washing followed by
      infiltration with corticosteroids and hylan G-F 20, followed by a program of home exercises
      and/or academy as the previous level of hemophilia patients, in relation to pain relief, and
      improved function and quality of life.
