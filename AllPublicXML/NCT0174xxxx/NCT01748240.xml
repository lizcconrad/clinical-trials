  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Azacytidine (AZA) is the current standard of care for frontline patient treated with
      high-risk MDS and is clinically active in all type of MDS, however, 50% of the patients will
      never respond. Vorinostat is an orally available HDAC inhibitor with clinical activity in MDS
      and proven in vitro synergy with AZA. Patient treated upfront with a combination of this
      agents have shown more responses based on phase I/II data. In the present study, we will use
      the combination of these two drugs to try to create a synergetic effect and generate a
      response for patients who experienced treatment failure after AZA.

      All eligible patients will be treated with Azacitidine and oral vorinostat for 6 cycles of 28
      days. Study Design

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be administered vorinostat orally at 300mg two
      times daily for 7 days as outlined in table 1.1. AZA will be administered SC at 75 mg/m2/day
      x 7 consecutive days or at maximum tolerated dose if a dose reduction of AZA was needed
      before entering the trial with a minimum dose of 50mg/m2/d for 7 consecutive days.

      Each cycle will last 28 days with AZA starting on day 1 of each cycle and vorinostat starting
      on day 3.

      Patients will receive 6 cycles unless progression is documented. Patients with a complete
      remission (CR), partial remission (PR), or hematological improvement (HI), will be treated
      until progression.
