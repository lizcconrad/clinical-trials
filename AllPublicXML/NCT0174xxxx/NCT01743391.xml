      By randomizing sub-fertile women to either control or office-hysteroscopy in the circle prior
      to IVF or ICSI (intracytoplasmatic sperm injection

      ) treatment, we aim to enlighten whether hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy increases
      pregnancy rates in the intervention group.

      Background A tenth of a population in Denmark today is the result of assisted fertility,
      including IVF and ICSI. In roughly 40 % of these subfertile women the reason is unknown.
      Standard initial procedures include transvaginal ultrasonography, with or without saline
      infusion to detect intrauterine abnormalities that might explain the infertile condition. The
      golden standard to detect intrauterine abnormalities is hysteroscopy. Such abnormalities can
      be detected in a fourth of this population. Earlier studies indicate that the hysteroscopy
      alone - without correcting any abnormalities, affects IVF/ISCI outcome positively.

      Aim By randomizing patients referred to the fertility clinic to Â±office-hysteroscopy in
      circle prior to IVF/ISCI, we aim to enlighten whether mini-hysteroscopy with endometrial
      biopsy will increase the fertility by looking at pregnancy rates as our main outcome.

      Method Women signed up for second IVF/ISCI treatment will be recruited, after signed consent
      they are randomized to either office-hysteroscopy or nothing before standard treatment in the
      fertility clinic.

      Mini-hysteroscopy is a standard procedure in our gynecological outpatient clinic. The
      procedure is done without any anesthetics. Only women with normal intrauterine conditions
      will be enrolled in this protocol.

      When the fertility clinic has a positive serum-HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin

      ) and a positive transvaginal sonography, pregnancy is confirmed. If negative serum-HCG,
      negative pregnancy will be registered.
