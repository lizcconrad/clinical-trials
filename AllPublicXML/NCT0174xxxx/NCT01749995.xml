  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has become a fundamental aid in the evaluation and
      treatment planning of older cancer patients. Systematic reviews of trials of geriatric
      assessments have shown effectiveness when interventions are implemented. Although CGA is a
      fundamental tool in the care of the geriatric patient, the integration and application of
      this tool in oncologic practice are still in evolution. Cognition is one of the domains
      examined within a CGA. Studies have noted that up to 25% to 50% of older patients had
      cognitive abnormalities that warranted further evaluation. Cognitive dysfunctions can
      influence the ability to weigh the risks and benefits of cancer therapy, to comply with the
      suggested treatment plan, and to recognize the symptoms of toxicity that need medical
      attention. Recently, the Freund Clock Drawing Test (CDT) has been proposed as a quick and
      simple screening tool to assess cognitive dysfunction. A retrospective analysis on 105 cancer
      patients at the General Hospital Groeninge showed that a cut-off score of ≤ 4 for the CDT has
      a good AUC, sensitivity and specificity.

      Aims

        1. To validate the Clock Drawing Test as a screening tool to identify elderly cancer
           patients in need of a more in-depth cognitive evaluation within a comprehensive
           geriatric assessment (CGA)

        2. Further registration of data in a database coupled to the Cancer Registry in the General
           Hospital Groeninge as set up by the PROGERCAN study

      Design: A prospective, observational, cohort study. All geriatric patients who are diagnosed
      with cancer will be screened by an oncology clinical nurse specialist or study collaborator
      with the G8 questionnaire. Patients who screen positive, will be refered to the
      multi-disciplinary onco-geriatric program where a member of the geriatric oncology team will
      implement a comprehensive geriatric evaluation under supervision of an oncologist and/or
      geriatrician, who will then formulate recommendations and might suggest referral to other
      health care providers.

      Population: All consenting patients, aged ≥ 70, who are referred for anti-cancer treatment in
      the General Hospital Groeninge and who are in need of a CGA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients should have reached the age of 70 or more at the moment of enrolment

          -  Patients should be eligible for standard CGA as per local practice (e.g. on the basis
             of positive screening with G8 or referred by a treating physician on the basis of
             clinical suspicion of vulnerability or frailty)

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer. All stages of cancer are eligible.

          -  Patients should be fluent in Dutch or French

          -  Patients must receive their primary oncology care (surgery, course of (neo)adjuvant or
             palliative chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, palliative care, experimental
             treatment as part of a clinical trial,...) planned in the General Hospital Groeninge

          -  Patients can be included before or at the start of a line of treatment but not during
             a line of treatment

          -  Patients should have signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not match the inclusion criteria

          -  Patients who are visiting the oncology clinic for a second opinion and do not wish to
             be treated in the General Hospital Groeninge

          -  Patients who already started a respective line of treatment

          -  Patients deemed fit on the basis of negative screening (negative result on G8) unless
