    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging (DCE-MRI) in patients with advanced breast or pancreatic cancer with metastases to
      the liver or lung. Diagnostic procedures, such as DCE-MRI, may help measure a patient's
      response to treatment

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the ability of iRGD (tumor-homing peptide iRGD) to elicit changes in metastatic
      breast cancer vascular permeability as measured by dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of iRGD. III. To explore the safety of iRGD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore changes in water diffusion status in tumors due to iRGD as measured by
      diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI.

      II. To explore the ability of iRGD to elicit changes in primary pancreatic cancer vascular
      permeability as measured by dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI.

      III. To explore changes in water diffusion status in primary pancreatic cancer due to iRGD as
      measured by DWI-MRI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo DCE-MRI on day 1 and undergo tumor-homing peptide iRGD DCE-MRI on day 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 15 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have a histologic diagnosis of breast or pancreatic adenocarcinoma
