  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether NXN-462, a selective nNOS inhibitor, is
      effective in reducing pain levels in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NXN-462 is designed to target the nitric oxide synthase system (NOS), specifically the
      neuronal NOS (nNOS) isoform. By design, NXN-462 is a potent inhibitor of nNOS with good
      affinity, and has little or no affinity for a range of G protein-coupled receptors, ion
      channels, and enzymes. NXN-462 is being developed as an oral therapy for the treatment of
      neuropathic pain syndromes, including PHN. This drug design strategy provides a new
      therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.
