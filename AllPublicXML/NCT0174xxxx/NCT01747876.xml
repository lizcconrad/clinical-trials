  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LEE011 is a small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6. LEE011 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo
      activity in both tumor models.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) in pediatric patients and to delineate a clinical dose
      to be used in future studies. This study will also assess the safety, tolerability, PK and
      preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of LEE011 in patients with MRT or neuroblastoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of MRT or, neuroblastoma or in dose escalation part, other tumors
             with documented evidence of D-cyclin-CDK4/6-INK4a-Rb pathway abnormalities (dose
             escalation part only),

          -  Patients with CNS disease should be on stable doses of steroids for at least 7 days
             prior to first dose of LEE011 with no plans for escalation.

          -  In expansion part, patients must have at least one measurable disease as defined by
             RECIST v1.1.

          -  Patients must have a Lansky (≤ 16 years) or Karnofsky (&gt; 16 years) score of at least
             50.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of QTc prolongation or QTcF &gt; 450 ms on screening ECG.

          -  Patients with the following laboratory values during screening:

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age

               -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN for age

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &gt; 3 x
                  ULN for age; aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic
                  transaminase(SGOT) &gt; 3 x ULN for age except in patients with tumor involvement of
                  the liver who must have AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT ≤ 5 x ULN for age. For the purpose
                  of this study, the ULN for SGPT/ALT is 45 U/L.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving treatment with agents that are metabolized
             predominantly through CYP3A4/5 and have a narrow therapeutic window and/or agents that
             are known strong inducers or inhibitors CYP3A4/5 are prohibited. In particular,
             enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs).

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the
             judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for the study.
