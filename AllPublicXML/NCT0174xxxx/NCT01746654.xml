  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the antibacterial protein P128 is (i) safe
      and well tolerated in healthy volunteers and in chronic kidney diseases patients on dialysis,
      (ii) is it effective in reducing the nasal carriage of pathogen (Staphylococcus aureus) in
      humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus with acquired multiple-drug resistance poses an increasing problem in
      both hospital and community settings. S. aureus is known to cause infections ranging in
      severity from skin infection to systemic bacteremia. As nasal colonization is the principal
      ecological niche for these bacteria and has been shown to be a significant risk factor in
      developing S. aureus infection, it is of importance to develop an efficient therapy that is
      able to clear this bacterium from human nostrils.

      In-vivo studies have shown that P128 treatment is efficacious in reducing and decolonizing
      MRSA bacteria from rat nostrils.

      Pre-clinical safety studies in animal models indicated no test drug related toxicity signs at
      the site of application or systemically.

      The present clinical trial is conducted in four parts. Part A consists of safety and
      tolerability studies in 4 cohorts of 3 healthy subjects who are administered a single dose of
      three escalating concentrations of the drug and placebo intra-nasally. Part B consists of
      safety &amp; tolerability as in part A but with multiple doses (3 doses/day for 5 days). Part C
      comprises of safety/tolerability as well as efficacy studies in chronic kidney disease
      patients stable on dialysis who are nasal carriers of S.aureus or MRSA on a treatment regimen
      as in Part B. Part D comprises of safety and efficacy studies in any patient who are nasal
      carriers of S.aureus or MRSA with single dose of 3 escalating concentrations of the drug and
      placebo intra-nasally.
