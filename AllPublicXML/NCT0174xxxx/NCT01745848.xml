  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary hypothesis is that Roflumilast (500 μcg, once daily) will significantly decrease
      surrogate markers of bone metabolism and early cardiovascular disease in individuals with
      moderate to severe airflow obstruction and a chronic bronchitis phenotype.

      Study participants will be given Roflumilast 500 micrograms daily for 30 days. At baseline,
      prior to drug administration, blood samples will be collected for analysis of markers of bone
      metabolism (C-terminal telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTx), Amino-terminal Propeptide of
      Type-1 Procollagen (P1NP) and participants will undergo measurement of endothelial function
      with measurement of brachial flow mediated dilation. After completion of one month of
      Roflumilast therapy, participants will have a repeat blood collection for measurement of CTx
      and P1NP and repeat measurement of brachial flow mediated dilation testing.

    <time_frame>30 days - measurements at baseline and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Serum samples were obtained at baseline and after participants took a once daily, 500 mcg roflumilast dose for 30 days. Samples were obtained in the semi-fasting state, processed, and stored for batch analysis at the end of the study. C-terminal peptide of type 1 collagen (CTx), a marker of bone resorption, was analyzed using a commercially available immunoassay (Roche Elecsys 2010 analyzer, Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany). Serum amino-terminal propeptide of type-1 procollagen (P1NP) was measured by ELISA (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA). All assays were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline of Measurements of Brachial Artery Flow Mediated Dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days - measured at baseline and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants had flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery measured at the baseline visit and at the follow-up visit after receiving 30 days of roflumilast 500 mcg daily. An ultrasound probe was placed over the brachial artery and the brachial artery diameter was measured in real time. A blood pressure cuff positioned below the elbow was then inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic pressure for five minutes. After five minutes of occlusion, the blood pressure cuff was released and the brachial artery diameter was again measured in real time. The amount of dilation expressed as the absolute change, in millimeters, from baseline diameter was quantified using the ultrasound images obtained 60 seconds after cuff release.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline of Measurements of Brachial Artery Flow Mediated Dilation</title>
        <description>Participants had flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery measured at the baseline visit and at the follow-up visit after receiving 30 days of roflumilast 500 mcg daily. An ultrasound probe was placed over the brachial artery and the brachial artery diameter was measured in real time. A blood pressure cuff positioned below the elbow was then inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic pressure for five minutes. After five minutes of occlusion, the blood pressure cuff was released and the brachial artery diameter was again measured in real time. The amount of dilation expressed as the absolute change, in millimeters, from baseline diameter was quantified using the ultrasound images obtained 60 seconds after cuff release.</description>
