  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low total testosterone (TT) is present in about 30% of men aged &gt;60 years and in up to 7% of
      younger men. Male hypogonadism is associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases as
      well as with increased mortality. There is evidence showing a relationship of TT with vitamin
      D in men. We aim at evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on TT and metabolic
      parameters in hypogonadal men. We will study the effects of 20,000 IU vitamin D weekly in a
      12 wk randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 100 men with TT &lt;3.0 ng/ml and
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) &lt;30 ng/ml (patients) as well as in 100 men with TT ≥3.0 ng/ml
      and 25(OH)D &lt;30 ng/ml (controls). Vitamin D supplementation might be a safe therapeutic
      approach improving TT levels as well as metabolic parameters in hypogonadal men. Further the
      effects of vitamin D on androgens will be evaluated in eugonadal men.
