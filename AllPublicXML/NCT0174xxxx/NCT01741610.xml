      This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of rapid crystalloid (Lactated Ringer's
      solution) or colloid (hydroxyethyl starch; HES) cohydration with a second intravenous access
      line on the incidence of hypotension and ephedrine requirement during spinal anaesthesia for
      caesarean section.

      Background: Spinal anaesthesia for caesarean delivery is often associated with hypotension.
      This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of rapid crystalloid (Lactated Ringer's
      solution) or colloid (hydroxyethyl starch; HES) cohydration with a second intravenous access
      line on the incidence of hypotension and ephedrine requirement during spinal anaesthesia for
      caesarean section.

      Methods: We studied 90 women with uncomplicated pregnancies undergoing elective caesarean
      section under spinal anaesthesia. Intravenous access was established in all with two
      peripheral intravenous lines, the first being used for the baseline volume infusion.
      Immediately after induction of spinal anaesthesia, Lactated Ringer's solution (Group L) or
      HES (Group C) infusions were started at the maximal possible rate via the second line in
      groups L and C respectively. The third group (Group E) patients received lactated Ringer's
      solution at a 'keep vein open' rate to maintain the double-blind nature. The incidence of
      hypotension, ephedrine requirements, total amount of volume and side effects were recorded.
