  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients of mild to moderate degree of arsenical palmer keratosis will be treated with
      garlic oil capsule orally for 12 weeks to examine its effectiveness in reducing body arsenic
      load and clinical symptoms. Similar treatment with similar number of arsenic exposed controls
      and healthy volunteers will be included for comparison.

      Thousands of Bangladeshi are suffering from arsenic-induced keratosis affecting palms and
      soles. Palmer keratosis, particularly in young female, affects the socioeconomic condition.
      Till today there is no effective treatment.

      Twenty patients of mild to moderate degree of arsenical palmer keratosis will be treated with
      garlic oil in soft capsule (10 mg/day) orally for 12 weeks. Similar treatment will be given
      to 20 arsenic exposed controls and 20 healthy volunteers for comparison. The aim of this
      study is to examine the effectiveness of oral administration of garlic oil to reduce body
      arsenic load and clinical symptoms of arsenical palmer keratosis.
