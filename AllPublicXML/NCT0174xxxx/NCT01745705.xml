  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical spine manipulation (CSM) is utilized by many health care practitioners in the
      management of patients with neck pain and headache. How CSM works is not understood however,
      most researchers agree that there is likely a combination of mechanical, neurophysiological
      and placebo effects. This study will test for possible neurophysiological effects by
      examining for changes in a person's ability to reposition their head and neck in space, and
      maintain their balance following CSM.

      Consenting participants will have their proprioception tested through a joint repositioning
      error test for their cervical spine, and also have their balance tested through a Neurocom
      Balancemaster. Following these pre-intervention measures, they will receive in a random
      order, either a cervical spine manipulation (CSM) or a sham manipulation, and then have tests
      repeated to analyze for changes and differences between interventions.

    <time_frame>1 day (Immediately after the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects wear a headband with a mounted laser pointer and sit 1 meter away from a wall. They assume their comfortable neutral cervical posture and then close their eyes and extend their cervical spine and return to their neutral posture with eyes closed. The laser pointer marks the point of return and we measure the difference between start and end points for error.</description>

    <description>Subjects stand on a force plate on a SMART Neurocom Balance Master and complete a Sensory Organization Test (SOT) program which assesses somatosensory, visual and vestobular systems used in maintaining balance.</description>
