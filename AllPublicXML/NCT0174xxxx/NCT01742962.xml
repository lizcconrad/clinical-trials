    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory data collection is to strengthen our knowledge of some of the
      rarer distresses following surgical removal of the prostate. In general these are:

        -  Side effects related to sexuality, including:

        -  Altered perception of orgasm,

        -  Orgasm associated pain,

        -  Penile shortening and deformity.

        -  Side effects related to urinary incontinence.

        -  Urinary tract infection after operation.

        -  Influence of distress on sexual quality of life.

        -  Influence of distress on the patient´s sex drive.

      In addition information on a range of demographics and information on the patient´s erectile
      function will be collected.

      Approximately 1 out of 6 men will, at some point of their life become diagnosed with prostate
      cancer. Treatment options included medication therapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. This
      data collection aims to gather information on some of the lesser known distresses experienced
      by patients following surgical removal of the prostate gland.

      Erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence remain common, but thoroughly investigated side
      effects. Thus they will not be of primary interest here, but considered factors for
      correlation. During the last couple of years, a series of lesser known side effects have come
      to investigators attention. These include altered perception of orgasm, orgasm related pain,
      sexual-related urinary incontinence, and shortening -and impairing deviations of the penis.
      Few studies have investigated these side effects, and clear knowledge of why, and how often
      these problems arise, remain scarce. This study will contribute to that knowledge.

      In addition, the questionnaire will include a series of exploratory questions, concerning
      lower urinary tract infections, treatment satisfaction, alcohol and urinary incontinence,
      reasons for abandoning treatment for erectile dysfunction, and an assessment of libido prior
      to and after radical prostatectomy.

      The data collection will include approximately 400 patients from the department of urology at
      the University Hospital in Herlev, Copenhagen, Denmark. A questionnaire will be sent to
      patients together with a stamped addressed envelope in order to optimize the response rate.
      Results will be kept in a separate database from personal information.
