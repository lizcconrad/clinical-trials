    <textblock>
      To investigate whether there is a food-effect with oral administration with EB-1020 as well
      as to obtain information on the safety, and tolerability of EB-1020 in a range of doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  To investigate the safety and tolerance of single doses of EB-1020 immediate release
           (IR) versus three sustained release (SR) formulations.

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerance of a single oral dose of a SR formulation of
           EB-1020 in the fed and fasted state.

        -  To investigate the safety, tolerance, and cognitive effects of multiple oral rising
           doses of a SR formulation of EB-1020.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize the single dose and steady state pharmacokinetic profiles of EB-1020 SR
           formulations.

        -  To investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profile of EB-1020 SR following
           single oral doses.

         10. Have a significant infection (such as influenza) or known inflammatory process on
             screening or admission

         11. Have acute gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of screening or admission (e.g.
