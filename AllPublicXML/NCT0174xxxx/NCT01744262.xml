  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) has gained popularity during the
      past decade and has widely replaced conventional open prostatectomy in many institutions due
      to reduced blood loss, nerve sparing, less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay.
      However, laparoscopic surgery is performed with intraperitoneal carbon dioxide insufflation,
      which leads to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). In particular, robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) usually requires a steep Trendelenburg position
      and often prolonged insufflation times, which is known to effect the increase in IOP during
      surgery and may result in ophthalmic complications such as postoperative vision loss (POVL).
      The majority of patients undergoing RALRP is old aged and often present with comorbidities.
      Advanced age, underlying diabetes mellitus (DM) or hypertension renders the patient
      vulnerable to damage due to increased IOP. Moreover, the possibility of the patient having
      undiagnosed glaucoma is also increased, and therefore methods to prevent such complications
      are needed. As of now, intravenous hypnotic agents, inhalation anesthetics and opioids have
      been reported to decrease IOP by relaxing extraocular muscle tone and increasing aqueous
      humour outflow to some extent. Among these agents, propofol has been reported to be more
      effective than other inhalational anesthetics in decreasing IOP. The goal of this
      prospective, randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of propofol and sevoflurane
      on IOP in patients undergoing RALRP in the steep Trendelenburg position with carbon dioxide
      pneumoperitoneum.
