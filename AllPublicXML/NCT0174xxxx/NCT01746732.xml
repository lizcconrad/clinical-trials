      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of evacetrapib on oral contraceptives
      (Ortho-Cyclen®) when given to healthy female participants. The amount of female hormones
      found in the blood will be measured and compared when taken alone and when taken with
      evaceptrapib. Each woman will participate in two study periods. Information about any side
      effects that may occur will also be collected.
