      Survivorship Care Planning may improve overall well-being and quality of life of colorectal
      and lung cancer survivors

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the feasibility and acceptability of an Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) driven
      Survivorship Care Planning (SCP) intervention for colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Development of the infrastructure and strategy for a larger comparative intervention
      study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo Survivorship Care Planning comprising disease surveillance, management of
      potential long-term and late effects, psycho-social-spiritual issues, and healthy living
      recommendations.
