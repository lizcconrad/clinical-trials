  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial cannulation is a commonly performed invasive procedure in the operation room, the
      emergency department, and in the intensive care unit. The indications include the need for
      continuous blood-pressure monitoring, frequent arterial blood-gas analysis, and repeated
      blood sampling for laboratory evaluation. This procedure can be challenging even in the best
      of hands. Traditionally, the artery is located by feeling the pulse of the patient. The pulse
      may, however be weak or absent in patients with hypotension, edema, obesity or local
      thrombosis due to previous arterial cannulation in the same location. Furthermore, the
      catheter may not be passed successfully into the artery, despite apparent good blood return
      on initial puncture, or hematoma and spasms of the artery may develop after failed attempts,
      thus making further attempts even more difficult. While ultrasound (US) is being used with
      increasing frequency for central venous access, fewer clinicians are familiar with US-guided
      arterial catheterization. The aim of this study is to investigate if ultrasound facilitates
      arterial cannulation in children â‰¤24 months compared with the palpation method and to
      investigate the potential extra costs/savings of introducing the method. This study
      hypothesizes that the ultrasound method will facilitate arterial cannulation in small
      children compared with the palpation method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children 24 months or younger

          -  Children undergoing elective surgical procedures where arterial cannulation is planned
             by the attending anaesthetist. These procedures include cardiac surgery, craniotomies,
             cranial vault surgery, and some abdominal procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal of consent from the parents

          -  Refusal of participation from the anaesthetist

          -  Children with anticipated circulatory instability after anaesthesia induction

               1. Pulmonary hypertension defined as an estimated pulmonary arterial pressure which
                  is greater than or equal to 66% of systemic blood pressure

               2. Children with severe heart failure (right and/or left)
