  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia results in the development of atelectasis in the dependent areas of the
      lungs exposing patients to an increased risk of hypoxemia. During laparoscopic procedures,
      pneumoperitoneum increases already present atelectasis.

      Several methods have been suggested to reduce the impact of atelectasis during surgery.
      However, few intraoperative modalities for the diagnosis and monitoring of atelectasis are
      available. Lung ultrasound imaging is a promising non-invasive, non-radiant, portable and
      easy to use tool that as yet to be studied in the intraoperative setting.

      This observational study will aim to clarify the role of lung ultrasound imaging during
      laparoscopic surgery for the diagnostic and monitoring of atelectasis.

      This study is designed to:

        -  Demonstrate a link between the lung ultrasound aeration score, the partial pressure of
           oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio and the
           oxygenation index.

        -  In the event of intraoperative desaturation, study the impact of positive end-expiratory
           pressure (PEEP) and/or increase of FiO2 on the aeration score.

        -  Study the impact of pain on diaphragmatic function and the aeration score.

      Our hypothesis is that lung ultrasound imaging allows detection of lung aeration changes
      associated with induction of general anesthesia, pneumoperitoneum, emergence from anesthesia
      and changes occurring during the stay in the recovery room.

      On arrival in the operating theatre, each patient will undergo a baseline lung ultrasound
      examination.

      The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. The radial artery will be
      cannulated after induction of anesthesia for blood gas monitoring.

      Lung ultrasound examinations will be performed 5 minutes following induction of general
      anesthesia and 5 minutes after insufflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide. In the event
      of a desaturation needing an intervention (increase of FiO2 or PEEP), ultrasound imaging will
      be repeated before and after the intervention. Presence of a pneumothorax or endobronchial
      intubation will be assessed during each examination. Fifteen minutes after arrival and
      immediately before discharge from the recovery room, lung ultrasound examinations will also
      be performed.

      FiO2 and vital signs will be recorded at each ultrasound examination. Arterial blood samples
      will be collected simultaneously. Pain rating using the visual analog scale and diaphragmatic
      function will be assessed during the preoperative ultrasound examination and before discharge
      from the recovery room.
