  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of high quality evidence to guide conservative care for patients with posterior
      tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD) has led to controversy over clinical care. Numerous orthotic
      devices are available to avoid a costly and debilitating surgery but no consensus on which to
      use has been made. The current study aims to link biomechanical testing of selected devices
      to clinical outcomes in subjects with PTTD after wearing a device for 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthotic devices serve as essential elements of conservative care programs for posterior
      tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD). Data on currently used devices remain limited. Current
      device designs are restrictive and focus on correction of flatfoot kinematics in subjects
      with stage II PTTD. Restrictive designs that limit ankle motion may lead to weakness and
      altered gait dynamics. It remains unclear if less restrictive device designs would be more
      optimal for subjects with stage II PTTD. The aims of the current proposal are to examine the
      in-vivo biomechanics of different device designs and to use outcomes to identify the device
      and design optimal for subjects with stage II PTTD. Research Design: This study will use a
      laboratory based repeated measures design to explore the function of four different orthotic
      devices in a sample of 60 subjects with stage II PTTD at baseline. Then each subject will be
      followed prospectively for 12 weeks while wearing one of the orthotic devices. Clinical
      outcomes including strength, tendon morphology, and self-reported outcomes will be measured
      at 12 weeks. Baseline foot kinematics will be collected using a three segment foot model
      (first metatarsal, calcaneus, tibia) while data on ankle kinetics will be derived from the
      kinematic data and the ground reaction forces. Impact: There are currently no head-to-head
      comparisons available among the various devices used in the conservative management of stage
      II PTTD. The proposed study will provide the necessary controlled data to determine the
      kinematic and kinetic effects of selected devices and the specific components needed to
      optimize device design. Outcomes will be used to determine which designs are successful to
      use clinically.

    <description>The Foot Function Index - Revised (FFI-R) is a newly published version of the original Foot Function Index (FFI) [45]. The original FFI is a validated, disease specific questionnaire that is widely used to measure foot function and document outcomes in observational studies of PTTD [31, 33]. Rasch analyses for the FFI-R indicated a Pearson reliability of 0.96 and item reliability of 0.93. The domains of the 34 items in the FFI-R questionnaire include pain and stiffness, social/emotional issues, personal disability, and social activity limitation. Although the FFI-R is relatively new, the 23 items from the FFI were the basis for the revised scale. The FFI has been used to measure outcomes for a variety of foot and ankle problems including plantar fasciitis, diabetes, and PTTD [32]. The overall score of the FFI-R will be used as a primary outcome variable while the subscales will be used as secondary outcome variables.</description>
