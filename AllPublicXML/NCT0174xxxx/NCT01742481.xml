  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is part of a career development award. The first two phases of research
      involve collaborating with adult survivors of childhood cancer representing both sexes and
      three ethnic/racial groups (African American, Hispanic, and White). THe collaboration will
      focus upon developing educational material that is helpful in teaching survivors about health
      risks related to cancer treatments and about survivorship care. The third phase is a
      randomized controlled trial that will randomly (like a flip of coin)place survivors into one
      of two groups. One group will meet in -person with a group leader three times, once each week
      over three weeks. The other group will receive an information packet that contains websites,
      books, and resources similar to content provided in-person within a group format to the other
      group. The goal is to help adult survivors get involved in specialized healthcare so they can
      remain healthy. This involves getting a copy of their medical record to understand what
      treatments they received and working with health providers to get an individualized
      survivorship care plan.

      The proposed study includes three aims: intervention development using focus groups,
      intervention refinement based upon a pre-pilot, and a randomized controlled pilot study of
      the final intervention. All participants are adult survivors of childhood cancer, males and
      females from three ethnic backgrounds (Black, Hispanic, White). The randomized control pilot
      is designed to assess the acceptibility/feasibility of a community-based intervention to
      engage childhood cancer survivors more actively in cancer follow-up care. Pilot data on
      outcome measures will provide data parameters (e.g. means and variances of groups) for
      accurate power analyses and sample size calculation to support a subsequent efficacy trial.

      Relevance: This project is a critical initial step towards addressing systemic problems in
      transition of care and has the potential to decrease morbidity of adult childhood cancer
      survivors.

      Outcomes include: knowledge of late effects and follow-up care, uncertainty related to 1)
      relapse, 2) secondary cancers, and 3) late effects, perceived efficacy to communicate with
      physician, access to childhood medical records, self-efficacy to obtain medical records, and
      the number of completed health care visits at a six month follow-up interview.
