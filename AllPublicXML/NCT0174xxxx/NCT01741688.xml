  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study evaluates the use and efficacy of intravenous (IV) tocilizumab in
      routine clinical practice in participants with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.
      Eligible participants initiated on tocilizumab treatment in accordance with the local label
      were followed for 6 months.

    <description>The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the number 28 refers to the 28 joints that are examined in this assessment. To calculate the DAS28 the following assessments are done: 1) count the number of swollen joints (out of the 28 [sw28]), 2) count the number of tender joints (out of the 28 [t28]), 3) measure Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and 4) ask the participant to make a 'global assessment of health' (GH) indicated by marking a 10 cm line between very good and very bad.
The Score is developed under the follow formula:
DAS28(4) = 0.56*sqrt(t28) + 0.28*sqrt(sw28) + 0.70*Ln(ESR) + 0.014*GH Where, t=tender joints; sw=swollen joints; ESR= Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate; GH=Global assessment of health score.
This score may range from 0 to 9.3, where a DAS28 of greater than 5.1 implies active disease, less than 3.2 low disease activity, and less than 2.6 remission.</description>

        <title>Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints (DAS28)</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the number 28 refers to the 28 joints that are examined in this assessment. To calculate the DAS28 the following assessments are done: 1) count the number of swollen joints (out of the 28 [sw28]), 2) count the number of tender joints (out of the 28 [t28]), 3) measure Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and 4) ask the participant to make a 'global assessment of health' (GH) indicated by marking a 10 cm line between very good and very bad.
The Score is developed under the follow formula:
DAS28(4) = 0.56*sqrt(t28) + 0.28*sqrt(sw28) + 0.70*Ln(ESR) + 0.014*GH Where, t=tender joints; sw=swollen joints; ESR= Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate; GH=Global assessment of health score.
This score may range from 0 to 9.3, where a DAS28 of greater than 5.1 implies active disease, less than 3.2 low disease activity, and less than 2.6 remission.</description>
        <time_frame>At Visit 1 (Baseline), Observation 1: up to 4 weeks, Observation 2: up to 8 weeks; Observation 3: up to 12 weeks; Observation 4: up to 16 weeks and Observation 5: up to 20 weeks</time_frame>
