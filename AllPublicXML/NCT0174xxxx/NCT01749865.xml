    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study. About 200 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who
      underwent radical resection will be included. The patients will be randomized to group A
      (receive CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly follow up) without any anti-cancer
      treatment after resection of HCC, and the randomize ratio will be 1:1.
