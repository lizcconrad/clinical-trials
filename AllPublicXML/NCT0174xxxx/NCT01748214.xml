  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants in neonatal intensive care units are increasing exposed to non-invasive ventilatory
      support modes (nasal continuous positive airway pressure - NCPAP and high flow nasal cannula:
      &gt;1 L/min flow - HFNC). While there have been small descriptive studies of noise exposure in
      infants on NCPAP, there have been no comparative trials done comparing noise exposure in
      infants undergoing both NCPAP and HFNC.

      Objective: Using a cross-over model determine noise exposure levels in infants exposed to
      similar levels of respiratory support provided by NCPAP and HFNC.

      Infants born &lt; 32 weeks, in an incubator, and &gt; 7 days postnatal that were maintained on
      either on NCPAP or HFNC to maintain SaO2 in a range of 88 - 92 %. Study infants had decibel
      measurements obtained every 15 seconds for 30 minutes using a noise dosimeter (NoisePro
      DLX-1). The microphone for the dosimeter was suspended from the inside of the incubator such
      that it hung 1 foot above the infants nose and mouth. The exhalation port for NCPAP was
      placed outside of the incubator. Repeated measurement periods on the same mode of support
      were made within a 72 hour period. Each infant the acted as their own control and was
      switched within 7 days to the alternative respiratory support method that maintained similar
      SaO2 goals and repeat measurements were obtained. Comparisons of mean decibel levels during
      recording were compared using paired t-tests.
