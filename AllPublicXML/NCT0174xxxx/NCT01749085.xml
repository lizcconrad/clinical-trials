    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine what effect a high fat meal will have on the drug exposure of
      PF-04449913. The study also aims to determine the effect of a strong enzyme (CYP3A4)
      inhibitor on drug exposure of PF-04449913.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years
             (inclusive):Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a
             detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and
             pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  A positive urine drug screen

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at Screening. If
             QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility. Subjects with one of the following currently in the past 6
             months: myocardial infarction, congenital long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes or
             clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females and females of childbearing potential including those with
             tubal ligation. To be considered for enrollment, women of 45 to 55 years of age who
             are postmenopausal (defined as being amenorrheic for at least 2 years) must have
             confirmatory FSH test results at Screening.
