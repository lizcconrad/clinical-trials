  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous Azythromycin therapy is considerably more expensive than oral therapy. The
      investigators believe that intravenous therapy is prolonged more that necessary and that oral
      therapy can be used much earlier in the course of the disease. The investigators plan to
      check if that statement is true and intervene in order to shorten the intravenous therapy.

      The study will be performed in two stages. First a retrospective review of medical files of
      50 patients hospitalized in the Haemek Medical Center with severe community acquired
      pneumonia, treated with azythromycin. The files will be reviewed for the criteria clinical
      improvement, and for azythromycin therapy, oral or intravenous.

      The results of this review will help us define the appropriate behavioral intervention in
      order to cause doctors to transfer from IV to PO therapy at the earliest appropriate time. An
      intervention such as posters, pharmacy overseeing etc will be introduced. 3 months after the
      intervention, an additional 50 files of pneumonia patients treated with azythromycin will be
      reviewed in order to check the efficacy of the intervention.

      The Review board and the NIH will be updated about the intervention, as soon as the
      investigators have decided what intervention is appropriate
