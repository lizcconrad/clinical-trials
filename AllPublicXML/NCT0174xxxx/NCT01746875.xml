      The purpose of this study is to determine treatment effects in patients with retinal pigment
      epithelium detachment (PED) in relation to Age Related Maculopathy (AMD). Patients with newly
      diagnosed PED without choroidal neovascularisations (CNV), will be randomized to either
      treatment or observation. The treatment group will first be given injections with anti
      Vascular Endothelium Growth Factor (anti-VEGF). If the injections do not have any effect,
      Verteporfin Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) will be given. All patients will be followed for a
      period of 2 years. It is hypothesized that treatment stops the progression of the disease and
      stabilizes the vision in this subgroup of patients with AMD.
