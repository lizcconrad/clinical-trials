  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to draw blood from vessels near the liver in patients undergoing
      liver surgery. This will be performed in both patients with cancer in order to learn more
      about circulating tumor cells, proteins and DNA mutations in the blood.

      The blood in patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases will be compared to blood
      taken from patients that do not have cancer that do not have cancer.

      Inclusion of patients with benign pathology will allow for the establishment of &quot;normal&quot;
      values which currently do not exist. We will then study whether tumor mutations can be used
      to predict recurrence and survival patterns.

    <description>Blood will be obtained from patients at the time of laparotomy for hepatic resection and/or hepatic arterial infusion pump placement, or pancreatic head resection . Blood will be drawn from a peripheral vein or artery (when an arterial catheter is present), the portal vein, and suprahepatic IVC and given to a research assistant and placed on ice followed by immediate processing. Total amount of blood drawn will not exceed fifty milliliters (50ml).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with resectable CRLM without extrahepatic metastases confirmed by tissue
             diagnosis or radiologic exam who are undergoing hepatic resection.

          -  All patients undergoing hepatic arterial infusion pump placement with or without
             without hepatic resection.

          -  Patients may have synchronous or metachronous CRLM

          -  Patients may have received prior cytotoxic (must be off for at least 2 weeks prior to
             surgery) or anti-angiogenic therapy (must be off for at least 6 weeks prior to
             surgery). Specific drugs are listed below.

          -  5-FU based chemotherapy - 2 weeks off

          -  Bevacizumab - 6 weeks off

          -  Cetuximab or panitumumab - 2 weeks off

          -  Control patients will include patients consented for pancreaticoduodenectomy for
             benign or pre-neoplastic lesions. If lesions assumed to be benign turn out to be
             malignant on final pathology, the blood will be discarded and the patient replaced.

          -  Patients undergoing a two-stage hepatectomy resection, or who are reevaluated for a
             second hepatectomy, will be considered for reenrollment to protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of extra-hepatic disease on pre-operative imaging or at operative
             exploration, excluding the primary colorectal tumor

          -  Those with known bleeding or clotting diatheses

          -  Patients diagnosed with chronic inflammatory diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid
             arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, etc.

          -  Pre- or intra-operative evidence of portal vein thrombosis or hypertension

          -  Patients who have taken immune modulating agents in the past 8 weeks including
             steroids, anti-TNF-Î±, interferon etc. Patients taking a single dose of Decadron as
             part of a chemotherapy regimen will not be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients who take daily anti-inflammatory medications such as COX-2 inhibitors or high
             dose NSAIDs. Patients taking a daily aspirin or acetaminophen or occasional
             anti-inflammatory medications will not be excluded from the study.

          -  If at the discretion of the operating surgeon, blood acquisition would lead to undue
             morbidity, the patient will be excluded and replaced

          -  Attending physicians authorized to obtain informed consent may exercise discretion in
             excluding individuals for appropriate medical or other reasons.
