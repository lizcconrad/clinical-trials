  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Braces have been used o treat stable (not requiring surgery) burst fractures with much
      success. Recently questions have been raised in regards to the importance of the brace. Some
      studies have results that suggest a brace is not important in having a good outcome. However,
      this has never been proven. This study is being conducted to see whether or not wearing a
      brace is important to having a good outcome.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the outcome between patients randomly
      assigned to a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) treatment group or no orthosis (NO)
      treatment group, for the management of an acute AO type A3 thoracolumbar fracture.

    <measure>Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post fracture</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) administered at 3 months post fracture. The RMDQ evaluates physical disability secondary to low back pain and is validated, simple to administer, sensitive, and reliable. The questionnaire evaluates 24 items to derive a score that varies between zero (no disability) and twenty-four (severe disability). Three months was chosen because it is the time point at which we expect a significant functional recovery and readiness to resume most normal activities.</description>

    <description>Overall satisfaction with treatment was assessed on a seven point scale, using the sentence, &quot;All things considered, how satisfied are you with the results of your recent treatment for your spine fracture?&quot; This is a recommended tool for assessing global satisfaction.</description>
