    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open-label study in approximately 200, and up to 240, healthy males and
      non-pregnant females, aged 18 years and older. This study is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent inactivated
      influenza H3N2v vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. Subjects will be stratified by age
      (approximately 100 (up to 120) subjects 18-64 years old and approximately 100 (up to 120)
      subjects &gt;/= 65 years old) to receive two doses of vaccine, delivered intramuscularly as
      15mcg HA/0.5mL dose, 21 days apart. The duration of the study for each subject will be
      approximately 7 months.

      This is a Phase II open-label study in approximately 200 (up to 240) healthy males and
      non-pregnant females, aged 18 years and older. This study is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent inactivated
      influenza H3N2 variant (H3N2v) vaccine (MIV) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. Subjects will be
      stratified by age (approximately 100 (up to 120) subjects 18-64 years old and approximately
      100 (up to 120) subjects &gt;/= 65 years old) to receive two doses of H3N2v MIV, delivered
      intramuscularly as 15 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA)/0.5 milliliter (mL) dose, 21
      days apart (see Table 1). Subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine prior to
      (2 weeks if given the inactivated vaccine or 4 weeks if given the live, attenuated vaccine)
      the first H3N2v vaccination. Alternatively, subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza
      vaccine at any time after completion of the Day 42 visit or following an early termination
      visit. Safety will be measured by the occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic
      reactogenicity on the day of each H3N2v vaccination through 7 days after each H3N2v
      vaccination, adverse events through 42 days after the first H3N2v vaccination, and serious
      adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical conditions through 7 months after the
      first H3N2v vaccination. Immunogenicity testing will include performing hemagglutination
      inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained on the day of and
      prior to each H3N2v vaccination (Days 0 and 21), approximately 8 days after each H3N2v
      vaccination (Days 8 and 29), and approximately 21 days after the second H3N2v vaccination
      (Day 42).

      From a subset of healthy adult subjects (up to 30 volunteers 18-64 years old enrolled at the
      Emory VTEU site who consent to blood donation for the immunology exploratory assays), an
      additional volume of venous blood will be drawn on Days 0, 8, 21, 29 and 42 to determine the
      specificity/cross reactivity of antibodies from H3N2v-reactive B cells with other influenza
      subtypes (e.g., 2009 H1N1 pandemic HA) and most recent H3 seasonal HA to define the molecular
      profile of antibody repertoire changes in circulating B cells after H3N2v vaccination, and to
      characterize the antibody-secreting cell (ASC), monoclonal antibody (mAb), and CD4+ T cell
      responses to H3N2v vaccination. The duration of the study for each subject will be
      approximately 7 months. Parent protocol to sub-study 12-0089 and 12-0015.
