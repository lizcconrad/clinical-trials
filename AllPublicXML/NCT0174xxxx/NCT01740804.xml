      Primary endpoint To observe the dynamic changes of CTC during the process of platinum based
      chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC.

      To study the relationship between CTC count and clinical outcome of chemotherapy (ORR and
      PFS).

      Secondary endpoint To study the relationship between CTC and overall survival. To study the
      molecular feature of CTC, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, CD117, etc.

      This is a prospective observational non-intervention study evaluating the dynamic CTC count
      during the chemotherapy. Patients provide written informed consent and pass the screening.
      Peripheral blood will be drawn before and after the first line chemotherapy. Analyze the
      relationship between CTC count and clinical outcome. The time points of blood drawing are set
      as following: once prior to 1st cycle of chemotherapy, once 1 week prior to 2nd cycle of
      chemotherapy, posterior to 4th cycle (or less than 4th cycle) of chemotherapy and once when
      progressive disease (PD). The specific blood tube CellSave Tube will be used, 7.5ml blood
      sample every time. One follow-up (including by phone) be made every 3 month after PD until
      death. The clinical outcome of first line chemotherapy will be ultimately obtained.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically documented, locally advanced or recurrent (stage IIIb and
             not amenable or combined modality treatment) or metastatic (stage IV) non-small cell
             lung cancer.

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 2.

          -  Patients without prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic anti-neoplastic therapy.
             Previous adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment or combine chemoradiotherapy for stage I
             to III is permitted if completed &gt; 12 months before enrollment.

          -  According to routine first line doublet chemotherapy in clinical practice, Cisplatin
             or carboplatin combined with gemcitabine or paclitaxel or docetaxol or Vinorelbine
             were recommended.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease according to the RECIST (version 1.1) criteria.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Written (signed) informed Consent to participate in the study.

          -  Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:Liver function: SGOT
             (AST) and SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN in the absence of liver metastases or up to 5 X ULN
             in case of liver metastases. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5ULN.Bone marrow function:
             Granulocyte count ≥ 1,500/mm3 and platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 and hemoglobin ≥90g/dl.

             on modified Cockcroft-Gault formula).

          -  For all females of childbearing potential a negative serum/urine pregnancy test must
             be obtained within 48 hours before enrollment. Postmenopausal women must have been
             amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic anti-cancer therapy
             including target therapy. Previous adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment for
