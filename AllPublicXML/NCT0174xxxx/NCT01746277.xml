  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two different treatment modes for NSCLC patients who failed to epidermal growth
      factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) after initially responding to EGFR-TKI.
      One is EGFR-TKI combined with chemotherapy and the other is chemotherapy followed by
      EGFR-TKI. It is unclear which one is more suitable to this group of lung cancer patients. So
      this phase Ⅱclinical trial is designed to compare the efficiency and safety of these two
      different treatment modes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Responses to EGFR-TKIs are quiet dramatic and durable, especially in patients with EGFR gene
      classic mutations, such as 19 deletion or 21 leucine 858 arginine(L858R). However, most
      patients with NSCLC who respond to EGFR-TKIs eventually experience progression of disease
      after approximately 12 months. The lack of an established therapeutic option for NSCLC
      patients who have progressive disease after EGFR-TKIs failure poses a great challenge to
      physicians in terms of how best to manage this growing group of lung cancer patients.

      In clinical practice some of the initially EGFR-TKI sensitive tumors which progressed
      evidence a striking increase in tumor volume within several weeks, after being taken off
      EGFR-TKI. This response is called &quot;rebound phenomenon&quot;. Most experts still believe that these
      tumors continue to be &quot;oncogene-addicted&quot; to EGFR. So it is rational that EGFR-TKI combined
      with another chemotherapy regimen can be used to treat NSCLC after the failure of EGFR-TKI
      therapy.

      However in some phase Ⅱclinical trials involved a few NSCLC patients who failed to EGFR-TKI
      therapy, another treatment mode, that is to say, at least one cytotoxic chemotherapy was used
      firstly then switched to EGFR-TKI therapy until progression of disease, was used and called
      reintroduction or retreatment of EGFR-TKI. Using this treatment mode, some investigators
      reported the partial remission (PR) and disease control rate (DCR) were observed in 21.7%-36%
      and 65.2%-86% NSCLC patients.
