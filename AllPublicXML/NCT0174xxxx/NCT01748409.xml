    <measure>Evaluate association between clinical autonomic failure and neuropathological autonomic failure on biopsies.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>the main objective is to look after associations between :
anatomopathological signs of autonomic nervous system disorders seen on biopsies AND
clinical signs of signs of autonomic nervous system disorders seen through functional tests or through symptoms indicated by the patient on questionaries.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate association between autonomic failure and severity factors in Parkinson's disease</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Autonomic failure will be assessed through questionaries on symptoms and through functional tests.
Severity factors in parkinson disease will refer to various parameters like patient age.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate consequences of autonomic failure on quality of life and sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>quality of life and of sleep will be assessed through functional tests and through questionaries.</description>
