  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesions are the most frequent complication of abdominopelvic surgery. They are internal
      scar tissues which form as a result of surgery which may abnormally join together what were
      once separate tissues and organs.

      This study will assess the safety and usability of anti-adhesion agent (gel) when used after
      laparoscopic surgery.

      The study will enroll 30 patients, (randomised 2:1) with safety primary endpoint (adverse
      events in ADBLOCK and surgery only group) assessed at 28 days

      Title: Assessment of the Manageability and Safety of ADBLOCK Adhesion Barrier System in
      Laparoscopic Gynaecological surgery

      Design: Randomised controlled study to assess the safety, manageability and usability of
      ADBLOCK when used as an adjunct to laparoscopic surgery for the primary removal of ('virgin')
      myomas in women wishing to improve pregnancy outcomes.

      Use of ADBLOCK will be assessed against laparoscopic surgery alone in 30 patients (randomised
      2:1 ADBLOCK/surgery) with a pneumoperitoneum ≤90minutes.

      Clinical Site Locations:

        -  Oldenburg, Germany

        -  Neuss, Germany

        -  Berlin, Germany

      Patient Population: Women who have not completed their family planning and who are undergoing
      primary ('virgin') laparoscopic myomectomy with an aim to improve pregnancy outcomes.
