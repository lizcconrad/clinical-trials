  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of 6 months' dietary supplementation with
      omega-3 fatty acids and whole freeze dried blueberry powder in improving cognition in older
      adults. The effects of each of these interventions alone will also be assessed in order to
      determine whether the combined treatment confers synergistic or additive benefit relative to
      the effect of each therapy.

      After meeting inclusion criteria, one hundred-forty men and women, aged 62 to 80 years old,
      will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) omega-3 fatty acid and
      blueberry powder supplement, 2) omega-3 fatty acid and placebo powder, 3) placebo oil and
      blueberry powder supplement, or 4) placebo oil and placebo powder. They will participate in a
      24-week intervention with major assessments including neuropsychological and functional
      evaluation at pre-treatment baseline and during the final week of the intervention. In
      addition, an interim evaluation of neurocognitive function will be conducted at 12 weeks.
      Subjects will be asked to maintain diet diaries for three periods during the study. Mood will
      be assessed as a potential covariate of the neurobehavioral outcome measures and data on red
      blood cell fatty acid content, metabolic parameters, inflammation, and anthropometric factors
      will be gathered to assess compliance and explore individual differences in response to the
      intervention and to evaluate potential mechanisms of action.
