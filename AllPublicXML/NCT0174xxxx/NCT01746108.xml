  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GSK
      Biologicals' 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in children aged between 2 and 17 years of age having
      asplenia, splenic dysfunction or complement deficiencies.

      In addition, this study will include an age-matched control group of healthy children aged
      24-59 months in order to descriptively compare the immunogenicity of 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in
      the at-risk population to that of the general, healthy population one month after each
      pneumococcal vaccination.

    <time_frame>One month after Dose 1 (At Month 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -4, -5, -6A, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19A, -19F and -23F). Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per millilitre (μg/mL).

        Additional inclusion criteria for the At-risk groups:

          -  A male or female aged between, and including, 2 and 17 years at the time of first
             vaccination.

        maximum of 35 individuals with sickle-cell disease can be enrolled in the At-risk group.
        These subjects do not require assessment of the splenic function as sickle-cell disease is
        invariably associated with severe splenic dysfunction.

        - Complement deficiencies. For all subjects defined as At-risk the Investigator will make
        all efforts to collect information from the subject/subject's parent(s)/LAR(s) during the

        which have made a child at-risk of pneumococcal infection and/or the results of tests
        determining spleen dysfunction or complement deficiency. This should be documented in the
        medical records of the At-risk subject. No originals/copies of medical documentation are

        <title>Concentrations of Antibodies Against Vaccine Pneumococcal Serotypes in the At Risk Primed Group.</title>
        <description>Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -4, -5, -6A, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19A, -19F and -23F). Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per millilitre (μg/mL). The seropositivity cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration ≥ 0.05 μg/mL.
Antibody concentrations &lt; 0.05 μg/mL were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation.</description>

        <description>Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -4, -5, -6A, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19A,
-19F and -23F). Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per millilitre (μg/mL). The seropositivity cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration ≥ 0.05 μg/mL.
Antibody concentrations &lt; 0.05 μg/mL were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation.</description>
        <time_frame>One month after Dose 1 (At Month 1) and one month after Dose 2 (At Month 3)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one pneumococcal vaccine serotype or protein D for at least one blood sample taken after vaccination.</population>

*An at-risk subject was a subject with Congenital or acquired asplenia such as anatomic, surgical or functional asplenia, or Splenic dysfunction [some degree of functional asplenia, such as sickle-cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies, Hodgkin disease, rheumatologic diseases, systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), chronic gastrointestinal disorders, liver disease, infiltrative disorders, vascular disorder etc.] or Complement deficiencies, e.g.C1-C4, C5-C9, properdin factor H or factor D.</description>

The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 8. Antibody titers &lt; 8 were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT calculation. When number of subjects analysed = 1, Lower limit and Upper Limit values were entered as equal to the Geometric mean value. “999999.9” was used as placeholder when Upper Limit value was greater than “1.0E8”.</description>
