             clinic for required visits.

          5. The subject's melasma has persisted for greater than 6 months and has failed to
             respond to conventional treatment with hydroquinone cream or other topical lightening
             agents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is female and pregnant, has been pregnant within the last 3 months, is
             currently breast feeding or planning a pregnancy during the study period.

          2. The subject has a history of cutaneous photosensitization, porphyria, and
             hypersensitivity to porphyrins or photodermatosis.

          3. The subject has any skin pathology or condition that could interfere with the
             evaluation or requires the use of interfering topical or systemic therapy.

          4. The subject has an uncorrected coagulation defect or is currently using
             anti-coagulation medication (including but not limited to heavy aspirin therapy).

          5. The subject has any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, would make it
             unsafe for the subject to participate in this research study.

          6. The subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device trial, or has
             received an investigational drug or been treated with an investigational device within
             30 days prior to entering this study.

          7. The subject has used photosensitizing drugs (e.g., Declomycin, sulfa antibiotics,
             phenothiazines, etc.) within a timeframe where photosensitization from these drugs may
             still be present.

          8. The subject has the need to be exposed to artificial tanning devices or excessive
             sunlight during the trial.

          9. The subject has had prior treatment with parenteral gold therapy (gold sodium
             thiomalate).

         10. The subject has Diabetes Type 1 or 2.

         11. The subject has a sensitivity to hydroquinone or Retin-A.
