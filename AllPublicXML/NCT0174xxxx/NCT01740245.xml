  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatments for the macroscopic or pathologic lesions caused by HPV infection can be
      classified as topical, surgical, destructive, or immunomodulatory. Post surgical treatments
      generally consist of analgesic, anti-inflammatory and topical antimicrobial agents to reduce
      the risk of local infections.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of polyhexamethylene
      biguanide-based vaginal suppositories to a similar chlorhexidine-based treatment, in the post
      recovery regimen after surgical treatment of cervical lesions.

      Women who underwent to CO2 laser therapy for cervical lesions are randomly assigned to
      receive 10 days of antiseptic treatment with chlorhexidine digluconate vaginal suppositories,
      or polyhexamethylene biguanide vaginal suppositories (Monogin® / BiguanelleTM vaginal
      suppositories, Lo.Li.Pharma, Italy). A weekly follow-up check was performed for 6 weeks.
