    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the accuracy of performing cytological imprints of targeted
      biopsies when diagnosing prostate cancer.

      It is useful to know whether the biopsy is cancer or not, in order to know when to stop
      sampling and when to continue.

      The strategy is used in other types of cancer, e.g lung, breast etc

      Background:

      When substituting a random biopsy procedure with a few targeted biopsies, it is of outmost
      importance to know immediately if the biopsy is positive or not. A recent study has
      demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity of imprint cytology of random biopsies.

      Aim:

      The correlation between cytological imprints and histology of targeted prostate biopsies

      Material&amp;Method:

      All patients in this study are already participating in an ongoing randomized biopsy study
      (NCT01455792) comparing:

        1. Preoperative MRI and targeted biopsies + random biopsies .

        2. Random biopsies (gold standard).

      Only patients with a positive MRI were included in this collateral study.

      The cytological imprints (negative/positive) of each targeted biopsy is compared to the
      histology (negative/positive) and Gleason score.

    <measure>Interobserver variability</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cytological imprints will be evaluated by three different cytologists and classified as either negative or positive. The results will be compared to the histology which defines the gold standard. Any difference in evaluation will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>The detection rate of high grade cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cytology will be compared to the specific Gleason score in patients with positive histology in order to evaluate any difference in the detection rate of intermediate/high grade cancer (Gleason score 7 or higher) and low grade cancer (&lt;Gleason score 6).</description>
