  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to address both the management and evaluation of pain. The primary aim of
      this study is to determine the efficacy of low dose ketamine in adults with moderate to
      severe pain in the emergency department as compared with parenteral opioids alone. Another
      aim is to examine the safety of low dose ketamine compared to opioids alone.

      The investigators hypothesize that low dose ketamine will result in more effective pain
      control than morphine alone and will not be associated with an increase in adverse events.

    <textblock>
      Management and assessment of pain in the Emergency Department (ED) can be challenging.
      Treatment of pain is most often accomplished by parenteral opioids analgesics. However,
      inadequate analgesia is often a problem when opioids alone are relied on for pain control. In
      the peri-operative setting ketamine has been used as an adjunct to opioids for acute pain.
      Ketamine may play a role in maximizing analgesia in the ED.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in reported pain score at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and hourly for 6 hrs or until discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Between patient arrival and patient discharge</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, to assess our primary aim, efficacy of pain control, we will use patient reported pain scores and amount of rescue analgesia (parenteral morphine) received. Trained research assistants (RA) will ask participants to report their pains scores using a numerical pain rating scale (NPRS). The NPRS used will be a 0 to 10 rating scale: a rating of 0 corresponds to &quot;no pain at all,&quot; whereas a rating of 10 is the &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Baseline NPRS will be measured after randomization, but just before administration of ketamine or placebo injection and morphine (Baseline). Repeat measurements will be taken at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and hourly following treatment with the study drug, for 6hrs or until the patient leaves the ED. The amount of rescue analgesia will be recorded at each time point. The ED course will also be reviewed post hoc by the RAs and physician investigators to confirm analgesia received. The main outcome measure will be the change in pain score over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety--Determine the incidence of adverse events associated with ketamine and morphine, versus morphine alone at 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and hourly up to 6 hours.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes, 30 minutes, hourly up to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will further be defined as Hypotension (SBP &lt; 90), Hypertension (SBP &gt;180, or Diastolic Blood Pressure &gt;110), Presence of nausea/vomiting, presence of hallucinations, Respiratory depression (pOx&lt;92%, Respirator Rate&lt;12, EtCO2 &gt;40), and need for naloxone. All patients will be monitored continuously with cardiac telemetry, pulse oximetry, and capnography following administration of the study drug. Level of sedation will be assessed using an adaptation of the Ramsay Scoring System and the Pasero Opioid Induced Sedation Scale. (Appendix 2) Further, the ED and inpatient course will be reviewed post hoc by the RAs and physician investigators who will record: Time to inpatient admission or discharge, inpatient length of stay, time to operative intervention, outcome of admission (i.e. discharge to home, SNF, rehab) and any morbidity and mortality suffered by the patient and medical complications (myocardial infarction, respiratory infection, etcâ€¦).</description>
