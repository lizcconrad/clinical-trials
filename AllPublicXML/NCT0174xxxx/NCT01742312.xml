  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Curative treatment for oesophageal cancer involves undertaking chemotherapy followed by an
      operation to remove the tumour. Chemotherapy has several effects upon the body, including
      effects upon the systems that control the creation and breakdown of muscle. We aim to review
      these effects by recording changes in the amount of exercise patients are able to undertake
      after chemotherapy and reviewing changes in muscle mass.

  <detailed_description>

      We aim to review the effects of chemotherapy on skeletal muscle mass and cardio-respiratory
      performance in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. All patients will be assessed by a
      Consultant Anaesthetist and a medical member of the Research team before commencing
      chemotherapy and after finishing their course. These assessments include a nutritional
      assessment, performance status assessments, blood assays, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry
      (DEXA) scans, cardio-pulmonary exercise (CPEX) testing and a muscle biopsy.
