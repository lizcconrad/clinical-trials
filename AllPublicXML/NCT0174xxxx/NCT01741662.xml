    <textblock>
      The objective of the LEA-PsyCog project is to assess the prevalence of psychiatric disorders
      and psychocognitive impairments in adolescents surviving childhood leukemia .

      The second objective is to explore the complex relationships between psycocognitive
      development and soiciodemodemographics data, main characteristics of leukemia, treatments,
      side-effects, quality of life and characteristics of proxyies environment.

      3. Materials and Methods The LEA study is based on the constitution of a multi-centric
      prospective cohort in 11 university hospitals: Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand, Grenoble, Lyon,
      Paris (Trousseau, Robert Debré, St Louis), Marseille, Montpellier, Nancy, Nice, Rennes. Are
      inclued in LEA all the children diagnosed and treated for acute leukemia since January 1980
      (incident and prevalent cases), surviving at month 24 for the AML and ALL grafted in complete
      remission and at month 48 for the ALL not grafted in first complete remission.

      The LEA Psy-Cog study rests on a sample of the LEA cohort. Are included the patients
      12-17-years-old from the PACA-Corse sub-cohort (administrative district of 4 million of
      people which corresponds to the Marseille and Nice centers). Patients from this two centers
      are the patients with the more important length of survey, allowing us to produce a not
      biaised estimation of prevalence rate. Finally, the choice of this subsample is supported by
      the proximity of the Mediterranean Center for Adolescent in Marseilles, specifically
      dedicated to the psychological follow-up of children suffering from cancer.
