  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative venous return stability and euvolemia is essential in management of morbidly
      obese patients. Fluid therapy regimes for patients with high BMI, especially with focus on
      preoperative management, are rare and not in consensus.The aim of this study was to evaluate
      preoperative effects of a standardized, ideal body weight (IBW) based volume-challenge on
      hemodynamics, stroke volume and level of venous return to the heart.

      34 morbidly obese patients scheduled for bariatric surgery underwent a preoperative
      three-week preparation by rapid-weight-loss-diet (RWL) to be accepted for bariatric surgery.
      Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in the awake state before and
      after volume-challenge (VC) based on 6ml colloids /kg IBW. Feasibility of standardized VC was
      evaluated by TTE. Dynamic and non-dynamic echocardiographic indices for VC were studied.

      Main outcome measures: Volume-responsiveness and level of venous return before and after
      volume-challenge were assessed by TTE. An increase of stroke volume ≥ 13% was considered as a
      volume-responder.
