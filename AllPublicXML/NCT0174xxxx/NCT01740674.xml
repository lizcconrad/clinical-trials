      One of the biggest challenges of conducting research where the investigators follow people
      over a long period of time is keeping the participants involved. One of way that
      investigators may be able to improve participant involvement in research is to give
      participants the opportunity to complete their questionnaires online.

      Here's how the investigators think the Internet data collection system will help to keep
      participants involved and ultimately help to answer important questions about the effects of
      nutrition during pregnancy:

        1. It will allow investigators to present complicated questionnaires in a way that doesn't
           confuse participants. For example, instead of telling participants to skip the remainder
           of a question if they answered no to the first part of the question, the ePRO system
           does the skipping for them. The result is less confusion, fewer questions to read, and
           less of the participant's time.

        2. It provides a convenient way for participants to keep track of where to find the
           questionnaire, and how much they have already completed. Participants sometimes don't
           have time to answer all of the investigator's questions in one sitting. The ePRO system
           keeps track of how much participants have already done and it's ready to keep going
           whenever the participant has time. It also avoids the common problem of losing the
           questionnaires to the household paperwork pile, or worse to the recycling bin.

        3. It provides timely reminders to participants. Study participants, and especially new
           moms, are busy and they forget to complete the questionnaires. The ePRO system can
           provide timely reminders encouraging participants to respond.

        4. It helps participants complete the questionnaires accurately. The ePRO system has an
           automatic error detection ability that will alert participants to any questions they
           missed or completed incorrectly.

      Finding ways to keep participants involved in research is something that all researchers are
      concerned about, and ultimately it's a concern for all Canadians because the results of
      research are often used to make decisions about health care and the kinds of programs that
      governments provide. Losing any participant from the study reduces the ability of policy
      makers to take the best decisions and choices about what health services to fund with limited
      dollars. What the investigators propose is a study to determine whether Internet data entry
      really will keep participants involved in a longitudinal study. Previous studies have shown
      that the internet can be a useful tool for getting people to sign up for research and at
      least one small study showed that using Internet data entry can actually save money. But no
      researchers have actually tested whether it really does a better job than paper based
      questionnaires in terms of keeping participants involved.

      In order to answer this question, the investigators will randomly assign the current Alberta
      Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition study participants to either continue receiving the
      paper-based questionnaire or to start receiving the web-based surveys. The investigators will
      follow participants over three assessment occasions (over a period of 18 months) and observe
      any differences between the groups in their involvement. Because the investigators are
      randomly assigning participants to the two groups, differences in involvement will tell them
      about usefulness of Internet data entry as a participant retention tool.

      RESEARCH QUESTIONS: In longitudinal research, will participant-initiated internet data entry
      improve 1) participant retention and 2) data quality? RESEARCH CONTEXT: While longitudinal
      research may be the best tool for examining the course of human health and illness over the
      lifespan, the burden of participation over many years often results in loss of participants
      to follow-up. Such attrition reduces statistical power and threatens the internal validity
      and generalizability of inferences drawn from longitudinal data (Shadish et al., 2002).
      Because internet data collection is convenient and simplifies complex questionnaires, this
      method may reduce participant burden and reduce attrition. While internet data collection is
      already regarded as a viable tool for participant recruitment (Smith et al., 2007) and
      usually results in data of equivalent or better quality (e.g., factor loadings,
      reliabilities) than traditional paper-and-pencil methods (Vergnaud et al., 2011), internet
      data collection as a tool to increase participant retention within an existing longitudinal
      cohort has not been evaluated previously. The goal of the current project is to determine
      whether internet data collection increases participant retention and data quality within the
      APrON (Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition) study.

      APrON is an ongoing longitudinal cohort study conducted in Calgary and Edmonton, involving
      more than 2000 women, 1200 of their partners, and their 2000 children. It is designed to
      answer questions about the impact of maternal nutrient intake and status during pregnancy on:
      a) maternal mental health, b) birth outcomes, and c) child health and development. The data
      collected from Albertans participating in health research (such as APrON) is a provincial
      treasure, an investment that needs to be maximized with easy, modern technology to reduce
      participant burden and promote better long-term follow-up. Although software is available for
      single questionnaire data entry (e.g., RedCap), the innovative technology the investigators
      plan to introduce and evaluate is a made-in-Alberta solution that automates and simplifies
      the collection of complex short- and long-term longitudinal data - a process that other
      software cannot easily achieve. This technology holds strong potential for broad application
      to all longitudinal health research.

      Currently, APrON collects data using traditional paper questionnaires mailed out at regular
      intervals throughout pregnancy and as children develop over the first 3 years. At some time
      points, participants are also asked to attend a clinic where biological samples and physical
      measures are taken. The questionnaires are long and complex (whether a question needs to be
      answered is dependent upon responses to previous questions) and have been identified as a
      major time burden by study participants. In a recent survey of 1763 APrON participants,
      almost 65%, indicated they would prefer to complete study questionnaires via the internet -
      most of the remainder had no preference. Completion rate for paper questionnaires is
      approximately 85% when participants come to a study clinic for an in-person visit. However,
      when a clinic visit does not accompany the mailed questionnaires (questionnaires are
      completed at home and returned by postage paid envelope) response rates are ~ 65%.

      RESEARCH PLAN/METHODOLOGY: Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) is a web-based
      software tool developed by the Women &amp; Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI) at the
      University of Alberta. Pilot studies have been performed at the University of Alberta,
      however, this study will be the first use of ePRO in a study population of this size.
      Questionnaires are built using Checkbox Survey Server. Automatic email invitations to
      participants are based on the individualized anchor dates and schedules (e.g., the
      questionnaire for children aged 12 months is linked to the individual child's date of birth).
      Participants receive links and instructions when a survey is due for completion. Reminders
      are automatically sent if a questionnaire is not completed within appropriate timelines
      (e.g., after 2 weeks). Study staff can track late and incomplete questionnaires, re-send
      invitations, and manually enter data when information is obtained via a paper questionnaire
      or telephone interview. Importantly, the system facilitates linking of data from different
      questionnaires and different time points.

      The investigators propose a randomized trial of data collection methods. Participants will be
      allocated using a permuted block randomization of equal block sizes from APrON participants
      in Calgary to one of two groups: (1) continue with paper-based data collection; and (2) use
      ePRO for future data collection tasks.

      IMPACT/RELEVANCE: In 2008, Alberta invested significant research funds to establish pregnancy
      and birth cohorts that will help develop knowledge needed to improve the health of mothers
      and infants. Answering health questions about developmental effects requires continued
      contact and follow-up with the participants every 3-6 months, which is a significant
      challenge, and one which most international cohorts are struggling to accomplish with paper
      questionnaires. What the investigators propose in this grant is to evaluate a novel approach
      to complex longitudinal research that enables data collection that is convenient, less
      burdensome, and efficient for participants. The investigators expect that the ePRO system
      will: 1) increase completion rate by tracking participant progress in the study, notifying
      them when it is time for another round of questionnaires, administering questionnaires in an
      efficient manner (skip non-relevant questions), and sending reminders about incomplete
      questionnaires, and 2) improve data quality by alerting participants to missing items.
