    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group study to determine the optimal dose of
      CART-19 cells (autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors expressing
      tandem TCR Zeta and 4-1 BB co-stimulatory domains) of the two dose levels being assessed
      (1-5x10e8 vs. 1-5x10e7 CART-19 cells). This trial will be conducted in two stages.

      This study is being conducted to determine the optimal dose of autologous CART-19 T cells
      engineered to express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptors in patients with relapsed or
      refractory CD19 positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma
      (SLL). The two dose levels being assessed are 1-5x10e8 versus 1-5x10e7. The trial will be
      conducted in two stages. In stage I subjects will be randomized into one of the two dose
      cohort with a1:1 ratio for a total of 12 subjects per dose cohort. Stage II will be to enroll
      an additional 8 subjects to the selected dose cohort once safety, tolerability and clinical
      responses have been evaluated to determine the optimal dose cohort.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Documented CD19+ CLL or SLL

          -  Successful test expansion of T-cells

          -  At least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, not including single agent monoclonal antibody
             (rituxan) therapy. Single agent ofatumumab will be counted as a regimen. -Patients
             with high risk disease manifested by deletion chromosome 17p will be eligible if they
             fail to achieve a CR to initial therapy or progress within 2 years of 1 prior regimen.

          -  Patients who progress within 2 years after the second or higher line of therapy will
             be eligible. For instance, patients who had progression &lt; 2 years after second or
             greater line therapy, but who have responded to their most recent treatment (3rd line
             or higher) will be eligible.

          -  Subject is not appropriate candidate for a potentially curative allogeneic SCT due to
             the state of disease, co-morbid illness, lack of an available donor, or patient
             declines Performance status (ECOG) 0 or 1

               3. Total Bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dl
