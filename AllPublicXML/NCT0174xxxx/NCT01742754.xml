    <textblock>
      Fecal microbiota therapy (FMT) is an emerging treatment for gastrointestinal disorders marked
      by an imbalance in the intestinal microbial flora (dysbiosis). It is hypothesized to work by
      shifting the recipient's microbiota toward a eubiotic microbial community that resists
      colonization by pathogenic organisms or decreases its inherent inflammatory properties.
      Several studies now report its efficacy in treatment of severe Clostridium difficile colitis.
      Preliminary studies using FMT in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have also met with some success.
      This is corroborated by several lines of evidence suggesting dysbiosis plays an important
      role in UC pathogenesis. While a recent study using FMT in patients with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and constipation found transplants persist for up to 2 years, the extent to
      which the microbiota is alterable in UC is not known. Indeed, there may be particular genetic
      or immunologic factors in UC leading to selection pressure preventing a change in the
      microbiota. As an initial step into investigating the potential efficacy of stool transplants
      for Ulcerative Colitis (UC), the investigators propose to determine the feasibility and
      stability of transplanted microbiota in a series of 10 patients with mild to moderate UC.
