  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to quantify the loss of in vivo biological
      potency of a depigmented polymerized (DPP) allergenic cat epithelial extract versus the
      native allergenic extract (N).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized phase II clinical trial.

      Three different concentrations of three different cat epithelial allergenic extracts,
      together with a positive and negative control, using 10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride and a
      glycerated phenol saline solution, respectively, will be tested in every subject on the volar
      surface of the forearm.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in the study only if all of the following criteria
        are met:

          -  The subject (and/or legal representative, where applicable) has given written, signed
             and dated informed consent.

          -  Subjects of either sex and of any race or ethnic group.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years and &lt; 60 years on the day of inclusion in the study.

          -  Positive clinical history of allergy to cat epithelia (i.e., rhinitis, conjunctivitis,
             rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, urticaria, etc. ).

          -  A positive prick-test (mean diameter of papule ≥ 3 mm or area of papule ≥ 7 mm2) with
             a commercial extract of cat epithelium. The results of the prick-test will be valid if
             they were obtained in the year prior to inclusion of the subject in the study.

          -  A positive specific IgE test (&gt; 0.70 KU/l) for cat epithelium. The results of the IgE
             test will be valid if they were obtained in the year prior to inclusion of the subject
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will NOT be eligible for inclusion in the study if any of the following criteria
        are met:

          -  Immunotherapy in the last 5 years involving allergens known to be able to interfere
             with the test allergen (e.g., cat extract).

          -  Use of drugs that can interfere with the skin response before and during the study
             (e.g., antihistamines), within the intervals established in section 9.1 and appendix
             1.

          -  Treatment with any of the following medicines: tricyclic or tetracyclic
             antidepressants or MAOIs (Monoamine oxidase inhibitors), beta-blockers or chronic use
             of oral corticosteroids or use of corticosteroids via either the oral or the
             parenteral route in repeated and intermittent dosing regimens (&gt; 10 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent).

          -  Pregnant or nursing women and women with a positive pregnancy test in visit 2.

          -  Dermographism affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to the
             study centre.

          -  Atopic dermatitis affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to
             the study centre.

          -  Urticaria affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to the
             study centre.

          -  Clinically relevant immune system diseases (both autoimmune disorders and immune
             deficiencies). (Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hypothyroidism well controlled through
             thyroid hormone therapy does not necessarily represent a contraindication. Graves'
             disease (hyperthyroidism) would be an exclusion criterion due to the potential risk in
             the event adrenaline must be used.)

          -  Serious uncontrolled diseases that may increase the safety risk of the subjects
             participating in the study, including but not limited to the following: heart failure,
             serious or uncontrolled respiratory diseases, endocrine disorders, clinically relevant
             liver or kidney diseases, or haematological disorders.

          -  Patents with diseases or conditions that limit adrenaline use (coronary disease,
             severe arterial hypertension, etc.).

          -  Serious psychiatric, psychological or neurological problems.

          -  Medication, alcohol or illegal drug abuse in the last year.

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial during the 30 days (or 5 times the
             biological half-life of the investigational product - whichever is longest) prior to
             inclusion of the subject in this study.
