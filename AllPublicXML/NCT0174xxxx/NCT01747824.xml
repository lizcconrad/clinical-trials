  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine the levels of stress biomarkers associated with
      severe pain, agitation from intoxication or psychosis, and excited delirium at various levels
      of the disease in order to compare them to pre-clinical models of law enforcement encounters.
      We hypothesize that the serum catecholamines and markers of metabolic acidosis will worsen
      with the duration and severity of agitation among agitated patients and will not worsen among
      patients with severe pain who are not agitated.

      Specific Aims

        -  To assess the prevalence of patients undergoing treatment for agitation from any cause
           requiring restraint or sedation.

        -  To assess the prevalence of excited delirium in the emergency department.

        -  To determine the difference in serum total catecholamines, serum dopamine, serum
           epinephrine, serum norepinephrine, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial
           pressure, mortality, and disposition among patients with agitation requiring restraint,
           including excited delirium and patients with severe pain from extremity fractures.

        -  To describe changes in stress biomarkers among patients with changing levels of
           agitation as determined by the Altered Mental Status scale.

      In this study, we propose to study Emergency Department patients under physiologic stress
      from severe pain, agitation, drug overdose, and excited delirium in order to compare markers
      of acidosis in patients at risk for unexplained-in-custody-death (UICD) in order to determine
      the relationship of these markers to what has been found in simulated law enforcement
      encounters. This information will help clarify the levels of stress associated with arrest
      and restraint conditions, allowing us to determine what aspects and levels of stress may be
      associated with the fatal mechanisms of UICD, and to identify markers that would inform death
      investigators of the mechanism of UICD. At the conclusion of this project, we will be able to
      report details explaining the relationship of the physiologic and metabolic effects of stress
      from restraint in excited delirium to other peri-arrest conditions and our previous work in
      simulated law enforcement encounters.
