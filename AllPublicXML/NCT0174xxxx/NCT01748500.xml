      The main objectives of this trial are:

        1. To assess the activity and safety of pantoprazole and docetaxel (with prednisone) in men
           with metastatic CRPC who have not received prior chemotherapy.

        2. To evaluate archival prostate cancer tissue of men included in the clinical trial for
           evidence of autophagy using IHC for LC3B, ATG5, p62 as well as ERG.

        3. To evaluate pharmacokinetic interactions of pantoprazole with docetaxel.
