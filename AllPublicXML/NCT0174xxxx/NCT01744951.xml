    <textblock>
      This study seeks to pilot a manualized adoption-specific intervention aimed at providing a
      preventive intervention for families adopting children ages 5-14 years where family
      reunification has been terminated and the family is moving toward adoption or who have
      adopted children from foster care in the last three years. This work will fill a major gap in
      services to children and families and is developed to improve mental health and family
      functioning of children adopted from foster care, as well as decrease adoption disruptions.
      President Clinton's 1997 adoption initiative, The Adoption and Safe Families ACT (ASFA),
      along with subsequent Congressional initiatives, have provided incentives to States and
      subsidies for adopting older children with a resultant increase in rates of adoption from
      foster care from 26,000 in 1995 to 53,000 (stabilized annual rate) beginning in 2002. The
      mean age at adoption from foster care is now 6 years old. These older children have histories
      of physical and sexual abuse, neglect, and multiple placements, all factors that predict
      behavior problems over time. To address this gap in our knowledge of providing care for this
      vulnerable group, we have developed a manualized adoption-specific intervention for families
      adopting children from foster care. Because adoptive children generally enter homes with
      stable, well-functioning parents, interventions may be particularly effective in helping the
      children adjust and their parents learn to understand and manage children with difficult past
      histories.

      The aim of this current pilot trial is to test this intervention designed to improve the
      outcomes for children adopted from foster care through a randomized trial. Our hypothesis is
      that this manualized adoption-specific intervention will be more effective than care as usual
      in improving child mental health and family functioning outcomes; specifically, families and
      children who have been randomized to the manualized adoption-specific intervention will show
      better outcomes on the post-treatment measures and the 3 month follow-up than on the
      pre-treatment measures than the care as usual families and children.
