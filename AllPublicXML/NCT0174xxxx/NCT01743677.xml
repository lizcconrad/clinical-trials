    <textblock>
      ICH E14 recommends that a thorough QT/QTc (TQT) study should be performed to determine
      whether intensive monitoring of QT interval in target patient populations is required during
      later stages of development. The current study is designed to ascertain whether CP-690,550 is
      associated with QTc prolongation.
