          -  Previous tissue augmenting therapy in the lip area (including oral commissures,
             marionette and perioral lines) with HA or collagen filler, or laser treatment, within
             12 months before study entry.

          -  Permanent implant or treatment with non-HA or non-collagen filler in the area

             level of the lower orbital rim, subjects anticipated to be unreliable or incapable of
             understanding the study assessment or unrealistic expectations of treatment result.

          -  Study staff or close relative to study staff (e.g. parents, children, siblings or
