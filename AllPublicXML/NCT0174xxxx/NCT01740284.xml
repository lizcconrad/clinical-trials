  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many grass pollen allergic subjects treated with immunotherapy tablets experience treatment
      related adverse events when initiating treatment.

      The majority are local allergic reactions within the mouth and/or throat, and most of these
      reactions are mild or moderate. It is anticipated that intake of antihistamine before
      initiation of Grazax treatment would most likely reduce the discomfort associated with
      initiation of Grazax treatment. So this trial was to investigate if administration of
      antihistamine prior to initiation of Grazax treatment results in a reduction of subjects
      reporting local allergic reactions.

      Many grass pollen allergic subjects treated with immunotherapy tablets experience treatment
      related adverse events when initiating treatment. The adverse events are considered
      consistent with the introduction of allergens in sensitised subjects. The majority are local
      allergic reactions within the mouth and/or throat. Most of these reactions are mild or
      moderate in intensity, have an onset almost immediately after taking a tablet, and last from
      minutes to hours after intake. Appearance of adverse events in relation to tablet intake
      tends to subside spontaneously within 1 to 7 days. Thus, initiation of treatment with Grazax
      may be associated with discomfort. It is anticipated that intake of antihistamine before
      initiation of Grazax treatment would most likely reduce the discomfort associated with
      initiation of Grazax treatment. Therefore, the rationale for this trial was to investigate if
      administration of antihistamine prior to initiation of Grazax treatment results in a
      reduction of subjects reporting local allergic reactions.
