  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the acceptability, operational feasibility and
      efficacy of a combined fatigue countermeasure comprised of shorter-wavelength light and
      exercise during operational Orbit 1 night shifts to improve alertness and performance of
      flight mission controllers.

      Specifically, the investigators will:

        1. Feasibility. Test the feasibility of developing a break room containing fatigue
           countermeasures (shorter-wavelength light and exercise equipment) to be used by flight
           mission controllers during Orbit 1 night shifts, and the feasibility to schedule regular
           breaks during the Orbit 1 shift so that flight mission controllers have the opportunity
           to use the fatigue countermeasures break room.

        2. Acceptability. Test the acceptability of the use of the fatigue countermeasures break
           room evaluating when and how the room is used by flight mission controllers, as measured
           on End-of-Shift Productivity Questionnaire.

        3. Test the hypothesis that alertness and performance will be impaired in flight mission
           controllers during Orbit 1 operational night shifts as compared to flight mission
           controllers working a non-console day shift.

        4. Test the hypothesis that alertness and performance of flight mission controllers who
           exercise and are exposed to shorter wavelength light during the Orbit 1 night shift will
           be significantly more alert and have better mood, performance (e.g., less PVT lapses,
           increased productivity) than those same mission controllers working Orbit 1 night shifts
           without exposure to the shorter wavelength light and exercise.

        5. Test the acceptability, operational feasibility and efficacy of implementing an
           anonymous sleep disorders screening for flight controllers, evaluated by number of
           visitors to the screening web site and the number of completed assessments.

      Each participant will have three data collection periods. Each data collection period will
      last one shift rotation (5 -7 days): One 5-shift or 7-shift block of Orbit 1 night shifts on
      console with access to photic and exercise countermeasures, a second 5-shift or 7-shift block
      of Orbit 1 night shifts on console with no access to countermeasures, and a third 5-shift
      block of daytime office work off console. We will be measuring sleep via a wrist worn
      activity measuring device and compliance of exercise intervention via a small, commercially
      available heart monitor worn around the chest underneath clothing. The activity device will
      be worn continuously and the heart monitor will be worn on shift. These devices will be
      downloaded at the end of each block of shifts. Subjects will complete a short baseline
      questionnaire once at the beginning of the study. Subjective alertness will be assessed with
      the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), performance testing will occur regularly and 'end of
      shift' questionnaires will be completed at the end of each shift. Drowsiness will be measured
      on the commute to and from work with the Optalert.

    <description>Subjects will visit the experimental break room 4 times per Orbit 1 shift:
first, prior to the beginning of the work shift
second, during an operationally feasible 20-min break during the 1st half of the work shift
third, once during an operationally feasible 20-min break during the 2nd half of the work shift
fourth, immediately after the end of the work shift
In the break room, subjects will be passively exposed to blue-wavelength enriched ceiling lights during all four visits for each work shift.
Also in the break room, subjects will perform 10-minutes of mild exercise during the first three visits to the break room during each work shift.</description>
