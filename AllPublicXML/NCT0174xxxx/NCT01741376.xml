    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the role of progesterone (a hormone found in both men
      and women) on stopping cocaine use. The study will examine whether the medication, in
      combination with behavior therapy will decrease cocaine use, cigarette smoking, withdrawal
      symptoms, impulsivity and stress.
