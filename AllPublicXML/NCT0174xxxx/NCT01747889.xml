  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the Thopaz chest tube drainage system to the traditional
      collection chamber system. The Thopaz system is already in clinical use in the United States
      and throughout the world. As such, this study is not evaluating safety or efficacy of this
      system both of which have already been demonstrated. This study's primary aim is to determine
      whether the use of a digital chest drainage system compared with a traditional system affects
      duration of chest drainage and length of hospital stay.

      Furthermore, we aim to determine whether the use of a digital chest drainage system compared
      with a traditional system increases the total distance of ambulation in the first 48 hours
      after thoracic surgery and affects overall patient satisfaction in the peri-operative period.

      Finally, we want to determine whether the aforementioned outcomes relative to the chest tube
      drainage systems differ in different parts of the world.

    <description>Patients in the intervention arm are connected to Thopaz, electronic drainage system immediately after closure of the chest, patients in the control group are connected to a traditional system. Chest tubes in both groups are then connected to suction of -20 cmH2O and maintained at that level until post-operative day #1.
On the morning of post-operative day #1, presence of air leak will be recorded on suction. Then, suction will be decreased to -8 cmH2O (so-called water seal). At that time, management of chest tube drainage and decision for chest tube removal will be dictated by clinical signs, symptoms, and surgeon preference following the standard clinical algorithm for post-operative care of general thoracic patients</description>
