             Selection Committee, preclude surgical valve replacement.

             ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months (less than or equal to (≤) 180 days) prior to
             the index procedure.

          3. Subject has a chest condition than prevents transapical access.

          4. Subject has carotid artery disease requiring intervention.

          5. Subject has documented evidence of a myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months (less
             than or equal to (≤) 180 days) prior to the index procedure.

          6. Subject has a native aortic valve that is congenitally unicuspid, bicuspid,
             quadricuspid or non-calcified as seen by echocardiography.

          7. Subject has mitral valvular regurgitation greater than (&gt;) grade III.
