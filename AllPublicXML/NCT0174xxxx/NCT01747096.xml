  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of PET / CT with 68Ga-DOTANOC in
      Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors with comparison with other techniques used in
      routine clinical practice (octreoscan ® ; multiphase SPECT / CT, MRI or endoscopy).

      Therapeutic impact and safety of PET / CT with 68Ga-DOTANOC will also be assessed. Expected
      results are a confirmation of the superiority of 68Ga-PET DOTANOC versus scintigraphy
      octreoscan ®, with a potential impact on the therapeutic management of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age over 18 years

          -  effective contraception or exclusion of pregnancy dosage of beta-HCG in women of
             childbearing age

          -  Fortuitous discovery of suggestive tumors of TE-GEP with well documented conventional
             imaging (multiphase CT; MRI, US endoscopy) associated or not associated with clinical
             or biological signs of TE-GEP tumors (increase in tumor markers) OR

          -  Histologically proven GEP-TE (WHO classification 2010 (26) well differentiated in the
             initial staging OR

          -  Suspicion of recurrence or progression of well differentiated TE-GEP tumors on
             conventional imaging or laboratory tests (increase in tumor markers) OR

          -  Clinical or biological syndrome strongly suggestive of digestive endocrine disease
             without identification of lesions with conventional imaging

          -  Informed consent and patient's written

          -  Affiliation to an insurance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple endocrine neoplasia

          -  TE GEP tumor not differentiated

          -  Pregnancy and lactation

          -  Persons protected by law

          -  Restlessness, inability to lie still hold at least 1 hour; Claustrophobia

          -  Poor compliance predictable or inability to undergo medical test for geographical,
             social or psychological

          -  Treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other antitumor treatment within 6 weeks
             of previous morphological and scintigraphic examinations. In case of treatment with
             somatostatin analogues delayed, scans will be performed 4 weeks after the last
             injection. However, a shorter period may be observed to avoid to do again the initial
             assessment exams.

          -  malignancy except basal cell cancers and cancer in situ of the cervix

          -  Contraindication of injection of a contrast agent necessary for the production of
             multiphase scanner.

          -  Patients who had a CT scan without injection of contrast material can not participate
             in the study
