  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of RM-493 on mean percent body weight
      loss, and other weight loss parameters as well as Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and
      ambulatory blood pressure in obese patients. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and tolerability of a single dose of RM-493. The study drug (RM-493 and placebo) will be
      administered subcutaneously in a blinded fashion.

             patients will have a BMI ≥ 40 Kg/m².

          5. Stable body weight (+/- 5 Kg) during previous 6 months.

          6. Blood pressure (&lt;140/90 mmHg); may include stable dose (≥ 30 days of use) of up to two
             anti-hypertensive medications to achieve control that are intended to remain on a
             stable dose during the protocol.

          7. Willingness and demonstrates ability to self administer study medication
             subcutaneously via an infusion pump during the placebo practice period.

          8. Willing to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regime throughout study as recommended
             by counseling at study start.

          9. Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use any two of
             the following medically acceptable forms of contraception from the Screening Period
             through the completion of study treatment: hormonal, condom with spermicidal jelly,
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicidal jelly, or IUD. Hormonal contraception must
             have started at least 3 months prior to screening. A female whose male partner has had
             a vasectomy must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable
             contraception. Patients must agree to practice the above birth control methods for 30
             days after completion of study treatment as a safety precaution.

         10. Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal
             for at least 12 months (and confirmed with a screening FSH level in the
             post-menopausal range), do not require contraception during the study.

         11. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use two medically
             acceptable forms of contraception as described above, with one of the two forms being

             study treatment. Males with female partners of childbearing potential who themselves
             are surgically sterile (status post vasectomy) must agree to use condoms with
             spermicide over the same period of time.
