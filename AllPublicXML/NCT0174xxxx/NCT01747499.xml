             stored at the time of transplant.

          -  Must receive a myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimen for SCT as
             defined by the CIBMTR

               -  Cyclophosphamide and single dose total body irradiation

               -  Fludarabine and busulfan

               -  Busulfan and cyclophosphamide

          -  Must be able to receive GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus and methotrexate.

          -  Must be ≥ 18 yrs old and ≤ 70 yrs old. Azacitidine is not approved by the FDA for use
             in children.

          -  Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          -  Must have laboratory results indicating:

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl, unless a diagnosis of Gilbert's disease

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 3 X the upper limit of institutional normal

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl

          -  Patient must have ability to understand and willingness to provide written informed
             consent prior to participation in the study and any related procedures being
             performed.

          -  The effects of azacitidine on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because category D agents as well as
             other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of
             childbearing age must have a negative serum pregnancy test (ß-human chorionic
             gonadotropin) within 72 hours prior to initiating the conditioning regimen and be
             willing to not become pregnant by using effective contraception while undergoing
             treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of azacitidine.

          -  Men must be willing not to father a new child while receiving therapy. They must use
             an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 months
             following the last dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Must not have myelofibrosis or other disease known to prolong neutrophil engraftment
             to &gt; 28 days after transplant.

          -  Must not be receiving any other investigational agents within 14 days of first dose of
             azacitidine (Day 7).

          -  Must not have myeloablative conditioning as defined below:

               -  TBI &lt; or = Gy +/- purine analog

               -  Flu + Cy +/- ATG

               -  Flu + AraC + Ida

               -  Cladribine + AraC

               -  Total Lymphoid Irradiation + ATG

          -  Must not receive antithymocyte globulin as part of pre-transplant conditioning
             regimens. Antithymocyte globulin is excluded due to its potential impact on modulating
             the incidence of GvHD or GvL.

          -  Must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because azacitidine is a Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with azacitidine,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated azacitidine. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Must not have a known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine, mannitol, or
             compounds of similar composition to azacitidine..

          -  Must not have an advanced malignant hepatic tumor.

          -  Must not be HIV, HBV, or HCV positive.
