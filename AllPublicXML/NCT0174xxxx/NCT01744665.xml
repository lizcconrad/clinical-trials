    <measure>Percentage of patients without molecular relapse after stopping nilotinib</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after stopping nilotinib therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients without confirmed loss of MR4 within 6 months following nilotinib TFR is calculated by dividing the number of patients with no documented confirmed loss of MR4, in the first 6 months after starting nilotinib TFR phase by the number of patients who entered nilotinib TFR phase.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients without molecular relapse after stopping nilotinib</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 18, and 36 months after stopping nilotinib</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients without confirmed loss of MR4 at 12, 18, and 36 months following nilotinib TFR is calculated by dividing the number of patients with no documented confirmed loss of MR4 at 12, 18, and 36 months after starting the nilotinib TFR phase by the number of patients who entered nilotinib TFR phase.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients who regain MR4.5 after restarting nilotinib due to molecular relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients who regain MR4.5 after restarting nilotinib will be calculated as the number of patients who achieve MR4.5 after having lost MR4 divided by the number of patients who lost MR4.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression to AP/BC and death where the &quot;failure&quot; event is the earliest occurrence of the following event: progression to AP/BC or death from any cause.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>The estimation of progression-free survival (PFS) following nilotinib cessation will use the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. PFS is measured from the date of cessation of nilotinib therapy to the date of the earliest of this event: progression to AP/BC or death from any cause. Patients not known to have progressed or died on or before the cut-off date for the KM analysis will have their PFS interval right-censored at the earlier of the date of their last assessment of molecular response status and the cut off date.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from the date of cessation of nilotinib therapy to the date of death from any cause.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimation of OS. OS is measured from the date of start of nilotinib TFR phase to the date of death from any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival will be censored at the date of last contact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse free survival is defined as time from the date of nilotinib treatment discontinuation to the first documented molecular relapse (confirmed loss of MR4.0).</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan- Meier (KM) estimation method in each arm. Patients who drop out without relapse will be treated as censored observations.</description>

    <measure>Change in symptom-burden scores by the MDASI-CML assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to time to when MR4.5 is confirmed and from end of Consolidation Phase to 6 and 12 months into the TFR Phase</time_frame>
    <description>The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory for CML patients (MDASI-CML) is a patient reported outcomes tool which will be used to assess the nature and impact of symptom burden on life on patients. The MDASI-CML consists of 19 validated symptom items and 6 validated core interference items. Each item is assessed on an 11 point scale, 0=Not Present and 10=&quot;As Bad as You can Imagine&quot;. The symptom, interference subscale total scores and the overall total score in MDASI-CML with their change from baseline will be summarized descriptively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in healthy utility assessed by EQ-5D-3L</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to time to when MR4.5 is confirmed and from end of Consolidation Phase to 6 and 12 months into the TFR Phase</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire comprises 5 items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and the EQ visual analog scale. Each item has 3 levels (no problems, some problems and extreme problems) and visual analog has a scale 0 to 100 (0=worst imaginable health state, 100=best imaginable health state). The percentages of patients at each level of the five items of the EQ-5D-3L will be summarized overall and by treatments arms as appropriate at baseline and all post-baseline time points. Mean and standard deviation of the visual analog scale be provided.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient quality of life assessed by SF-8</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to time to when MR4.5 is confirmed and from end of Consolidation Phase to 6 and 12 months into the TFR Phase</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-8 questionnaire consisting of 8 items (general health, physical functioning, rolephysical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health) will be used to assess the impact of nilotinib treatment discontinuation on the quality of life. Each item has a 5 or 6 point response range. Physical and mental component summary measures (calculated using a norm-based scoring method given in the instrument guidelines) and each item score will be summarized at baseline and all post-baseline time points using mean and standard deviation.</description>

    <description>59 patients will be enrolled to the study. Patients who achieve MR4.5 on study will then be randomized to receive a total 2 years (Consolidation Phase) of additional nilotinib therapy. If MR4.5 is sustained during the Consolidation phase, patients will be eligible to stop taking niltoinib during the treatment-free remission (TFR) phase. No head to head comparison of the 2 arms will be performed. Each arm will be compared to historical data.</description>
