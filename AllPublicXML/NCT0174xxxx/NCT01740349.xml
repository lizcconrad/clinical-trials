  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective pilot study of 30 pediatric subjects, that are indicated for standard
      colonoscopy due to follow-up of ulcerative colitis (UC), examines the Given Diagnostic System
      and the PillCam Colon Capsule in comparison to standard colonoscopy.

      This study aims

        1. To evaluate and compare the accuracy of PillCam ™ Colon capsule endoscopy (PCCE) with
           standard colonoscopy in the evaluation of colon in pediatric ulcerative colitis.

        2. To evaluate the safety of PillCam ™ Colon capsule endoscopy (PCCE) in pediatric age.

        The Given® Diagnostic System offers an alternative approach for endoscopic visualization of
        the colon using capsule endoscopy, a swallowable device which contains imagers, light
        sources, a power source and a RF transmitter. Advantages of the Given® Diagnostic System
        include the elimination of the need for conscious sedation, the minimally invasive,
        painless nature of the exam, and the ability to pursue normal daily activities immediately
        following the procedure. This prospective pilot study will evaluate the performance of PCCE
        in visualizing the colon of children with UC. All subjects to be enrolled will be
        appropriate candidates for standard colonoscopy based on their clinical indication.

        Each subject will undergo PCCE. PCCE results will be compared with that of a colonoscopy
        procedure.

        Inclusion criteria:

        Subjects must meet one the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into
        this proposed study:

          -  diagnosis of UC made at least 3 months before the enrolment;

          -  subject was referred for standard colonoscopy and endoscopic follow-up in Ulcerative
             colitis

          -  signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:

          -  Subject has a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted electro medical devices.

          -  Subject is expected to undergo MRI examination within 7 days after ingestion of the
             capsule.

          -  Subject has had prior abdominal surgery of the gastrointestinal tract other than
             uncomplicated procedures that would be unlikely to lead to bowel obstruction based on
             the clinical judgment of the investigator.
