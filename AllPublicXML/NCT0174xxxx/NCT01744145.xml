    <textblock>
      The mortality rate and quality of life is effected in patients with pneumonia, especially in
      the older population.

      The end point of this study is to improve quality of life by and interventional exercise and
      education. Patients will be randomized at admission and enrolled into the study. They will be
      assessed with various performance and quality of life indicators before, during and after the
      study, and exercise tolerance will be assessed throughout and after.

      The purpose of this research study is to assess improvement in functional status and quality
      of life of patients 40 years of age and older patients hospitalized for community acquired
      pneumonia and healthcare associated pneumonia with a multi-disciplinary program of exercise,
      education and psychological support. This study will use a randomized, controlled clinical
      trial design. The total number of patients enrolled will be 120, divided into two groups of
      60 patients each. One group will have patients age 40 to 60 and second group will have
      patients age 60 and above. Stratified randomization will be done to divide these into two
      (control group and intervention group) equal groups with 30 patients each. The primary
      endpoint is improvement in quality of life indices. Secondary endpoints are improvement in
      functional status, change in 6 minute walk test, exercise intolerance, immunization, occult
      desaturation and change in body weight of patients hospitalized for community acquired
      pneumonia with a multi-disciplinary program of exercise, education and, psychological
      support. Eligibility includes age 40 and above at the time of admission, diagnosis of CAP and
      HCAP via radiographic and PNA symptoms, discharge to home, ability to read and sign informed
      consent to participate, ability to perform procedures/exercises involved in the study and
      ability to comprehend educational component of program.
