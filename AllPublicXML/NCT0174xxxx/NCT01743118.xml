  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current most important topical treatments for psoriasis are vitamin D3 analogues and/or
      corticosteroids. The possibility of another effective treatment for psoriasis could be based
      on the immunosuppressive efficacy of selective blockers of a lymphocyte potassium channel.

      The aim of the clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-psoriatic
      efficacy of topical SPS4251 formulations in comparison to placebo and to a marketed topical
      Vitamin-D analogue ointment in a psoriasis plaque test.
