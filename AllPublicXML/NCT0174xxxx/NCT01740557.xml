    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the side effects of T-cells injected
      with CXCR2 and NGFR when given in combination with chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine) and aldesleukin to patients with metastatic melanoma in an attempt to allow them
      to better localize the tumor. The safety of this combination will also be studied.

      Pretreatment Procedures:

      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and procedures will
      be performed before you begin receiving any study drugs or treatments:

      Within 6 months before receiving cyclophosphamide and fludarabine:

        -  You will have a lung function test.

        -  You will have a cardiac stress test to check your heart function during stressful
           conditions. Your study doctor will explain this procedure.

      Within 30 days before receiving cyclophosphamide and fludarabine:

        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires about your quality of life. It should take about 15
           minutes total to complete.

        -  You will have an (ECG) to check your heart function.

        -  You will have a CT or (PET)/CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  You will have an (MRI) scan, CT scan, and/or a PET scan of the brain to check the status
           of the disease

        -  You will have tumor biopsies to check the status of the disease. The type of biopsy will
           depend on the size and location of the tumor.

        -  Blood samples (about 4 tablespoons) will be collected to evaluate changes in your
           T-cells.

      Within 14 days before receiving cyclophosphamide and fludarabine:

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine and blood clotting
           tests.

        -  Urine will be collected to check your urinary tract and kidney function.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood or urine pregnancy test. If it
           is a blood test, it will be part of the routine blood draw. To take part in this study,
           you must not be pregnant.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you were found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin to receive the
      study drugs and other drugs that are given to help lower the risk of side effects.

      The days leading up to Day 1 of the study are considered negative days. For example, the day
      before Day 0 is Day -1.

      On Days -7 and -6, you will receive cyclophosphamide each day by vein over about 2 hours.

      On Day -7, you will receive mesna by vein non-stop over about 24 hours. This is help to
      protect the bladder from side effects of cyclophosphamide.

      On Days -5 to -1, you will receive fludarabine each day by vein over about 15-30 minutes.

      On Day 0, you will receive CXCR2 and NGFR T-cells through a catheter over up to 4 hours. A
      catheter is a thin flexible tube that inserted into the body. The catheter may be placed into
      a vein in your arm or in a large vein in your neck. If the cells need to be given through a
      large vein either in your upper chest or in your neck, the area will be numbed with medicine
      before the catheter is put in. Other catheters may be needed in one or both of your arms to
      give you fluids, medicines, or extra nutrition. You will sign a separate consent for the
      catheter, which will describe the procedure and the risks in more detail.

      On Days 1-5, you will receive aldesleukin by catheter over about 15 minutes every 8-16 hours
      for up to 15 doses.

      On Days 22-26, you will receive aldesleukin by catheter over about 15 minutes every 8-16
      hours for up to 15 doses. You will only receive aldesleukin if your platelet counts are high
      enough. This 5 days of dosing may actually start as early as Day 20 or may end as late as Day
      33.

      You will be given levofloxacin once a day by mouth or vein until your white blood cell count
      rises. You will receive filgrastim through a needle under the skin once a day until your
      white blood cell count rises. You will begin to receive fluconazole on Day 0 by mouth until
      your white blood cell count rises. You will also take trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)
      by mouth 2 times a day, beginning on Day -7 and continuing for at least 3 months after
      chemotherapy.

      To prevent the occurence of Herpes Virus Infections, you will be given Valtrex by mouth, once
      a day for 6 months. If you cannot take valtrex by mouth, you will receive acyclovir by vein
      over one hour when you visit the hospital. Your study doctor will explain this to you.

      The drug furosemide will be given by vein while you receive cyclophosphamide to try to
      increase the amount of urine your body makes.

      The T-cell infusion may cause an allergic reaction such as fever, chills, and/or shivering.
      You will take Tylenol (acetaminophen) by mouth before the T-cell infusion to decrease the
      risk of these side effects.

      You will receive the drug ondansetron by vein over 30 minutes to decrease the risk of nausea
      and vomiting during chemotherapy.

      It is possible that you will receive a 2nd round of chemotherapy, aldesleukin, and T-cells.
      You will repeat the study visit schedule as well. Your doctor will discuss this with you.

      Study Visits:

      Every 1-2 days during Days -7 to 26, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      While you receive CXCR2 and NGFR T-cells, your vital signs will be measured before T-cell
      infusion, every 15 (+/- 10 minutes) minutes during the infusion, and then 1 time an hour (+/-
      30 minutes) for 4 hours after the infusion.

      On Day 3 and at 3 weeks (+/-7 days) after the T-cell infusion, if your blood tests show that
      you had cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the past, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check
      for CMV. Some of the T-cells that you receive may come from donors who have tested positive
      for CMV in the past.

      On Days 0, 6, and 27, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the activity of the
      T-cells and their ability to attack the tumor. If you return for follow up this blood will
      also be drawn 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after you receive the CXCR2
      and NGFR T-cells.

      On Day 21 (+/- 7 days), you will have a tumor biopsy to check the status of the disease, if
      the doctor thinks it is possible. The type of biopsy will depend on the size and location of
      the tumor.

      At about 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) and 12 weeks (+/- 7 days), the following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will be checked for any skin lesions.

        -  You will have an x-ray of the chest

        -  You will have a CT or PET/CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status
           of the disease.

        -  You will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your health and quality of life.
           This questionnaire should take about 15 minutes to complete.

      Leftover blood samples will be stored at MD Anderson for future research related to cancer.
      Before your samples can be used for research, the researchers must get approval from the
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson. The IRB is a committee of doctors,
      researchers, and community members. The IRB is responsible for protecting study participants
      and making sure all research is safe and ethical.

      Your samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked
      to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code
      numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the
      samples to be updated as needed.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 2 rounds of the study drugs (up to 12 weeks). You will no longer be
      able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or
      if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment and
      follow-up visits.

      If all of the tests are normal and show no change, blood (about 2-4 tablespoons) will be
      collected from you at every visit and stored in case you develop symptoms later. This blood
      may be tested to check the number of t-cells in your blood and how they are functioning. If
      you give your consent below, in the optional procedures section, any blood left over from
      these tests will be stored and used for use in future research.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      About 6 and 12 months after you stop receiving the study drugs and T-cells, blood (about 1
      tablespoon) will be drawn to check the activity of the T-cells.

      If you are unable to return for the follow-up blood draws, you will be asked how you are
      doing either by phone or at one of your standard clinic visits about every 3 months for a
      year and then 1 time a year for 10 years. If the study is completed sooner than that, you
      will no longer have the follow-up.

      One (1) time a year for up to 15 years, you will be mailed two questionnaires about your
      health and quality of life. This questionnaires should take about 15 minutes to complete. You
      will be given a self-addressed, stamped envelope in order to return the questionnaire.

      This is an investigational study. CXCR2 and NGFR T-cells is not FDA approved or commercially
      available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      Cyclophosphamide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several
      types of cancer (such as leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer).

      Fludarabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of B-cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia.

      Aldesleukin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of Metastatic
      melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.

      The study doctor will tell you how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
