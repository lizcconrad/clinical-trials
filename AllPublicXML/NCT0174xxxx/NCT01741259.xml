  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if epidural meperidine administered by
      patient-controlled bolus button is equivalent to a low dose infusion plus patient-controlled
      bolus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, patient satisfaction, and incidence
      of side effects of meperidine patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with and without a
      basal infusion for post-cesarean section analgesia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal Pain Score With Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>36-48 hours post-op (until epidural is stopped)</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal Pain Score on a 0-10 scale is recorded by the nurse at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36,40, 44, and 48 hours after transfer to the post-partum floor. On this scale, 0 represents no pain at all and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable. Because we were relying on nurses to capture this data in the course of normal patient care, scores within 1 hour before or after the goal time were accepted. For each patient, the average of all pain scores was taken and this was considered to be the average pain score while the epidural meperidine was being given.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nausea and Vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>36-48 hours post-op (until epidural is stopped)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of nausea and vomiting will be estimated by the administration of ondansetron during the study period as recorded in the patient record.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pruritus</measure>
    <time_frame>36-48 hours post-op (until the epidural is stopped)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of pruritus will be estimated by the administration of diphenhydramine or nalbuphine during the study period as recorded in the patient record.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dysphoria</measure>
    <time_frame>36-48 hours post-op (until epidural is stopped)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of dysphoria will be captured when a nurse calls the anesthesia team to alert them. This information is tracked on the physician rounding sheet. The record will also be reviewed if an epidural is discontinued earlier than the morning of the second post-operative day to find out if dysphoria was the cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inadequate Analgesia</measure>
    <time_frame>36-48 hours post-op (until the epidural is stopped)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients routinely get scheduled ibuprofen as an adjunct to the epidural infusion. The record will be reviewed to see if ketorolac is substituted for ibuprofen or other pain medications such as acetaminophen either alone or in combination with oxycodone or other narcotic pain relievers are administered. The record will also be reviewed if an epidural is discontinued earlier than the morning of the second post-operative day to find out if inadequate analgesia was the cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>36-48 hours post-op (until the epidural is stopped)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse outcomes such as seizures or respiratory depression will be reported to anesthesia personnel by nursing if they occur. Patients are monitored for respiratory rate and sedation every 1 hour for 24 hours, then every 2 hours for 24 hours. Pulse, blood pressure, and neurocirculatory checks are performed every 2 hours for 24 hours and then every 4 hours per our nursing protocol.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Drug Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours post-op or when the epidural is stopped</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacy will generate a report of the drug total from the pump on return to pharmacy.</description>

        <title>Verbal Pain Score With Movement</title>
        <description>Verbal Pain Score on a 0-10 scale is recorded by the nurse at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36,40, 44, and 48 hours after transfer to the post-partum floor. On this scale, 0 represents no pain at all and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable. Because we were relying on nurses to capture this data in the course of normal patient care, scores within 1 hour before or after the goal time were accepted. For each patient, the average of all pain scores was taken and this was considered to be the average pain score while the epidural meperidine was being given.</description>

          <title>Inadequate Analgesia</title>
          <description>Patients routinely get scheduled ibuprofen as an adjunct to the epidural infusion. The record will be reviewed to see if ketorolac is substituted for ibuprofen or other pain medications such as acetaminophen either alone or in combination with oxycodone or other narcotic pain relievers are administered. The record will also be reviewed if an epidural is discontinued earlier than the morning of the second post-operative day to find out if inadequate analgesia was the cause.</description>
