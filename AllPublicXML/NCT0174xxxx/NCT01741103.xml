    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of sitagliptin on overall blood glucose
      concentrations in Type I Diabetic subjects. The study also aims to evaluate post meal
      glucagon concentrations in Type I Diabetic subjects (a possible mechanism of reduced blood
      glucose concentrations) and indices of oxidation stress in the plasma of these subjects.

      The hypothesis is that Sitagliptin will improve overall blood glucose, fasting blood glucose,
      and glycemic excursions in patients with Type I Diabetes. In addition, sitagliptin will
      likely suppress indices of oxidative stress in patients. The study will investigate proposed
      mechanisms of improved glucose concentrations, including enhanced effect of endogenous GLP-1
      and suppression of glucagon.
