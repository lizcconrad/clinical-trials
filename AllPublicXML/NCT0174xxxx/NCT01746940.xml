      This study aims to evaluate topical application of Cocaine HCl 4% and 10% on safety and
      efficacy in local (topical) anesthesia for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through
      accessible mucous membranes of the nasal cavities.

      Randomized, prospective, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      a Placebo Topical Solution versus Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% Topical Solution as an anesthetic
      prior to a diagnostic procedure or surgery.

      In the Safety and Efficacy first phase, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one
      of the three treatment groups (placebo, Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% topical solution) pre-procedure
      and given one application of up to 4 mL from one bottle of the assigned test product. After
      pre-procedure Von Frey filament testing, the blind will be broken, but only relative to
      placebo versus cocaine, not relative to the strength of the cocaine. The placebo subjects
      will then exit participation in the efficacy portion of the trial, and be followed for safety
      for 7 days. Treatment group subjects who do not feel pain after Von Frey testing will receive
      their surgery or diagnostic procedure and also be followed for safety for 7 days.

      In the Safety second phase, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of the two
      treatment groups (Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% topical solution) pre-procedure and given one
      application of up to one 4 mL of the assigned test product. After pre-procedure Von Frey
      filament testing reveals a pain score of 0, subjects will receive their surgery or diagnostic
      procedure, and then all subjects will be followed for safety for 7 days.

    <description>The primary endpoint for this trial is analgesic success immediately after application of study drug and sustained throughout the diagnostic procedure or surgery for each nostril that received the study drug application. A subject will be considered a treatment success if they meet the following: Prior to the procedure or surgery, a 0 pain score on the 10 point pain scale (0=no pain, 10=unbearable pain) based on the Von Frey filament challenge after application of the assigned treatment solution (placebo, 4% or 10% Cocaine HCl). During the procedure or surgery, no further analgesic treatment is required (only 4% and 10% Cocaine HCl subjects who receive a procedure or surgery). Otherwise, the subject will be considered a treatment failure. Subjects with missing primary outcome data are marked as treatment failures in all treatment groups.</description>

    <description>Group 1: Placebo group -Placebo solution, up to 4 mL, is applied for 20 minutes via cotton pledget(s), then the nasal site is tested with a Von Frey (or equivalent) filament (Size 5.18, about 15 grams of force) to determine and record pain on a pain scale of 0 to 10. The subject will then exit the treatment portion of the trial and be followed for safety for seven days . All placebo subjects, regardless of Von Frey filament test results, will undergo Phase 1 recovery (i.e. at least 90 minutes after cotton pledget removal) and associated required study procedures (including the final 12 lead ECG). After a minimum of 24 hours from the time of study drug pledget removal, the subject may continue the procedure, and the treatment reverts to standard anesthetic management (suitable products at the discretion of the investigator). Alternatively, at the investigator's discretion, the diagnostic procedure or surgery may be delayed until study termination.</description>

          -  Has a history of abuse of controlled substances, nasal or otherwise, or has damage to
             the nasal space that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the
             ability of the subject or the investigator to judge anesthesia from the trial drug.

          -  Has used any investigational drug(s) within 30 days preceding the randomization.

          -  Is pregnant or is a nursing mother

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must be using an acceptable method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study, and for women 30 days and men
             90 days after the last dose of investigational product in such a manner that the risk
             of pregnancy and risk to pregnancy is minimized.

          -  Is &lt; 18 years of age

          -  Suffers from a condition, other than the need for a diagnostic procedure or surgery of
             or through the nasal mucous membranes which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would

             wound healing process.

          -  Use of any analgesic 2 days prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs during
             the screening period. This includes NSAID such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin,

             chlorpromazine, thioridazine, theophylline, or tricyclic antidepressants such as
             amitriptyline.

          -  Has previously received study drug during this study. Subjects who fail screening may
             rescreen if eligibility requirements are met.

             failure, irregular heart rhythm (as fully defined in sections 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 of the
             protocol), or uncontrolled hypertension or is taking (or has recently taken) monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors. Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure
             greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal
             to 90 mm Hg

          -  Has a known personal or family history of hereditary pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
             Study participants will be screened by asking about personal or family history of
             anesthetic reaction, anesthetic death, and previous diagnosis of pseudocholinesterase
             deficiency in a relative or personally. Subjects identified with pseudocholinesterase
             deficiency are at risk for delayed recovery with certain anesthetics (e.g.
             succinylcholine and ester-based anesthetics).

             products such as catecholamines (norepinephrine or epinephrine), ephedrine,
             pseudoephedrine and any other amphetamines in the 48 hours prior to screening or has a
             need to use these drugs during the course of the study. All herbal products are also
             prohibited within 48 hours prior to screening or if the subject has a need to use
             these drugs during the course of the study.

          -  Has screening 12-lead ECG findings of any abnormalities as listed in sections 7.9.4,
             7.9.5, and 7.9.6 of the protocol. Generally, these are current or prior myocardial
             ischemia or infarction, dysrhythmia, or risk of serious dysrhythmia (such as prolonged
             QT interval) An exception to this would be from 7.9.5.11 if sinus bradycardia or sinus
             tachycardia is present, the Investigator must determine whether this finding is
             clinically relevant and exclusionary.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dL; a one-time retest will be allowed for Hb 8.3-8.4 g/dL

          -  WBC &lt; 3.5 x 103 cells/mcL; a one-time retest will be allowed for WBC 3.3-3.4 x 103

          -  Serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin not exceeding 2X ULN for the lab's reference values

          -  Cardiac enzymes outside of the range of normal

          -  Coagulation studies that in the opinion of the investigator would be cause for the
             subject to be excluded from the study.

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test at screening or Day 1

          -  Positive urine drug test at screening or Day 1 without prior medically-necessary use
             of controlled substances (for example, benzodiazepines for anxiety)

        <description>The primary endpoint for this trial is analgesic success immediately after application of study drug and sustained throughout the diagnostic procedure or surgery for each nostril that received the study drug application. A subject will be considered a treatment success if they meet the following: Prior to the procedure or surgery, a 0 pain score on the 10 point pain scale (0=no pain, 10=unbearable pain) based on the Von Frey filament challenge after application of the assigned treatment solution (placebo, 4% or 10% Cocaine HCl). During the procedure or surgery, no further analgesic treatment is required (only 4% and 10% Cocaine HCl subjects who receive a procedure or surgery). Otherwise, the subject will be considered a treatment failure. Subjects with missing primary outcome data are marked as treatment failures in all treatment groups.</description>
