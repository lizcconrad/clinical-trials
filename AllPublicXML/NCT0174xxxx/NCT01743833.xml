  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder impingement has been identified as the most common cause of shoulder pain in the
      adult general population. Sometimes therapeutic pushing on the middle part of the back
      (manual therapy) decreases shoulder pain in someone experiencing shoulder impingement. We do
      not known what causes the decreased shoulder pain. It could be that the therapeutic pushing
      makes things move better. It may be that the person getting their back treatment thinks they
      are better or the physical therapist who provides the manual treatment thinks it works.

    <textblock>
      Shoulder impingement has been identified as the most common cause of shoulder pain in the
      adult general population. High-Velocity, Low-Amplitude Thrust Manipulations (HVLATM) of the
      thoracic spine and ribs result in increased shoulder ROM, as well as decreased pain and
      disability in patients suffering shoulder impingement. The quality of the sparse publications
      is low and lacking control or comparison groups regarding the use of HVLATM in the management
      of shoulder impingement. Further higher quality randomized clinical trials are needed.
      Moreover, no research has investigated the effects of the patients beliefs and different
      types of verbal messages conveyed by the clinician to the subjects in regard to the effects
      of HVLATM of the thoracic spine on shoulder pain and function. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate, in subjects with signs and symptoms of shoulder impingement: (1) the effects of
      a series of the prone thoracic spine High Velocity Low Amplitude Thrust Manipulation (HVLATM)
      as compared to the HVLATM directed at the scapula, on shoulder pain, impingement symptoms,
      and functional outcomes; (2) the effect of the type of message and language used by the
      clinician in regard to thoracic HVLATM on shoulder pain, impingement symptoms, and functional
      outcomes; (3) the effect of subject's expectation of outcome of thoracic and scapula HVLATM
      on shoulder pain, impingement symptoms, and functional outcomes; (4) if these potential
      immediate improvements will be sustained at 6 to 9-day follow up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A consecutive convenience sampling of patients with complaints of shoulder pain that
             are not post-surgical will be screened at their initial evaluation. Subjects between
             the ages of 18 and 69 years will be included if they present with a painful arc of
             shoulder active ROM. Additional requirements for inclusion will be (1) shoulder pain
             greater than 1/10 but less than 9/10 at time of testing; (2) shoulder active ROM above
             horizontal; (3) the ability to lie prone with arms at their side; and (4) at least one
             of the following signs or symptoms: (1) a positive Hawkins-Kennedy Sign; (2) a
             positive Neer Impingement Sign; (3) painful resisted abduction; (4) painful resisted
             external rotation at 0°of abduction with the elbows bent to 90°

        Exclusion Criteria:
