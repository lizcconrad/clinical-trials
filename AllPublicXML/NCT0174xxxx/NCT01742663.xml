    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the relative efficacy and safety of the test
      formulation diclofenac sodium gel 3% (Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc.) to the marketed formulation
      Solaraze® (diclofenac sodium) Gel 3% (Fougera Pharms) in the treatment of actinic keratosis.

      Both the test and reference formulations will also be compared to a placebo formulation to
      test for superiority.
