      This is a dose finding study using a 3 + 3 dose escalation and expansion design to determine
      a Not Tolerated Dose (NTD), Optimal Biological Effect Dose (OBE) and / or Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD). These data will be used to establish a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for the
      combination of CC-292 and Rituximab in subjects with CLL.

    <textblock>
      This dose finding study uses a 3 + 3 dose escalation and expansion design to establish the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Treatment will consist 28 day treatment cycles with a single
      Rituximab infusion per cycle for 6 cycles and twice daily (days 1-28) administration of
      CC-292 with a starting dose cohort of 375mg twice a day. Following safety review of the data
      from the initial cohort and confirmation that the initial dose is tolerable, the next dose
      level will be enrolled with a once per cycle Rituximab infusion for 6 cycles and twice daily
      CC-292 at 500 mg.

      Determination of the maximum tolerated dose and/or optimal biologic effect will be used to
      establish a dose for evaluation in an expansion cohort of 24 subjects. Evaluation of the data
      for subjects in the expansion cohorts will result in establishment of a RP2D.

                  administered during screening for the sole purpose of helping a subject exceed
                  these exclusionary laboratory values.
