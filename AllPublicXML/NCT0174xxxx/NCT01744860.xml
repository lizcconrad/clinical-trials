  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will compare the Cobas BRAF V600 mutation assay with in-house
      methods used in molecular laboratories for the assessment of the BRAF mutation status in
      melanoma tumor samples. No patients will be enrolled in this study. Data will be collected
      for approximately 6 months.
