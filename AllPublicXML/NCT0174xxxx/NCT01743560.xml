    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success is defined as: The best overall response for each patient is determined from the sequence of investigator overall lesion responses according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1.) To be assigned a best overall response of Complete Responese (CR) at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart before progression are required. To be assigned a best overall response of Partial Response (PR) at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression (and not qualifying for a CR) are required.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from date of start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, progression-free survival is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.</description>
