  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate superiority of the solifenacin succinate
      (treatment) over the placebo (control) based on the change from the baseline in the mean
      number of urgency episodes per 24 hours after 2 weeks.

      The BPH (benign prostate hyperplasia) patients who have OAB (overactive bladder) after TURP
      (trans-urethral resection of prostate) or PVP (photoselective vaporization of prostate) will
      participate in this study. The subjects will be randomized 1:1 to the solifenacin succinate
      group or to the placebo treatment group. The subjects shall take investigational product each
      night before sleeping from for four weeks and complete voiding diary. At Week-2 and Week-4 of
      the treatment, the subjects will be asked to complete the following activities: physical
      exam, vital signs test, IPSS, OABSS, post-void residual (PVR) test, and uroflowmetry, and
      will be asked to answer the BSW, (Benefit, Satisfaction and Willingness to Continue
      Questions) questionnaire.
