  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with lymphoma that recurs after chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation using
      cells from a healthy donor represents potentially curative treatment. In these individuals,
      cure is possible because transplantation of healthy donor immune cells can fight the lymphoma
      in the patient. The goal of this work is to test a strategy that activates the healthy donor
      immune cells so that they more effectively fight lymphoma and can result in an increased cure
      rate for these patients. Our group has previously studied CpG, an immune activating
      medication, in patients with lymphoma and demonstrated modest anti-tumor responses. We now
      have a more potent form of CpG which we intend to test to see if it will better activate the
      donor immune cells and result in shrinkage of tumor throughout the entire body, not just at
      the injected site.

      Patients will receive low dose radiation to all bulky or symptomatic lymph nodes on days -2
      and -1. SD-101 will be administered intratumorally to the single largest palpable node within
      24 hours after completion of radiation, on day 0. Two additional intratumoral SD-101
      injections will be performed on days 7 (+/- 2 days) and 14 (+/- 2 days). This is a dose
      ranging study using a 3+3 design with a definition of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which our
      group has found acceptable in the past. The first cohort of patients will receive a SD-101
      dose of 0.3 mg per injection. The dose will be escalated to 1 mg and 3 mg based on dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT).
