          3. Subject's symptoms can be reproduced with resisted supination or wrist dorsiflexion

          4. Subject's symptoms have persisted for at least 3 months despite conservative treatment
             that includes one or combinations of:

             in less than three months prior to enrollment

          2. Subject has received previous Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injection to the affected
             elbow

          3. Subject is deemed to require a corticosteroid injection into the affected elbow during
             the course of the study

          4. Subject uses chronic medications known to affect the skeleton (e.g. glucocorticoid
             usage &gt;10mg/day)

          5. Subject has undergone surgical intervention to the affected elbow for the treatment of
             lateral epicondylitis

          6. Subject has a positive medical history of any of the following:

               1. medial epicondylitis

               2. radial tunnel syndrome

             suspected of having a malignancy or are currently undergoing radio- or chemotherapy
             treatment for a malignancy anywhere in the body, whether adjacent to or distant from
             the proposed rhPDGF-BB Injection treatment site

          9. Subject is physically or mentally compromised (e.g. currently being treated for a
