      This is a personalized anti-cancer vaccine protocol which includes an in-situ (in the body)
      cancer vaccine step which combines killing a single metastatic tumor lesion by use of
      cryoablation in order to cause the release of tumor-specific markers to the immune system and
      then injecting bioengineered allogeneic immune cells (AlloStim) into the lesion as an
      adjuvant in order to modulate the immune response and educate the immune system to kill other
      tumor cells where ever they reside in the body.

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide. Metastasis is the
      main reason of death in CRC patients. The current drugs used to treat colorectal cancer
      provide important treatment options for patients, their limitations including drug
      resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects. Development of new therapeutic strategies
      for KRAS mutant as well as BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed in order to offer a
      new category of drug (immunotherapy). This study targets the population of mCRC patients that
      have progressed after two lines of chemotherapy and are not eligible for targeted therapies
      due to a mutation in KRAS or BRAF.

      This is a Phase II/III, randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, two arm study
      designed to determine the efficacy in terms of OS and the safety of the InSituVax (AlloStim+
      Cryoablation) personalized in-situ anti-cancer vaccine protocol (Treatment Arm) compared with
      Physician's Choice (PC) of Treatment + Cryoablation (Control Arm) in Metastatic Colorectal
      Cancer. Subjects are randomized 2:1 into the treatment or control arms.

    <description>AlloStim® is derived from the blood of normal blood donors and is intentionally mismatched to the recipient. CD4+ T-cells are separated from the blood and differentiated and expanded for 9-days in culture to make an intermediary called T-Stim. AlloStim is made by incubating T-Stim cells for 4h with antibody coated microbeads. The cells with the beads still attached are suspended in infusion media and loaded into syringes. The syringes are shipped refrigerated to the point-of-care.</description>
