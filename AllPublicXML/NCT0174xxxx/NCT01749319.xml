  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize baclofen pharmacokinetics following
      oral and intravenous administration in patients who are on chronic oral baclofen therapy. The
      secondary objective is to determine the safety profile of an IV baclofen formulation.

      This study is a randomized crossover study with two treatment arms. All subjects will receive
      a dose of oral baclofen and a dose of IV baclofen on separate study days. Whether the oral or
      intravenous form is given on the first study day will be randomized in a 1:1 manner.

      The pharmacokinetic and tolerability information gained from this study will support the
      development of further studies to assess the use of IV baclofen to prevent or treat baclofen
      withdrawal syndrome.

    <description>A rating scale of ataxia will be used:
0=none, 1=mild, 2=severe
For those who are ambulatory, this will be assessed by gait. Ratings will be:
mild-unsteady with tandem gait testing, but able to perform without assistance severe-unable to perform tandem gait testing without assistance. For non-ambulatory subjects, ataxia will be assessed by finger to nose and finger pursuit maneuvers.</description>
