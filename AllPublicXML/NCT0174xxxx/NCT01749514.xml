                  Day 1, not influenced by RBC transfusion within 7 days of measurement) for
                  non-transfusion dependent patients (defined as having received &lt; 4 units of RBCs

             treatment:

               -  Dose escalation cohorts and expansion cohort 1 patients: Serum erythropoietin
                  level &gt; 500 U/L, OR, if ≤ 500 U/L, patient is non-responsive, refractory, or
                  intolerant to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), or ESAs are
                  contraindicated or unavailable.

                  level ≤ 200 U/L. If a patient is RS- (defined as having &lt; 15% ring sideroblasts
                  in the bone marrow), prior ESA treatment and any serum erythropoietin level is
                  allowed.

             2.0 µg/L]) and vitamin B12 (≥ 148 pmol/L [≥ 200 pg/mL]) during screening
             (supplementation and retest during screening is acceptable).

          8. Females of child bearing potential (defined as sexually mature women who have not
             undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or are not naturally postmenopausal
