  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate and compare the objective response rate of SPI-1620
      administered in combination with docetaxel in patients with NSCLC and to determine the safety
      of SPI-1620 when administered in combination with docetaxel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two part study. In Single Arm Part, patients will receive 11 μg/m2 of SPI-1620
      IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV. Cycles will continue every 3 weeks until progression or
      intolerable toxicity. Overall 27 patients will be enrolled in the Single Arm Part. If 6 or
      more responses (CR/PR) are observed in this group then the Randomized Part will be initiated.

      In the Randomized Part approximately 200 patients (100 per arm) will be randomized to receive
      SPI-1620 plus docetaxel or docetaxel alone.

      In the experimental arm, patients will receive 11 μg/m2 of SPI-1620 IV followed by docetaxel
      75 mg/m2 IV administered in 3-week cycles until progression or intolerable toxicity. In the
      control arm, patients will receive 75 mg/m2 docetaxel in 3-week cycles until progression or
      intolerable toxicity.

    <description>Single Arm &amp; Randomized Part:
On Day 1, the patient will receive standard docetaxel premedication followed by SPI-1620 11 μg/m2 administered intravenously over one minute. Patients will receive docetaxel 10 (±2) minutes following the infusion of SPI-1620. Docetaxel dose is 75 mg/m2 infusion. Patients will continue to receive SPI-1620 plus docetaxel once every 3 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Overall 27 patients will be enrolled in the Single Arm Part. If 6 or more responses are observed in this group then the Randomized Part will be initiated. About 100 patient in the experimental arm will receive SPI-1620 &amp; Docetaxel</description>
