  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will seek to enroll 372 adult otherwise healthy subjects presenting with
      influenza-like illness (ILI). Subjects will enter the study based on listed
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, including a positive Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) for influenza
      virus (IFV).

      Subjects will be randomized into one of three treatment groups: a DAS181 30 mg total dose
      group (DAS181-F02 formulation), a DAS181 60 mg total dose group (DAS181-F04 formulation) or a
      placebo group.

      The modified intent to treat (mITT) analysis set will include subjects with confirmed
      influenza as documented by qPCR or TCID50. The full analysis set will be used for activity
      analysis and will include all randomized subjects with baseline and treatment data. Per
      protocol, the safety analysis sets are described below in statistical methods.

      A subpopulation of 60 participants will also have additional PK and Immunogenicity blood
      samples collected. For this subgroup, PK and Immunogenicity samples will be collected at all
      study visits.

    <description>Because of the possibility of unacceptable or excessive defined serious adverse events during the treatment period or the study enrollment period, a stopping rule for safety/tolerability has been introduced in the design.
The following two stopping rule criteria will initiate an ad hoc DSMB data evaluation.
5% with a related SAE post-dose Day 1 through Day 28 , or
15% with related DAIDS toxicity Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities post-dose Day 1 through Day 28
Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities in hematology or serum chemistry, excluding absolute neutrophils and absolute lymphocytes.
Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities in hematology or serum chemistry including absolute neutrophils and absolute lymphocytes
Changes (absolute and percent) from baseline in influenza viral load from Day 1 to Day 2 as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) from pharyngeal wash and nasal wash samples.</description>
