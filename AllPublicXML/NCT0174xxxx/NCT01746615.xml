    <textblock>
      Assessment of retinal vessel calibers combined with bidirectional Fourier domain optical
      coherence tomography (FDOCT) for measurement of retinal blood velocities is a new and
      sophisticated method for assessing retinal blood flow in humans. The valid measurement of
      retinal blood flow is of significant importance, because it is known that major ophthalmic
      diseases are associated with alterations in blood flow.

      As such, retinal vascular occlusive diseases represent a major cause of visual impairment and
      blindness. The prevalence of the disease is between 0.7 and 1.6%. Compression of the retinal
      veins at arterio-venous (AV) crossings plays an important role in the development of branch
      retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The mechanical narrowing of the vessel lumen is supposed to be
      the mechanism behind this fact. The present study should elucidate how BRVO influences
      retinal blood flow at retinal vessel crossings in comparison to healthy control subjects.
      Retinal blood flow at retinal bifurcations will also be assessed. In addition, a fundus image
      will be taken to assess retinal oxygen saturation.

      For the first time we use a combination of a dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA) with bidirectional
      Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FDOCT) to assess retinal blood flow. Whereas the
      DVA provides information concerning retinal vessel caliber, FDOCT provides laser Doppler
      information in addition to conventional optical coherence tomography, allowing the
      observation of blood flow dynamics simultaneously.

      In the present study we hypothesize that the DVA in combination with FDOCT is a suitable new
      tool for the assessment of blood flow in healthy subjects and in patients with BRVO.
