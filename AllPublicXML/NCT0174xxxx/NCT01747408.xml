  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study was set up to evaluate the tolerability and safety of 25% human albumin
      (HA) therapy in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It is estimated that 37,500
      people in the USA have SAH every year. SAH is associated with a 51% mortality rate and one
      third of survivors are left functionally dependent. Cerebral vasospasm (CV) has been
      identified as the most important reason for neurological deterioration. CV may be due to
      multiple molecular mechanisms. The use of a neuroprotective agent with various actions, likes
      HA, would be important for prevention of CV and improved clinical outcome in patients with
      SAH. The proposed open-label, dose-escalation study will have important public health
      implications by providing necessary information for a definitive phase III clinical trial
      regarding the efficacy of treatment with HA in patients with SAH. The study was to enroll a
      maximum of 80 patients with SAH who meet the eligibility criteria. Four dosages of HA (0.625,
      1.25, 1.875, and 2.5 g/kg) administered daily for seven days will be evaluated. The lowest
      dosage was to be evaluated in the first group of 20 subjects. A specific safety threshold was
      defined based on data from previous studies. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board approved or
      disapproved advancing to the next higher HA dosage based on the evaluation of the rate of
      congestive heart failure (CHF). The study assessed three outcomes: safety and tolerability of
      the HA dosages and the functional outcome. The primary tolerability outcome was defined as
      the subject's ability to receive the full allocated dose of HA without incurring frank CHF
      that requires termination of treatment. Secondary safety outcomes were serious adverse events
      (including neurological and medical complications, and anaphylactic reactions). Neurological
      complications comprise incidence of CV, rebleeding, hydrocephalus, and seizures after
      treatment. The three-month functional outcome determined, by Glasgow Outcome Scale, Barthel
      Index, modified Rankin Scale, NIH Stroke Scale and Stroke Impact Scale was measured to obtain
      a preliminary estimate of the treatment effect of HA. The timeline of the study is three
      years.
