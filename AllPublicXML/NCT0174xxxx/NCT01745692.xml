  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic strokes (those caused by blockage in an artery in the brain caused by a blood clot)
      can be treated with very early use of clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs to attempt to restore
      the blood supply and limit the damage, resulting in an increased proportion of people making
      a recovery to independence after stroke. However, drug treatment only succeed in restoring
      blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries (10-25% depending on the
      size of the blood vessel) and these people also have the most severe strokes and highest risk
      of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best treatment is therefore least
      effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices that can be fed through the
      blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the brain vessels can open this
      type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a highly skilled procedure and
      it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities (including anaesthetic, nurses and
      medical support) and to reach the blockage. The extra time that is required to use these
      devices may mean that brain tissue is already irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual
      patient cannot benefit and indeed may be harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed
      clinical trials comparing the outcome in people treated with standard stroke treatment and
      those treated with devices. PISTE is a randomised, controlled trial to test whether
      additional mechanical thrombectomy device treatment improves functional outcome in patients
      with large artery occlusion who are given IV thrombolytic drug treatment as standard care.

          -  Interventional device delivery (guide catheter placed beyond aortic arch and angio
             obtained) can be achieved within 6 hours of onset of the stroke.

          -  Consent of patient or representative.

          -  Independent prior to the stroke (estimated mRS 02)

          -  Alternative intracranial pathology potentially responsible for the new symptoms

          -  Medical comorbidities which would preclude safe cerebral vessel catheterisation or
