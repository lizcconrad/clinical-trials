  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aorta is the main blood vessel that comes out of the heart and distributes blood to the
      whole body. In some people, the aorta becomes swollen (aneurysm) and bursts, especially as it
      passes through the abdomen. These 'abdominal aortic aneurysms' often occur without symptoms
      and can burst or rupture without warning. This usually leads to death and represents the
      thirteenth commonest cause of death in the United Kingdom. In this study, we are looking at a
      new technique that can look at the aortic aneurysm using magnetic resonance imaging; a
      technique that does not require x-rays or radiation. We have recently shown that, using
      magnetic resonance combined with a new imaging agent USPIO, we can detect 'hotspots' of
      activity in these aneurysms that seem to predict which aneurysms grow rapidly, and are
      therefore potentially at risk of rupture. We here propose to conduct a study in Edinburgh
      that will invite all patients who are under surveillance because of an aneurysm. We will
      image these patients using this novel technique and see if we can identify which patients
      burst their aneurysm, have an aneurysm that grows so large it needs to have surgery, or die.
      This will be important to establish as it will potentially lead to a new way of managing
      people that could ultimately save lives. This is particularly timely as national screening
      and surveillance programmes are currently being launched.

      HYPOTHESIS We hypothesise that uptake of ultrasmall supraparamagnetic particles of iron oxide
      into the aortic wall will predict abdominal aortic aneurysm growth and clinical outcomes.

    <description>The change of R2* signal which is determined by the USPIO uptake within the issues will be used to assess the change between pre-and post contrast MRI scans.

    <measure>Does USPIO uptake as determined by percentage change between pre-and post contrast scan co-relates with FDG PET standardised uptake values or tissue to background ratios.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 yrs</time_frame>
    <description>As per ethical approval, we have recruited patients under AAA PET study to look at USPIO correlation with 18F-FDG PET. The cellular inflammation can be assessed by USPIO uptake, whilst the metabolic activity can be determined by 18F-FDG PET. In this study, the investigators will determine if there is a correlation between the these two imaging modalties by comparing the R2* change using MRI and standardised uptake values using FDG PET.</description>

        The investigators will recruit 237 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms from the
        clinical surveillance programme at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. Inclusion criteria will
        be patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt;40 mm on ultrasound scanning. Exclusion
        criteria will include patients with anticipated or planned abdominal aortic aneurysm
        repair, women of child-bearing potential without contraception, inability to undergo
        magnetic resonance or computed tomography scanning, life expectancy of &lt;2 years, and those
        with any form of collagen-vascular disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical history or clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening
             medical examination, vital sign measurement, or clinical laboratory examination that
             is deemed by the principal investigator and/or designee to make the subject ineligible
             for inclusion.

          2. Subjects with planned AAA surgery.

          3. Renal impairment with eGFR of &lt;30 mls/min at screening, history of kidney transplant

          6. Inability to undergo magnetic resonance or computed tomography scanning,

          7. Contraindication to MRI scanning (as assessed by local MRI safety questionnaire) which
             includes but not limited to:

               -  Intracranial aneurysm clips (except Sugita) or other metallic objects,

               -  History of intra- orbital metal fragments that have not been removed,
