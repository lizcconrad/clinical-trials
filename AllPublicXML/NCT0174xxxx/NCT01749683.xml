      The goal of this study is to use MCE (myocardial contrast/perfusion echocardiography) to
      study and compare short/long term change of myocardial perfusion abnormality and cardiac
      outcome in diabetic patients after nonfatal MI (heart attack), who are treated with different
      glucose control agents.
