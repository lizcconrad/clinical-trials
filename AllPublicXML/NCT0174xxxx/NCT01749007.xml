  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to gather pilot data related to exploring relationships
      between cognitive impairment and/or psychiatric distress and suicidal thoughts and/or
      behaviors in Veterans with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency
      Syndrome (AIDS). To achieve this goal, a neuropsychological battery will be administered to
      Veterans with HIV/AIDS.
