  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the impact of 24, 48 and 72 hours of over and underfeeding on
      energy expenditure as measured in the metabolic chamber at the UNC Chapel Hill Nutrition
      Research Institute (UNC NRI).

    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete a baseline eucaloric study day. Following this, subjects will be
      randomized to complete 3 days of overfeeding (150% of baseline eucaloric energy requirements)
      or 3 days of underfeeding (50% of baseline eucaloric energy requirements). After completing
      one of these study arms, subjects will cross-over and complete the second arm. All study arms
      will be separated by two weeks. 24-hour energy expenditure will be measured 3 times during
      each of 3 day periods. We hypothesize that the impact of over or underfeeding on EE will be
      evident after 24-hours and will be comparable to 72 hour EE.

    <description>To assess 24-hour energy expenditure and substrate utilization subjects will spend 23 hours and 15 minutes each day in the metabolic chamber at the UNC NRI. Subjects will be requested to arrive at the study center each morning following a 10hour overnight fast. During each study day, subjects remained sedentary. All meals were provided and were tailored to each subject's specific energy requirements and the study protocol (i.e. 50% or 150% of calorie requirements).</description>
