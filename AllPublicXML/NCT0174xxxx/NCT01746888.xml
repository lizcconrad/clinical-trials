      Gold standard diagnostic criteria for diagnosing acute infection in older adult patients in
      the Emergency Department do not currently exist. These patients often have atypical
      presentations which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. The development of an
      antimicrobial stewardship program for Emergency Department older adult patients can
      ultimately improve the accuracy of diagnosis and correct antimicrobial prescribing. This
      research study involves data collection from enrolled subjects and treating physicians. The
      data will be collected using a patient interview which will be answered directly by the
      patient or caregiver. Additional surveys will be administered to the Emergency Department
      treating physician and subsequent physician. Additional data will be abstracted from the
      Emergency Department chart and from additional charts that often accompanies the patient to
      the Emergency Department. A physician adjudication process will occur if there is
      disagreement in diagnosis between the treating Emergency Department physician and succeeding
      physician.
