      Background:

      - Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a brain disease that impairs memory, cognitive abilities and
      the ability to function independently. It is the most common cause of dementia in older
      people. It is caused by abnormal proteins in the brain that affect how neurons communicate
      with each other. Researchers are looking for drugs that can slow down the disease or treat
      its symptoms. One drug, called bisnorcymserine (BNC), may help improve brain function and
      symptoms in people with AD. BNC is designed to block a chemical that affects how neurons
      communicate with each other. Researchers want to see how BNC works in healthy older
      volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To look at how the body processes bisnorcymserine taken by mouth and how safe it is for
      healthy older volunteers.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers at least 55 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood and urine
           tests.

        -  Within 3 weeks from the screening visit, participants will come to the National
           Institute on Aging clinical unit for a 2-night stay. On the morning of the second day,
           they will take either a BNC capsule or a placebo. They will not know which tablet they
           are taking.

        -  Blood samples will be collected frequently throughout the second and third days of the
           study visit. The last blood sample will be collected about 32 hours after taking the
           study capsule. Participants will have heart function tests and other exams during the
           visit. Once the tests are done, they will leave the clinical center.

        -  Participants will have a final follow-up visit about 1 week after leaving the clinical
           center.

      Objective: Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs
      memory and other cognitive abilities, as well as behavior and the ability to function
      independently. It is the most common cause of dementia among older people. Alzheimer s
      disease is characterized by deficits in several neurotransmitter systems, most prominently
      acetylcholine (Ach). The cholinergic deficit in the AD brain is associated with the cognitive
      and functional symptoms in AD. Restoring this deficit in the cholinergic system is one proven
      approach for symptomatic treatment in AD. The action of Ach in the brain is terminated mainly
      by two enzymes called cholinesterases (ChEs): acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
      butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Inhibitors of these enzymes therefore augment the activity of
      surviving Ach neurons in AD. All ChEs inhibitors currently approved for the treatment of AD
      mainly inhibit AChE and, secondarily and to a varying extent, BChE. Reversible and
      brain-specific BChE inhibitors have been developed as a class of drugs called cymserine
      analogs. Scientists at the NIA/NIH have developed a novel BChE inhibitor called
      Bisnorcymserine (BNC). Pre-clinical evidence suggests that BNC may be a safe treatment for
      Alzheimer s disease. Based on this, we propose this first-in-human study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single doses of BNC tartrate administered
      orally.

      Study population: Healthy volunteers aged 55 years and older.

      Design: Double blind placebo-controlled Phase I clinical Trial of single oral doses of BNC
      doses in an ascending schedule: 20, 40mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, 270 mg and 380 mg. Each dose will be
      tested in groups of 8 subjects. Six subjects in each cohort will receive active drug and two
      will receive placebo. Subjects will be kept in the unit and followed clinically and with
      laboratory tests for adverse effects for 32 hours; they will return for a follow-up visit to
      assess safety in about 7 days. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability associated with each dose level before the next higher dose is tested in a new
      cohort. All research will be performed at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Clinical
      Research Unit located on the 5th floor of MedStar Harbor Hospital.
