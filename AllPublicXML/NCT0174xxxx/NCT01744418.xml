  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel, tissue-engineered
      vascular prosthesis, the Human Acellular Vascular Graft, HAVG.

      The HAVG is intended as an alternative to synthetic materials and to autologous grafts in the
      creation of vascular access for dialysis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HAVG is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, acellular tubular graft composed of human collagens and
      other natural extra-cellular matrix proteins. Upon implantation, it is anticipated (based on
      pre-clinical studies) that the collagen-based matrix comprising the graft will be infiltrated
      with host cells and re-modeled by the host. This will result in a vascular structure more
      similar to the histological composition of the native vascular tissue that may improve graft
      longevity and be less likely to become infected.

    <description>Patients will be implanted with a Human Acellular Vascular Graft (HAVG) in the forearm or upper arm (arterial anastomosis to the radial or brachial artery, venous anastomosis to either the brachial, cephalic or very central basilica vein) using standard vascular surgical techniques. The graft will be placed in a straight or curved configuration in the first 10 patients. Loop grafts may be permitted in subsequent patients subject to acceptable graft performance at the interim safety review. Placing the graft across the elbow will be avoided.</description>
