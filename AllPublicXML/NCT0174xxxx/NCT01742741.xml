  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An unblinded, randomized, cross-over design with each patient participating in two 40-hour
      outpatient admissions: (a) Experimental involving automated Control-to-Range (CTR) and (b)
      Control using Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)-augmented insulin pump treatment outside of a
      hospital based clinical research center.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal goal is to validate a smart phone-based control-to-range (CTR) system for
      ambulatory use and to estimate the effect of CTR vs. sensor-augmented pump therapy, thereby
      providing justification for further larger home-based trials of CTR.

    <measure>Effect size of Control-to-Range (CTR) vs. Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)-augmented insulin pump treatment in an outpatient setting.</measure>
    <time_frame>40 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators expect that compared to CGM-augmented insulin pump treatment, CTR will result in moderate effect size of approximately 0.4, in terms of reduction of the overnight risk for hypoglycemia as measured by the Low Blood Glucose Index computed from retrofitted CGM data. This effect is not expected to be statistically significant with the anticipated sample size but will be used to inform power analysis for the subsequent multi-center trial of CTR at home.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time spent in target range</measure>
    <time_frame>40 hours</time_frame>
    <description>CTR will improve (non-significantly at the projected sample size of N=5 subjects/site) the time spent within the target range of 80-140 mg/dL overnight (computed from retrofitted CGM data) and will reduce the extent of postprandial glucose excursions during the day. These data will provide justification and design support for a subsequent larger multi-center trial of CTR at home.</description>

    <description>Closed-Loop Control: Insulin delivery will be controlled by the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs)system running in Control to Range (CTR) or in Safety Only mode. The subject will interact with the system through its Graphic User Interface (GUI). Subjects will not be allowed to administer correction boluses between meals and snacks as the DiAs will automatically be adjusting insulin to correct the hyperglycemia. The total doses recommended by the DiAs prior to meals and snacks includes the correction dose and Insulin on Board (IOB) calculated by the system.</description>

    <description>Open Loop Control: Insulin delivery will be controlled by the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) system running in open-loop mode. Subjects will interact with the system through its Graphic User Interface (GUI). Subjects will be permitted to administer correction boluses at any time during the Control Admission, whether or not they are eating a scheduled meal or snack. DiAs will be initialized with the subject's typical insulin pump settings. Subjects will be reminded that all treatment decisions should be based on fingerstick values and not on continuous glucose monitor (CGM) values.</description>

    <description>A medical platform that uses a smart-phone to connect to a continuous glucose sensor to insulin pump and run closed-loop control. The cell phone runs the Control to Range and is connected to work with the insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor to help keep the blood sugar in a desired range (80-180 mg/dL during the day) and help avoid hypoglycemia during the night.</description>
