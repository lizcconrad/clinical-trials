    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, two-arm parallel, no-treatment group
      controlled (only for the first 6 months), Phase 3 study in children with ISS. The subjects
      will be treated with 0.067 milligram/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) of Saizen®, weight base dose,
      for 12 months (12 months of treatment in the test group, and 6 months of no treatment and
      then 6 months of treatment in the control group).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Height Velocity at Month 6 Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline height is defined as the last available height measurement before randomization. Baseline height velocity = ([Baseline height minus height measurement obtained at least 6 months prior] / 6) * 12. Height velocity at Month 6 = ([Month 6 height minus height measurement obtained at least 6 months prior] / 6) * 12.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Height Velocity at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline height is defined as the last available height measurement before randomization. Baseline height velocity = ([Baseline height minus height measurement obtained at least 12 months prior] / 12) * 12. Height velocity at Month 12 = ([Month 12 height minus height measurement obtained at least 12 months prior] / 12) * 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) at Month 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Height SDS was calculated as: Height SDS = (measured height - population mean) / population standard deviation, where mean and standard deviation were based on the Korean standard growth charts. SDS indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive SDS) or lower (in case of negative SDS) a subject's value was relative to the mean of the reference population. The scores were centred around zero. Negative score indicated a subject was smaller for their age/gender.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Adherence to Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-dose (Saizen Test Group and Saizen Control Group); 12 months post-dose (Saizen Test Group)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of adherence to study treatment (adherence rate) was defined as the actual number of received treatments divided by the scheduled number of treatments multiplied by 100. The adherence rate for 6 months was calculated from Baseline to 6 months for the Saizen Test Group and from Month 6 to Month 12 for the Saizen Control Group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 13</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this the study drug. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. For the Saizen Test Group, TEAEs were defined as events that occurred or worsened at or after the first administration of treatment and for the Saizen Control Group, TEAEs were defined as events that occurred or worsened at or after the randomization.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this the study drug. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. For the Saizen Test Group, TEAEs were defined as events that occurred or worsened at or after the first administration of treatment and for the Saizen Control Group, TEAEs were defined as events that occurred or worsened at or after the randomization.</description>
