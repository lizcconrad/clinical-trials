      Reducing the rest time after diagnostic cardiac catheterization for three hours does not
      increase the complications concerning to the procedure, compared to the rest of five hours.
      The aim of this study is to compare through a randomized clinical trial to reduce the rest
      time in bed for five hours after elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization, with a 6F
      sheath with a transfemoral approach, for a period of three hours of the occurrence of
      bleeding, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm and a vasovagal reaction.

    <description>Intervention group (IG), will maintain bed rest supine for two hours after the digital compression. After this period prescribed, patients sit in bed with the head elevated at 45 degrees for 50 minutes and then walk within the unit hemodynamic for about 10 minutes. Afterwards patients remain sitting out of bed in hemodynamics unit, until they are five hours, then they will be discharge.</description>
