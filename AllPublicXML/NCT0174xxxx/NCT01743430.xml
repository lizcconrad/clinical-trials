      Study 1: Background and Purpose—This study were to set up the telerehabilitation program for
      standing balance training, and to examine the training effects on balance and daily
      activities in subjects with subacute stroke.The null hypothesis included telerehabilitation
      balance training were not significantly different from conventional balance training in
      subjects with subacute stroke.

      Study 2: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation with
      group therapy on balance and daily activities in subjects with stroke living in long-term
      care facilities (LTC).The null hypothesis would be telerehabilitation balance training were
      not significantly different from conventional balance training in subjects with subacute
      stroke.

      study 3:To investigate whether a four-week tele-rehabilitation program can result in
      significant improvements in physical function and quality of life for subjects with chronic
      stroke living in long-term care facilities.

      Study 4: To compare the effects of a home-based telerehabilitation (Tele) with intelligent
      agent systems and a conventional in-home physical therapy (home PT) for subjects with stroke.

      Study 1: Methods—Twenty-four subjects with substroke (less than 6 months post-stroke) were
      recruited for telerehabilitation group and conventional balance training group. Study 2.
      Methods—Twenty -four participants with mild to moderate stroke were randomized into
      telerehabilitation (Tele) group and conventional (Conv) group. They received balance training
      with three sessions per week for 4 weeks. The pressure distribution of buttock-pressure
      interface was measured by Pressure Distribution Plate (PDM-S).

      Study 3.Methods: Twenty-four participants were recruited from three long-term care
      facilities. Participants were assigned into tele-rehabilitation (Tele group) and conventional
      Groups (Con group) randomly. Baseline and post-treatment physical function, daily activities
      and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were assessed by Simplified-STREAM, Berge Balance
      scale (BBS), Barthel index (BI), and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS 3.0), respectively.
      Interventions were conducted to both groups by two different physical therapists with three
      sessions a week for four weeks of intervention.

      Study 4. Ten participants with stroke were randomized into Tele or control group 1 (CG1) for
      randomized controlled trial. The Tele group also received home PT at 3 weeks later as control
      group 2 (CG2) for cross over design.

      Intervention: All three groups received 4 weeks training (2 sessions/week, 50
      minutes/session), including upper extremity and balance exercises.

      Main outcome measures: The assessments were performed at baseline (pre), after 4 weeks (post)
      and after 7 weeks (follow-up). The measures for physical function included Stroke
      Rehabilitation Assessment (STREAM), Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS), and
      Barthel index (BI). The measures for satisfaction included Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and
      user-satisfaction questionnaires.
