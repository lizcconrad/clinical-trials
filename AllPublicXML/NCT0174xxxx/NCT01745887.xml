    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety and biological activity of two doses of
      EBI-005 ophthalmic solution versus placebo in subjects with moderate to severe Dry Eye
      Syndrome. Approximately 72 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in this study at up to 9
      centers located in the United States (US). Subjects will be enrolled in two groups or
      cohorts. The first enrollment group will consist of 33 subjects.

      -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of EBI-005 ophthalmic solution compared to
           placebo in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Dry Eye Syndrome (DES).

        -  To evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and immunogenicity of two different doses of
           EBI-005 ophthalmic solution.

        -  To investigate the biological activity of multiple doses of EBI-005 ophthalmic solution
           compared to placebo as assessed by both objective and subjective assessments.

        -  To investigate the comparative dose response of two different doses of EBI-005
           ophthalmic solution.

        -  To investigate the comparative tolerability of two different doses of EBI-005 ophthalmic
           solution.

        -  To identify key biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of subjects with DES.
