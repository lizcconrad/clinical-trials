  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Scotland and the Western World.
      Approaches to improve the identification of vulnerable or ruptured coronary atherosclerotic
      plaques are urgently needed to help risk stratification, to identify patients for intensive
      therapies, and to provide novel biomarkers for the development of anti-atherosclerotic drug
      interventions. Using positron emission tomography, we have recently shown that sodium
      18-fluoride uptake holds major promise as a novel marker of plaque vulnerability and rupture.
      Here we wish to characterise coronary atherosclerotic plaque using 128-multidetector computed
      tomography combined with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose and sodium 18-fluoride positron emission
      tomography and Virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound in 80 patients with stable and
      unstable coronary artery disease. This has the potential to provide an innovative and highly
      valuable translational model with which to test novel therapeutic interventions targeted at
      reducing atheroma and plaque rupture. This could have major implications for the future
      treatment of cardiovascular disease.

        The investigators will recruit two populations of 40 patients each. The first population
        will be patients with known stable coronary heart disease. They will have previously
        documented and angiographically proven coronary artery disease (≥70% luminal stenosis of a
        major epicardial vessel). The second population will be patients with a recent (within 30
        days) acute myocardial infarction defined by the Universal definition of myocardial
        infarction. The culprit plaque will be defined according to the invasive coronary angiogram
        appearances, electrocardiogram and clinical features by two cardiologists blinded to the
        results of positron emission tomography.
