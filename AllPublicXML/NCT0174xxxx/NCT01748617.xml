      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, crossover intervention to investigate the
      health effects of acute ingestion of pomegranate juice when consumed with a high fat meal.
      After one week of controlled dietary intervention, subjects will consume a high fat morning
      meal supplemented with either pomegranate juice or a juice-free sweetened beverage. After
      consumption of the breakfast meal, subjects will be assessed for endothelial function and
      postprandial meal response.

    <description>After a consuming controlled diet for 1 week, subjects will report in the morning after a 12 hour fast. Upon arrival , subjects' endothelial function will be assessed by measuring endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilation of the peripheral bed (EndoPAT, Itamar Medical, Israel). For this test, subjects will rest in the supine position with a brachial blood pressure cuff on one arm and a finger tip probe on each of two fingers (one on the left hand, one on the right hand). After 5 minutes of rest, the blood pressure cuff will be inflated and remain inflated for 5 minutes. Then the cuff pressure will be released and the subject will remain resting for 5 additional minutes. This test will be repeated 3 hours after the test meal.</description>
