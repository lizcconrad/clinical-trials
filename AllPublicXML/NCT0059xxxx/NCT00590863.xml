      This study will compare whether a combination of antidepressant medications is better than
      one antidepressant medication alone when given as initial treatment for people with chronic
      or recurrent major depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes (CO-MED) is to
      enhance remission rates for outpatients with chronic or recurrent nonpsychotic major
      depressive disorder (MDD) as defined by DSM-IV TR, treated in primary or psychiatric care
      settings.

      Current evidence indicates that remission, the goal of treatment, is found in only about
      one-third of representative depressed outpatients treated for up to 14 weeks with an initial
      SSRI. In addition, even for those who do respond or remit, over one-third relapse in the
      subsequent 12 months. Combinations of antidepressants are used in practice at the second or
      subsequent steps when relapse occurs in the longer term, or, in some cases, even acutely as a
      first step when speed of effect is a clinical priority. Whether such combinations could
      potentially offer higher remission rates, lower attrition, or greater longer-term benefit if
      used as initial treatments as compared to monotherapy remains to be examined.

      CO-MED will test whether two different medications when given in combination as the first
      treatment step, compared to one medication, will enhance remission rates, increase speed of
      remission, be tolerable, and provide better sustained benefits in the longer term. Results of
      this study will inform practitioners in managing the treatment of patients with chronic or
      recurrent MDD.

    <description>The Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) is a 32-item comprehensive self-report of satisfaction in 16 areas of life, such as love, work, and health. Each area is rated in terms of satisfaction and the relationship of that area to overall quality of life. It yields an overall raw score and satisfaction ratings for the 16 individual areas of life. The QOLI raw score is an average of weighted satisfaction ratings computed only over areas of life judged to be Important or Extremely Important to the respondent. Higher scores indicate higher reported quality of life.</description>

Participants were recruited from six primary care and nine psychiatric care sites within the NIMH Depression Trials Network.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Outpatient enrollees, 18-75 years old, met DSM-IV-TR criteria for either recurrent or chronic MDD.

        <title>Quality of Life Inventory</title>
        <description>The Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) is a 32-item comprehensive self-report of satisfaction in 16 areas of life, such as love, work, and health. Each area is rated in terms of satisfaction and the relationship of that area to overall quality of life. It yields an overall raw score and satisfaction ratings for the 16 individual areas of life. The QOLI raw score is an average of weighted satisfaction ratings computed only over areas of life judged to be Important or Extremely Important to the respondent. Higher scores indicate higher reported quality of life.</description>
