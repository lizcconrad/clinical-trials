  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in humans with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) treatable by
      PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      subcutaneous delivery of recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor rG-CSF
      (Filgrastim, Neupogen®, Amgen Switzerland) with regard to the promotion of collateral growth.
