  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women aged 50 and older are disproportionately affected by breast cancer, not only in terms
      of new diagnoses, but also in terms of survivorship. Approximately 85% of women who receive a
      first diagnosis of breast cancer are aged 50 and over, thus older women constitute the
      largest group of breast cancer survivors. Yet, few studies have focused on evaluating whether
      physical activity and exercise interventions affect long-term symptoms, physical fitness and
      function, and body composition of older breast cancer survivors. Due to the combined effects
      of breast cancer, related treatments and aging it is likely that exercise is even more
      beneficial for older breast cancer survivors than for younger survivors. Along with the
      cancer-related symptom of fatigue common to cancer survivors, older survivors face
      age-related declines in bone and muscle mass, muscle strength, bone health and physical
      function (gait and balance) that are likely exacerbated by reduced physical activity in
      survivorship and side effects of adjuvant cancer treatment. All women, regardless of age, are
      at risk for breast cancer recurrence. Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests a link between
      exercise and reduced risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer survivors. Strength training
      is specifically suited to reverse or slow age-related declines in bone, muscle, strength and
      function and has shown promise to reduce cancer-related fatigue. However, no controlled
      trials of strength training in older breast cancer survivors have been conducted.

    <description>60 minute session 3 times a week focusing on whole body flexibility (stretching) and relaxation (progressive neuromuscular relaxation, focused breathing) exercises. Exercises are selected to be non-weight bearing and require minimal muscle strength in order to provide a contrast to the intervention arm. Two sessions are conducted in a supervised setting at a university fitness center and the third is a home-based version of the program performed at home.</description>
