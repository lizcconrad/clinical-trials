  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to muscle atrophy, hyperreflexia and spasticity, symptoms that
      decrease quality of life and prevent effective rehabilitation. Previous findings from our
      labs found that a passive cycling exercise program, motorized bicycle exercise training
      (MBET), in adult spinally transected animals reduced muscle atrophy and normalized
      hyperreflexia. We found that MBET could prevent the onset of hyperreflexia after spinal
      transaction, that MBET could also be used to rescue from hyperreflexia once it had set in,
      and that MBET could induce savings in normalization of reflexes after MBET ceased. We also
      demonstrated that MBET was effective in rescuing from hyperreflexia in a chronic ASIA B SCI
      patient, and that short-term MBET could lead to brief savings in normalization of reflexes
      once MBET ceased. The proposed studies will test the ability to MBET to prevent the onset of
      hyperreflexia in a group of acute SCI patients trained before hyperreflexia has had a chance
      to set in. In addition, the proposed research will attempt to confirm the possibility that
      long-term MBET in chronic SCI patients will rescue from hyperreflexia once it has set in, and
      also produce significant savings in normalization of reflexes if carried out for long periods
      of time. We will also test the possibility that MBET in acute and/or chronic SCI patients
      could reduce or prevent muscle atrophy. The experimental design calls for assessing muscle
      mass using MRI scans, bone density using Dual-Energy X-ray Absortiometry (DEXA) scans,
      spasticity measures and electrophysiological measurements to determine low frequency
      habituation of the H-reflex. Assessments will be carried out before MBET, during a 25 week
      MBET block of time, and during a 12 week post MBET monitoring period. Changes in muscle mass,
      bone density, spasticity scales and H-reflex habituation will be compared across these
      interventions and between treated SCI victims and a group of control acute and chronic SCI
      victims undergoing standard of care during the same period.

The exercise was conducted three times a week for 16 weeks or 5 times a week for 12 weeks, for an average of 50 sessions. Each subjects bone density and lean muscle mass was measured by DEXA scan, using a low radiation dose to determine the effect of exercise by comparing the subjects change in both parameters before the exercise and then after the exercise.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This was a pilot study to determine if a passive exercise bicycle would suppress the H-reflex after a spinal cord injury. We were not able to collect stable H-reflex data. However, the Dual-Energy X-ray Absortiometry (DEXA) scan data was useable.</limitations_and_caveats>
