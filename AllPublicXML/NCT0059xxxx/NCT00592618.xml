      Sleep studies in ESRD patients have identified increased prevalence of Sleep Apnea. Based on
      current knowledge, treatment aimed at reducing oxidative stress might improve Sleep Apnea in
      HD patients. The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of N-acetylsysteine on Sleep
      Apnea in HD patients.

      Background Cardiovascular disease is the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality in
      chronic dialysis patients [1]. Sleep studies in ESRD patients have identified increased
      prevalence of sleep apnea (SA), both obstructive (OSA) and central (CSA) in origin [2]. The
      reported prevalence of SA in patients with ESRD ranges from 50% to 70% [3], which is
      dramatically higher than the estimated prevalence of 2% to 4% in the general population [4].
      SA has been recognized as a novel risk factor for cardiovascular disease in general
      population [5]. Recent evidence showed that severity of SA in hemodialysis patients is
      associated with severity of coronary artery calcifications [6]. Underlying mechanisms by
      which SA adversely affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been fully
      established yet. The presence of untreated SA may further impair fluid balance,
      cardiovascular function and increase mortality through abnormal vagal or sympatomimetic
      responces and hypoxia [7]. One intriguing possibility is oxidative stress, which has been
      implicated in cardiovascular disease in patients with ESRD [8]. Recent study demonstrated
      association between SA and decreased antioxidant status in hemodialysis patients [6].
      Repeated apnea-related hypoxic events in patients with SA may trigger elevated oxidative
      stress [9].

      In general population, the treatment of SA with CPAP improves oxygenation during sleep and
      quality of life [10]. In the ESRD population, CPAP was used in a very preliminary study on 8
      patients with some improvement in nocturnal oxygenation and 5 of 6 patients reported improved
      daytime alertness [11]. Unfortunately, CPAP application itself may be stressful, poorly
      tolerated and so disturb night sleep.

      Hanly and Pierratos suggested that SA in hemodialysis patients may be a consequence of
      inadequate treatment of uremia by standard 4-hours thrice-weekly HD procedure [12]. This
      group reported that intensive nocturnal HD for 8 hours 6-7 times per week reduced the
      severity of SA, although their patients continued to suffer from frequent arousals,
      diminished sleep time, REM sleep and sleep efficiency [12]. Restoration of normal kidney
      function by transplantation may lead to reversal of SA [13, 14].

      Several experimental and clinical studies showed that increased oxidative stress in dialysis
      patients may be due to inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by ADMA (Asymmetric
      Dimethylarginine ), known to be endogenous inhibitor of NO synthetase [15]. ADMA may be
      significantly reduced by dialysis [16]. Metabolism of ADMA is primarily by the enzyme DDAH ,
      which activity is decreased by inflammation, oxidative stress, diabetes mellitus and
      hypercholesterolemia [17 ]. It was proposed that circulating ADMA may be one mechanism
      accounting for the resistant hypertension and overfluid in dialysis patients [17 ].

      Based on current knowledge, treatment aimed at reducing oxidative stress should decrease ADMA
      levels [17 ], and it is logical to suggest that such a therapy might improve SA in HD
      patients. One preliminary study on effect of antioxidant Vitamin E showed a small beneficial
      effect on ADMA in chronic kidney disease [19 ].

      In our opinion, it is worth to check an ability of antioxidant therapy to produce a favorable
      effect on parameters of SA in dialysis patients.

      N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an active antioxidant proved to be safe and beneficial in
      hemodialysis patents [19]. In our recent study, NAC effectively reduced the ototoxic effect
      of gentamicin in chronic hemodialysis patients [20, 21]. Cheap and safe drug therapy may
      appear more cost effective than such resource consuming therapies as CPAP and not readily
      available treatments as prolong every night hemodialysis or kidney transplantation.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of N-acetylsysteine on SA in HD patients.

      Methods. Study population. The study will include 20 patients with ESRD, treated with chronic
      hemodialysis in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center and suffering from sleep disturbances, such as
      frequent arousals, snoring, daytime sleepiness.

      Patients will be excluded from the study if they are:

        1. Recently started treated with chronic dialysis: less than 3 months.

        2. Survived recent major illness, requiring hospitalisation in the last 3 months.

        3. Patients with acute renal failure

        4. Currently treated with antioxidants ( NAC, vitamin E ets.)

        5. Current use of sleep pills Study protocol. We planned this study as a prospective
           cross-sectional study where every patient will serve as his/her own control. Al the
           patients will continue their previous dialysis and drugs regimen. The presence and
           severity of SA will be accessed using the overnight polysomnography in the Sleep
           Laboratory.

      After performance of baseline overnight polysomnography the patients will receive orally NAC
      1200 mg x 2/day for 4 weeks. At the end of this therapy, a follow up overnight
      polysomnography examination will be performed.

      The clinical monitoring of all the patients will include:

        1. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate - at each dialysis session 3 times a week. .

        2. Review of medications and doses.

        3. Body weight - at each dialysis session 3 times a week

        4. Dialysis adequacy: Kt/V at study start and end.

        5. Biochemical studies: full chemistry, bicarbonate, ADMA, DDAH, NO - both at baseline and
           follow up visits.

      Statistical analysis The statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical
      software SPSS-version 10. Parametric data will be expressed as means Â± standard deviation and
      compared by the standard t-test. Non-parametric data will be compared using chi square test.
      p value of 0.05 or less will be considered significant.
