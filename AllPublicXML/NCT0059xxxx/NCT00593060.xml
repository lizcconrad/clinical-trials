  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigational drug, temsirolimus, will be combined with cetuximab, a
      biologic agent used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Cetuximab in combination with
      temsirolimus may be more effective in treating advanced colorectal cancer than cetuximab
      alone. The purpose of this research study is to try to define the highest dose of cetuximab
      that can be used safely in combination with temsirolimus to treat advanced colorectal cancer
      that has progressed through standard therapy.

      -  Because this is a study to determine the highest dose of cetuximab that can be safely
           given with temsirolimus, groups of 3 participants will be treated at gradually
           increasing doses of cetuximab. Each group of 3 participants must complete 4 weeks (1
           cycle) of treatment before the following group of 3 participants can start treatment at
           the higher dose.

        -  Cetuximab is administered intravenously 7 days before the treatment cycle begins.
           Participants will receive a cetuximab infusion every week of the treatment cycle (days
           1, 8, 15, 22) along with temsirolimus. Temsirolimus is also given intravenously.

        -  As a precaution, participants will be pre-medicated with Benadryl/diphenhydramine to
           help prevent an allergic reaction.

        -  During the study participants will have weekly clinical visits. Each clinic visit will
           last approximately 2-3 hours. During the clinic visit, the following tests and
           procedures will be performed: Physical exam; vital signs; and blood tests. A CT scan
           will be performed after every 2 cycles (8 weeks).

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be taken at various points during the study. For
           each PK sample, we will take about 1 teaspoon of blood. There will be a total of 22
           tubes of blood taken for the PK study.
