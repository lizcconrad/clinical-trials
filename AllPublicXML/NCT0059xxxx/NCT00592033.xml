  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In COPD patients with desaturation during exercise, several studies have shown an acute
      beneficial effect of supplemental oxygen. Therefore, both the British Thoracic Society and
      the American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend supplemental oxygen to patients who
      desaturate &gt;4% and to below 88-90%. However, long-term studies have not been able to support
      this intervention. In this study of COPD patients, who desaturate and participate in a 7-week
      pulmonary rehabilitation programme, we examine the effect of supplemental oxygen on exercise
      tolerance, health status, and exacerbation rates. In a randomised design patients trained
      either with room air or with 2 litres oxygen per minute from a portable oxygen concentrator.
      All patients were asked to exercise every day for 30 minutes.

      this intervention. In this study of COPD patients, who desaturate and participate in a 7-week
      pulmonary rehabilitation programme, we examine the effect of supplemental oxygen. Using a
      randomised design, patients trained either with room air (control) or with 2 litres oxygen
      per minute from a portable oxygen concentrator. All patients were asked to exercise every day
      for 30 minutes.

      Primary effect parameters:

      endurance shuttle walk time at baseline, 7 weeks (after intensive supervised rehabilitation),
      3 months (after maintenance training twice a month), and after 6 months.

      Secondary effect parameters:

      St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (health status); usage of oxygen, exacerbations
      requiring medical treatment, hospitalisation and mortality in the same periods.
