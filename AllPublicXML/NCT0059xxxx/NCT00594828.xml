      To test the hypothesis that home international normalised ratio (INR) monitoring with
      supervised patient self-testing (PST)can provide comparable or superior time in therapeutic
      range (TTR) to that provided by traditional outpatient anticoagulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indications for anticoagulant treatment to prevent thromboembolic disease have increased in
      recent years. INR must be monitored frequently to determine the safest dose and to minimize
      the risk for thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications. Standard warfarin therapy is
      associated with rates of major haemorrhage of up to 5-9% annually and recurrent venous
      thromboembolism of up to 8%. These event rates are dependent of the model of care used to
      manage warfarin therapy, with better outcomes associated with home testing of the INR which
      enables patients to monitor their response to warfarin more frequently. INR results must
      still be 'managed' by communicating the data to the healthcare provider, usually be telephone
      or fax.

      In this study we will evaluate a novel method of PST; supervised PST with an internet based
      expert system, which 'manages' patients on oral anticoagulation by utilizing clinical and
      laboratory data provided by the patient and dose adjustment and retesting algorithms derived
      from clinical practice. Patients will be randomized to either 6 months of supervised PST or
      routine medical care by the AMS. At the end of the 6 month period, each patient will then
      'cross over' to the other management regimen and the difference in TTR between the two
      periods will be compared.
