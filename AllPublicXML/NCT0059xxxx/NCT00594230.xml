      LBH589 (20 mg PO) will be administered three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
      Treatment will be given over 21 days followed by a 7 day rest period and repeated every 28
      days. Patients will be assessed for toxicity on an ongoing basis and disease assessment will
      be determined every 2 treatment cycles (8 weeks). Patients will be allowed to continue on
      treatment for a maximum of eight four week treatment cycles. Treatment will be discontinued
      if there is evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity and/or at the discretion
      of the investigator.

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (CR, Marrow CR + PR) of LBH in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory MDS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks up to 24 months on-study.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is defined by the modified International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for MDS. In the marrow, Complete Response (CR) is &lt;= 5% blasts present with normal maturation of all cell lines. In peripheral blood, CR is defined as hemoglobin &gt;= 11 g/dL, ANC &gt;= 1000/mL, and platelets &gt;= 100,000 with 0% blasts present. Partial Response (PR) is defined the same as CR with blasts decreased by &gt;= 50% and &gt;= 5% blasts in the marrow.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Disease Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks up to 24 months on-study, every 3 months in follow-up until progression of disease</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disease progression is defined as the time between day 1 cycle 1 and time to first documented disease progression. Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks up to 24 months on-study</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from when objective response is realized until time to first documented disease progression. Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Objective Response = CR + PR. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.

    <measure>Median Time to Treatment Failure</measure>

        <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is defined by the modified International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for MDS. In the marrow, Complete Response (CR) is &lt;= 5% blasts present with normal maturation of all cell lines. In peripheral blood, CR is defined as hemoglobin &gt;= 11 g/dL, ANC &gt;= 1000/mL, and platelets &gt;= 100,000 with 0% blasts present. Partial Response (PR) is defined the same as CR with blasts decreased by &gt;= 50% and &gt;= 5% blasts in the marrow.</description>

        <description>Time to disease progression is defined as the time between day 1 cycle 1 and time to first documented disease progression. Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.

        <title>Duration of Response</title>
        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from when objective response is realized until time to first documented disease progression. Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Objective Response = CR + PR. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.
