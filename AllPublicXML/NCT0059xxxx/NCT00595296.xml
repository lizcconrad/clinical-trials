  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-approval study is designed to determine the performance of the FDA-approved
      GeneSearch™ BLN Assay when compared to the site's standard of care permanent section
      histological evaluation, and when compared to more extensive histological evaluation when the
      assay is being used by clinicians to make surgical decisions on complete axillary dissections
      (ALND).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to gather data to estimate the positive
      predictive concordance (PPC) between the GeneSearch™ BLN Assay and histology as routinely
      practiced, i.e., routine H&amp;E histology of sentinel lymph node(s) (SLN) and, when available,
      routine histology of non-sentinel axillary lymph nodes (ALN). This study will provide
      information on the assay that will augment the performance data gained in pre-market
      validation studies. In addition, with the assay being used for ALND decision-making, the
      metastatic status of the non-sentinel axillary nodes can be taken into account in the
      performance measures, i.e., if the patient's sentinel or non-sentinel nodes are
      histologically positive, the patient will be considered positive for the primary comparison
      to the assay results.

    <description>The GeneSearch™ BLN Assay is a real time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay that detects the presence of breast tumor cell metastasis in lymph nodes through the detection of gene expression markers present in breast tissue, but not in nodal tissue (cell type specific messenger RNA).</description>

        Patients must have been diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast and be a candidate for lymph
        node surgery as per each site's standard of care. The patients may be female or male, at
        least 18 years old, and must meet study inclusion criteria described later in this
        protocol. Patients receiving pre-operative therapy for breast cancer, such as neoadjuvant
        therapy and/or hormonal intervention are not eligible to participate in this study.

             clinical site for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients

          -  Patients for whom the GeneSearch™ BLN Assay will be used intra-operatively to make a
             decision for an axillary lymph node dissection

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Female or male

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous diagnosis of lymphoma

          -  Subjects participating in other research studies that would interfere with their full
             participation in this study

          -  Patients and/or conditions with 'interfering substances' as listed in the IFU.

          -  Patients who have had any pre-operative treatment for breast cancer including
             neoadjuvant and/or hormonal intervention such as aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen
