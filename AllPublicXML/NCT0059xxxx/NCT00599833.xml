    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of
      radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal
      tissue. Giving cetuximab together with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with radiation
      therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be
      removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the progression free survival rate in patients treated with cetuximab and
           radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate, toxicity of the combined regimen, and clinical benefit
           response in patients treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly for 6-7 weeks. Patients
      also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional image-guided conformal radiotherapy in 28-30 fractions
      over approximately 5.5-6 weeks (2-4 hours after administration of cetuximab).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for up to 3 years.
