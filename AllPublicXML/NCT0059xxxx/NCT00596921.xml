      This study proposes to examine the correlation of central venous pressure to measures of the
      diameter of the inferior vena cava as determined by bedside ultrasonography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous pressure (CVP) is a key physiologic estimate of preload, which in turn helps
      define the vascular fluid status. It is a particularly important parameter to measure in
      critically ill and injured patients who may require resuscitation. Unfortunately, measurement
      of the CVP requires invasive central venous catheters which can be difficult or
      time-consuming to insert. A non-invasive means of inferring the CVP would provide clinicians
      with an alternative. Preliminary data suggests that the diameter of the vena cava may reflect
      the CVP. Ultrasonography can provide reliable measures of internal body structures including
      the vena cava, and therefore may be useful in this regard. Collecting simultaneous values of
      vena cava diameter and CVPs will allow for the identification and quantification of
      correlation.
