      Objectives of the trial were to assess the optimal timing of chemotherapy with or after ATRA
      and the role of maintenance therapy.

      Induction treatment was stratified by age and initial WBC count. Patients ≤65 years of age
      with a WBC count less than 5,000/µL were randomized to receive the reference ATRA treatment
      of our previous trial (APL91 trial) {Fenaux, 1993 #2088}, ie, 45 mg/m2/d ATRA followed by CT
      (ATRA→CT group) or ATRA plus CT (ATRA+CT). In the ATRA→CT group, patients received 45 mg/m2/d
      ATRA orally until CR, with a maximum of 90 days. After CR achievement, they received a course
      of 60 mg/m2/d daunorubicin (DNR) for 3 days and 200 mg/m2/d AraC for 7 days (course I).
      However, course I was added to ATRA if the WBC count was increased to greater than 6,000/µL,
      10,000/µL, or 15,000/µL by day 5, 10, and 15 of ATRA treatment, respectively, be-cause, from
      our experience, patients were at risk of ATRA syndrome above those thresholds{de Botton, 2003
      #1127; De Botton, 1998 #1604}. Patients randomized to the ATRA+CT group received the same
      combination of ATRA and CT, with course I of CT starting on day 3 of ATRA treatment.

      Patients with a WBC count greater than 5,000/µL at presentation (irrespective of their age)
      and patients 66 to 75 years of age with a WBC count ≤ 5,000/µL were not ran-domized but
      received ATRA plus CT course I from day 1 (high WBC group) and the same schedule as in the
      ATRA→CT group (elderly group), respectively.

      Treatment of coagulopathy during the induction phase was based on platelet support to
      maintain the platelet count at a level greater than 50,000 /µL until the disappea-rance of
      coagulopathy. The use of heparin, tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen
      transfusions was optional.

      CR patients received 2 CT consolidation courses, including course II (identical to course I)
      and course III, consisting of 45 mg/m2/d DNR for 3 days and 1 g/m2 AraC every 12 hours for 4
      days. The elderly group only received course II.

      Three to 4 weeks after hematological recovery from this consolidation CT, patients who were
      still in CR were randomized both to receive or not receive intermittent ATRA (45 mg/m2/d, 15
      days every 3 months) and to receive or not receive continuous CT with 6 mercaptopurine (90
      mg/m2/d, orally) and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/wk, oral-ly), according to a 2-by-2 factorial
      design stratified on the initial induction treatment group. Maintenance treatment was
      scheduled for 2 years. Randomizations for induc-tion and maintenance, stratified on center,
      were performed through a centralized tele-phone assignment procedure.

    <description>Patients randomized to the ATRA+CT group received the same combination of ATRA and CT, with course I of CT starting on day 3 of ATRA treatment. This 48-hour interval before onset of CT was based on our previous report, because it allowed correction of coagulopathy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of APL, based on morphology criteria

          2. Age 75 years or less; and

          3. Written informed consent. Diagnosis had to be subsequently confirmed by presence of
             t(15;17) or PML-RAR gene rearrangement. In the absence of t(15;17) and if no analysis
             of the rearrangement could be made, review of initial marrow slides by an independent
             morphologist was mandatory.
