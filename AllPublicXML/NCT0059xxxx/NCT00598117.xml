  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate how treatment for esophageal cancer affects your
      quality of life. The findings of this study may help us understand how this disease and its
      treatment affect your lifestyle, diet, exercise, support system and overall quality of life.
      We hope this study will provide important information that can be used to develop programs to
      improve the quality of life of patients with esophageal cancer.

      In order to determine the impact of esophageal cancer and its treatment on patients' quality
      of life over time, this study will prospectively follow a cohort of patients at specified
      intervals, evaluating their physical symptoms, physical and social functioning and overall
      quality of life. Medical and sociodemographic factors as well as health behaviors that might
      be predictive of adaptation will be tested. This is a preliminary investigation and it is
      hoped that we will be able to base future research questions on the results of this study.

        This is a descriptive study comprising two cohorts of esophageal cancer patients. The first
        cohort will be followed prospectively and will include patients newly diagnosed with
        esophageal cancer prior to treatment. QOL assessments will be administered pre-surgery, at
        first post-operative visit, and at 6 and 12 months post surgery. The second cohort will be
        a cross sectional sample and include patients more than 18 months post treatment, without
        evidence of disease who will undergo one QOL assessment. This is a preliminary
        investigation and it is hoped that we will be able to base future research questions on our
        results of this study.
