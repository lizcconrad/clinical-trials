  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several risk factors including high cholesterol contribute to heart disease. We know that
      lowering triglycerides and raising HDL (protective cholesterol) in men reduces the risk for
      heart disease. We expect that women will share this same benefit because the combination of
      high triglycerides and low HDL appears to be a more important risk for heart disease in
      women. Niacin reduces triglycerides and raises HDL. We also expect to see improvement in
      markers of inflammation and clot formation and blood vessel health, which we hypothesize
      should all confer a reduced risk of heart disease in women.

      Women already taking lipid lowering statin will receive niacin therapy. We will measure blood
      lipid levels, markers of inflammation and clotting as well as a non-invasive measure of blood
      vessel reactivity. After 3 months of therapy we will repeat these measures.
