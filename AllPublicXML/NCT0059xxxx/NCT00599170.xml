  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of R-CHOP, given every two weeks, will be associated with improvements in response
      rate, and progression-free survival, when compared to R-CHOP given every three weeks. The
      addition of sargramostim will allow safer adminIstration of the dose-intensified R-CHOP,
      while at the same time, improving the functional capability of the macrophages, and thus
      increasing the likelihood of improved clinical response and disease-free survival.

      The current phase II study is being proposed in order to develop preliminary data on the
      efficacy and toxicity of this approach, for future study in larger, phase III randomized
      trials. Laboratory correlates of response will also be studied, including activation markers
      on monocytes/macrophages before and after sargramostim exposure; and presence or absence of
      informative Fc gamma III polymorphisms.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Previously untreated, histologically or cytologically documented diffuse large B cell
             non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

          2. Lymphoma must be CD20 positive.

          3. All stages of disease.

          4. Measurable or non-measurable tumor parameter(s). Non-measurable tumor parameters will
             be defined as not having bi-dimensional measurements (i.e. gastric or marrow
             involvement) but can be followed for response by other diagnostic tests such as
             gallium, PET imaging and/or bone marrow biopsy.

          5. Age ≥ 18 years.

          6. KPS ≥ 50% (ECOG PS 0, 1, or 2).

          7. Able to give signed informed consent.

          8. Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl (unless elevated secondary to
             lymphomatous involvement of liver or biliary system. For bilirubin &gt; 3.0 due to
             hepatic involvement, the initial dose of doxorubicin will be decreased by 50%, and the
             initial dose of vincristine will be omitted. SGOT &lt;5X upper limit of normal.

          9. Adequate renal function: creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl, or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min,
             unless secondary to renal involvement by lymphoma.

         10. Adequate hematologic function: granulocytes (ANC) &gt;1000/mm3, platelets &gt; 75,000/dl,
             unless these parameters are abnormal secondary to lymphomatous involvement of bone
             marrow. All patients must be off colony stimulating factor therapy at least 24 hours
             prior to institution of cycle #1 chemotherapy.

         11. Left ventricular ejection fraction that is at or above the lower institutional limits
             of normal, as assessed by nuclear scan or echocardiogram obtained within 6 weeks of
             registration.

         12. Concurrent radiation with or without steroids for emergency conditions secondary to
             lymphoma (i.e. CNS tumor, cord compression, etc) will be permitted, provided that
             additional, measurable or evaluable sites of lymphomatous disease are present at study
             entry.

         13. Female patients must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of entering into
             the study. Both men and women will be included and, if of child bearing potential,
             must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of the treatment. Women must
             avoid pregnancy and men avoid fathering children while in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of second active tumor, other than non melanomatous skin cancer, carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix.

          2. Primary central nervous system lymphoma, including parenchymal brain or spinal cord
             lymphoma.

          3. Pregnant women or nursing mothers.

          4. ECOG performance score 3 or more (KPS &lt;50%).

          5. Expected survival &lt; 3 months.

          6. Unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol, or unable to provide adequate
             informed consent in the opinion of the principal investigator.

          7. Serious, on-going non-malignant disease or infection, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator and/or the sponsor, would compromise other protocol objectives.

          8. Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within four weeks.

          9. History of prior therapy with Rituximab within 12 months. Patients treated with
             Rituximab more than 12 months earlier are eligible only if it was given for
             indications other than the treatment of aggressive lymphoma.

         10. History of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy for this lymphoma.

         11. History of cutaneous or muco-cutaneous reactions or diseases in the past, due to any
             cause, severe enough to cause hospitalization or an inability to eat or drink for 2
             days or more. This exclusion relates to the long-term possibility of severe
             muco-cutaneous or cutaneous reactions to Rituximab, which maybe occurred at increased
             frequency in patients who have had severe skin disease or reactions in the past.

         12. Any acute inter-current infection that may interfere with planned protocol treatment.
