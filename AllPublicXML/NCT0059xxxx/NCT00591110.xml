  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized intervention evaluation. Ten senior centers in predominately
      African American communities in the Birmingham, Alabama will be selected as sites for the
      educational intervention. Five centers will be randomly assigned to receive an educational
      intervention communicating practical information about vision, eye conditions and eye care as
      pertinent to the older African American population. The other five centers will serve as
      social-contact controls, where participants will receive an engaging information session on a
      non-health related topic. The primary outcome of interest is the change in percentage of
      persons receiving comprehensive eye care from pre- to post- intervention. The secondary
      outcomes are the process outcomes of improvement in knowledge, attitudes, and values about
      vision, eye conditions, and eye care.
