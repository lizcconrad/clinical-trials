  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of brain tumor patients who received radiation or chemotherapy have
      thinking problems as a result of their treatment. The purpose of this study is to find out if
      treatment with Aricept (donepezil) may improve some aspects of thinking abilities in patients
      with brain tumors who received radiation or chemotherapy. This research will also study
      whether persons having particular genes for a blood-borne substance called apolipoprotein E
      (APOE) are more likely to have thinking problems after radiation or chemotherapy treatment
      for their brain tumors. The findings of this study will help us find out whether Aricept can
      improve thinking abilities after cancer treatment, and whether some of the thinking
      difficulties may be in part related to having certain genes.

      A significant proportion of brain tumor patients treated with radiation or chemotherapy who
      are in disease remission experience cognitive sequelae from their treatment. Cognitive
      dysfunction can be of sufficient severity to interfere with their ability to function at
      premorbid professional and social levels. There are, however, no approved pharmacological
      interventions for improving cognitive functions in cancer patients who display
      treatment-related cognitive deficits. Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, has been
      shown to provide cognitive and functional benefits in patients with Alzheimer's disease,
      vascular dementia, and in patients with other neurological diseases without known cholinergic
      deficiency. The proposed pilot study will examine the efficacy of donepezil in improving
      cognitive functions in adult brain tumor patients treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy
      who have mild to moderate cognitive difficulties. Neuropsychological measures of executive,
      psychomotor speed, attention, and memory abilities will be administered prior to, during and
      following donepezil therapy. The proposed study will also test the hypothesis that the
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) e-4 allele correlates with the development of cognitive impairment
      after radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The proposed investigation is unprecedented and
      may provide preliminary information about (1) a pharmacological therapy that could improve
      cognitive functions in this population, and (2) a genetic risk factor that may increase
      vulnerability to radiation or chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline.

    <description>Patients will undergo a brief cognitive evaluation prior to (baseline/Time 1), Cognitive Re-Evaluation (about 12 weeks after Time 1), Cognitive Re-Evaluation (about 12 weeks after Time 2) ,Cognitive Re-Evaluation (about 6 months after discontinuation of Donepezil). Then pt will be tx with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. They will undergo a four-week dose titration (i.e., 5mg QD during weeks 1-4) to reach a final dose of 10mg QD of oral donepezil there after for a maximum of 24 weeks.</description>
