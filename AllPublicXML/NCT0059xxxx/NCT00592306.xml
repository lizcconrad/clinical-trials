      The purpose of this study is to take a population of lung transplant recipients who meet UCLA
      criteria for induction chemotherapy with thymoglobulin and prospectively study weather giving
      the first dose intraoperatively versus postoperatively makes a difference with how patients
      do during and after lung transplantation.

      The purpose of this study is to take a population of lung transplant recipients who meet UCLA
      criteria for induction chemotherapy with thymoglobulin and prospectively study weather giving
      the first dose intraoperatively versus postoperatively makes a difference with how patients
      do during and after lung transplantation. In addition, these cohorts will be compared to
      patients who do not qualify for thymoglobulin and receive either an alternative agent or no
      agent. The primary endpoint is primary graft dysfunction. We will also evaluate several other
      early and late end points such as ventilator days, ICU/hospital days, acute/chronic
      rejection, infection, CT chest abnormalities, and survival.

      We will also collect donor lung tissue and lavage fluid for measurement of various proteins
      and receptor expression at two time points: (1) prior to implementation and dosing of
      induction chemotherapy and (2) after transplantation (following a course of induction
      chemotherapy). This will allow us to possibly make a connection between the profiles of the
      various proteins and receptors and the clinical outcomes, depending on weather the patient
      has received induction chemotherapy, starting intraoperatively or postoperatively.
