    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of DTA-H19/PEI given as six
      intravesical instillations of 20 mg of plasmid DNA complexed with PEI into the bladder of
      patients with intermediate risk superficial bladder cancer [recurrent stages Ta (low or high
      grade)and T1, (low grade) transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)] who have failed prior
      intravesical therapies including either Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or chemotherapy. The
      primary efficacy objective is to determine the effect of DTA-H19/PEI on the prevention of new
      tumors after the induction course of 6 weekly intravesical administrations of investigational
      product assessed 8 to 10 weeks after the start of treatment. Secondary objectives include
      assessing the ablative effect of DTA-H19/PEI on a marker tumor, safety assessed by the
      incidence and severity of adverse events, determining the long-term (46 weeks) continued
      rates of absence of bladder cancer, and time to tumor recurrence in those patients who had a
      complete response (CR) after the induction course.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DTA-H19, is a doubled stranded DNA plasmid that carries the gene for the diphtheria toxin A
      (DT-A) chain under the regulation of the H19 promoter sequence. This is a Patient-Oriented,
      Targeted Therapy as DT-A chain expression is triggered by the presence of H19 transcription
      factors that are upregulated in tumor cells. The selective initiation of toxin expression
      results in selective tumor cell destruction via inhibition of protein synthesis in the tumor
      cell, enabling highly targeted cancer treatment.

    <description>Papillary tumors will be resected with the exception of one marker tumor that will remain to examine the effects of the treatment on the remaining tumor. Study treatments will consist of an induction course of six weekly instillations of 20 mg of DTA-H19/PEI into the urinary bladder. Intravesical therapy will be delivered through a Foley catheter. Patients will be instructed to hold the dose in the bladder for two hours after administration. If the patient has a complete response, then she/he will be eligible to receive three additional courses of 3 weekly intravesical administrations of the same dose of investigational product every 12 weeks.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible to participate in this study, patients must:

          1. Provide written informed consent.

          2. Have intermediate-risk recurrent superficial TCC of the bladder defined as Stage Ta
             (low or high grade) or T1 (but with penetration into no more than ½ of the lamina
             propria), low grade (grade 1 or grade 2), as confirmed by histopathology, and have not
             recurred within 3-months of a complete course of a prior acceptable therapy (i.e.,
             6-weekly intravesical administrations of BCG or standard adjuvant treatment with
             thiotepa, doxorubicin, epirubicin, valrubicin, or mitomycin C).

             is defined as intolerance to treatment such that treatment was discontinued or after
             having received 6 or more BCG instillations there is recurrent or persistent disease 3
             or more months after initiation of BCG treatment.

          7. Have a Karnofsky's performance status of greater than or equal to 60%.
