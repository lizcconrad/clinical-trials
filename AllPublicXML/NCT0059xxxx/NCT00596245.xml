      This is an open-label, parallel group, single-center study. The study design consists of a
      screening and a treatment period. A total of 42 (approximately 21 of each sex) non-smoking
      healthy volunteers aged 18 - 35, will be selected for treatment. Potential subjects will be
      assessed for exposure to ionizing radiation or working with cytotoxic chemicals, or who have
      cell cycle times that fall outside the range of 13 Â± 1.5 hours or subjects with stable
      chromosomal rearrangements and/or abnormally high background chromosomal aberration
      frequencies. Approximately 30 subjects (10 per arm) are estimated to be needed for analysis.

               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
                  pregnant); or,

               2. Childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test (urine) at Screening, and

                    -  Female sterilization or sterilization of male partner; or,

                    -  Any non-medicated intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that
                       the lowest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year; or,

                    -  Barrier method

          3. Physical status within normal limits for age and consistent with observations at
             Screening

          4. Subject agrees to remain sequestered on site during the treatment phase of the study
             and is willing and able to abstain from the consumption or use of any alcohol,
             caffeine containing beverages or medication for the duration of the study

          5. Subject is able to understand and comply with study procedures required and able and

             performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of hypersensitivity, allergy, intolerance or contraindication to the use of

             will likely interfere with the study conduct, subject cooperation, or evaluation and
             interpretation of the study results, or which otherwise contraindicate participation
             in this clinical trial
