      This pilot feasibility experimental study is designed as a randomized wait-list controlled
      trial of mindfulness meditation for CLBP. A sample of 37 older adults 65 years of age and
      older will be recruited from a chronic pain clinic, posted flyers, and newspaper
      advertisements over a 6-month period. Eligibility will be determined by self-report from a
      checklist reviewed with potential participants over the phone (see appendix for checklist).
      Pre-intervention study participants will be consented and study measures obtained. After
      consent and baseline measures, participants will be randomized in blocks of six using a
      simple randomization process with no stratification using a table of random numbers. After
      randomization, participants in the intervention group will receive the intervention of eight
      weekly 90-minute mindfulness meditation sessions. Instead of waiting until all 37
      participants have been recruited into the study to do the intervention, the intervention will
      be done on a rolling basis. This means there will be a minimum of 6 participants per
      intervention group, with the possibility of three separate intervention groups. If
      recruitment goes better than expected, then we will offer the intervention to all 18
      participants at one time. Controls will not receive any intervention during this time.
      Immediately post-intervention the measures will be administered again to participants and
      wait-list controls. Once the intervention is complete and participants and wait-list controls
      have completed post-intervention measures the mindfulness meditation program will be offered
      to the wait-list controls. We will try to combine the wait-list controls into one eight-week
      program. 3 months after the intervention is completed, participants will be asked to complete
      the measures a third time and any mindfulness meditation they continue to do at home will be
      quantified.

      The primary hypotheses are:

        1. We expect to be able to recruit 37 eligible individuals with CLBP into the study within
           a six-month period.

        2. We expect participants randomized to the mindfulness meditation intervention to meet an
           adherence standard of attending 75% of the 8 weekly 90-minute sessions.

        3. We expect mindfulness meditation will result in a moderate effect size difference (0.5)
           between the intervention participants and wait-list control participants on outcome
           measures of pain, mood, physical function, attention, and QOL.
