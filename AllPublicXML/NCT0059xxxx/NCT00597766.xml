    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded study of subacromial corticosteroid injection (steroid injection to
      the shoulder) to treat shoulder pain in the paralyzed (hemiplegic) shoulder of chronic stroke
      survivors. This study is designed to evaluate pain relief of a standard steroid injection
      treatment, compared to a high dose treatment and a low dose treatment, for shoulder pain in
      stroke survivors. A total of 105 chronic stroke survivors with moderate to severe shoulder
      pain will be enrolled. All eligible participants will undergo an initial test injection to
      localize pain to the subacromial space. If this turns out to be positive, the subjects will
      be randomly assigned to one of three groups:

        1. low dose group which receives 20mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection to the
           subacromial space of the affected shoulder;

        2. standard dose group which receives a standard 40mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection
           to the subacromial space of the affected shoulder; or

        3. high dose group which receives 60mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection to the
           subacromial space of the affected shoulder.

      Study participants will all rate their pain in interviews (Baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12
      (7 times) and in laboratory-based measures that will be administered at baseline, weeks 4, 8,
      12 (4 times). Subjects will be followed for a total of 13 weeks.

      The study will thus characterize the dose response of triamcinolone for the treatment of
      hemiplegic shoulder pain.

    <textblock>
      -  A total of 105 chronic stroke survivors with moderate to severe shoulder pain will be
           enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled in the study for 13 weeks. Subjects who complete the
           protocol will visit MetroHealth five times.

        -  Visit 1: Baseline information about demographics, past medical history, and
           inclusion/exclusion issues will be collected for study participants. Pertinent lab work
           will be performed to determine initial eligibility.

        -  Visit 2: All initially eligible participants also will undergo a test injection of
           lidocaine to localize the pain to the subacromial bursa (Neer's Test). A positive Neer's
           test is required to finalize eligibility for further participation. Participants who
           satisfy inclusion/exclusion criteria (including a positive Neer's test) will be
           randomized to high dose steroid, standard dose steroid, or low dose steroid via a
           computer generated random number table. The study participants and the observer will be
           blinded as to these groupings.

        -  After the initial Neer's test and randomization, participants will receive their
           assigned injection the same day. Participants then will be followed for an additional 12
           weeks, including three follow-up visits (Visits 3-5). The total participation time in
           this study will be 13 weeks.

        -  The primary outcome measure will be the BPI 12. The BPI is a pain questionnaire, which
           assesses the &quot;worst pain&quot; in the previous 7 days. Secondary outcome measures also will
           be assessed together with BPI 12. There will be 3 additional secondary outcome measures,
           Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (a measure of poststroke motor impairment), pain free
           external rotation range of motion (ROM) and pain free abduction ROM.

        -  A blinded therapist will administer all outcome measures. The primary outcome will be
           assessed on a weekly basis via telephone (or in person during weeks of MetroHealth
           visits) starting on the day of Visit 1 and continuing to 12-weeks after steroid
           injection (i.e., for the 13 weeks of the subject's participation). The remaining
           secondary outcomes will be assessed in clinic visits at least every 4 weeks starting
           with Visit 2 (Visits 2-5).
