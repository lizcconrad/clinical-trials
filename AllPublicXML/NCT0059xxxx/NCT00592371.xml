      Head and Neck Squaumous Cell Cancer(HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer in the United States
      and the 3rd most common worldwide. Risk factors include abuse to tobacco and alcohol.
      Survival is related to stage of HNSCC when treatment is sought. Most HNSCC patients present
      with advanced staged disease. This screening activity will educate patients with HNSCC rick
      factors and screen for pre malignant and/or early staged lesions.
