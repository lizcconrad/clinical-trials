      The objective of this study is to evaluate a post-fracture intervention for improving
      osteoporosis care in older men and women who have suffered a fracture that may indicate the
      presence of osteoporosis. Although osteoporosis can be identified with a bone mineral density
      (BMD) test, most individuals with osteoporosis are not diagnosed until they fracture.
      Post-fracture care often &quot;falls between the cracks&quot; when there is a breakdown in
      communication between hospital and community, or between specialists and primary care
      physicians. Often physicians and patients fail to make the connection between an acute
      fracture and osteoporosis, or the value of secondary prevention strategies. If untreated,
      there is an extremely high rate of additional fractures after a first osteoporotic fracture.
      It follows that improving BMD testing and/or treatment in appropriately identified
      individuals is a necessary step in optimizing post-fracture patient care. Over the next three
      years we will be testing and optimizing a notification procedure to physicians and/or
      patients relying upon fracture events reported to the provincial health service (Manitoba
      Health).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major 'care gap' exists in the management of patients with fractures suggestive of
      osteoporosis. Currently, only a small minority of these individuals who are at high risk for
      recurrent fractures undergo evaluation for possible treatment. We propose to test and
      optimize a novel approach to address this question, relying upon fracture events reported to
      provincial health service (Manitoba Health) as a mechanism for osteoporosis case
      identification and enhancing post fracture care.

      Phase 1 (one year duration): individuals meeting the fracture case definition will be
      randomized to usual care (no intervention), physician notification and physician/patient
      notification. The notification will provide a general recommendation for osteoporosis
      assessment. The use of appropriate post-fracture investigations and treatment will be
      prospectively evaluated.

      Phase 2 (up to two years duration): the intervention will be refined and iteratively trialed
      for all individuals meeting the fracture case definition.

      Phase 3: a recommendation for long term maintenance of the post-fracture intervention will be
      developed.

    <description>Information letters under Manitoba Health letterhead will be sent out to physician(s) and/or patient connected with a fracture that meets specific criteria. To address concerns over discontinuous care of patient seen at the time of fracture and for subsequent follow-up, the physician notification will specifically target the individual involved in the initial report to Manitoba Health as well as the primary care physician (using an algorithm developed by the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy). The notification will provide a general recommendation for osteoporosis assessment in addition to a copy of the BMD testing requisition since BMD testing is usually justified in this setting. The notification will not dictate what testing or treatment needs to be performed.</description>
