      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if long-term survivors of childhood
      head or neck cancer, who received radiation therapy as part of the overall treatment plan,
      are at increased risk of thickening or blockage of the carotid arteries (the major blood
      vessels in the neck).

      Researchers also want to find out if other medical conditions, such as high blood sugar, high
      blood cholesterol, or history of tobacco use may contribute to the thickening or blockage of
      the carotid arteries.

      Some research shows that survivors of adult head or neck cancer, who received radiation
      therapy, are at increased risk for thickening or blockage of the carotid arteries, which may
      increase the risk for other medical conditions, such as stroke. Researchers want to learn
      about the possible risks of thickening or blockage of the carotid arteries in survivors of
      childhood head or neck cancer.

      If you agree to take part in this study, researchers will see if there are any possible
      effects (thickening or blockage) of radiation therapy on your carotid arteries. This will be
      done by examining the test results from routine testing (mentioned below) that is normally
      done for your standard long-term follow-up care of the disease. These routine tests would be
      performed even if you were not in this research study.

      During your long-term follow-up clinic appointment, you will have a physical exam and an
      ultrasound test (performed at the Cardiology Clinic) of the carotid arteries. A carotid
      ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to look at the blood vessels in the neck. Blood
      will be drawn (about 2-3 teaspoons) for laboratory tests, including blood sugar level, blood
      cholesterol level, blood triglyceride level, thyroid hormone level, and blood levels of
      certain proteins (C-reactive protein and brain natriuretic peptide).

      If any of the tests show any thickening or blockage of the carotid arteries or other medical
      problems, such as high blood sugar, your study doctor will discuss the test results,
      treatment options, and/or a follow-up plan with you.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
