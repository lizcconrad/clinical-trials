    <textblock>
      Xerostomia (dry mouth) is the most common late complication of radiation therapy for head and
      neck cancers. When patients are cured or survive for several years, xerostomia often becomes
      quite bothersome; it affects their quality of life. This study compares the effectiveness of
      seven over-the-counter remedies, 2 rinses, 3 sprays and 2 chewing gums. A computer program
      will make random assignments so that the patient nor the physician will choose the order in
      which the products are tried. The remedies will be used for one week each and at the end of
      each period the patient will fill out a questionaire.
