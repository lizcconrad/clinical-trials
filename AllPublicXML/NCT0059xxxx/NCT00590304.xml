    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate asthma and examine the homes of children with asthma
      living in rural areas of the state. This study is being done to give investigators more
      information about the presence of allergens and endotoxin in the homes of children with
      asthma living in the delta region of Arkansas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children and disproportionately affects minority
      and low-income children. Current pediatric asthma research in this high-risk group focuses on
      children living in inner-city environments. Low-income, minority children with asthma from
      non-urban locales have not been studied extensively. The specific aims of the study will
      examine the impact of home environmental exposure to endotoxin on asthma severity and atopy
      status in the rural setting among predominately African American, low-income asthmatics. This
      study will answer several research questions. The first question involves the relationship
      between asthma severity and exposure to endotoxin among rural children at high risk for
      increased morbidity and mortality. Second, the relationship between atopy and endotoxin
      exposure has been the subject of recent debates among asthma researchers. The hygiene
      hypothesis suggest that the recent rise in atopic disease in Westernized societies is due to
      decreased microbial burden. Last data on atopy and aeroallergen exposure among high-risk
      rural asthmatics will be critical in the design and implementation of future intervention
      programs.

    <description>The population will consist of 120 English-speaking participants ages 4-17 years from four rural schools with physician-diagnosed asthma or symptoms of asthma in the previous 12 months. As of June 2008, an additional rural school has been added to the population criteria, making a total of five rural schools.</description>

      Optional buccal swab samples will be obtained from participants. This is done by touching the
      inside of the participant's cheek to collect a sample of the cells in his/her mouth with a
      cotton swab type applicator.

        Participants will be children with asthma, ages 4-17 years from the Mississippi Delta
        region. The Mississippi Delta has been identified as one of the poorest,
        medically-underserved regions of the United States, and includes the geographic regions of
        Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi that are contiguous with the Mississippi River.
        Participants for the study will be recruited from Eudora, Lake Village, Marvell and Elaine
        public school districts. Since June 2008, the Dumas Public School District has been added
        in the recruitment. These districts are located in the Delta region of Arkansas where more
        than one-third of families with children 5-17 years are below the 2000 poverty line (Census
        bureau). Students in these school districts are predominately of a miniority population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English speaking participants aged 4-17 years from four rural schools with physician
             diagnosed asthma or symptoms of asthma in the previous 12 months (coughing, wheezing,
             chest tightness, shortness of breath) (per parental or legal guardian report) and
             current taking prescribed medications for asthma such as inhalers, syrup or breathing
             machine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with significant underlying respiratory disease other than asthma (such as
             cystic fibrosis) or significant co-morbid conditions such as severe developmental
             delay or cerebral palsy will be excluded from the study.
