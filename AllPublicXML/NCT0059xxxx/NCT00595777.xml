  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the institutionalisation of a regular systematic approach to the assessment
      of pain in inpatient cancer units using the Edinburgh Pain Assessment Tool (EPAT©) leads to
      better control of pain than that achieved by usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and relevance to cancer - Pain associated with cancer has a severe negative impact
      on quality of life and can also limit a patient's ability to tolerate potentially life-saving
      tumoricidal treatment. Unfortunately in practice only half of cancer patients receive
      adequate pain control. A fundamental reason for this is inadequate assessment of pain. The
      institutionalisation of pain assessment as a 5th vital sign on the bedside chart combined
      with training and guidance in pain management (EPAT) is a potentially effective solution.

      We have already evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of EPAT in a randomised trial of 150
      oncology inpatients and found that by Day 4 after admission 90% reported adequate pain
      control compared to only 52% of those who received usual care.

      Aims - We now want to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EPAT in practice
      and ask: Does it reduce cancer pain more that usual care? Are there adverse effects? Is it
      cost effective?

      Outline plan - A UK-wide cluster randomised controlled trial of 18 inpatient cancer centres
      of which half will use the EPAT package and half usual care. The trial outcomes are
      clinically significant improvement, adverse effects such as opiate toxicity and cost
      effectiveness.

    <description>The EPAT package consists of an education programme, which deals with the known common barriers to effective pain control and the bedside pain tool. The pain tool is uniquely incorporated into the vital signs chart to enable a systematic approach to cancer pain assessment and review. EPAT consists of 2 steps: step 1 is a colour-coded pain assessment on the bedside vital signs chart. Patients with moderate or severe pain on step 1 will progress to to step 2, which helps to identify the aetiology of the pain, screening for opioid side effects and is linked via flags to simple management plans. The intervention will be delivered to the clusters randomised to the intervention, after collection of baseline data (pre-intervention data) on 50 patients.</description>
