  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the tolerability and efficacy of a 0.10% or
      0.05% PTH (1-34) parathyroid hormone peptide gel in the treatment of mild to moderate plaque
      psoriasis in comparison to treatment with the placebo gel alone.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to confirm the results of a previous proof of concept study performed
      by Dr. Michael Holick using a different dosage form. The secondary objective is to determine
      if there is a dose dependent difference or trend in response between the two concentrations
      of PTH (1-34) peptide gel.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive one of three treatment groups on a 1:1:1 basis. The
      three treatment groups are:

        -  Treatment Group 1: 0.05% PTH (1-34) Gel

        -  Treatment Group 2: 0.10% PTH (1-34) Gel

        -  Treatment Group 3: Placebo Gel
