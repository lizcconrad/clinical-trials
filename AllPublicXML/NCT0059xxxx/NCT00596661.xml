    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of treating
      coronary artery lesions which have not been previously treated with the TRIMAXX Coronary
      stent system as compared to the reported results for commercially available non-drug eluting
      coronary stent systems which are indicated for the same treatments.

      The TriMaxx study is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm trial intended to
      demonstrate the safety and feasibility of the TriMaxx Cornary Stent System. The study will
      enroll 100 subjects with de novo native coronary artery lesions who meet the eligibility
      criteria and agree to participate in the study. Subjects will be enrolled in a sequential
      manner. The safety and feasibility of the TRIMAXX stent will be evaluated by comparing the
      MACE rate that is observed 30 days post-procedure to the MACE rate for commercially available
      non-drug eluting stents. Secoandry evaluations will include analysis of clinical and
      angiographic parameters at 6 months. All subjects will undergo assessments at 30 days and at
      6 months. Additionally, all subjects will undergo a follow-up angiogram at 6 months.
