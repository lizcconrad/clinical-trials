  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the short term and the long term side effects of
      proton beam radiation for pediatric bone and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas.

      -  Participants will receive radiation treatments once per day, 5 days a week for a total
           of 4 to 6 weeks, depending on how much total dose the tumor requires. The radiation
           doctor will see the participant once each week to monitor and record any side effects
           they may have from radiation treatment.

        -  A special device will be made for each participant to help them hold still during the
           treatment. This may either be a mask or foam cradle, depending on the area to be
           treated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven NRSTS or bone sarcoma

          -  Less than or equal to 30 years of age

          -  Patients must have been treated with a standardly accepted chemotherapy regimen if
             chemotherapy is indicated

          -  Patients must be willing to receive follow-up care for a minimum of five years after
             treatment at MGH and annual visits unless it is too difficult to return to MGH for
             follow-up care. In that event, the patient or guardian must be willing to have their
             outside medical information released in order to track the results of treatment

          -  They or their legal guardian must give their informed consent

          -  Timing of radiation may be according to concurrent protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Co-morbidities that would make the use of radiation too toxic to deliver safely, such
             as serious local injury of collagen vascular disease

          -  Patients who are pregnant

          -  Previous treatment with radiation therapy

          -  Concurrent adriamycin or gemcitabine chemotherapy is planned, unless on a concurrent
             protocol
