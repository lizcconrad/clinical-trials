  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 5% of patients with recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding remain undiagnosed by EGD
      and colonoscopy, the presumed source of bleeding in these patients being the small intestine.
      These patients fall under the category of &quot;obscure gastrointestinal bleeding,&quot; and frequently
      require an extensive diagnostic work-up. For these reasons, most patients who present with
      obscure or occult gastrointestinal bleeding typically undergo multiple endoscopic
      evaluations, including capsule endoscopy and various radiologic imaging studies, including
      enteroclysis, small bowel series, CT scan, angiography, and radionuclide scan. Recently, many
      centers (included the Brigham and Women's Hospital) have begun using capsule endoscopy and CT
      enterography (CTE) for evaluation of suspected small bowel pathology. This is an
      observational study enrolling patients referred to the Brigham and Women's Hospital for
      obscure gastrointestinal bleeding designed to compare the diagnostic yield of various
      diagnostic modalities, in particular capsule endoscopy and CT enterography in the evaluation
      of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.
