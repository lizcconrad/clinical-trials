  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study. The goal of this study is to test whether Bevacizumab is safe enough
      in patients with brain tumors so that a larger study can be conducted. This study will also
      give us some information about whether the combination of Bevacizumab and radiation has
      potential to become an effective treatment for regrowing brain tumors.

      Bevacizumab is an experimental drug that blocks a molecule called VEGF that is found in high
      amounts in malignant gliomas. VEGF promotes the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients
      to tumor cells. In studies with laboratory animals, Bevacizumab slowed the growth of several
      different types of human cancer cells by blocking the effects of VEGF. There is also evidence
      that Bevacizumab enhances the effects of radiation on tumor cell

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent malignant glioma that has failed prior radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
             Surgery for the recurrence may be offered to selected patients prior to receiving
             bevacizumab and IMRT on this protocol.

          -  MRI scan with gadolinium contrast showing geographically-circumscribed tumor &lt; than or
             equal to 3.5cm. (Scan must be performed on a steroid dosage that has been stable for
             at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between date of imaging and
             registration, a new baseline MRI is required).

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy:

          -  An interval of &gt; than or equal to 4 weeks (28 days) from prior cytotoxic therapy

          -  An interval of &gt; than or equal to 1 week (7 days) from any non-cytotoxic agents

          -  An interval of &gt; than or equal to 6 weeks (42 days) from the completion of radiation
             therapy

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; than or equal to 1,500/mm3.

          -  Platelet count &gt; than or equal to 100,000/mm3.

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; than or equal to 10 g/dl.

          -  BUN and serum creatinine both &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Total bilirubin both &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  SGOT and SGPT both &lt; than or equal to 3 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal.

          -  &gt; than or equal to 18 years of age.
