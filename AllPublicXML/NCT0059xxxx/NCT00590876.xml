  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is the
      rate-limiting step to achieve glucose level control. As a result, understanding the body's
      responses (including the brain's response) to hypoglycemia is essential for the effective
      treatment of patients with T1DM. The purpose of this research is to determine whether
      pancreatic islet cell allotransplantation to restore normoglycemia (normal blood glucose
      levels) in Type 1 Diabetic patients with hypoglycemia unawareness alters brain fuel
      utilization and cognitive performance under euglycemic (blood sugar at 100 mg/dl) and
      hypoglycemic (blood sugar at 50 mg/dl) conditions. Three groups of subjects will be studied:
      (1) T1DM patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness who
      have been selected for pancreatic islet cell allotransplantation; (2) T1DM patients who also
      have a history of severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness; (3) nondiabetic
      subjects. All subjects will undergo identical testing including: (a) screening; (b)
      neuropsychological testing; (c) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during
      euglycemic and hypoglycemic conditions.

             is associated with a blood glucose of &lt; 50 mg/dl or prompt recovery after
             administration of oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon) or 2 or more
