  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder have symptoms that persist,
      including hallucinations or delusions, despite adequate pharmacotherapy with antipsychotic
      drug. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain that has been implicated
      in several brain diseases. NMDA antagonist drugs cause symptoms of psychosis in otherwise
      normal persons. It is postulated that reduced NMDA receptor mediated neurotransmission leads
      to an increase in synaptic glutamate. Excessive synaptic concentrations of glutamate can
      produce excitatory neurotoxicity. Agents which reduce excess glutamate activity are
      neuroprotective. This therapeutic strategy has been applied to schizophrenia through the use
      of compounds that reduce presynaptic release of glutamate or otherwise decrease excessive
      postsynaptic stimulation, including lamotrigine, memantine and a m-GLU-R2 agonist (LY354740)
      with the hypothesized result of a reduction in psychotic symptoms.

      Recently it was shown that a commonly available antibiotic (ceftriaxone) has the unique
      neuroprotective function of decreasing the amount of extracellular glutamate in nervous
      system tissue by increasing the number of glutamate transporter proteins. Our clinical
      experience with patients who have refractory psychosis and past Lyme disease indicates that
      in some patients psychosis may improve with IV ceftriaxone therapy. Whether this improvement
      was due to its antimicrobial or glutamate effect or a placebo effect is uncertain. In a
      placebo-controlled design, this study investigates the ability of ceftriaxone to decrease
      psychotic symptoms in patients with refractory psychotic disorders. In addition, the study
      will examine glutamatergic functional activity before and after treatment using brain imaging
      with magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

      Patients will be screened over the telephone. Information will be gathered from the mental
      health treatment team and the patient. Most patients who come to this study have had an
      inadequate or insufficient improvement with clozapine. Upon arrival at the NYS Psychiatric
      Institute, they review and sign consent to make sure the details of the research study are
      understood. Comprehensive assessments are conducted, including neurocognitive testing, prior
      to treatment onset. The treatment is randomized so patients will either receive IV
      ceftriaxone or IV placebo. Treatment is given Monday through Friday to enable the patient to
      have weekends off without a plastic tube (angiocath) in the vein of the arm. If after 6 weeks
      the patient's symptoms are not at least mildly improved, then the treatment will be stopped.
      If however there are signs of improvement, the treatment will be continued another 2 weeks.
      If at the end of the &quot;double-blind&quot; part of the study a patient learns he/she received
      placebo and wishes to be given ceftriaxone, we will provide 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for those
      patients. The inpatient unit is located in the NYS Psychiatric Institute which is adjacent to
      the Columbia Medical Center in northern Manhattan. Our new building for the NYS Psychiatric
      Institute is about 10 years old so the inpatient unit is quite attractive with beautiful
      views of the Hudson River and the Palisades. There is no financial cost for the inpatient
      stay nor is there a financial cost for participating in this study.

      Patients or family members wishing to learn more about this research study should call
      212-543-6510 for more information or call Dr. Fallon directly at 212-543-5487.

          7. Patients on other antidepressants/mood stabilizers (except PRN benzodiazepines) will
             be at the same dose for at least 2 months prior to starting this trial. (Clinical
             evaluation &amp; record review.)

          8. Patient's current treatment has been optimized (Review of medical records and
             conversation with treating psychiatrist)

          9. Patient is likely to tolerate the departure from clinical management required of study
             participants (Review of medical records and conversation with treating psychiatrist)

         10. There is no significant risk of self-injury or violence based on recent history and
             current mental state (Review of medical records and conversation with treating

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Penicillin or cephalosporin allergy (Self-report)

          2. Agitation such that patient is likely to be unable to tolerate having an IV line in
             place.(Behavioral Observation)

          3. Current Lyme disease that has not been treated previously. Current or history of
             liver, kidney, or gall bladder disease or elevated liver function test, elevated BUN
             over/Cr at screening. Unstable medical illness. History of gall stones (without
             subsequent cholecystectomy), hypereosinophilic syndrome, sickle cell disease,
