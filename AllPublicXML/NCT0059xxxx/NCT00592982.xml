      1. Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw(ONJ)is detectable by positron
           emission tomography(PET).

        2. Bisphosphonate-associated ONJ can be diagnosed and characteristically differentiated
           from other bony pathologies of the jaw(osteomyelitis, osteolytic lesions, and
           osteoradionecrosis)by PET imaging.

      Is to review medical records of approximately 1000 patients with bisphosphonate-associated
      ONJ who have had PET imaging at the time of diagnosis. Also to review medical records of
      patients who have been diagnosed with jaw osteomyelitis, osteoradionecrosis, and cancerous
      lytic lesions who received PET imaging at the time of diagnosis.

      If sufficient information regarding presentation and treatment cannot be obtained form the
      medical record, approximately 300 patients will contacted by mail (and phone if necessary) by
      the PI or sub-investigators to question them regarding the onset of symptoms, treatment
      interventions, and outcomes.
