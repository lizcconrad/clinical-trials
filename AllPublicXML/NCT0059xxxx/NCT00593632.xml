      The study evaluates high fiber diet intake in patients with hyperlipidemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fiber intake has been shown to have modest effect in lowering cholesterol. However,
      most of these studies were done with 20g/daily fiber intake. Not much is known about high
      dietary fiber intake (30-40 g/day) and serum cholesterol. Also, there have been small studies
      that have shown modest decrease in oxidative stress by increasing dietary fiber intake. The
      goal of our study is to determine the efficacy /safety of high dietary fiber intake in
      raising HDL, lowering LDL, and lowering oxidative stress in patients with hyperlipidemia.
