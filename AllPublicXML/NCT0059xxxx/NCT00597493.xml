      PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective To evaluate the activity of Sorafenib plus protracted, daily temozolomide
      in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) as measured by 6-month PFS.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and toxicity of combination therapy using
      Sorafenib plus temozolomide; To determine the pharmacokinetics of Sorafenib when combined
      with temozolomide in patients on and not on concurrent EIAC medications.

      STUDY ACTIVITIES AND POPULATION GROUP:

      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single center phase 2 trial. A treatment cycle will
      consist of 4 weeks of therapy.

      Sorafenib will be administered at a set dose of 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) twice daily,
      without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating). Temozolomide will be
      administered at a set dose of 50 mg/m2 once daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2
      hours after eating).

      Thirty-two (32) patients will be enrolled in this single-stage study.

      DATA ANALYSIS AND RISK/SAFETY ISSUES:

      After 16 patients with recurrent GBM are treated, an interim analysis will be conducted. If 6
      or more patients have experienced unacceptable toxicity, accrual of patients in this patient
      group will be terminated. Otherwise, patient accrual will continue. If 9 or more of the total
      32 patients experience unacceptable toxicity, the treatment regimen will be considered to
      have an unacceptable toxicity profile. The type I and II error rates associated with this
      testing are 0.053 and 0.053, respectively.
