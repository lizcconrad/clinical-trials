      The purpose of this study is to investigate how mucus (phlegm or spit) is broken down once it
      forms in the airways (bronchial tubes) of people with lung disease. This research study will
      also examine whether blood groups have an effect on lung function or the type of mucus found
      in the lung. This study is not designed to be a treatment for asthma, emphysema, cystic
      fibrosis, or other lung disease. It is designed to help the investigators learn more about
      the causes of airway disease.

      Accumulation of mucus in the airway involves the process of overproduction and reduced
      clearance of mucin glycoproteins. To date, little attention has been focused on mechanisms of
      mucin clearance from the airway. We hypothesize that there is enzymatic degradation of mucins
      (&quot;mucinase activity&quot;) in the airway, which acts to break down mucins and facilitate their
      clearance. We further hypothesize that glycosidases function as mucinases by removing
      peripheral monosaccharides from oligosaccharides, including oligosaccharides on mucins.
      Removal of terminal or capping sugars on mucin side chains may be an important mechanism in
      mucin degradation and clearance from the lung. If mucinase activity exists in the airway then
      mucus collected from human subjects should demonstrate evidence of mucin degradation ex vivo,
      especially at 37º celsius. As part of our protocol we propose to examine changes in airway
      mucus ex vivo under different experimental conditions. Our primary readout will be measures
      of sputum rheology, namely viscosity and elasticity. Our consultant for this methodology will
      be Dr Susan Muller (Chemical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley). In order to
      conduct experimental studies in this way we will need multiple samples from the same
      subjects. Thus, up to 10 or more sputum samples per subject will be collected on different
      days. In addition, we are interested in the biochemical properties of sputum and saliva,
      specifically the composition of mucin molecules found in these fluids.
