        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV), and has failed, or is

          -  The subject is ≥18 years old.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2.

          -  The subject has adequate organ function.

          -  Subjects who have received phlebotomy due to PV must have documented phlebotomy
             history for 12 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  The subject has the capability of understanding the informed consent document and has
             signed the informed consent document.
