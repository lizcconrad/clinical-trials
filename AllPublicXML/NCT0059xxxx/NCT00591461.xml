    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a condition that often occurs in patients who have had GERD for a
      long time. The researchers are interested in BE because it can sometimes become a cancer in
      the esophagus. The way that we currently diagnose BE is by performing an upper endoscopy and
      looking for a change in the color of the esophagus. This color change may represent BE. If
      the doctor sees this, he/she may take biopsies of this area.

      Studies have shown that making the diagnosis of BE can be hard to make. One of the reasons
      why this may be is because doctors may interpret what they see differently during the
      procedure. In other words, they may see an esophagus that appears normal in color or abnormal
      in color.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two doctors' impressions of the appearance of the
      esophagus during a single endoscopy procedure.
