      We hypothesize that mycophenolate mofetil(Cellcept)is safe and effective for lupus arthritis.
      In this study, patients with lupus will be randomly assigned to receive mycophenolate mofetil
      or placebo (inert pills) for three months. At the end of three months all patients will
      receive mycophenolate mofetil for three additional months. The effectiveness on arthritis and
      other symptoms of lupus will be measured by joint counts and by the BILAG instrument (a
      measure of overall lupus disease activity. Additionally special blood tests aimed at
      understanding the biologic effects of mycophenolate mofetil will also be performed at some
      visits. The primary outcome measurement will be the safety and effectiveness of this
      treatment (as compared to placebo) at the three month point. The trial will continue in a
      blinded fashion (neither the investigator or the participants know who is getting
      mycophenolate and who is getting placebo) until 24 patients have completed the first three
      months of the protocol.

      Patients and Methods:

      27 patients with active BILAG B or A arthritis, with at least 6 swollen and 6 tender joints
      entered a six month study of MMF vs placebo for three months followed by open label MMF. 14
      patients (12 women and 2 men) received placebo at baseline and 13 patients (11 women and 2
      men) received MMF. Primary Outcome was Major Clinical Response at 3 months, then all patients
      received open label Cellcept for another 3 months. Blood was drawn for safety, lupus disease
      activity measures and exploratory Biomarkers, Joint counts were performed monthly. At
      baseline background DMARDs were stopped. Plaquenil was allowed. All patients received 160 mg
      depomedrol at baseline and were allowed 80 mg shots at subsequent months after blood draws
      and procedures had been completed.

      Baseline Characteristics:

      At entry into the study, there was no difference between MMF and placebo in: age, gender,
      ethnicity, number of ACR criteria for lupus, or number of swollen and tender joints.

      DEFINITION of RESPONSE

      Prespecified Primary Endpoint: Complete Clinical Response:

      BILAG C in musculoskeletal by Week 12 and decrease to 0.25 or less of tender +swollen jt
      counts

      Prespecified Secondary Endpoint: Partial response:

      One letter drop in musculoskeletal by Week 12 OR decrease to 0.5 or less tender + swollen jt
      counts

      Exploratory Measure (not prespecified): Major Clinical Response:

      BILAG C in musculoskeletal by Week 12 and decrease to 0.5 or less of tender +swollen jt
      counts. (In the primary analysis the one patient who met this endpoint was designated as a
      partial responder since those prespecified criteria were also met.

      Non response:

      Does not meet above criteria for complete or partial response

      Additional Measures: (prespecified secondary endpoints) included joint counts, changes in
      BILAG and SLEDAI and physician and patient global assessments.

    <description>Patients Randomly Assigned to Arm 2 will enter Arm 2a for three months as a placebo comparator. The placebo treatment will be structured so that they will undergo the same type of dosing in Month 1 that the ascending dose patient from Arm 1 undergo, but will have placebo in both bottles of pills. At the end of three months, after assessment of primary outcome, these patients enter Arm 2b which is a treatment arm.</description>

    <description>Arm 2b begins for patients in Arm 2 after three months. They will receive ascending doses of mycophenolate for the first month (which is Month 4 of the study). This will still be blinded since patients in Arm 1 will be undergoing an identical ascending dose regimen during this month, except that there will be active treatment in both bottles. At the end of Month 4 all patients will know that they are on full dose of 3 gms/day mycophenolate (or a lower dose if there are tolerance issues).</description>
