    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a pharmacist can help patients understand how he/she
      should be taking their medications. The study is also being done to see if meeting with the
      pharmacist can help patients better control chronic kidney disease and the medical problems
      that can occur.

    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious condition associated with premature mortality,
      decrease quality of life, and increase health-care costs. An estimated 19 million Americans
      (1 in 9 US adults) have non-dialysis dependent CKD (Stages 1-4).1 The health care
      expenditures for caring for patients with CKD are substantial. According to Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the estimated annual health cost per patient for
      managing patients with CKD is markedly higher ($28,000) compared to the costs for caring for
      diabetic patients ($10,000 per patient) and heart failure patients ($5000 per patient). 2
      According to the National Kidney Foundation, as renal function declines, the number of renal
      complications, notably high blood pressure, anemia, malnutrition, and mineral and bone
      disorders, increases along with the severity. A large proportion of patients with CKD also
      develop multiple co-morbidities, particularly hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.
      Fortunately, accumulating evidence indicates that treatment of earlier stages of chronic
      kidney disease can prevent the development of kidney failure (Stage 5)3. In addition, early
      prevention of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with CKD may reduce cardiovascular
      events before and after the onset of kidney failure.3 Because many patients, particularly in
      the later stages of CKD, have multiple renal complications and chronic co-morbidities, these
      patients are potentially at high risk of medication non-adherence and non-persistence
      (defined as premature discontinuation of medication therapy). Studies have demonstrated that
      patients with chronic diseases typically take only 50% of prescribed doses of medication,
      leading to increased disease severity, clinic visits, and hospital admissions, resulting in
      substantial healthcare expenditures.4,5 In the United States alone, the cost of illness, due
      to non-adherence was estimated to be $170 billion per year.6 In addition, the associated
      total cost of treating the complications resulting from poor adherence in dialysis and
      transplant patients exceeds $950 million.7 Potential barriers to medication adherence for
      patients with chronic diseases include, but are not limited to, complex medication regimens,
      multiple drug doses, treatment of asymptomatic conditions, and cognitive factors. Although
      not well-studied in pre-dialysis patients, limited data suggests that important causes of
      medication non-adherence in chronic dialysis patients include inadequate prescription
      coverage or high medication costs, lack of transportation, and adverse effects. 8
