  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory recurrent papilloma (RRP) is one of the most common benign tumors. Surgical
      removal is the current management for RRP, but it is a very traumatic procedure, and often
      leads to permanent voice dysfunction. In this study, we will develop a new, combined RRP
      treatment with a pulsed dye laser (PDL) and Celebrex. We will determine if Celebrex, a newly
      developed inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, can provide a long-term inhibitory effect on
      RRP, therefore preventing RRP from recurring. This combined strategy, if successful in this
      proposed study, will provide a new and ideal &quot;voice-preserving&quot; therapy for RRP that will
      deliver long-term efficacy in managing RRP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RRP and its surgeries usually involves the vocal cords or other regions of the larynx,
      thereby, resulting in a poor voice. Our previous studies have shown the efficacy and safety
      of a microvascular targeting technique (MVT) for RRP treatment using the 585 nm PDL. This
      technique provides a less traumatic alternative to surgery. However, postoperative recurrence
      of lesions still remains a problem because of microvascular regrowth. This study is a
      continuation of our effort to develop a new and less traumatic treatment for RRP. In this
      study, we will develop a new, combined RRP treatment with PDL and Celebrex. We will determine
      if Celebrex, a newly developed inhibitor of COX-2, can provide a long-term inhibitory effect
      on RRP through its anti-angiogenic activity and the synergic effect produced with the laser
      therapy. The hypothesis is that postoperative administration of Celebrex will provide a
      long-term inhibitory effect on microvascular regrowth and on COX-2 enzyme, thereby,
      preventing RRP from recurring after the PDL therapy. Our specific aim in this study is to
      determine the synergic effect between PDL and Celebrex and long-term efficacy of Celecoxib in
      preventing postoperative RRP recurrence. We will compare this new combined strategy with
      traditional treatments in 30 adult patients. This is the first time to combined this new
      laser MVT technique with a COX-2 inhibitor for microvascular targeting therapy of RRP. This
      combined strategy, if successful in this proposed study, will provide a new and ideal
      &quot;voice-preserving&quot; therapy for RRP that will deliver long-term efficacy in managing RRP and
      will be safe and convenient enough for use in out-patient treatment.

    <limitations_and_caveats>We failed to recruit a total of 30 cases, due to (1) This disease is relative less common in clinic; and (2) particularly, more and more of patients now had a serious concern in safety of Celebrex due to news and warnings to public in recent years.</limitations_and_caveats>
