    <textblock>
      Background:

      Many people who have suffered a hip fracture are discharged from rehabilitation services with
      significant residual functional limitations and disability. We believe that a home-based
      exercise program that incorporates cognitive-behavioral techniques to increase exercise
      adherence and promote the return to daily activities could extend the benefits of formal
      rehabilitation for patients who have suffered a hip fracture.

      Specific Aims:

      We will conduct a 5-year multi-site randomized controlled trial in patients who have suffered
      a recent hip fracture and have completed all rehabilitation services. The specific aim that
      this project will address is whether:

      Participation in the Strong for Life (SFL) program will improve function and disability
      outcomes in participants 6-months after they are discharged from rehabilitation services.

      This study will also investigate the following secondary hypotheses:

        1. Changes in function and disability at 6-month follow-up will be correlated with changes
           in all three proposed intermediary variables: muscle strength, balance, and
           self-efficacy.

        2. The SFL program will significantly improve health-related quality of life among
           participants at 6-month follow-up.

        3. At 9-month follow-up the SFL program will continue to have a significant impact on
           participants' function and disability compared to the control group.

      Target population:

      The target population will be people aged 60 years or more who have suffered a recent
      traumatic hip fracture, have one or more residual functional limitations and have completed
      all inpatient, outpatient or homecare rehabilitation services.

      Intervention:

      We will use an enhanced version of the Strong for Life program. This home-based exercise
      program will include both resistance exercises using Thera-bands that will be shown on a
      video/DVD and weight-bearing exercises that are progressed using a step and/or a weighted
      vest. A cognitive-behavioral program that is customized for people recovering from hip
      fracture is being developed that will focus on promoting exercise adherence, decreasing fear
      of falling and increasing the return to daily activities in the patient's home and community.

      Design:

      A randomized controlled clinical trial will be implemented to measure the efficacy of the
      Strong for Life program. An attention-control intervention will be provided to all
      participants assigned to the control group. The outcome evaluation points are:

        -  T0: baseline, at the point of discharge from formal rehabilitation;

        -  T2: 6-month outcome assessment

        -  T3: 9-month follow-up

      Outcomes:

      The primary outcomes will be function measured by both self-report (AM PAC) and physical
      performance measures (SPPB). Secondary outcomes include disability, self-efficacy, balance,
      strength, cognition, and reaction time. Adherence to the exercise program and adverse events
      will also be monitored.

    <description>The program contains 5 minutes of warm-up, 25 minutes of strengthening, and 5 minutes of cool-down exercises. The SFL program is contained on a 35 minute videotape. Subjects are instructed to increase resistance when they can perform 10 repetitions of a movement pattern without significant fatigue or loss of proper execution. Subjects are instructed to move within a comfortable range of motion.
Participants will be taught the SFL program during two home visits conducted by a physical therapist. On the first visit, the exercise techniques will be taught, modified as needed based on individual needs and practiced as necessary until proper technique is attained. Each participant will be given written guidelines for how to progress resistance of the program, how to modify the exercises and how to complete bimonthly exercise calendars.</description>
