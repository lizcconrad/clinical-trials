      The purpose of this study is to determine the potential usefulness of new functional MRI in
      diagnostic assessment of patients presenting with vertigo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of vertigo has been reported to be as high as 1.5% in the general population
      and some reports suggest that more than 5% of adults experience some kind of vertigo each
      year. In 80% of affected individuals, this symptom resulted in a medical consultation,
      interruption of daily activities, or sick leave. Therefore, vertigo can have a significant
      impact on health and well being. Unfortunately, there is not yet any satisfactory objective
      method for diagnosis of vertigo. At present, the diagnosis usually depends on medical
      history, vestibular function tests, Dix-Hallpike positioning tests done in the office, and,
      to some extent imaging studies doen to look for such abnormalities such as acoustic tumor,
      brain tumor, and evidence of multiple sclerosis. A number of recent studies support the
      possibility of using functional MRI (fMRI), particularly a new diffusion tensor fiber
      tracking (DTT) technique, as a new tool for diagnosis of disorders that can cause vertigo. In
      this study, our hypothesis is that there is an alteration in the activity in neural pathways
      of patients with vertigo that can be detected by fMRI. To test this assumption, our objective
      in this study is to determine whether there is a difference between the fMRI images obtained
      in normal subjects versus those in patients with vertigo.

    <description>The functional MRI imaging of whole brain will be obtained before, during and after the vestibular response which is induced by the designated caloric stimulation. Post-imaging analysis will reveal which region or neural pathways in the central nervous system may attributed to the development of vertigo.</description>
