      Heart failure is a clinical syndrome where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to
      satisfy the organism's metabolic needs. Heart failure has become a major clinical and public
      health problem with approximately 300,000 Canadians being affected. Atrial fibrillation is a
      rhythm disorder in which the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) are paralyzed by
      continuous electrical activity. Some of the continuous chaotic electrical activity in the
      atria travels to the lower cavities of the heart (the ventricles) causing then to beat
      irregularly and very rapidly. It is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 5% of
      individuals 65 years and older and it is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Both
      conditions (heart failure and atrial fibrillation) often co-exist in the same patient. Heart
      failure promotes atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation aggravates heart failure. The
      Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure (AF-CHF) trial is investigating whether
      preservation of normal cardiac rhythm influences mortality and morbidity. The AF-CHF study
      began in 2001 and 1,378 patients have been enrolled from 123 participating centres, in North
      America, South America, Europe, and Israel. The results of this trial which are expected in
      October 2007, will improve decision-making for the physician and will provide useful
      information to healthcare organizations responsible for the care of heart failure patients.

      Congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are two important and growing
      problems in medicine and cardiology. Both conditions often co-exist and complicate each
      other's management. Two therapeutic strategies are available for patients with AF and CHF:
      the first aims at restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm, whereas, the second focuses
      exclusively on optimizing ventricular rate. The primary objective of the Atrial Fibrillation
      and Congestive Heart Failure (AF-CHF) trial is to compare these two widely-used treatment
      strategies with respect to cardiovascular mortality.

      Hypothesis: Restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm reduces cardiovascular mortality compared
      to a rate control treatment strategy in patients with AF and CHF.

      Rationale: Despite new therapeutic interventions, the prognosis of heart failure patients
      remains grim with 5-year survival rates usually less than 50%. In most recent, large CHF
      trials, AF has been reported to be independently associated with increased mortality.
      Non-randomized observations also suggest that patients with AF in the setting of CHF have a
      greater tendency to revert to sinus rhythm during amiodarone therapy or with newer class III
      antiarrhythmic agents and that those who maintain a normal rhythm have a better prognosis.
      There is a need to determine whether a treatment strategy that attempts to maintain sinus
      rhythm will have a beneficial impact on cardiovascular mortality in CHF patients. This
      hypothesis has never been tested in a prospective, controlled, adequately-powered randomized
      trial.

      Research Plan: AF-CHF is a prospective, multicentre clinical trial (100 centres in Canada,
      the USA, and Europe), that will randomize 1,450 NYHA class II-IV CHF patients with left
      ventricular ejection fraction &gt;/=35% (NYHA class I patients with prior hospitalization for
      CHF or ejection fraction &lt;/=25% are also eligible) and a history of significant AF (ECG
      documentation of either one episode lasting &gt;/=6 hours within the past 6 months, or an
      episode lasting &gt;/=10 minutes within the past 6 months in a patient with prior electrical
      cardioversion for AF) to one of two treatment strategies: 1) rhythm control with the use of
      electrical cardioversion if needed combined with antiarrhythmic drug therapy (amiodarone or
      other class III agents), and additional non-pharmacologic therapy in resistant patients, 2)
      rate control with the use of drugs (mainly beta-blockers plus digoxin) and/or pacemaker and
      AV nodal catheter ablation if necessary. The enrollment period will be completed within 2
      years with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Both groups will receive optimal CHF management
      with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. Cardiovascular mortality will be the primary endpoint
      of the trial. The intention-to-treat approach will be the primary method of analysis.
      Secondary outcomes are total mortality, hospitalization, stroke, cost of therapy and quality
      of life. From recent trial data, we anticipate a 18.75% 2-year cardiovascular mortality in
      the rate control arm and a 25% reduction in cardiovascular mortality in the rhythm control
      group. Assuming a 2% loss to follow-up, a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and an annual accrual
      rate of 750 patients, we calculate that 722 patients per group (rounded total number of 1,450
      patients) will be necessary to achieve a power of 0.80 when performing a log-rank test. The
      Research Centre of the Montreal Heart Institute will be the Coordinating and Methods Centre.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;/=35% as measured by nuclear imaging,
             echocardiography, or cardiac angiography within 6 months preceding enrollment. If the
             patient has had a myocardial infarction or heart surgery during this period, the
             ejection fraction must be remeasured.

          2. Symptomatic CHF (NYHA class II-IV) at some time during the 6 months before
             randomization, despite therapy with an ACE inhibitor (however, patients who do not
             tolerate an ACE inhibitor are eligible). Asymptomatic patients (NYHA class I) with
             either a prior hospitalization for CHF during the 6 months before randomization or
             with a left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;/=25% are also eligible.

          3. History of significant AF, defined as either:

               1. one episode lasting &gt;/=6 hours (duration of AF will be determined by history),
                  within the past 6 months with electrocardiographic confirmation; or

               2. an episode lasting &gt;/=10 minutes (by history) within the past 6 months with
                  electrocardiographic confirmation in a patient with a prior electrical
                  cardioversion for AF.

          4. In the opinion of the clinical investigator, the patient must be eligible for
             long-term treatment with either treatment strategy of AF.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. AF is known to be present and uninterrupted for more than 12 months prior to
             randomization. However, if such a patient is cardioverted and maintained in sinus
             rhythm for &gt;/=24 hours, he or she becomes eligible.

          2. Reversible cause of AF such as acute pericarditis, pulmonary embolism,
             hyperthyroidism, alcohol intoxication.

          3. AF occurring and not persisting beyond 10 days of surgery or myocardial infarction.

          4. Reversible cause of CHF such as severe aortic or mitral stenosis and
             tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

          5. Decompensated CHF within 48 hours of randomization.

          6. Antiarrhythmic drugs other than calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers or digoxin
             required for other arrhythmias or other indications.

          7. More than 7 days of amiodarone therapy within the last month prior to randomization.

          8. Second or third degree AV block, sinus pause &gt;3 seconds, resting heart rate &lt;50 bpm
             without a permanent pacemaker.

          9. History of drug-induced Torsades de Pointes or congenital long QT syndrome.

         10. Prior AV nodal ablation or Maze surgery.

         11. Probable cardiac transplantation in the next 6 months.

         12. Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis.

         13. Women of child-bearing potential and not on a reliable method of birth control.

         14. Geographic or social factors, drug or alcohol abuse making follow-up or compliance
             difficult.

         15. Other noncardiovascular medical condition (such as cancer) making 1 year survival
             unlikely.

         16. Less than 18 years of age.
