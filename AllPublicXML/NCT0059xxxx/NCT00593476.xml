    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the safety and efficacy of a pre-packaged, portion
      controlled meal plan on weight loss and glycemic control in overweight and obese patients
      with type 2 diabetes.

      Aim 1 - Effects on Weight Assess the effects of a pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan
      on weight loss in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The researchers hypothesize that the pre-packaged, portion controlled diet (PCD) will produce
      a greater weight loss than a diabetes support and education (DSE) program at 12 weeks. The
      study will be powered to detect between group differences of 3% of body weight. Secondarily,
      the researchers will assess whether there are any differences in weight during the secondary
      phase from weeks 13-24 when both groups will consume a PCD diet.

      Aim 2 - Effects on Glycemic Control

      Assess the effects of a pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan on glycemic control in
      overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The researchers hypothesize that the PCD will show greater improvement in HbA1c levels than a
      DSE group at 12 weeks. The study will be powered to detect between group differences of .5%
      in HbA1c. Secondarily, improvements and differences in HbA1c from weeks 13-24 when both
      groups are consuming a PCD will be assessed.

      General Design

      Randomized, non-blinded, controlled clinical trial using a parallel and cross-over design of
      either the treatment group which receives a pre-packaged, portion-controlled (PCD) meal plan
      for 24 weeks (weeks 0-24) or to the control group which receives 12 weeks of diabetes support
      and education (DSE) (weeks 0-12) and then crosses over to 12 weeks of PCD from weeks 13-24.

           Active hepatic disease: defined as any patient who currently, or has a history of
           requiring immune modulating/suppressing medications, ammonia lowering medications, or
           hepatic disease related diet modifications.

           Active renal disease: defined as any patient who currently, or has a history requiring
           potassium phosphate lowering medications, protein restriction diet, or hemo/peritoneal
           dialysis.

           interview at the screening visit

       18. Uncontrolled Dyslipidemia. Participants stable on medication treating dyslipidemia for
           at least 3 months or more is allowable.

      Physical Measures

      Diabetes control: Measures of HbA1c and fasting glucose will be takes at visits 1-4 to assess
      diabetes and glycemic control. In addition, we will track use of medications used to control
      diabetes.

      Dyslipidemia: Lipid/lipoprotein concentrations (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides) will be measured at visits 1-4. Current medication use
      will be collected at each clinic visit. We will use these data to track the incidence and
      prevalence of dyslipidemia.

      Inflammatory Markers: Inflammation will be measured using high sensitivity C reactive protein
      (hs- CRP) at visits 2-4.

      Electrocardiograms: Electrocardiograms will be obtained at visit 1 according to a standard
      protocol.

      Hypertension and blood pressure measures: Through blood pressure measurements at visits 1-4,
      and self-reported current medication use, we will track the incidence and prevalence of
      hypertension as a measure of periphery artery disease.

      Weight, height, and waist circumference: Body weight will be measured at each PCD visit,
      using calibrated scales. Participants will be weighed in light indoor clothing. Waist
      circumference will be measured at visits 1-4. Height will be measured at visit 1.

      Serum and DNA samples: Samples of serum will be frozen and stored for future testing of new
      and emerging cardiovascular risk factors. DNA samples will be frozen and stored to identify
      genetic markers of diet response. We will use these samples to determine the possibility that
      the common genetic variant ENPP1 K121Q could predispose diabetic and metabolic syndrome
      subjects to respond better to weight loss intervention than those who have the common variant
      K121K. Similarly, other genetic variants that associate with obesity and insulin resistance
      may change susceptibility to weight loss in different directions. If at any time during the
      study a participant decides they do not want their serum samples to be stored they may have
      them destroyed

      Self-Reported Measures

      Psychosocial measures: A battery of psychosocial measures will be assessed including
      standardized assessments such as the Beck Depression Inventory8 and an eating disorders
      questionnaire.9 These surveys will be measured will be assessed at visits 1-4.

      Quality of life: The Short Form 36 (SF-36) version will be used to measure general health
      related quality of life at visits 1-4.10 It can be used to calculate domain scores plus two
      summary scores: physical summary (four domains, 21 items), and mental health summary (four
      domains, 14 items).

      7-day Food Records: A 7 day food record will be recorded at visits 2-4 to assess compliance
      with the PCD in phases 1 and 2.

      Acceptability: Acceptability of each program (PCD and DSE) will be measured at visits 2-4 to
      determine tolerability and ease of each program.

      Socio-demographics: Information on employment, household composition, and education is
      collected at visit 1.

      Weight history, personal medical history, family medical history: At visit one only.
      Participants report their weights at various ages, history of weight cycling, and family and
      personal history of disease. Participants will be referred to appropriate treatment for any
      eating disorders, depression or other complications discovered as a result of the standard of
      care weight and lifestyle inventory and beck depression inventory administered at the
      screening visit. This treatment will be offered at CORE, or if participants prefer, with a
      provider at another location relevant to their complication.

      Concomitant medications and adverse events: At visits 1-4 concomitant medications and adverse
      events will be recorded. Additional changes to these will be assessed as needed throughout
      the study.

      TREATMENT

      Eligible volunteers are randomly assigned to a treatment group consisting of a pre-packaged,
      portion controlled meal plan (PCD) or to a control group that consists of a combination
      diabetes support and education (DSE) program/pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan (PCD)
      cross-over group. Treatment assignments are unmasked. At the end of 24 weeks the treatment
      group will have completed 18 group sessions and the control group will have completed 15
      group sessions. The PCD program is aimed at achieving and maintaining a decrease in weight
      from 1-24 weeks. Combination DSE/PCD program is aimed at achieving and maintaining a decrease
      in weight from weeks 13-24. A Certified Diabetes Educator will review the effects of diet and
      weight loss, exercise, and medications on blood glucose levels among all participants at the
      first group meeting before any changes in dietary intake or exercise are prescribed.
      Participants will be counseled on strategies to prevent hypoglycemia. In addition the causes,
      symptoms and treatment of hypoglycemia will be reviewed including when to contact their
      health care provider.
