      The purpose of this study is to evaluate preparation and administration of PB127,
      echocardiographic images obtained during PB127 administration, and evaluate the safety of
      PB127.

      The primary objectives of this clinical trial are:

        1. To train potential Phase 3 investigational sites in the preparation and andministration
           of PB127

        2. To train potential Phase 3 investigational sites in the acquisition of adequate images

        3. To collect additional safety information regarding intravenous administration of PB127

        4. To obtain a larger sample of images obtained with the Acuson Sequoia ultrasound system.
