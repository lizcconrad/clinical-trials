      This research protocol makes pictures of brain tumors. The pictures are made with a positron
      emission tomography (PET) scanner. PET scans use radioactivity to &quot;see&quot; cancer cells. We are
      using a new kind of PET scan. The new PET scan is called [18F]-FACBC PET. We will compare
      this to the standard PET scan. The standard PET scan is called [11C]-methionine PET.

      We expect these pictures will give us information about your tumor. We also hope to collect
      information about the amount of radioactivity exposure. We will measure radioactivity
      exposure to your tumor, brain and other organs. The research study results will be used to
      support the submission of an investigational new drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).

      The purpose of this research is to: 1) perform both 3-[18F]-FACBC and
      [11C-methyl]-Lmethionine brain tumor PET imaging studies in patients with primary brain
      tumors who have previously been treated and are now suspect for having recurrence or
      progression of disease (a pilot study, n=20); 2) perform only 3-[18F]-FACBC PET imaging
      studies on an additional set of patients with primary brain tumors who have previously been
      treated and are now suspect for having recurrence (n=10) . 3) obtain organ/tissue and body
      radiation dosimetry information following i.v. injection of 3-[18F]-FACBC; 4) look for
      potential correlations between the scan results obtained from those patients enrolled to
      03-028 and the patients' past medical treatment; The first set of 20 patients will agree to
      two PET studies. One study will involve the i.v.

      administration of a fluorine-18 labeled amino acid analogue, 3-fluoro-aminocyclobutane
      carboxylic acid (3-[18F]-FACBC) with sequential brain and body PET imaging. The second study
      will involve i.v. administration of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine and head imaging only.

      The additional set of 10 patients will undergo one PET study which will consist of the i.v.

      administration of fluorine-18 labeled amino acid analogue, 3-fluoro-aminocyclobutane
      carboxylic acid (3-[18F]-FACBC) with one brain scan and one body scan only. The 3-[18F]-FACBC
      PET studies (n=30) will be performed under the Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC)
      guidelines as defined and established by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).
      [11C-methyl]-L-methionine is in the hospital formulary and is approved for imaging brain
      tumors at MSKCC. Our hypotheses include: 1) [18F]-FACBC has equal or better brain tumor
      imaging characteristics compared to [11C]-methionine; 2) [18F]-FACBC is not metabolized, and
      radiolabeled metabolites will not confound the interpretation of the images as can be the
      case with [11C]-methionine; 3) imaging recurrent brain tumors with [18F]-FACBC will be
      enhanced by lower brain (background) activity as compared to corresponding [11C]- methionine
      images; 4) the biodistribution of [18F]-FACBC and radiation dosimetry following i.v.
      administration of a 370 MBq (10 mCi) dose is safe and within FDA guidelines; 5) a 370 MBq (10
      mCi) dose of [18F]-FACBC is sufficient for imaging brain tumors in a clinical setting; 6) the
      accumulation of [18F]-FACBC will correlate with the patients response to prior treatment and
      will provide prognostic information with respect to tumor progression and survival.

    <description>F-18 labeled FACBC is prepared stereo-specifically in a semi-automated, NCA procedure utilizing the General Electric FDG MicroLab, a system employing a quaternary 4-aminopyridinium resin to effect F-18 fluorination. The triflate species is displaced with F-18 fluoride in the MicroLab, and then the 1-t-butyl carbamate-3- trifluoromethane sulfonoxy-1-cyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester is hydrolyzed with 1 N HCl. The final product is isotonic and sterile, and has been utilized in animal experiments. The product was obtained in 30% radiochemical yield after 65 minutes from EOB. The radiochemical purity was greater than 95% and no preparative HPLC was required. The procedure could be considered routine, and is performed on the FDG synthetic module without changes either to the programming or to the cassettes.</description>
