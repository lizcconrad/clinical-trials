      The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized EEG method with the intended
      clinical users in the intended clinical settings with the intended population (patients who
      would typically receive a clinician's evaluation for ADHD). Multiple sites will be examined
      to provide a sample of patients across numerous communities with different demographics. The
      goal is to evaluate if the predictive accuracy of EEG will not be inferior to that of a
      widely-used and extensively validated ADHD scale in the prediction of ADHD in the intended
      use population as evaluated by Best Estimate Diagnosis.

        The study focuses on individuals who have consecutively presented to participating clinics
        with suspected attention and/or behavior concerns and would receive a clinician's
        comprehensive evaluation for ADHD. The study population includes male and female
        participants aged 6-17.99 years regardless of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic origin.
        Because of inclusion of patients with consecutive presentation to provide a representative
        clinical sample, the exact numbers for sub-groups will not be controlled. The study
        population will include patients with comorbid conditions. The non-ADHD subgroup will
        include patients with other causes of attentional concerns, which may include other common
        psychiatric disorders, organic causes of attention problems (such as poor hearing, vision
        disturbances, remote head injury, substance abuse), and/or no diagnosis.

             study.

          -  Subject and parent (or legal representative) of an educational level and degree of
             understanding sufficient to communicate suitably with the investigator, rater and
             study coordinator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous diagnosis of mental retardation. IQ &lt; 70 by previous records.

          -  History of seizure disorder or of EEG abnormalities. On anticonvulsants for seizure

          -  Metal plate or metal device in the head.

          -  Suicide ideation or gesture and/or homicidal ideation or gesture.

          -  Concomitant medications during participation in a research study. No prescription or
             nonprescription medications with psychoactive properties that may affect EEG (such as

             antipsychotics, no psychostimulants, no antidepressants. Washout of at least one week
             or longer depending on the medication and clinician's judgment. Medication used for
             medical reasons must be cleared by research staff with consideration of known effects
             on EEG.

          -  Known serious medical problems (cardiovascular, hematological, liver, seizure
             disorder, renal, or chronic respiratory problems).
