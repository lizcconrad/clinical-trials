  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to investigate the effects (good and bad) of Rituximab for the
      treatment of an autoimmune eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy. This disease has proven
      to be difficult to treat. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that depletes a line of cells
      involved in the autoimmune response. The study hypotheses is that rituximab is effective in
      the treatment of patients with moderate to severe active Graves' ophthalmopathy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laboratory evidence suggests that autoantibodies targeting the thyrotropin receptor are
      directly involved in the pathogenesis of Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). This double-blind,
      randomized, controlled study will determine whether rituximab, an anti-B-lymphocyte antigen
      (CD20) monoclonal antibody that induces transient B-cell depletion, is an effective treatment
      for moderate to severe, active GO.

      Before any treatment is given, careful eye and thyroid physical examinations will be
      performed and the patients will have several thyroid blood tests, a test to count the white
      cells in the blood, and a CT scan of the head and eyes. A close-up photograph of the face
      will be taken and patients will be given a short questionnaire about how their eyes are
      feeling and how the eye disease is affecting their quality of life.

      Each study subject will receive either 2 infusions of rituximab (each 1000 mg; given 2 weeks
      apart) or 2 intravenous infusions of saline. Glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 100 mg) or
      saline will also be administered IV as premedication to the rituximab and placebo arm
      respectively, in a blinded fashion but matching the randomization, to decrease the rate of
      infusion-associated reactions. All antihypertensive medications will be held for the 12 hours
      prior to and during the infusion. Patients will return 2 weeks after the first intravenous
      infusion in order to receive the second infusion.

      Patients will be assessed at weeks 8, 16, 24 and 52 for eye disease severity, CAS, thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), thyroid
      autoantibodies (TRAB), thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and C19+B cell count. CT scan of the orbits
      will be obtained at baseline and week 52 for orbital volume measurements and proptosis.
      Thyroid ultrasound will be obtained at baseline, week 24 and week 52 for thyroid volume
      measurements and color Doppler flow assessment.

      Data analysis - Continuous variables were compared between the two treatment groups using t
      test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test, while categorical variables were analyzed using the
      chi-square /Fisher exact test. Non-parametric methods were used throughout where normality
      and chi-squared assumptions did not hold. General linear models were used to access treatment
      effect on change in CAS between baseline and 24 or 52 weeks. Patients who discontinued the
      trial prior to week 52 were evaluated before discontinuation and those data were carried
      forward to either 24 weeks (for the 5 patients who discontinued prior to or at week 24) or 52
      weeks (for the single patient discontinued from the trial after 24 weeks) as the final
      evaluation for that patient. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

    <measure>Change in Clinical Activity Score (CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months after the first infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical activity score (CAS), for Grave's ophthalmopathy has become a widely accepted tool to assess disease activity and help decide the management of the condition. The CAS, which is based on classical signs of inflammation (pain, redness, and swelling), consists of 7 equally weighted items. The total CAS (as used in this study) may range from 0 to 7. The higher the CAS, the greater degree of inflammation is present. A drop in CAS of 2 or more points suggests an improvement in the inflammatory components of the disease. A CAS ≥3 implies active disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Failure Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after first infusion, 12 months after first infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The failure rate was defined as a composite variable of CAS decrease of &lt; 2 points or need for additional therapy (excluding cosmetic surgery) for the eye disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Disease Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months after first infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Disease severity was measured by the NOSPECS Score. This classification scheme of the eye changes in thyroid eye disease was introduced by the American Thyroid Association. It separates patients into seven classes of disease (class 0-6), with 0 being no signs or symptoms and 6 being sight loss. (The acronym is based on the first letter of the defining characteristic of each class, the classification is known as: 'no signs or symptoms; only signs; soft tissue; proptosis; extraocular muscle; cornea; sight loss' (NOSPECS) ).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Proptosis</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months after first infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Eye proptosis is a condition resulting in forward displacement of the globe from its normal position within the orbit. It is measured by computed tomography. Improvement in proptosis was defined as a decrease in proptosis by ≥2 mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Lid Fissure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months after first infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The palpebral fissure is the elliptic space between the medial and lateral canthi of the two open eye lids. In adults, this measures about 10mm vertically and 30mm horizontally. The fissure may be increased in vertical height in Graves' disease.
Improvement was defined as a decrease in lid aperture width by ≥3 mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Extraocular Motility</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months after first infusion, 12 months after first infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Change extraocular motility was assessed using the Gorman diplopia score. Diplopia, commonly known as double vision, is the simultaneous perception of two images of a single object that may be displaced horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (i.e., both vertically and horizontally) in relation to each other. It is usually the result of impaired function of the extraocular muscles, where both eyes are still functional but they cannot converge to target the desired object.
The Gorman diplopia score includes four categories: 1) no diplopia (absent), 2) diplopia when the patient is tired or awakening (intermittent), 3) diplopia at extremes of gaze (inconstant), and 4) continuous diplopia in the primary or reading position (constant).</description>

    <measure>Graves' Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life Score Using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months after first infusion, 12 months after first infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (QoL) was measured by the SF-12 questionnaire. The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores are computed (combined, scored, and weighted) using the scores of the 12 questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. Improvement was defined as a change of ≥ 6 points.</description>

        <description>The clinical activity score (CAS), for Grave's ophthalmopathy has become a widely accepted tool to assess disease activity and help decide the management of the condition. The CAS, which is based on classical signs of inflammation (pain, redness, and swelling), consists of 7 equally weighted items. The total CAS (as used in this study) may range from 0 to 7. The higher the CAS, the greater degree of inflammation is present. A drop in CAS of 2 or more points suggests an improvement in the inflammatory components of the disease.

        <title>Change in Extraocular Motility</title>
        <description>Change extraocular motility was assessed using the Gorman diplopia score. Diplopia, commonly known as double vision, is the simultaneous perception of two images of a single object that may be displaced horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (i.e., both vertically and horizontally) in relation to each other. It is usually the result of impaired function of the extraocular muscles, where both eyes are still functional but they cannot converge to target the desired object.
The Gorman diplopia score includes four categories: 1) no diplopia (absent), 2) diplopia when the patient is tired or awakening (intermittent), 3) diplopia at extremes of gaze (inconstant), and 4) continuous diplopia in the primary or reading position (constant).</description>
