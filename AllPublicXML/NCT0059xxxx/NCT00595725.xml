      The purpose of this study is to learn if a surgical technique called intraoperative lymphatic
      mapping can accurately identify the lymph node that is at greatest risk if endometrial or
      cervical cancer spreads to the lymph nodes.

      Early cervical cancer is usually treated by removing the cervix, tissue around the cervix,
      and the upper vagina. If needed, the uterus is also removed. The treatment also includes
      removing lymph nodes from the pelvis. Endometrial cancer is usually treated by removing the
      cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries.

      The treatment also includes removing lymph nodes from the pelvis.

      Patients with FIGO stage I endometrial cancer or patients with FIGO stage I-IIA invasive
      cervical cancer and who will be undergoing surgical management to include a lymphadenectomy.

      ↓ Injection of radioisotope and preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with Tc99m either the day
      before or on the day of surgery by the Nuclear Medicine Department.

      ↓ Intraoperative lymphatic mapping with blue dye and gamma probe.

      ↓ Hysterectomy, Radical hysterectomy and/or radical trachelectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.
