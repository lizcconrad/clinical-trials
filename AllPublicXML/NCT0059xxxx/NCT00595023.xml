  <brief_summary>

      This study is designed to collect data about the amount of time required to use the assay in
      clinical-use conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assay turn-around-time will be collected at sites that are using the GeneSearch BLN Assay for
      intraoperative testing of sentinel lymph nodes. The sites must be planning to use the assay
      result to guide the decision to complete an axillary lymph node dissection.

    <description>The GeneSearch™ BLN Assay is a real time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay that detects the presence of breast tumor cell metastasis in lymph nodes through the detection of gene expression markers present in breast tissue, but not in nodal tissue (cell type specific messenger RNA).</description>
