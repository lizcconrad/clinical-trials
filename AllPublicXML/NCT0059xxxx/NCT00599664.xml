      OMS201 is being developed to facilitate endoscopy of the ureters and to reduce postoperative
      discomfort, such as pain, frequency, urgency and/or difficult urination following endoscopic
      surgery to remove a urinary tract stone.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is undergoing unilateral ureteroscopic removal of renal collecting system or
             ureteral stones located in the ureter with a maximum stone diameter of 12 mm, for
             which general anesthesia will be used.

          -  Subject's physical examination is within normal limits or examination is clinically
             non-significant for purposes of the study as determined by the Investigator, and
             subject is in good general health.

          -  Subject's laboratory evaluations are within normal limits or evaluations are
             clinically non-significant as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential who is using an effective method of birth
             control within at least 14 days prior to surgery and has a negative pregnancy test.

          -  Subject is at minimal risk from anesthesia and is classified according to the American
             Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification as either PS-1 or PS-2.

          -  Subject's body mass index is between 19 and 35, inclusive, based on the Body Mass
             Index Table.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject taking a prohibited medication.

          -  Subject who has had a renal transplant, has a single kidney or has evidence of a
             compromised renal function as measured by abnormal serum creatinine, as judged by the
             Investigator, or who has evidence of urinary tract infection, or has prior history of
             open or laparoscopic surgery, or any history of an ureteral stricture.

          -  Subject who has congenital anomalies that would engender an increased procedural
             safety risk such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction resulting in severely dilated
             renal pelvis, duplicated urinary collecting system, horseshoe kidney or vascular
             anomalies such as renal arteriovenous fistulas or papillary necrosis.

          -  Subject has bilateral renal or ureteral stones requiring concurrent ureteroscopic
             removal.

          -  Subject with clinically significant hypotension at Screening.

          -  Subject who has a present condition or history of any clinically significant
             uncontrolled gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological,
             endocrine, neurological, psychiatric, connective tissue, respiratory or other medical
             disorder as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Subject on chronic diuretic use.

          -  Subject who has taken or used an investigational drug or device within 30 days prior
             to the day of surgery.
