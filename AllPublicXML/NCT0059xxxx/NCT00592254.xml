      The objective of this protocol is to establish a comprehensive screening process to evaluate
      the eligibility of potential adult subjects for appropriate ADHD clinical research studies
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the needs of the large number of adults who contact the Adult ADHD Program at
      Massachusetts General Hospital annually, we have sought approval for several research studies
      aimed at evaluating critical components of the needs of this population. Potential
      participants for those studies present with a widely varied set of complaints not always
      discernable in a telephone screening interview. This state of affairs often makes it
      difficult to ask subjects to sign a specific protocol's consent form without obtaining
      additional clinical information. Because of this, we have potential subjects consent to
      undergo an in-depth clinical assessment that will allow them to be screened by a clinician
      for eligibility to a diverse clinical research program available to them.
