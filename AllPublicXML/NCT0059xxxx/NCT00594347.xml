    <textblock>
      The present study intends to investigate the use as a booster of a dose of sanofi pasteur's
      Pneumo 23 vaccine in the second year of life following 3-dose priming with Wyeth's Prevnar
      vaccine. The researchers will use a cohort of subjects who have received 3 doses of Prevnar®
      at 2, 4, 6 months of age in the context of the clinical study A3L12 on Hexavalent combined
      vaccine (DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T)
