          3. Be correctable to visual acuities of at least 20/25 in each eye with spectacles.

          4. Be in good general health, based on his/her knowledge.

          5. Be able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this protocol and able

          3. Previous refractive surgery; current or previous orthokeratology treatment.

          4. Subject is wearing lenses in a modified monovision modality (multifocal lens in one
             eye). NOTE: subjects may not wear monovision lenses at any time during the study
             unless they are wearing spherical monovision lenses prior to enrollment.

             of the eye, lids, or associated structures.

          8. Ocular or systemic disease or need for medication which might interfere with contact
             lens wear. i.e., Sjögren's syndrome, type II diabetes, etc.

          9. Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear, including but not
             limited to:

               -  History of corneal ulcer, corneal infiltrates or fungal infections.

               -  Pterygium, pinguecula or corneal scars within the visual axis

               -  Pathological dry eye or associated findings (examples: Sjögren's syndrome, lupus
                  erythematosus, sclerodermia)

               -  Seborrheic eczema, seborrheic conjunctivitis

               -  History of papillary conjunctivitis greater than Grade 2 (Mild)

               -  Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present)
