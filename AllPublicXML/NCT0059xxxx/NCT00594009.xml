    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to determine the safety and effectiveness of a mechanical device to
      remove carbon dioxide from the blood of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD)when they are hospitalized in the intensive care unit for exacerbation of their
      condition.

      This is a pilot study to examine the efficacy and safety of an extracorporeal circuit to
      remove carbon dioxide from the blood in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD resulting
      in acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure. The extracorporeal circuit consists of
      venovenous configuration through a percutaneously inserted 18 F double lumen catheter placed
      in a central vein. Centrifugal pump and heparin bonded circuit are used and patient is
      heparinized to maintain an ACT &gt; 180. Circuit blood flow and gas sweep speed will be adjusted
      to maximize CO2 removal and minimize ventilator settings and patient's work of breathing.
      Patients will remain on the extracorporeal circuit for a maximum of four days as tolerated.
      Plasma Hemoglobin will be monitored daily.
