      Hypotheses: 1) Airway pH regulation is abnormal in severe asthma; 2) In severe asthma, there
      is formation of cytotoxic nitrogen oxides and loss of beneficial nitrogen oxides in the
      airways

      Specific Aim 1:Test hypothesis that airway pH regulation is abnormal in severe asthma.

      1a) Determine the effects of systemic corticosteroids on breath pH in children with severe
      and mild to moderate asthma.

      1b) Examine whether breath condensate pH and other biomarkers of oxidant stress can predict
      clinical outcomes in children with severe and mild to moderate asthma.

      1c) Identify whether increased Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, and abnormalities in airway
      glutaminase, G-SNO-reductase, VATPase, and carbonic anhydrase are associated with airway pH
      disturbance in children with severe asthma.

      1d) Test whether rhinovirus infections, which reduce airway pH, persist longer or are more
      frequent in children with severe asthma than in children with mild to moderate asthma.

      1e) Examine the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and proximal airway pH in
      children with severe asthma and mild to moderate asthma.

          <description>Breath condensate pH was measured by the RTube (trademark) device. This device is a plastic tube with a one-way exhalation valve and a chilled aluminum sleeve. pH (the log of hydrogen ion concentration) was measured using an Orion pH meter and probe calibrated in 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 pH solutions.</description>
          <population>225 children with asthma were enrolled in the study and completed baseline assessments. Only 40 children were followed longitudinally. The data from those 40 children are shown here.</population>
