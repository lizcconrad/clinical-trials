  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the dialysis filter AN69ST (Nephral 400
      ST Dialysis Membrane) induces less clotting during hemodialysis than a conventional
      polysulphone filter. Our hypothesis is that the two filters induce the same degree of
      clotting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six consecutive hemodialysis (HD) sessions are evaluated per patient, altogether 10 - 12
      stable HD patients (or at least 48 HD sessions altogether). During these six sessions, AN69ST
      and Fx8 are used on alternate days. Dalteparin is given intravenously as a single bolus dose
      at start of HD (50% of the conventional dose). Clinical clotting is evaluated visually each
      hour of HD after blood draining of the venous air trap: 1=no clot, 2=a fibrinous ring, 3=a
      clot &lt;1 cm, 4=a clot &gt;1 cm and 5=coagulated system (stop in HD).

      Blood specimens are taken at start and after each hour of HD. Markers of coagulation
      (prothrombin 1+2) and of platelets (beta-thromboglobulin) are evaluated as well as anti
      FXa-activity.

      The two filters are going to be compared statistically with respect to the degree of clinical
      clotting and of intravascular coagulation and platelets activation.
