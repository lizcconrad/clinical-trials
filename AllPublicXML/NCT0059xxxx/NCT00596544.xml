  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about sexual problems after treatment for
      ovarian cancer. At this time, we do not know how many women have sexual problems after they
      are treated for ovarian cancer.

      How common are sexual problems after treatment for ovarian cancer?

        -  What factors make women more likely to have sexual problems after treatment for ovarian
           cancer?

        -  What happens to sexual functioning over the first 12 months after treatment? ie.

      Does it get better or worse?

      â€¢ Does referral to a specialized sexual health clinic help?

    <description>will be offered referral to the Sexual Health Clinic (SHC) at MSKCC for evaluation and possible treatment. The effectiveness and compliance of the intervention offered at the SHC will be assessed at approximately 3, 6 and 12 months using the FSFI, SAQ, CES-D, MSC and IES. At each evaluation they will complete a Health Surveillance Form (HSF). They will have completed the study at 12 months after entering the study or at the time they have evidence of recurrent disease requiring treatment</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with any stage of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer who have completed
             frontline therapy within the past 6 months

          -  Women who present to Sexual Health Clinic for the first time and meet all other
             eligibility criteria are eligible. Their FSFI scores will be used to determine the
             primary endpoint of prevalence of sexual dysfunction. If they score over 26 on the
             FSFI, they may still elect to be followed at the SHC.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active secondary cancer requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy at the time enrollment

          -  Evidence of recurrent/persistent disease by elevated CA125, findings on imaging (CT,
             PET scan etc) or physical examination

          -  Women with borderline (low malignant potential) ovarian cancers

          -  Women who are already in active evaluation and/or follow-up at the Sexual Health
