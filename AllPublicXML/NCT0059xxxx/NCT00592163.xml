        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with histological or cytological confirmation of advanced cancer that is
             refractory to standard therapies for their condition.

          2. Men and women of ≥18 years of age.

          3. ECOG performance score ≤2.

          4. Eligible subjects MUST have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST
             guidelines. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its
             neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology. Measurable lesions MUST
             NOT have been in a previously irradiated field or injected with biological agents.
             Eligible subjects with lymphomas must have measurable disease as defined by the
             revised International Working Group response criteria.

          5. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.

          6. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements, to be conducted &lt;2 weeks prior to Baseline:

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR a calculated creatinine
                  clearance ≥50 cc/min

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2 × ULN

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤3 × ULN

               -  Granulocytes in peripheral blood ≥1 × 109/L, hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL, and platelets
                  ≥50,000 /μL

          7. Adequate vascular access for repeated blood sampling.

          8. Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception from
             Screening through the duration of Study participation.

          9. Written informed consent in compliance with ZIOPHARM policies and the Human
             Investigation Review Committee (IEC/IRB) having jurisdiction over the site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class ≥3 myocardial infarction within 6
             months

          2. Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia other than asymptomatic atrial fibrillation; a QTc
             ≥450 msec; or a ≥Grade 2 atrioventricular (AV) block or left bundle branch block
             (LBBB); or documented history of prolonged QTc.

          3. Pregnant and/or lactating women.

          4. Uncontrolled systemic infection (documented with microbiological studies).

          5. Metastatic brain or meningeal tumors.

          6. Subjects with seizure disorder requiring medication (such as anti-epileptics).

          7. History of confusion or dementia or neurological condition that could mask a potential
             adverse response to the Study Drug, which may include transient ischemic attack,
             Parkinson's disease, thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimers, and other
             neurological disorders.

          8. Anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy during the study or within 4 weeks of Study
             entry (mitomycin C or nitrosureas should not be given within 6 weeks of Study entry).

          9. Radiotherapy during study or within 3 weeks of Study entry.

         10. Surgery within 4 weeks of start of Study Drug dosing.

         11. Investigational drug therapy outside of this trial during or within 4 weeks of Study
             entry.

         12. History of invasive second primary malignancy diagnosed within the previous 3 years
             except for Stage I endometrial/cervical carcinoma or prostate carcinoma treated
             surgically, and non-melanoma skin cancer.

         13. Substance abuse, medical, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with
             the subject's participation in the study or evaluation of Study results.

         14. Any condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the subject and
             his/her compliance in the Study.

         15. Arsenic allergy.
