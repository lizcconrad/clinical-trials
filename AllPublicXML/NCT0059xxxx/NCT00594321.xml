      The objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the SPACE 360 Delivery System using SPACE
      CpsXL Bone Cement compared to standard vertebroplasty in the treatment of pathological
      fractures of the spine caused by metastatic tumors of the spine, myeloma, or lymphoma. Up to
      a total of three levels per patient may be included or five levels for multiple myeloma. The
      control group will be standard vertebroplasty.

      The primary endpoint is cement leakage as determined radiographically (CT). will be cement
      leakage measured by CT. Secondary endpoints are reduction of pain (VAS) and quality of life
      measurements (Oswestry disability index).
