        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with a breast mass highly suspicious for malignancy from clinical,
             mammographic or sonographic examination.

          -  The study has been explained to the patient when she is scheduled for surgery.

          -  Healthy normal volunteers for imaging protocol optimization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Patients with implanted surgical clips (hemostatic clips) or other ferromagnetic
             material,

          -  Patients engaged in occupations or activities which may cause accidental lodging of
             ferromagnetic materials, or who may have imbedded metal fragments from military
             activities,

          -  Patients with metallic implants, because they may cause artifacts in diagnostic images
             due to magnetic field distortion,

          -  Patients with implanted prosthetic heart valves,

          -  Patients with pacemakers, neuro-stimulation devices,

          -  A breast mass with features of benign tumor

          -  The patients unwilling to participate in the study or fail to sign the consent form
