    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare non-operative treatment versus operative treatment in
      patients who suffer a complete, acute acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation. This study
      will show if one method is superior to the other and will also show advantages and
      disadvantages associated with each treatment method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients presenting to the hospital with a Type III, IV or V acute acromioclavicular (AC)
      joint dislocation and meeting the eligibility criteria will be approached and asked to enter
      this prospective, randomized clinical trial. After obtaining consent, the subject will be
      managed in accordance with one of the two randomized treatment strategies. The first
      treatment strategy will involve conservative (nonoperative) management of the AC joint
      dislocation. The second treatment strategy will involve operative fixation (i.e. ORIF) of the
      dislocation with a hook plate and screws.

      The subjects in both treatment groups will receive post-operative care according to the same
      standards and protocol. The surgeon and research staff will be responsible for study
      follow-up (clinical and radiological assessment) of the patient on admission (baseline), on
      discharge from the hospital and at post-operative intervals of six weeks, three months, six
      months, one year and two years. Primary and secondary outcomes will be monitored at these
      post-operative intervals.

    <description>Definitive surgical treatment (i.e., ORIF) will be performed within 28 days of the injury. In all cases the procedure will be performed by an orthopedic staff surgeon with the assistance of a fellow/resident(s). The operating surgeon will determine the positioning of the patient for surgery. ORIF of the AC joint dislocation will be carried out as follows:
