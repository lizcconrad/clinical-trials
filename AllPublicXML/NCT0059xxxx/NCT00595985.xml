  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib as second
      line treatment in patients with Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (A/MGC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, although FU based, cisplatin based and taxane based regimen, and ECF regimen have
      been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA, there is no standard regimen for
      patients with A/MGC as second line treatment. Based on the promising results of sorafenib in
      primary hepatic carcinoma and renal cancer, we design this clinical trial to evaluate the
      efficacy, time to progression and overall survival of sorafenib for A/MGC patients as a
      second line treatment.
