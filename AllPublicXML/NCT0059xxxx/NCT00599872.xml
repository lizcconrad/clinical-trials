      The purpose of this study is to determine an effective dose range for the administration of
      ragweed allergenic extract via the sublingual route of administration
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific allergen immunotherapy as currently practiced in the USA and described in product
      labeling comprises the subcutaneous injection of incrementally increasing doses to a targeted
      maintenance dose (&quot;build-up&quot;) followed by maintenance injections of allergenic
      extract/vaccine. Up to 30-40 injections may be required during the build-up phase over a 3-6
      month period. When adequate maintenance doses are reached, this form of immunotherapy (SCIT)
      has been shown to be highly effective and safe.

      Standard practices recommend that the injections be given under the supervision of trained
      physicians and that the patient remain in the physician's office at least 20 to 30 minutes
      after an injection. The administration of immunotherapy injections are not recommended at
      home because of the risk of inadequate recognition and treatment of systemic reactions. The
      inconvenience and expense of traveling for allergy injections and the discomfort of the
      repeated injections is a disincentive to this form of treatment particularly in pediatric
      patients. For example, dropout rates exceeding 50% over a multi-year course of injection
      treatment have been reported.

      Alternative routes for immunotherapy have been explored, especially in Europe in an attempt
      to improve patient compliance and to minimize the risk of serious adverse reactions. For
      example, sublingual-oral immunotherapy (SLIT), which is the administration of the allergenic
      extract/vaccine under the tongue for 1-2 minutes followed by swallowing, has been proven to
      be efficacious and safe in several double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. A recent
      Cochrane Review concluded, &quot;SLIT is a safe treatment, which significantly reduces symptoms
      and medication requirements in allergic rhinitis.&quot;

      Efficacy studies support the use of SLIT for the treatment of rhinitis or rhinitis and
      asthma. However, dosage schedules are highly variable and optimal maintenance doses have not
      yet been established. Thus, dosing studies should be designed to investigate not only the
      safety profile but to determine optimal doses for maintenance therapy of patients built-up by
      injection IT and for build-up regimens of previously untreated patients.

      Much of the United States medical community's hesitation to embrace sublingual immunotherapy
      as a viable treatment option for allergy patients has stemmed from limited information using
      U.S. licensed allergenic extracts for this treatment route. Additionally, the
      cost-effectiveness of one form of therapy over the other has not been clearly evaluated and
      the third-party payers have not accepted SLIT for insurance coverage.

    <measure>Scores on a Scale (Average of Daily Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score (RSS) Recorded During the Ragweed Season</measure>
    <time_frame>Ragweed pollen season, 08/01/08 to 10/30/08, approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom score defined as sum of scores from eight symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe): ocular (itchiness, swelling/redness, and watery eyes/tears), nasal (sneezing, itching, runny and stuffy nose), and ears (itching). Average daily RSS ranged from 0-48; A lower score was more favorable.
The average daily RSS was computed for each subject by: (1) summing the 8 individual allergy symptoms recorded in the morning (AM RSS) and the evening (PM RSS); (2) forming the daily RSS by summing the AM RSS and the PM RSS for each day of the ragweed season; (3) averaging the daily RSS for the entire ragweed pollen season.</description>

    <description>Symptom score defined as sum of scores from eight symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe): ocular (itchiness, swelling/redness, and watery eyes/tears), nasal (sneezing, itching, runny and stuffy nose), and ears (itching). Average daily RSS ranged from 0-48; A lower score was more favorable.
The average daily RSS was computed for each subject by: (1) summing the 8 individual allergy symptoms recorded in the morning (AM RSS) and the evening (PM RSS); (2) forming the daily RSS by summing the AM RSS and the PM RSS for each day of the ragweed season; (3) averaging the daily RSS for the entire ragweed pollen season.
The highest pollen count week was defined as the 7 contiguous days from the series with the largest average pollen count, and in which the weekly average was computed using at least 4 non-missing daily RSS values (either AM or PM could be present to be considered a valid daily RSS value).</description>

    <time_frame>Ragweed pollen season 08/01/08 to 10/30/08</time_frame>
    <description>The average daily RSS during the ragweed season for each of the 3 organ systems (ocular, nasal, ears) were separately analyzed to evaluate these individual components of the RSS. Three separate baseline average daily RSS values were computed for this analysis. The modified ITT population was used for this analysis. The range for scores: 0 to 3 for each of eight symptom or a total of 0 to 24 daily RSS. A lower score was more favorable.</description>

    <measure>Scores on a Scale (Total Allergy Relief Medication Score During the Ragweed Season) for Each Subject</measure>
    <time_frame>Ragweed pollen season 08/01/08 to 10/30/08</time_frame>
    <description>Total allergy relief medication score during the ragweed season for each subject. This score is computed for each subject by summing their individual medication scores (excluding beta-agonist use) for the entire ragweed season. High scores were indicative of poor symptom relief from the study medication. The associated relief medication scores assigned to medication are 0-if no medication taken; 3 for each one antihistamine tablet taken; 1 for each 2 antihistamine eye drop administrations, 1 for each 2 antihistamine nasal spray administrations and 1 for each puff of beta-agonist. The maximum medication score was dependent on the cumulative rescue medication use. The lower result the more favorable.</description>

        <description>Symptom score defined as sum of scores from eight symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe): ocular (itchiness, swelling/redness, and watery eyes/tears), nasal (sneezing, itching, runny and stuffy nose), and ears (itching). Average daily RSS ranged from 0-48; A lower score was more favorable.
The average daily RSS was computed for each subject by: (1) summing the 8 individual allergy symptoms recorded in the morning (AM RSS) and the evening (PM RSS); (2) forming the daily RSS by summing the AM RSS and the PM RSS for each day of the ragweed season; (3) averaging the daily RSS for the entire ragweed pollen season.</description>

The highest pollen count week was defined as the 7 contiguous days from the series with the largest average pollen count, and in which the weekly average was computed using at least 4 non-missing daily RSS values (either AM or PM could be present to be considered a valid daily RSS value).</description>

          <description>Symptom score defined as sum of scores from eight symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe): ocular (itchiness, swelling/redness, and watery eyes/tears), nasal (sneezing, itching, runny and stuffy nose), and ears (itching). Average daily RSS ranged from 0-48; A lower score was more favorable.
The average daily RSS was computed for each subject by: (1) summing the 8 individual allergy symptoms recorded in the morning (AM RSS) and the evening (PM RSS); (2) forming the daily RSS by summing the AM RSS and the PM RSS for each day of the ragweed season; (3) averaging the daily RSS for the entire ragweed pollen season.
The highest pollen count week was defined as the 7 contiguous days from the series with the largest average pollen count, and in which the weekly average was computed using at least 4 non-missing daily RSS values (either AM or PM could be present to be considered a valid daily RSS value).</description>

        <description>Total allergy relief medication score during the ragweed season for each subject. This score is computed for each subject by summing their individual medication scores (excluding beta-agonist use) for the entire ragweed season. High scores were indicative of poor symptom relief from the study medication. The associated relief medication scores assigned to medication are 0-if no medication taken; 3 for each one antihistamine tablet taken; 1 for each 2 antihistamine eye drop administrations, 1 for each 2 antihistamine nasal spray administrations and 1 for each puff of beta-agonist. The maximum medication score was dependent on the cumulative rescue medication use. The lower result the more favorable.</description>
