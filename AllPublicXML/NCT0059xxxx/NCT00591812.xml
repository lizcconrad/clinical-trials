      Patients in this study require a replacement of a lower thighbone and knee joint. A new
      device, called the ComPreSs, will be used in this study to replace the lower thighbone. This
      new device has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There is not
      enough data to assure that it is as good as other devices currently available. Taking part in
      this study will help provide data to the FDA. Other devices used to replace large pieces of
      bone and joints in the leg can result in damage to the bone over time. The bone damage can
      cause the device to come loose from the bone. This is a bad problem, and causes pain, and
      often more surgery is needed. This new device connects to the bone in a different way to
      prevent some of the problems seen with other devices. The new device protects the bone, and
      may help the replacement last longer. So far, the device has been used in over 50 patients on
      a selective basis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with bone tumors of the distal femur requiring primary bone resection of up
             to 30 cm with the resection at or below the lesser trochanter.

          -  Patients with prior orthopaedic oncologic conditions requiring revisions of distal
             femoral replacement devices with a total replacement height of 30 cm or less and the
             resection level is at or below the lesser trochanter.

          -  Patients who have a cortical bone thickness of 2.5 mm or larger in the region where
             the ComPreSs device would be implanted.

          -  Patients diagnosed with a bone tumor classified as Stage 1A, IB, IIA, IIB, or III by
             Enneking's classification system. (See section 12.0, #7)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active infection.

          -  Patients who are unable to return for follow-up examinations.

          -  Patients who have cortical bone thickness less than 2.5 mm in the region where the
             ComPreSs device would be implanted.

          -  Patients who are unwilling or incapable of following postoperative care instructions.

          -  Patients requiring bilateral knee implants.

          -  Patients with evidence of vascular insufficiency (arterial and/or venous).

          -  Patients having Parkinson's disease, severe muscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease in
             the affected limb.

          -  Patients with prior irradiated bone.

          -  Patients with metastatic cancer including carcinoma, melanoma, myeloma, lymphoma,
             leukemia.

          -  Patients with pathologic soft tissue or skeletal conditions that would prevent secure
             fixation of the device in the bone.
