  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reported normal values used in diagnosing and treating pediatric kidney stone formers are
      based on adult values or historic data from small studies. Urinary supersaturation indices
      which are now described in the adult stone literature as more sensitive predictors of stone
      composition, and precise predictors of response to therapy, are not established in children.
      The goals of this prospective study are to redefine normal values for pediatric urinary
      metabolites and supersaturation indices based on samples from a large number of healthy
      children and to identify if a difference in urinary supersaturations in children is
      protective.

        All normal, healthy volunteer children between the ages of 3 and 18, inclusive, with no
        personal or first relative family history of urolithiasis. Both boys and girls will be
        enrolled with an effort to enroll an equal number of children of all ages after toilet
        training.
