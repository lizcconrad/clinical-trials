      The purpose of this project is to further characterize inherited predisposition to breast
      cancer mediated by specific BRCA alleles (BRACA1 185delAG and 5382insC; BRCA2 6174delT) among
      Jewish women.

        A list of Jewish women diagnosed with breast cancer at Memorial Hospital after January 1994
        will be generated from the hospital database. Patients that meet the study criteria will
        have a letter sent to their oncologist asking permission to invite the patient to
        participate in a study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are eligible for the study if they are over 18 years of age, identify their
             ancestry as Jewish (both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews are eligible), have or have had
             a diagnosis of breast cancer, and are able to give informed consent.

          -  Relatives, age 18 or older, of the patients who meet eligibility criteria above and
             are found to have a specific BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation if they are able to give informed
