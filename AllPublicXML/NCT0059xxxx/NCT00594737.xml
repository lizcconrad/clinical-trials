  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memantine has been approved for use in Alzheimer's disease. Its mechanism of action raises
      questions of whether it can also be effective for non-Alzheimer's dementias such as
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which currently has no disease-modifying treatment.

      This is an open-label study to probe the effects of memantine in 15 outpatients diagnosed
      with FTD, as shown objectively by comparing PET scans performed before and after use of the
      medication. The specific type of PET scan, FDG-PET, allows the investigators to gauge the
      effects of memantine on cortical activity levels. The investigators hypothesize that subjects
      on memantine will show normalization of cortical metabolic activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must meet criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD) by Neary et al.
             criteria. 28 Subjects may have either the behavioural or the aphasic variant of FTD.

          -  Able to undergo psychometric testing.

          -  Must have reliable informant with daily contact with patient

          -  May be taking concurrent psychotropic medications, but must be on stable dosing
             regimen for 3 months prior to trial enrollment

          -  On the basis of a physical examination, medical history (including psychiatric and
             neurological), and results of blood chemistry carried out at screening visit, the
             patient in the investigator's opinion is considered healthy.

          -  Signed Informed Consent must be obtained from the patient or legally responsible
             representative and the informant prior to initiating any study specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Complaint of recurrent or persistent dizziness or constipation

          -  Abnormal chemistry panel particular with respect to ruling out renal insufficiency or
             failure. We will exclude those patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) &lt; 50ml/min,
             per the Sakana equations for men and women.

          -  Angina, myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, severe cardiac arrhythmia,
             unstable diabetes mellitus, or new abnormalities on EKG within the past year.

          -  Any current malignancy, or any clinically significant hematological, endocrine, renal,
             hepatic, gastrointestinal or non-dementia neurological disease. If the condition has
             been stable for at least the past year and is judged by the investigators not to
             interfere with the patient's participation in the study, the patient may be included.
             Basal cell carcinoma is an exception.

          -  Non-English speaking, as cognitive tests will be in English.

          -  Evidence of other neurological or psychiatric disorders which preclude diagnosis of
             FTD (including, but not limited to, stroke, Parkinson's disease, any psychotic
             disorder, severe bipolar or unipolar depression) within the past year

          -  Current or prior history of uncontrolled seizure disorder, due to seizures reported as
             adverse events with memantine.

          -  Patients with suspected alcohol or substance abuse within last 1 year. If past history
             of abuse or dependence must have been abstinent for 1 year with continuing progression
             of dementia despite abstinence.

          -  Patients with active delusions or hallucinations at the time of screening.

          -  Female patients who are not at least two years post-menopausal or surgically sterile.
             Pre-menopausal women will be excluded; because almost all women are post-menopausal at
             the age of onset of FTD, we do not anticipate having to exclude more than one
             potential subject on the basis of this one exclusion criterion.

          -  Use of investigational drugs or participation in another investigational drug study
             within 3 months of screening.

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with memantine or have participated in an
             investigational study with memantine.

          -  Patients with history of severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity or known
             hypersensitivity to amantadine or memantine.
