    <textblock>
      This study investigated the safety and efficacy of different gene therapy approaches for
      Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by the deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA)
      enzyme. This is a severe condition that can be cured by HLA-matched sibling donor bone marrow
      transplantation. Patients were enrolled if no HLA-identical sibling donor was available and
      the patient showed evidence of failure of enzyme replacement therapy or this treatment was
      not a long-term available option. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the procedure and to identify the relative role of peripheral blood lymphocytes
      and hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells in the long-term reconstitution of immune
      functions after retroviral vector mediated ADA gene transfer.

      This is mono-centric, non-randomized, non-controlled, open label, phase I-II trial that
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of ADA gene transfer into somatic cells for the treatment
      of ADA-SCID
