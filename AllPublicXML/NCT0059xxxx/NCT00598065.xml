      The purpose of this study is to see if researchers can improve the detection of lung cancer
      by using a new method which will help us to take multiple snapshot images of the lungs while
      the patient is breathing. We are also investigating whether with the help of this new method
      we can better measure the actual amount of radioactivity that is taken up by the cancer. The
      name of this new method is respiratory gated PET/CT. Previous research has shown that PET
      scans may be useful in investigating whether cancer has spread to other parts of the lung or
      body. Using our standard method, smaller cancers are sometimes difficult to detect in the
      lungs because the PET images are taken over several minutes and the patient is breathing
      during that time. That means the cancer may appear &quot;blurred&quot; on the images (like a poor
      photograph) or may not be identified at all. In this study, in addition to the images that
      were ordered by your doctor, we will take additional images of your lungs while you are
      following a breathing command (&quot;breath in-hold-breath out&quot;). We will then compare the images
      of your cancer during the regular PET study with those taken during the breathing commands.

      The hypotheses to be tested in this pilot study are:

        1. Respiratory gated image acquisition reduces partial volume effects on PET image that may
           render lung lesions undetectable.

        2. Breath-hold CT may detect small lung lesions that are beyond the limit of detection in
           shallow-breathing CT scans, related to respiratory motion which causes blurring
           artifacts around smaller lung lesions.

      Positron emission tomography is now a clinically accepted imaging modality for the evaluation
      of pulmonary nodules as well as for the staging of patients with lung cancer. PET imaging
      with the radiotracer 18 Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) has a high accuracy for the
      differentiation between benign and malignant lung lesions and for the detection of nodal
      metastases. This is because malignant tumors are characterized by an increase in glucose
      metabolism as compared to most normal tissues. In clinical practice, PET images are
      interpreted visually or semiquantitatively, using a standardized uptake value (SUV). Previous
      studies have shown that SUV thresholds can be used with high accuracy to distinguish between
      benign and malignant lesions that exhibit increased uptake of FDG. In addition, the SUV is
      frequently used as a surrogate marker for the evaluation of a response to chemo- or radiation
      therapy. Unfortunately, the accuracy of SUV measurements may be affected by lesion motion
      during the image acquisition. This is a particular problem in PET imaging of the lung. Normal
      respiratory motion, and hence lesion motion, causes a smearing effect, whereby the
      concentration of radiotracer within a given lesion is spread out over a larger area. For the
      same reason small lesions and lesions with relatively low uptake of radiotracer may become
      undetectable during normal breathing (partial volume effect). PET images are acquired for
      several minutes, image acquisition during breath hold is therefore not an option for clinical
      scans. However recently published work from UCLA (Auerbach et al. J Nucl Med., February 2006)
      shows that 3 lesions per patient on average can be missed on shallow breathing scans compared
      to breath-hold CT scans. These lesions did not show any FDG uptake on clinical PET scans. The
      goal of this pilot study is to evaluate whether respiratory gating during PET image
      acquisition enables the detection of those lesions which are identified during the
      breath-hold CT scan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years old

          -  Patients must have at least one lung lesion or lung cancer on prior chest Xray or
             chest CT.

          -  Sign informed consent. Eligible patients should give their consent at the beginning of
             the clinical PET scan. Following clinical CT and PET scans, breathhold CT should
             follow. Then, these breath-hold CT images will be reviewed by one of the investigating
             physicians to determine if the patient qualifies for the study. If there is a small
             lesion (&lt; 5 mm) gated PET images will be acquired.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women are ineligible.

          -  Patients who are unable to follow breathing instructions either due to language
             difficulties or hearing impairment This will be determined by one of the consenting
             individuals when they approach the patient to ask for informed consent.

          -  Patients who are too ill to hold their breath.
