  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder in which multiple potential inflammatory pathways
      contribute to airway obstruction. The biological basis for airway inflammation is the subject
      of intensive investigation. This work is designed to identify airway factors that are
      responsible for recruiting cells and associate their airway presence with atopy and asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The production of chemotactic cytokines or chemokines by the airways is one of the mechanisms
      thought to be responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airways (Makay
      2001). While the chemokine receptor-ligand systems responsible for immune cell homing to the
      mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract have been clarified, those responsible for
      allergic airway inflammation remain unknown. This work is designed to identify airway factors
      that are responsible for recruiting cells and associate their airway presence with atopy and
      asthma.

    <intervention_name>Bronchoscopy, Segmental Allergen Challenge, and Broncheoalveolar Lavage</intervention_name>
    <description>Bronchoalveolar lavage is performed in the lingula without instillation of diluent or allergen. A 2ml aliquot of diluent is instilled into the right upper lobe. The procedure is repeated in the right middle lobe with instillation of 2ml of Cat or Mite allergen. A test dose of allergen is administered first. This will consist of 2ml allergen at 1/10th the threshold concentration for Cat or DF Mite Allergen or at 1/30th the threshold concentration for DP Mite Allergen. If on visual inspection through the bronchoscope there is no evidence of reaction to the test dose, a 2nd allergen challenge is done in the right middle lobe using 2ml of full-dose allergen. After a 1,6, or 24hr recovery period, a single 2nd bronchoscopy is performed after delivery of allergen extract and diluent and 1 Tbsp of blood is obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage will be obtained from the lobes in which the diluent and allergen were instilled. OFDI and endobronchial brushing of the airways will also be performed.</description>
