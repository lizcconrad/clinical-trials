    <textblock>
      The proposed project will apply a unique, effective family-responsive psychoeducation
      program, PsychoEducation Responsive to Families (PERF), for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
      treatment. The goal is to demonstrate that the intervention will enlarge the eligibility of
      some patients for HCV treatment and help sustain others through it.

      This study aims to evaluate the utility of a psychosocial intervention (PsychoEducation
      Responsive to Families; PERF), applied to help patients prepare for and sustain HCV treatment
      in the treatment setting. Through careful psychiatric diagnosis and multiple longitudinal
      assessments, this study will also shed further light on the course of comorbid alcohol use,
      drug use, and other psychiatric syndromes and their interrelationships. The proposed study
      combines an innovative psychoeducation program with traditional HCV patient care and
      education. The goal of this work is to improve treatment adherence, allowing individual drug
      regimens to achieve their optimal effectiveness and reach a wider patient population. Support
      and sustenance of patients from a psychosocial perspective while they are in treatment should
      also help deliver more patients to sustained suppression of HCV as well as help presently
      untreated patients and populations become candidates for this therapyâ€”ultimately reducing the
      disease burden of increasing numbers of patients needing liver transplantation or facing
      imminent death.
