        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease: Histologically proven Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia/MMM defined as
             per the Italian Consensus Conference on MMM diagnosis with either primary MMM or
             secondary to Polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia with

               -  &quot;intermediate risk&quot; or &quot;high risk&quot; score according to the Lille Scoring System

               -  OR &quot;low risk&quot; score according to the Lille Scoring System with constitutional
                  symptoms (fever, night sweat, weight loss &gt; 5% of body weight)

               -  OR &quot;high risk&quot; score according to the Cervantes score

          -  Age:

               -  Patients between 50 and 70 years of age and no limited life expectancy for other
                  reasons than MMM

               -  Patients under 50 years of age who are not eligible for a standard myeloablative
                  conditioning, (e.g., because of prior autologous stem cell, history of severe
                  infections like fungal infections, history of cardiac toxicity or other reasons
                  according to the treating physician)

          -  HLA compatible or identical donor, related or unrelated (one mismatch allowed)

          -  Written informed consent of the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive search for bcr-abl on blood.

          -  Serious irreversible renal, hepatic, pulmonary or cardiac disease

          -  Central nervous involvement

          -  Positive serology for HIV

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Patients with a life-expectancy of less than six months because of another
             debilitating disease

          -  Serious psychiatric or psychological disorders
