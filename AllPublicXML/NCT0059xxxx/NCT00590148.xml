    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the FIM™ as a measure of daily function in children
      with sickle cell disease hospitalized with vasoocclusive pain. Currently, the standard for
      pain assessment is a rating of pain intensity, as determined by observation (for younger
      children) or self-report (for older children and adolescents). However, these measures of
      pain intensity are not effective in recurrent or chronic pain states, and in sickle cell
      disease in particular. Pediatric patients who are hospitalized with vasoocclusive pain often
      do not report a decrease in pain intensity; however, other indications of clinical status,
      such as ambulation, less use of opiates from the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump,
      increased food intake, and transition to oral pain medication, signify that the patient may
      be improving. As a result of our inability to get an accurate picture of the patients'
      condition, we would like to have a summary of improvement that would reflect these changes in
      clinical status and reflect the reduced impact of sickle cell pain on the patient's life. In
      this study, we plan to evaluate a standardized functional assessment measure in pediatric
      patients with sickle cell disease. It is hypothesized that FIM™ scores will correlate with
      other indicators of clinical status, such as movement, quality of sleep, use of IV opiates
      from the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, and use of intravenous vs. oral pain
      medications. It is also hypothesized that the FIM™ will demonstrate adequate responsiveness
      to change in functional status within a 3-7 day hospitalization by a progressive increase in
      scores and associations with other indicators of clinical improvement.
