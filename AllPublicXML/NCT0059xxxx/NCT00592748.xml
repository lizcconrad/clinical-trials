      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if the administration of a higher dose
      would decrease the chance of tumor recurrence, compared to the risk of tumor recurrence with
      a lower dose. Most of the treatment will be given protons, but participants may receive a
      small portion of treatment with x-rays, because less radiation is given to the skin with
      x-rays. This study uses two slightly different doses of radiation It is not clear at this
      time which of the dose levels is better.

      -  Participants will be assigned to a dose level by random chance, like flipping a coin.

        -  A treatment plan will be determined by a treatment planning CT scan and will either
           involve 40-44 treatments or 37-40 treatments.
