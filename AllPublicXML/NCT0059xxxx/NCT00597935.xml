  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is common among women with a prevalence that has been estimated to be
      as high as 30%. Pelvic organ prolapse often involves a combination of support defects
      involving the anterior, posterior and/or apical vaginal segments. While the anterior vaginal
      wall is the segment most likely to demonstrate recurrent prolapse after reconstructive
      surgery, reoperations are highest among those who require apical suspension procedures with
      or without repair of other vaginal segments (12%-33%). Despite the substantial health impact,
      there is a paucity of high quality evidence to support different practices in the management
      of prolapse, particularly surgery. Thus, the objectives of the Operations and Pelvic Muscle
      Training in the Management of Apical Support Loss (OPTIMAL) Trial are:

        1. to compare sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) to uterosacral vaginal vault ligament
           suspension (ULS); and

        2. to assess the role of perioperative behavioral therapy/pelvic muscle training (PMT) in
           women undergoing vaginal surgery for apical or uterine prolapse and stress urinary
           incontinence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stage 2 to 4 prolapse

          -  Prolapse of the vaginal apex or cervix to at least half way into the vaginal canal
             (POPQ Point C &gt; -TVL/2)

          -  Vaginal bulge symptoms as indicated by an affirmative response to either questions on
             the PFDI

          -  Vaginal surgery for prolapse is planned, including a vaginal apical suspension
             procedure.
