  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to determine the activity of erlotinib in a rationally selected
      population of women with ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2/neu-negative, EGFR-positive breast
      cancer. If erlotinib is shown to have activity, this could identify a form of targeted
      therapy for this specific subset of breast cancer patients. In addition, it may identify a
      subset of breast cancer patients with tumors that overexpress EGFR in whom other EGFR
      targeted therapies could warrant further testing.

      This is a Phase II, open-label, single institution trial of treatment with single agent
      erlotinib. The purpose of the research is to determine the effects erlotinib has on the
      breast cancer tumors in women with metastatic hormone receptor negative and HER2-negative
      breast cancer. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has approved erlotinib, also known as
      Tarceva, for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      To qualify for the trial, subjects must have histologically confirmed, incurable, locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is ER-negative, PR-negative, Her2/neu-negative and
      EGFR-positive. Subjects must have measurable disease. They must have received less than or
      equal to 1 chemotherapeutic agent in the metastatic setting. The target accrual is 43
      subjects. Initially, 18 subjects will be accrued. If at least 3 subjects are progression-free
      at 4 months, accrual will continue to a maximum of 43 subjects. Subject eligibility will be
      evaluated during a screening period of 4 weeks. During the treatment period, subjects will
      receive single agent erlotinib, 150mg/day. Subjects will receive the first dose of erlotinib
      on Day 0, within 7 days of registration. Efficacy will be assessed by radiographic tumor
      assessment or photographic documentation. Safety will be assessed by the recording of adverse
      events and laboratory test results. Subjects with documented progressive disease will be
      discontinued from treatment and will be followed for survival information every 2 months
      until death, lost to follow-up or study termination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Verbal and written informed consent to participate in the study.

          2. Women greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          3. Histologically documented metastatic or locally advanced, incurable breast cancer with
             a tumor block available

          4. Less than or equal to 1 prior chemotherapy for metastatic or locally unresectable
             disease.

          5. Prior treatment with anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy, either in the adjuvant or
             metastatic setting

          6. Measurable disease on CT or PET scan or physical exam Disease at a previously
             irradiated site is considered measurable if there is clear evidence of disease
             progression following radiation therapy.

          7. ER-negative, PR-negative and HER2-neu-negative. Estrogen and progesterone status will
             be defined by immunohistochemistry. Her2/neu status will be considered negative if the

             chromosome 17 is approximately 1. This will be done by FISH (fluorescent in-situ
             hybridization) testing.

          8. EGFR-positive defined as strong membrane staining in greater than 10% of tumor cells
             by immuno-histochemistry (Dako).

          9. Pre- or post-menopausal.

         10. ECOG performance status of 0 - 2.

             neurologically stable after treatment for brain metastases and have been off steroids
             for greater than or equal to 4 weeks.

          4. Radiotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy within 21 days prior to
             registration.

          5. Prior treatment with an agent that targets the EGFR or the EGFR-specific tyrosine
             kinase activity.

          6. Unstable systemic disease, including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months
             prior to Day 0, or serious cardiac arrhythmias requiring medication.

          7. Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant traumatic injury
             occurring within 21 days prior to Day 0.

          8. History of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examinations findings, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications.

          9. Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or
             active peptic ulcer disease.

         10. Pregnancy or lactation. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test is required for women
             of child-bearing potential during screening and within 7 - 10 days of Day 1 of Cycle 1
             of erlotinib (TarcevoÂ®)administration. Men and premenopausal women of child bearing
             potential will follow an approved, medically accepted birth control regimen while
             taking erlotinib and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug.
