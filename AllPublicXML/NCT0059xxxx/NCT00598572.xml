  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal studies show that the breakdown of blood results in iron accumulation in the brain
      after brain hemorrhage (ICH); and that iron plays a role in brain injury in ICH patients.
      Deferoxamine (DFO) has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than 30 years to
      remove excessive iron from the body, and has been shown to provide some benefit in animal
      studies of ICH. Therefore, we plan to undertake this study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of treatment with DFO in patients with ICH, and to determine the maximal
      tolerated dose to be used in future studies to determine if treatment with DFO can improve
      the outcome of patients with ICH.

      Our main objectives are: 1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of varying doses of DFO,
      by determining the treatment related adverse events, in patients with ICH; and 2) to
      determine the maximal tolerated dose to be adopted in subsequent studies to test the efficacy
      of DFO in improving outcome after ICH.

      We hypothesize that DFO is well-tolerated and has minimal serious adverse effects in patients
      with ICH; and that treatment with DFO will improve patients' outcome. The results can
      potentially bring into account new means to improve the outcome of patients with ICH. ICH is
      a frequent cause of disability and death. A successful study demonstrating the efficacy of
      iron-modifying therapy would be of considerable public health significance.

          2. The diagnosis of ICH is confirmed by brain CT scan.

          3. The first dose of the study drug can be administered within 18 hours of ICH symptom
             onset.

          4. Signed and dated informed consent is obtained

          5. Stable clinical and neurological status. Patients whose clinical or neurological
             status significantly deteriorates compared to presentation prior to administration of
             the study drug will be excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous chelation therapy or known hypersensitivity to DFO products

          2. Abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl)

          3. Known severe iron deficiency anemia

          4. Planned surgical evacuation of ICH prior to administration of the study drug

          5. Patients with suspected secondary ICH related to tumour, coagulopathy, ruptured
             aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, or venous sinus thrombosis

          6. Evidence of significant shift of midline brain structure (&gt; 10 mm) or herniation on
             imaging studies.

          7. Deep coma (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) = 3-5) upon presentation

          8. Taking iron supplements or prochlorperazine

         15. Any condition which, in the judgement of the investigator, might increase the risk to
             the patient

         16. Life expectancy of less than 90 days due to co-morbid conditions

         17. Concurrent participation in another research protocol for investigation of another
