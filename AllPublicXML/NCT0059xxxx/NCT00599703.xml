  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use an imaging method called functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) in patients who have a tumor near an area of the brain that is believed to
      control language. The fMRI is a new kind of imaging that uses a strong magnetic field to look
      at functioning brain tissue. This kind of imaging will be used to study the effect of the
      brain tumor on your speech.
