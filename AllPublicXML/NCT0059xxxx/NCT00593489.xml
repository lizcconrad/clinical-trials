      Family Physicians, the subjects of this trial are reluctant to initiate insulin in patients
      with type 2 diabetes due to a lack of familiarity and comfort with this clinical strategy.
      This study will test the effectiveness of diabetes specialist consultation support, and
      community pharmacy insulin initiation support on the insulin prescribing behaviour of family
      physicians across Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2003 Canadian Diabetes Association clinical practice guidelines recommend early and
      sustained glycemic control targeting an A1C &lt; 7%. The guideline target however is not
      achieved in 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes in the Canadian family practice setting.
      Family physicians are not comfortable initiating and managing insulin for their patients the
      DICE study5 found that only 12% of the 2473 patients audited were prescribed insulin; 6%
      insulin alone and 6% in combination. Harris et. al. found 20% of patients prescribed insulin,
      15% insulin alone and 5% in combination. A strategy to increase physicians' knowledge, skill
      and comfort with insulin prescription is needed to better achieve glycemic control for
      patients with type 2 diabetes in Canada.

      Purpose - The purpose of AIM@GP is to increase family physicians clinical experience and
      comfort with insulin prescription and better achieve glycemic control for patients with type
      2 diabetes in Canada.

      Primary Objective - To determine the effectiveness of a Basal Insulin Initiation strategy on
      family physician insulin prescribing behaviour. The strategy, using a multifaceted behaviour
      facilitation approach, includes diabetes specialist consultation support, and community
      pharmacy insulin initiation support.

      Study Design - The study design is a stratified, parallel group, randomized control
      effectiveness study. All physicians will attend an insulin education workshop where they will
      receive a Diabetes Practice Profile and randomly allocated in a 1:1 manner into the
      intervention or control group.

    <description>This multifaceted intervention consists of (1) Diabetes Specialist Consultation Support which entails specialists and educators providing consultation for insulin initiation and titration for the 12 months following the Workshop. Support will consist of prearranged and scheduled communications to review and advise for the first 2 months and will continue on an ad hoc basis for the remaining 10 months, with communication initiated by the physician (2)Community Pharmacy Insulin Initiation consists of trained community pharmacists providing patient education insulin initiation. Education will consist of one individual teaching session, one hour in duration, to review the insulin prescription protocol, insulin injection method, management of hypoglycemia, and self-monitoring of blood glucose.</description>
