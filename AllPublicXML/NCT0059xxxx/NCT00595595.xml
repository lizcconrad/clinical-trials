  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of teeth are saved each year by root canal therapy. Although current treatment
      modalities offer high levels of success for many conditions, an ideal form of therapy might
      consist of regenerative approaches in which diseased or necrotic pulp tissues are removed and
      replaced with healthy pulp tissue in order to revitalize teeth.

      The long term goal of this research project is to develop a method to regenerate dental
      pulp-like tissue as an alternative method to conventional root canal treatment. The objective
      of this study is to identify the methods necessary to regenerate dental pulp-like tissue in
      human teeth. We will collect small (~4X4mm) pieces of oral mucosa that are normally removed
      during surgical tooth extractions, isolate human postnatal progenitor/stem cells and, using
      an in vitro cell culture system, combined isolated cells with various scaffolds and test
      compounds to determine optimal conditions to differentiate pulp-like tissue (eg,
      odontoblasts, fibroblasts, endothelium, etc) grown in segments of human roots.
