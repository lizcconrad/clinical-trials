      The primary objective of this study is to explore the efficacy of Nasonex (mometasone furoate
      nasal spray) in comparison with placebo in improving the quality of life of subjects with
      moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis and intermittent asthma. A secondary
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Nasonex in relieving the subject's symptoms of
      allergic rhinitis and asthma.

      The primary objective is to explore the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) in
      comparison with placebo in improving the quality of life of subjects with moderate to severe
      persistent allergic rhinitis and intermittent asthma as measured by the Rhinasthma
      Questionnaire (Global Summary Score). In addition, there are two secondary objectives. The
      first secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of MFNS in improving the quality of
      life of subjects with moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis and intermittent asthma
      as measured by the Rhinasthma Upper Airways Score, the Rhinasthma Lower Airways Score, and
      the Rhinasthma Respiratory Allergy Impact Score. The second secondary objective is to
      evaluate the efficacy of MFNS in relieving the subject's symptoms of allergic rhinitis and
      asthma as measured by the Total 5 Symptoms Score (T5SS) and the Global Symptom Score
      (T5SS+asthma symptoms) and by the use of rescue medication on demand.

    <description>To explore the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray in comparison with placebo in improving the quality of life of subjects with moderate-severe PER and intermittent asthma as measured by the Rhinasthma Questionnaire (Global Summary Score). The Rhinasthma is a questionnaire that consists of 30 items and for each of them subjects had to indicate on a Likert scale (1=not at all; 5=very much) the degree of limitation or discomfort caused by each problem. Possible total best score = 150 and possible total worst score = 30.</description>

          <title>The Change of the Rhinasthma Global Summary Score From Baseline to Endpoint After 28 Days of Treatment.</title>
          <description>To explore the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray in comparison with placebo in improving the quality of life of subjects with moderate-severe PER and intermittent asthma as measured by the Rhinasthma Questionnaire (Global Summary Score). The Rhinasthma is a questionnaire that consists of 30 items and for each of them subjects had to indicate on a Likert scale (1=not at all; 5=very much) the degree of limitation or discomfort caused by each problem. Possible total best score = 150 and possible total worst score = 30.</description>
