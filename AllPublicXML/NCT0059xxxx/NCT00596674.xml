  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with chronic disabling conditions such as fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) must manage a
      wide variety of disease-related, intrapersonal, and environmental demands to maintain their
      health and quality of life. Engaging in health-promoting behaviors is one strategy
      recommended to manage disease symptoms and enhance quality of life (USDHHS, 2000). The
      purpose of this four-year study is to refine and test a theoretically and empirically based
      intervention to promote the health and well being of women with the chronic disabling
      condition of fibromyalgia. We hypothesize that women who participate in the &quot;Lifestyle
      Counts&quot; Intervention will report more greater self-efficacy for health behaviors, more
      frequent health behaviors and more positive health and quality of life than women in the
      comparison group.

      This wellness intervention, originally developed and tested in a randomized clinical trial of
      women with MS (N=113), resulted in significant improvements in self-efficacy, health
      behaviors and improvements in pain, social functioning, mental health and emotional
      role-functioning. The specific aims of this study are to examine the effects of the adapted
      wellness intervention on self-efficacy, resources, barriers, health behaviors and health
      outcomes for women with fibromyalgia.

      A sample of 160 women with FMS will be recruited to participate in a randomized clinical
      study to determine the effects of this wellness intervention that includes an eight week
      health promotion/behavior change component and 3 months of follow-up phone support. Content
      regarding stress management, lifestyle adjustment, physical activity, nutrition and women's
      health issues will be presented with an emphasis on the unique adaptations and associated
      skills required to empower women with the tools for exercising personal control over their
      health behaviors. The effects of the intervention on outcome variables will be assessed over
      an 8-month period with measurements at baseline, 2 months (immediately after the
      educational/skill-building component), 5 months (after 3 months of phone support) and at 8
      months.
