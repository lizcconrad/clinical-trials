  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to determine if rapid discontinuation of corticosteroids (also
      known as prednisone withdrawal) and maintenance immunosuppression with Prograf (tacrolimus)
      and CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) while using Thymoglobulin (Rabbit antithymocyte
      globulin) will give similar safety and efficacy results compared to continuation of
      corticosteroids (also known as prednisone maintenance) and standard maintenance
      immunosuppression with Prograf (tacrolimus), CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) while using
      Thymoglobulin (Rabbit antithymocyte globulin).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corticosteroids (one specific type is prednisone) have been used in clinical transplantation
      for more than 30 years. There are many side effects of corticosteroids including significant
      bone disease, diabetes (elevated blood sugar levels), fluid retention and hypertension (high
      blood pressure), psychosis, peptic ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia (elevated lipid levels such
      as cholesterol and triglycerides), obesity (overweight), acne, and susceptibility to
      infections. It is hoped that the new generation of potent immunosuppressive medications (such
      as Prograf and CellCept) will permit avoidance or withdrawal of corticosteroids for the
      majority of patients to avoid both short- and long-term complications of corticosteroid use
      in kidney transplant recipients.

    <description>Participants randomized to the prednisone withdrawal group, received 4 medications to prevent rejection. Thymoglobulin (rabbit antithymocyte globulin) was given intravenously in the operating room at the time of transplant. Subsequent intravenous doses were administered to participants an inpatient or outpatient for a total of 3 to 5 doses. Participants also began taking Prograf (tacrolimus) and CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil)orally within 24 hours of transplant and continued indefinitely. The steroids were initially given in the operating room intravenously at time of transplant as Solu-medrol (methylprednisolone)and were then switched to daily oral prednisone doses. The participant's dose of prednisone was rapidly decreased until it was completely eliminated by day 6 post-transplant.</description>

    <description>Participants in both groups received 3 to 5 doses of an intravenous medication to prevent rejection called Thymoglobulin (rabbit antithymocyte globulin) as per our standard of care. This drug was dosed at 1.5 milligrams/killograms per dose and dosing was then based on body weight. The dose was decreased in half or held if the participant had a low white blood cell count or if the participant a low platelet count. The first dose was given intravenously in the operating room and subsequent intravenous doses were administered either while participants were inpatients or outpatients for a total of 3 to 5 doses for a total of up to 6mg/kg. The number of doses was based on transplant kidney function and risk factors for rejection.</description>

          <description>The above methods focus on estimating or determining actual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (or renal function) of the kidney transplant. The MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) calculation includes age, sex and serum creatinine would have provided an estimate of GFR. This was to be performed at 3,6 and 12 months post-transplant.</description>
