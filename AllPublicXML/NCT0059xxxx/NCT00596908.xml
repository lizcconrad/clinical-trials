  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to obtain an imaging training set that will be used to evaluate images
      in future trials. Currently, no radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent has been
      approved by the FDA in the U.S. for use in diagnosing Parkinson disease and related
      Parkinsonian syndromes. The diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes in the U.S. is based on
      clinical criteria only. The goal is to demonstrate that 123I-ALTROPANE® paired with SPECT
      imaging permits a more accurate early diagnosis of Parkinson disease than a clinical
      diagnosis by a general neurologist.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, out patient clinical trial
      which will include up to 90 subjects, male or female, 40 years of age or older.

      This study is designed to obtain an imaging training set that will be used to evaluate images
      in future trials. Up to ninety subjects with upper extremity tremor for less than 2 years
      duration will be enrolled. Of these, at least thirty Parkinsonian syndromes subjects and at
      least thirty non-Parkinsonian syndromes subjects as diagnosed by a MDS will be enrolled.

      Subjects will participate in three study visits over the course of the study period. The
      screening visit will include an assessment of eligibility as well as the collection of the
      MDS diagnosis. The second visit, during which all subjects receive a single intravenous
      injection of 123I-ALTROPANE® followed by SPECT imaging, will include appropriate safety
      assessments before and after dosing. The third visit will include follow-up safety. The
      subjects' participation in the study will range between 30 and 40 days.
