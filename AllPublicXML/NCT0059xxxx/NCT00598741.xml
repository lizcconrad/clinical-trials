  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether fast imaging with MRI and the usual contrast
      material used for MRI, predicts which patients will do well with treatment. Some studies
      suggest that MRIs done right before surgery may be able to tell how much of the cancer was
      killed by the chemotherapy. This study will see if this is true in patients with osteogenic
      sarcoma (OS) and Ewing's sarcoma (ES). This study will also see if MRIs done early in
      treatment can tell if the chemotherapy is working.

    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo DCE-MRI studies prior to chemotherapy, 18-24 days after starting
      treatment, continue treatment and undergo a third MRI within 25 days prior to surgery. All
      patients with OS or Ewing sarcoma who will undergo pre-operative chemotherapy are eligible
      for study. Anti-neoplastic therapy will be determined by the primary physician and will not
      be impacted upon by this study, although the data will be made available to the physicians
      involved in the patient's care. The goals of this study are: 1) To determine if pre-operative
      dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can reliably predict percent
      necrosis at definitive surgery in bone tumors after induction chemotherapy. 2) Evaluate the
      hypothesis that in patients with Ewing or osteogenic sarcoma (OS), the a priori or early
      (18-24 days into treatment) DCE-MRI study predicts pathological percent necrosis measured at
      surgery, and disease free survival. 3) Determine if the DCE-MRI results are independent
      markers of tumor response compared to current clinical markers (LDH, alkaline phosphatase
      (osteogenic sarcoma only), primary disease site, primary disease size (length and volume),
      stage). 4) Compare the DCE-MRI results with several key molecular parameters including p53
      mutations and CDKN2A deletion in Ewing's sarcoma and RB alterations, CDKN2A deletion, and
      expression of HER-2, platelet derived growth factor, reduced folate carrier, and
      pglycoprotein in osteogenic sarcoma. Ewing's sarcoma and osteogenic sarcoma samples will also
      be submitted for Affymetrix expression microarray analysis. Summary: This project will
      determine the potential of DCE-MRI to predict tumor necrosis and as an a priori or early
      marker of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy

    <description>Patients will undergo DCE-MRI prior to, and within 18-24 days of starting chemotherapy. These studies are designed to determine if the DCE-MRI data will provide an a priori or early prognostic marker of tumor response. The dynamic MRI is done on a standard clinical scanner using standard techniques described below.
MR imaging studies will be acquired on a 1.5T GE (Milwaukee,WI) Signa LX scanner.</description>
