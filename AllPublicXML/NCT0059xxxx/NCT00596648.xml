    <textblock>
      In Phase 1 of this study, the purpose is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and highest
      safe dose of the multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (including VEGFR2, MET, and RET)
      XL184 in combination with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib administered to adults with
      Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). In Phase 2 of this study, the purpose is to evaluate the
      objective response rate of daily oral administration of XL184 with or without erlotinib in
      subjects with NSCLC who have progressed after responding to treatment with erlotinib.
