        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female patient, &gt;= 18 years of age.

          -  Histologically/cytologically proven solid malignant tumor, for which standard
             treatment of proven efficacy are not or no longer available.

          -  Performance status 0-2 ECOG/WHO.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  Able and willing to undergo blood sampling for pharmacokinetics.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Safety concerns:

          -  Any non-compensated or uncontrolled non-malignant condition, such as, symptomatic
             heart failure, active tuberculosis or any other chronic or active infection.

          -  History of allergic reaction to one of the ingredients of the trial medication.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormality in organ function as evidenced by any of the following
             pa¬ra¬meters:

          -  White blood cell count: &lt; 3.0 x 109/l ANC: &lt; 1.5 x 109/l

          -  Thrombocytes: &lt; 100 x 109/l

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 6.0 mM

          -  Bilirubin (total): &gt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal range

          -  ASAT, ALAT: &gt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal range unless related to metastases in
             which case &gt; 5 times upper normal limit is allowed

          -  Creatinine (serum) &gt; 135 µmol/l (&gt; 1.5 mg/100ml) OR

          -  Creatinine clearance: &lt; 50 ml/min (calculated according to modified Cockcroft and
             Gault)

          -  Breast feeding, pregnancy or planned pregnancy. A reliable method of contraception
             must be used in men and in women of childbearing potential during the study and for 3

          -  Lack of suitability for the trial:

          -  Concomitant treatment with any other investigational drugs or exposure to another
             investigational agent within the last 4 weeks prior to study specific screening
             procedures (period should be extended if the patient has received any drug which is
             known to have de¬layed toxicity or prolonged half-life).

          -  Active peptic ulcer or any GI condition that could alter absorption or motility.

          -  Chronic use of H2-antagonists or proton pump inhibitors.

          -  Any other cancer treatment during the study or administered within the last 4 weeks (6
             weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, high-dose carboplatin or extensive radiotherapy)
             before start of study treatment, except irradiation of non-target lesions for symptom
             relief and bi-phosphonate treatment of bone metastases.

          -  Clinically symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Neurological or psychiatric disease or drug or alcohol abuse which would interfere
             with the patients proper completion of the protocol assignment.

          -  Administrative reasons:

          -  Anticipated non-availability for study visits/procedures.
