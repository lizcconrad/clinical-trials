  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral contraceptive therapy is routinely used for the treatment of menstrual disturbances of
      patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

      To date, the cardiovascular risk (CVR) of the oral contraceptives (OC) are known but no data
      are available on the CVR in PCOS patients treated with OC or physical exercise.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of OC to physical exercise on the CVR of
      PCOS women and show the hormonal and metabolic effects of these two different treatment.

      We hypothesize that physical exercise has the same beneficial effects of OC therapy on
      hormonal and metabolic features of PCOS women with less cardiovascular consequences.

      One hundred and fifty PCOS women will be enrolled. The diagnosis of PCOS was made based
      according to the Rotterdam criteria (1). Specifically, patients with anovulation and clinical
      and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism were enrolled.

      Patients will be randomly allocated in three groups (OC, physical exercise and placebo group)
      using a computer-software. Fifty PCOS patients will be treated with OC (Drospirenone 3 mg,
      Ethynylestradiol 30 microgram = Yasmin, Schering, Milan,Italy) other fifty PCOS will be
      undergone physical exercise, whereas other fifty will be treated with placebo tablets (one
      tablet once daily; placebo group). The duration of the treatment will be 6 months.

      Patients treated with OC will be instructed to follow their usual diet and physical activity,
      whereas patients undergone to physical exercise will be instructed to follow a detailed
      regular physical training program and for the diet they will be advised for the quality of
      food to eat. All subjects will be nonsmokers and none will drink alcoholic beverages.

      Each subject will undergo follow-up visits under (at three and 6 months from treatment
      starting) and after treatment (at three and 6 months from treatment withdrawal). At each
      follow-up visit, in all subjects the same operator will perform clinical, hormonal, metabolic
      and cardiovascular assessments by carotid and brachial artery US
