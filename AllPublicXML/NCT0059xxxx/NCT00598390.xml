  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to measure brain CB1 receptors in the hope to better
      understand how they work, so that one day we can understand how the CB1 receptors are
      involved in psychiatric, neurological, and behavioral disorders.

      MePPEP is a ligand that is highly selective for the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor. This
      receptor is considered the most common G-coupled protein receptor in the brain (Pacher et
      al., 2006). The CB1 receptor is the site of action of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC), the
      active compound in marijuana, and is found primarily on the presynaptic terminals of
      dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic neurons (Howlett et al., 2002). The function of the
      CB1 receptor is not entirely clear; however, it has been implicated in several neurological
      and psychiatric disorders, and a selective inverse agonist, rimonabant, is currently in use
      in Europe for the treatment of obesity (Van Gaal et al., 2005). [11C]MePPEP was developed to
      enhance our understanding of the in vivo characteristics of the CB1 receptor (e.g., receptor
      density and receptor occupancy with pharmaceuticals).

      The purpose of this protocol is to establish an accurate method to measure CB1 receptor
      levels in brain by performing test/retest brain imaging studies. The results of this overall
      study are required to apply this PET ligand in various neurological and psychiatric disorders
      in the future.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        &lt;TAB&gt;

        All subjects must be healthy and aged 18 65 years, with history/physical exam, ECG, and
        laboratory tests within one year of the PET scan. The volunteer must sign an informed
        consent form.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Current psychiatric illness, substance abuse including marijuana use, or severe
             systemic disease based on history and physical exam.

          -  Laboratory tests with clinically significant abnormalities or positive urine
             toxicology screen.

          -  Prior participation in other research protocols in the last year such that radiation
             exposure would exceed the annual limits.
