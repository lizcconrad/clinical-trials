      Study Objective:

      Brain tumors are poorly understood. The purpose of this research is to examine whether
      factors in lifestyle play a role in brain tumor development. The study will also investigate
      the contribution of inherited susceptibility to the risk of brain cancer. By gaining a better
      understanding of these influences, the investigators hope to learn how to prevent brain
      tumors in future generations, and to develop more effective strategies for treatment.

      Study Protocol:

      This is a case-control investigation. Persons affected with a brain tumor are compared to
      unaffected persons on previous medical history, diet and other factors. Those enrolled in the
      study will participate in an interview on general background, diet, medical history and
      lifestyle, and will provide a sample of DNA, clippings of your toenails, and a tap water
      sample from your home. All procedures are performed in the clinic or through the mail.

      'Cases': Cases eligible for the study are persons with a recent diagnosis of a primary brain
      tumor (glioma or meningioma), at least 18 years of age.

      'Controls': Controls in the study are non-family members of patients, similar in age and of
      the same gender. Suitable controls include in-laws, friends, neighbors and co-workers.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this research is to establish a clinic-based case-control study for
      examination of potential risk factors for primary adult brain tumors. After assembling a
      series of 1,500 cases and 3,000 controls, investigators will test current hypotheses on
      ge-netic and environmental risk factors for the occurrence of these tumors.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      In this case-control study, persons with a recent diagnosis (within 4 months) of a primary
      brain tumor will be identified in the neurology/neurosurgery clinics at major treatment
      referral centers in the Southeast. Non-blood related relatives (eg. in-laws), friends or
      other persons will be recruited as controls. Names and contact information of eligible
      controls will be ascertained from patients. A total of 1,500 cases and 3,000 controls will be
      enrolled over the course of the 5-year study. All enrolled subjects will complete a one hour
      interview on lifestyle, environmental exposures, diet, physical activity, tobacco use and
      medical history. They will also be asked to provide a DNA sample, a water sample and a
      toenail sample (from each great toe). At the end of data collection, lifestyles and genetic
      attributes will be compared in cases and controls to identify any differences that may be
      relevant to the causation of disease. Because the study will recruit patients near the time
      of disease diagnosis, full enrollment should be possible. In addition, high re-sponse rates
      are anticipated among the controls. Thus, with the large numbers of patients available and
      high anticipated response rates, the study offers a unique opportunity to successfully
      identify environmental and genetic risk factors for this uncommon form of cancer.

        &quot;Case&quot; subjects will be identified from the patients referred to neurology/neurosurgery
        clinics. Cases, when enrolled in the study, will be asked to identify potential &quot;controls&quot;
        by providing the name and phone number of the same-sex in-law nearest in age to the case
        and/or the name of a same-sex friend will also be sought.
