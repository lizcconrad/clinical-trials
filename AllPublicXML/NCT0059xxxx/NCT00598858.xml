      This pilot phase II trial studies docetaxel and prednisone in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed stage I-II prostate cancer undergoing prostatectomy. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies, such as
      prednisone, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from
      growing. Giving docetaxel and prednisone together may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of a 3-month prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of at least 30%
      by chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel and prednisone in patients with stage I/II prostate
      cancer, who are scheduled for prostatectomy.

      II. To compare tumor, pathological and PSA responses to neoadjuvant docetaxel between
      patients with intermediate and high grades of prostate cancer.

      III. To obtain prostate specimens for genomic correlates with responses of the chemotherapy
      regimen of docetaxel and prednisone.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 2 and prednisone
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo prostatectomy
      within 3 weeks after completion of chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 7 days.
