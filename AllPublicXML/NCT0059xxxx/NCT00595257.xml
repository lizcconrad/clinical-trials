      The purpose of this study is to determine if concentrated nucleated cells from your own bone
      marrow, injected or infused into an ischemic limb, will restore sufficient blood flow to
      avoid amputation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Critical Limb Ischemia per protocol (see diagnostic criteria #2) with
             regard to the study limb.

             Existence of a PAOD with clinical presentation corresponding to Rutherford Category 4
             or Category 5 as defined in the reporting standards adopted by the Society of Vascular
             Surgeons (table 1)

          2. Patient meets at least one of the following diagnostic criteria in the study limb:

               -  Ankle artery occlusion pressure absolute &lt;50 mmHg or ABI &lt;0.4

               -  Toe artery occlusive pressure &lt; 40mm Hg or TBI (&lt;0.4)

               -  TcPO2 &lt;20 mmHg lying down breathing room air, if available.

          3. There is no reasonable open surgical or endovascular revascularization option as
             determined by the treating vascular specialist. Factors that may contribute to the
             determination of inoperability may include:

               -  Anatomical considerations

                    -  No outflow targets

                    -  No appropriate conduit (i.e. vein for bypass)

                    -  Long segment occlusions or calcified lesions that predict poor outcome with
                       endovascular approaches.

               -  High risk medical conditions

                    -  Unstable cardiac disease.

                    -  Renal insufficiency

               -  History of prior failed revascularization attempts

               -  The patient's unsuitability must be confirmed by 2 qualified physicians.

                    -  The attending vascular surgeon will provide the primary assessment.

                    -  The confirmatory opinion must come from a fully licensed physician. (not a
                       resident)

                    -  If anatomical considerations are invoked, the second physician may be a
                       vascular surgeon, interventional radiologist, cardiologist, or vascular
                       medicine specialist.

                    -  If medical co-morbidity is deemed the high risk aspect, then the
                       confirmatory opinion may be obtained from an internist, family physician,
                       cardiologist, vascular medicine, nephrologists, or vascular surgeon.

          4. Age &gt;18 years and ability to understand the planned treatment

          5. Subject has read and signed the IRB/IEC approved Informed Consent form

          6. Patients for whom the following medication(s) is prescribed must have a one month
             stable baseline of appropriate/maximally tolerated therapy prior to enrollment:
             Plavix/asprin therapy, anticoagulation therapy, cholesterol lowering agent, and or
             blood pressure medication

          7. Hematocrit ≥ 28.0%, White Blood Cell count ≤ 14,000, Platelet count ≥ 50,000, INR ≤
             1.6 unless on Coumadin, or PTT &lt;1.5 x control (to avoid bleeding complications)
             Patients on Coumadin will be corrected prior to the procedure and must have an INR&lt;1.6
             at the time of randomization/surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy &lt;6 months due to concomitant illnesses

          2. History of bone marrow diseases (especially NHL, MDS) that prohibit transplantation

          3. Terminal renal failure with existing dependence on dialysis

          4. Known active malignancy or results outside of normal limits from the following tests:
             PAP, Chest X-ray, PSA, Mammogram, Hemocult unless follow-up studies reveal patient to
             be cancer free..

          5. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HgbA1C&gt;10%)

          6. Medical risk that precludes anesthesia (conscious sedation), or ASA Class 5

          7. Life-threatening complications of the ischemia necessitating immediate amputation

          8. Uncorrected iliac artery occlusion on index side

          9. Extensive necrosis of the index limb or other conditions that make amputation
             inevitable (Rutherford Category 6)

         10. Active clinical infection being treated by antibiotics within one week of enrollment

         11. Treatment with immunosuppressant drugs (including Prednisone &gt; 5 mg per day).

         12. Female who is pregnant or nursing, or of child bearing potential and is not using a
             reliable birth control method.

         13. Underwent a major cardiovascular surgical procedure (carotid endarterectomy, open
             arterial aneurysm or bypass surgery, or coronary artery bypass surgery) or an adverse
             cardiovascular event (stroke or MI) within the 30 days prior to randomization
