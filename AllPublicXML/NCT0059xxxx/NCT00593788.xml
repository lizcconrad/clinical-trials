    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to establish parameters for the Gaps-in-Noise test in
      normal-hearing young adults. One hundred subjects (50 males and 50 females) received an
      audiological evaluation to rule out hearing loss and auditory processing disorder. The
      Gaps-in-Noise test was then conducted on all subjects. The mean gap detection threshold was
      4.19 msec. A psychometric function by gap duration was constructed, revealing that the
      percentage of correct responses was less than or equal to 5% for a gap duration of 2 msec,
      10-30% for a gap duration of 3 msec, 60-70% for a gap duration of 4 msec, and over 96% for
      gap durations of 5 msec or longer. The results suggest that the data obtained can be applied
      as reference values for future testing. In the subjects evaluated, the Gaps-in-Noise test
      proved to be consistent with low variability.

        Normal-hearing adults between 18 and 31 years of age were evaluated, including 50 males
        (mean age 24.72 years) and 50 females (mean age 23.77 years). The youngest male subject was
        18 years old, and the youngest female subject was 18.16 years old. In contrast, the oldest
        male subject was 31.5 years old, and the oldest female subject was 31.83 years old. All of
        the participants in the study were students or employees of the University of Guarulhos.
