    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of atacicept compared to
      placebo in the treatment of signs and symptoms in a subject population with active rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA), inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) and no previous exposure to
      anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology 20 Response Based on C-reactive Protein (ACR20-CRP) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>ACR20-CRP response is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 percent (%) improvement from Baseline in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with &gt;=20% improvement from Baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP).</description>

    <description>ACR50-CRP response is defined as &gt;=50% improvement from Baseline in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with &gt;=50% improvement from Baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP).</description>

    <description>ACR70-CRP response is defined as &gt;=70% improvement from Baseline in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with &gt;=70% improvement from Baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Responses at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The EULAR response criteria evaluate change in DAS28 scores represented as &quot;good response&quot;, &quot;moderate response&quot;, or &quot;no response&quot; considering both the current DAS28 score and the observed improvement from baseline. Participants were considered to have &quot;good&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; EULAR response if at the time of assessment, their DAS28 score was less than or equal to (&lt;=) 5.1 and the improvement from baseline in their DAS28 score was greater than (&gt;) 0.6; or if at the time of assessment, their DAS28 score was &gt;5.1 and improvement from baseline in their DAS28 score was &gt;1.2.</description>

    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, assessed up to Week 38</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
