    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is clinical validation of an electrochemical biochip for rapid
      pathogen identification and antibiotic susceptibility determination.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Point-of-care identification of pathogens and determination of antibiotic susceptibility will
      significantly improve the clinical management of urinary tract infection. We have previously
      developed a biochip based on microfabrication technology capable of rapid detection of
      pathogens. The specific objectives of the current proposal are: 1) Determination of microbial
      constituents in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients and development of additional
      species-specific probes against these pathogens; 2) Development of a rapid antibiotic
      susceptibility and molecular pyuria assay using the electrochemical biochip; and 3) Clinical
      validation of the biochip as a diagnostic test for urinary tract infection.

      Within a single protocol, two non-interventional studies were conducted at different time
      points to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Sensitivity and specificity of the
      electrochemical biosensor based assay was demonstrated in each study.

    <description>Study 1: Multiplex pathogen identification using biosensor based assay. We recruited 116 participants yielding 109 urine samples suitable for analysis and comparison between biosensor assays and standard urine culture. Biosensor based assays were used to detect multiple pathogens in the urine samples.
Study 2: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using biosensor based assay. We recruited 222 participants yielding 252 urine samples. Corresponding biosensor and clinical microbiology culture data was available for 215 samples. 73% (157) of these samples contained bacteria. Biosensor based antimicrobial susceptibility test, in concert with pathogen identification assay was directly performed on these samples.</description>

          <title>Multiplex Identification of Pathogens.</title>
          <description>Urine samples of patients at risk for urinary tract infections were collected. Biosensor based assays were used to detect the most common uropathogens in these samples. Analytical validity of the biosensor assays was examined by comparing biosensor results to those obtained using standard clinical microbiology laboratory methods. No interventions were performed.</description>

          <title>Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing.</title>
          <description>Urine samples of patients at risk of urinary tract infections were collected. Biosensor based antimicrobial susceptibility test, in concert with pathogen identification assay was directly performed on these samples. Analytical validity of the biosensor assays was examined by comparing biosensor results to those obtained using standard clinical microbiology laboratory methods. No interventions were performed.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The trial is non-interventional. Future studies will focused on developing advanced prototypes with the option of using the biosensor platform to direct patient care in comparison with standard microbiology.</limitations_and_caveats>
