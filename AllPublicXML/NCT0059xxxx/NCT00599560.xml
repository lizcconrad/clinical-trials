      Summary: Some of sicknesses are well known to be provoked by inadequate adaptation to
      physical and/or psychogenic stress in their daily life. Meniere's disease is also a common
      inner ear disease accompanied with vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus especially in civilized
      people under stressed life style. Its oto-pathology was firstly revealed in 1938 to be inner
      ear endolymphatic hydrops through the temporal bone study. To elucidate the neuroscientific
      relationship between &quot;stress&quot; and &quot;inner ear&quot;, we examined plasma vasopressin (the
      anti-diuretic &quot;stress&quot; hormone) and its receptor, V2R in the endolymphatic sac (the &quot;inner
      ear&quot; endo-organ for endolymph absorption) in Meniere's patients.

      Methods: Between 1998 and 2006, we enrolled and assigned 105 intractable Meniere's patients
      to examine plasma vasopressin during remission of vertigo attacks (controls: 30 patients with
      chronic otitis media). Using the real-time PCR method, we examined V2R mRNA expression in the
      endolymphatic sac in 12 patients (controls: 6 patients with acoustic neurinoma). By means of
      cell culture and cyclic AMP assay, we also examined cyclic AMP activity in the endolymphatic
      sac in 3 patients (controls: 3 patients with acoustic neurinoma).

    <description>Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had received a clinical diagnosis of Meniere's disease according to the 1995 AAO-HNS criteria (Committee, 1995). These criteria can be briefly described as follows: 1) Repeated attacks of vertigo: A definitive spell is spontaneous vertigo lasting at least 20 minutes. A mixed type of spontaneous nystagmus is observed during attacks. 2) Fluctuating cochlear symptoms: The hearing test usually reveals a marked fluctuation of the threshold in the low and middle tone range.</description>
