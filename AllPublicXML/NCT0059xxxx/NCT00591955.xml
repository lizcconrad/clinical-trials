  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine factors which predict a complicated hospital course
      and then to develop from these findings an Emergency Department guideline to assist in
      knowing who is at highest risk of elderly patients with infection presenting for care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is looking at how closely physicians adhere to treatment guidelines in caring for
      elderly patients, and then to determine if there are differences in elderly patient disease
      symptoms that result in a failure to use guidelines. If this is known, physicians can then be
      aware of these differences and provide appropriate care.

    <description>failure to meet any one of the following will be considered inadequate processes of care:
obtain blood cultures prior to antibiotic administration
administration of antibiotics within 4 hours of presentation
measure serum lactate if patient has severe sepsis in the ED
