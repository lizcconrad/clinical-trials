  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Protocol is intended to facilitate development and testing of new cardiovascular MRI
      software capabilities by UC Davis Research Faculty, as well as to facilitate the evaluation
      of new software capabilities provided by GE and Siemens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will permit normal subjects, as well as patients with suspected or proven
      medical conditions, to undergo MRI studies using the new software capabilities. This Protocol
      is not restricted to imaging of a particular organ system or disease. The Protocol does not
      involve injection of any contrast agent, or other minimally-invasive or invasive procedure.
      It is intended only for those cases for which the only requirement of the subject is to relax
      and lie still while imaging is being performed.
