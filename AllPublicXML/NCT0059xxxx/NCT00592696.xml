      It has been shown in the adult literature that smoking is related to depression and visa
      versa. Not much is known about how this relationship is started or if one perhaps leads to
      the other. We are performing 1 hour long interviews with adolescents ages 12-19 who meet
      criteria for major depression and who smoke. They are interviewed along with their parent.
      Questions center around their view of depression and their history of depression as well as
      questions around their smoking as well as the interrelationships between the two. Transcripts
      are made of the interview and are being analyzed for themes.
