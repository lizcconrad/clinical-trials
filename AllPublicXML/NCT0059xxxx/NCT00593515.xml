    <textblock>
      Does parenting style affect emotion regulation among children who initially demonstrate high
      levels of fear and anxiety? Although recent correlational research has demonstrated a linkage
      between parental behaviors, such as excessive intrusiveness, and children's manifestations of
      fear and anxiety, it is not clear if parenting behaviors directly influence children's
      ability to regulate these emotions. Alternatively, these parental behaviors may be elicited
      by children who express fears and anxieties more frequently than other children do.
      Experimental research designs would offer a more definitive test of these competing
      explanations of the extant correlational findings. Intervention studies, in particular, can
      test whether experimentally manipulating current family interaction patterns affects
      children's ability to regulate emotion. This study provides a preliminary experimental test
      of the relationship between parental behavior and children's regulation of fear and anxiety.
      Some 40 clinically anxious youth, aged 6-13, were randomly assigned to a family intervention
      program for childhood anxiety problems, which includes extensive parent communication
      training, or a child intervention program without parent-training. By comparing these two
      interventions, we tested if it was possible to improve parenting behaviors—such as
      intrusiveness—through intensive parent-training, above and beyond the effects of involving
      children in a child intervention program. We then tested the impact of this change in
      parental behaviors on children's ability to regulate fear and anxiety. We hypothesized that
      parent-training would reduce intrusiveness, which would in turn improve children's anxiety
      outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The child met DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of a principal anxiety disorder based on
             a semi-structured interview

          -  The child was not taking any psychiatric medication at the initial assessment, or was
             taking a stable dose of psychiatric medication (i.e., at least one month at a stable
             dose prior to the baseline assessment), and

          -  If medication was being used, families stated an intention to maintain that dose
             throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The child was currently in child-focused psychotherapy

          -  The family was currently in family therapy or a parenting class

          -  Either the child or the parents evidenced psychotic symptoms

          -  The child began taking psychiatric medication or increased his/her dose of medication
             during the intervention, or

          -  For any reason the child or parents appeared unable to participate in the intervention
             program.
