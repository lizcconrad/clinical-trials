  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New blood tests have become available to detect either latent or active tuberculosis. These
      tests - which according to the CDC can replace the tuberculin skin test - measure the
      production of gamma-interferon (a cytokine) by peripheral lymphocytes (white cells) when
      exposed to antigens which are highly specific of mycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacteria
      responsible for tuberculosis). Our hypothesis was that the production of gamma-interferon
      would be much higher at the beginning of treatment than at the end, and that decline in
      gamma-interferon secretion could be an indicator of clinical response to treatment.

      Patients either treated for active culture proven tuberculosis (TB) or having completed
      treatment during the preceding 6 months were recruited. Exclusion criteria were : HIV
      infection and previous TB. Interferon gamma release assay (T-SPOT.TB, Oxford Immunotec) was
      sampled during the 2 first weeks of treatment, at the end of treatment and 6 months later.

      T-SPOT.TB was analysed qualitatively (pos/neg) and quantitatively (Spot forming units: SFU)
      to determine if there was a higher rate of negative tests at the end of treatment and 6
      months after treatment than initially. Paired samples were analysed to compare SFU counts
      between beginning of treatment and end of treatment, and SFU counts between end of treatment
      and 6 months later.

      Clinical response to treatment was recorded, as well as treatment failures and relapses.
