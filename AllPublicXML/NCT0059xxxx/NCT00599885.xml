  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with diabetes mellitus are more prone to coronary heart disease, stroke, and
      peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus has been regarded as an independent risk
      factor for the progression of coronary artery disease. Several studies have been reported
      that diabetes increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality in both men and women. With the
      introduction of drug-eluting stents (DESs), the angiographic rates of restenosis at later
      months have reduced dramatically in several studies. However, even with DESs, diabetic
      patients showed increased rates of restenosis and late loss index compared with nondiabetic
      patients. Diabetes has been considered to be a predictor of poor prognosis after percutaneous
      coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-metal stents (DESs) have been
      demonstrated to be worse in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients. In the era
      of DESs, no study has compared the effects of telmisartan and valsartan on neointima volume
      with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at 8 months after zotarolimus-eluting stent implantation
      in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. Telmisartan, which is well-known for its selective
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ activity with its anti-inflammatory and
      antiproliferative properties, could be an appropriate therapeutic option for treating
      hypertensive diabetic patients with significant coronary artery diseases requiring stent
      implantation. In contrast, valsartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker with negligible
      PPAR-γ activity. Increasing interest remains in the identification of systemic
      pharmacological therapies to prevent coronary restenosis especially in diabetic patients.
