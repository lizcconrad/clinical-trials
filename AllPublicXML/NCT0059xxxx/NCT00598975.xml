    <textblock>
      Study 07-PIR-02 is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NKTR-102
      (PEG-irinotecan) for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The study is
      comprised of two sequential components - Phase 2a and Phase 2b. The Phase 2a portion is an
      open-label, dose-finding trial in multiple solid tumor types that are refractory to standard
      curative or palliative therapies. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a is to establish the
      /recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) of NKTR-102 by measuring the frequency of Dose Limiting
      Toxicity (DLT). The Phase 2b portion is an open-label, randomized, two-arm study in patients
      with second-line metastatic colorectal cancer and study participants will be randomized (1:1)
      to receive either NKTR-102 and cetuximab or irinotecan and cetuximab. The primary endpoint of
      the Phase 2b portion of the trial is progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints for both
      the Phase 2a and 2b portion include response rate, response duration, overall survival,
      standard pharmacokinetics, and incidence of toxicities, including diarrhea and neutropenia.

      The Phase 2a portion of this study is completed. The following entries reflect the Phase 2a
      portion of this study only. The Phase 2b portion of the study was not enrolled. Based on
      emerging data regarding the corresponding low efficacy of cetuximab in patients with KRAS
      mutations, as well as revised NKTR-102 clinical development plans, the Phase 2b portionof the
      study was not completed.
