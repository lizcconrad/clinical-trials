  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label study conducted at one site. Six healthy male subjects will be
      enrolled to ensure at least four fully evaluable subjects. Each subject will receive a single
      10 milligram (mg) oral dose of GW856553 containing 50 microCi (µCi) of [14C] GW856553. Urine
      and fecal samples will be collected until 216 hour after dosing but subjects may be
      discharged after 168 hour if 90% of the dose is recovered and/or &lt;1% of the dose is excreted
      in a 24 hour period. Blood and plasma will be collected at various sample times after dosing
      to measure parent drug and total drug-related material. Samples of urine, faeces and plasma
      will be transferred into a separate study to characterize and quantify metabolites in these
      matrices. Safety will be assessed by adverse event monitoring, vital signs, electrocardiogram
      (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests.

             spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone, sub dermal implants or a
             tubal ligation if the women could become pregnant from the time of the first dose of
             the study medication until completion of the follow-up procedures.

          -  Any condition that could interfere with the accurate assessment and recovery of 14C.

          -  Prescribed or over-the-counter medication within 5 days (or 5 half lives, whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dosing day, unless the investigator confirms that it will
             not introduce additional risk or interfere with the study procedures or outcome.

          -  Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, Gamma GT and bilirubin) &gt; upper limit of normal
             (ULN) at screening
