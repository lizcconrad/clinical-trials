      This is a phase I dose escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      novel combination of Arsenic, Ascorbic Acid and Velcade, followed by a phase II study
      conducted using the MTD estimated from the phase I portion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact the high dose therapy and autologous transplant can prolong life in patients
      with multiple myeloma (MM), in most studies there appears to be a continuously declining
      event free survival following auto-transplant indicating that few patients will be cured with
      this approach. A high percentage of patients the relapse in the post transplant setting will
      not be candidate for additional chemotherapy. We therefore, are investigating novel
      strategies for controlling their disease in the post transplant setting. The key theoretical
      issue for this study is whether concomitant Trisenox would permit the use of less toxic doses
      of Velcade, resulting in a less toxic but equally effective regimen.

      Phase I of this study uses dose escalation to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of Arsenic,
      Ascorbic Acid and Velcade. Phase II is a subsequent treatment phase using the maximum
      tolerated dose from Phase I. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events,
      treatment may continue for 6 cycles, plus two additional cycles if patient has achieved a
      good response.

    <description>Phase I/Cohort I
Loading:
Arsenic Trioxide (ATO): 0.25 mg/kg IV over 1-2 hr qd x 5 days (Monday-Friday)
Ascorbic Acid: 1000 mg by IV infusion over 15 minutes after each infusion of arsenic trioxide qd x 5 days
Maintenance cycles (21 days)
ATO: 0.25 mg/kg IV over 1-2 hr once a week x 2 weeks every 3 weeks (one cycle) for a total of 6 cycles.
Ascorbic Acid 1000mg IV will be given within 30 minutes of completion of ATO.
Bortezomib 1 mg/m2 is administered intravenously in a 3-5 second bolus on days 1, 8 of a 21-day cycle. ATO is given at least one hour prior to Bortezomib. The first cycle will start on week 2, after loading dose week.
Phase I/Cohort 1 is followed by Cohort 2. Phase II uses maximum tolerated dose from Phase I.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as localized plasmacytoma, detectable
             M-spike by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and/or urine protein electrophoresis
             (UPEP), or free light chain assay, bone lytic lesions and/or bone marrow infiltration
             with atypical plasma-cells.

          -  Patients must be at least four weeks since their prior therapy. Patients will not be
             excluded because of any prior regimen they have received as long as they meet other
             requirements.

          -  Adequate organ function, patients with elevated creatinine due to myeloma are not
             excluded

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          -  Serum potassium greater than 4.0 milliequivalent (mEq)/dL and serum magnesium greater
             than 1.8 mg/dL. If these electrolytes are below the specified limits on the baseline
             laboratory tests, supplemental electrolytes should be administered to bring the serum
             concentrations to these levels before administering arsenic trioxide.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Bortezomib, Trisenox, Ascorbic acid, or other agents used in the study.

          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) interval greater than 460 msec in the presence of serum
             potassium greater than or equal to 4.0 mEq/L and magnesium greater than or equal to
             1.8 mg/dL, or underlying conduction disease that prevents measurement of the QTc
             interval.

          -  History of ventricular tachycardia or any cardiac arrhythmia requiring the placement
             of an automated intraventricular cardiac defibrillator or therapy with class I or
             class II antiarrhythmic drug.

          -  Ejection fraction (EF) by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan less than 35%.
