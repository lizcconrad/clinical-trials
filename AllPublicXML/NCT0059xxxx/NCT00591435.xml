  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaesthesia and surgery related time intervals of three standard operations are compared
      depending on whether residents or consultants are performing anaesthesia and surgery.

      Hypothesis: Perioperative workflow is influenced by state of education, time intervals
      reflecting anaesthesia as well as surgical performance increase due to resident training.
      Therefore, costs of perioperative care increase as well.
