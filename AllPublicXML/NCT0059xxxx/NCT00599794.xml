    <textblock>
      Patients may have actual or relative intravascular volume depletion in a number of different
      disease states, particularly with sepsis syndrome. However, it is clinically difficult to
      determine volume status without invasive monitoring, which may cause unintended
      complications. Our hypothesis is that we can accurately estimate central venous pressure,
      which is a surrogate marker of volume status, with a noninvasive portable ultrasound device.
