      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of partial breast radiation therapy
      and how well it works in treating women undergoing breast conservation therapy for
      early-stage breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To allow women undergoing breast conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer to
           have access to accelerated partial breast irradiation therapy on a controlled trial.

        -  To capture prospective data on acute and late toxicity and disease recurrence in
           patients treated with this therapy.

        -  To summarize the institutional experience of these patients treated with this
           experimental therapy.

      OUTLINE: Within 9 weeks after surgery, patients undergo accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (including conformal external-beam irradiation, interstitial brachytherapy,
      intracavitary brachytherapy, or proton beam irradiation) twice daily for 5 days (10
      fractions).

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 to 6 months for at least 5
      years and then annually thereafter.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Women who have chosen to undergo breast conservation therapy, including lumpectomy and
             breast irradiation, at the University of Pennsylvania for any invasive mammary
             carcinoma or intraductal breast cancer

          -  Stage I-II invasive or intraductal breast cancer

               -  Unifocal tumor ≤ 3.0 cm in size

                    -  Patients with microscopic multifocality are eligible provided total
                       pathologic tumor size is ≤ 3 cm

               -  No proven multicentric carcinoma in more than 1 quadrant or separated by 4 or
                  more centimeters

                    -  Pre- or post-biopsy ipsilateral* breast MRI negative for multicentric
                       disease (i.e., areas of cancer that cannot be removed in a single excision
                       specimen) or other suspicious findings NOTE: *Patients with synchronous
                       bilateral breast cancers who will be treated with radiotherapy to each
                       breast are eligible, provided such treatment can be performed in a manner
                       that avoids overlap between treatment fields. Both sides may be treated with
                       partial breast irradiation (PBI) if the pathologic eligibility criteria are
                       met for both tumors, or only one side may be treated with PBI if the
                       criteria are met for only one tumor.

               -  Negative margins of excision (≥ 2 mm) OR no tumor seen in a re-excision specimen

               -  No extensive intraductal component present

               -  Negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) or axillary lymph node dissection OR fewer
                  than 4 positive nodes on adequate axillary lymph node dissection (i.e., 10 or
                  more lymph nodes removed)

                    -  If a SLN is positive on hematoxylin and eosin (but not by
                       immunohistochemistry alone), complete axillary lymph node dissection is
                       required

                         -  Axillary lymph node staging is not required for patients with ductal
                            carcinoma in situ

                    -  No SLN identified in the internal mammary nodes

                    -  No node &gt; 2 cm

                    -  No node with extracapsular extension

          -  Surgical clips placed in the operative bed OR ability to visualize operative bed on CT
             scan of the breast

               -  Target lumpectomy cavity/whole breast reference volume must be ≤ 30% based on the
                  treatment planning CT scan

               -  Negative post-biopsy mammogram required if presented with mammographically
                  detected microcalcifications

          -  Hormone receptor status unspecified

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Female

          -  Menopausal status not specified

          -  History of non-breast malignancies allowed provided patients have been disease free
             for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their physician to be at
             low risk for recurrence

               -  Treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma
                  in situ, or basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer within the past 5 years
                  allowed
