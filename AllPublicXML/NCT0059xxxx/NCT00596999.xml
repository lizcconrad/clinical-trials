  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety of partially matched related human placental-derived stem cells
      (HPDSC) administered in conjunction with umbilical cord blood (UCB) stem cells from the same
      donor in subjects with various malignant or nonmalignant disorders potentially curable with
      stem cell transplantation and to assess potential restoration of normal hematopoiesis and
      immune function in subjects with these disorders
