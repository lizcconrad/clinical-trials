      This is a pilot study designed to examine the potential efficacy and tolerability of
      zonisamide compared to placebo for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zonisamide is an antiepileptic medication which has similar clinical and pharmacologic
      effects to topiramate, a medication that has demonstrated efficacy in a randomized clinical
      trial for treatment of alcoholism. Because zonisamide is potentially better tolerated and
      easier to titrate in the outpatient setting than topiramate, it may offer important clinical
      advantages in the treatment of alcoholism.

      This is a small 12-week placebo-controlled pilot study examining tolerability and potential
      efficacy in anticipation of a larger, placebo-controlled trial of zonisamide for treatment of
      alcohol dependence. It is a randomized, double-blind trial of zonisamide vs. placebo at
      flexible dosages of 100-500mg/day in alcoholics receiving ambulatory psychosocial treatment.
      Participants will take part in six individual Cognitive-Behavioral based therapy sessions,
      which are focused on learning coping skills. Participants must endorse a goal of either
      cutting down their drinking to non-hazardous levels, or abstinence.

    <measure>Change in Number of Heavy Drinking Days (i.e., 5 or More Drinks Per Day for Men, and 4 or More Per Day for Women)Per Week, by Week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the end of 12 weeks in treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure represents the change in number of heavy drinking days (i.e., 5 or more drinks per day for men, and 4 or more per day for women)per week, from baseline to the end of week twelve. This was analyzed using weekly measurements over the 12 week study period (thirteen time points, 12 measurements)with a repeated measures analysis (SPSS linear mixed models), by interaction with time (week).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Rate of Change in Abstinent Days</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the end of 12 weeks in treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure analyzed the weekly rate of change in number of abstinent days over the twelve weeks of the study from baseline to the end of week twelve. This was analyzed using weekly measurements over the 12 week study period (thirteen time points, 12 measurements)with a repeated measures analysis (SPSS proc mixed), by interaction with time (week).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Number of Drinks Per Week by Week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the end of 12 weeks in treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure represents the change in the total number of standard drinks per week (weekly data) from baseline to the end of week twelve. This was analyzed using weekly measurements from baseline to week 12 week of the study period (thirteen time points, 12 measurements)with a repeated measures analysis (SPSS linear mixed models), by interaction with time (week).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Urge to Drink Alcohol as Measured by the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the end of 12 weeks in treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is the change in measured urge to drink alcohol as measured by the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ), measured every 2 weeks from baseline until the last week of the study (over twelve weeks, 7 timepoint measurements of AUQ, 6 calculated changes). It is reported in terms of change per visit (every 2 weeks). AUQ measures a feeling state, and uses a 7 point (1-7)Likert scale for each of 8 items (questions). The lowest urge score is 8 (representing less urge to drink), and the highest would be tabulated as 56 (meaning more urge to drink). Repeated measures SPPS linear mixed models used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (from initiation to end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure looks at the change in blood levels of this enzyme assay from baseline, and then after 6 weeks (midpoint), and then at the endpoint (12 weeks). The analysis takes into account all three time points, and reports the average change between each of the three time points.</description>

          -  able to read at the eighth grade or higher level and show no evidence of significant
             cognitive impairment

          -  if a woman of child-bearing potential (i.e., who has not had a hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, tubal ligation or who is less than two years postmenopausal), must be
             non-lactating, practicing a reliable method of birth control including barrier method;
             and have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to initiation of treatment

          -  be willing to provide signed, informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have a current, clinically significant physical disease or abnormality (i.e.,
             neurologic, renal, rheumatologic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, pulmonary, endocrine,
             cardiovascular, hepatic, or autoimmune disease that, in the context of the study would
             represent a risk to the subject, or significant laboratory abnormalities such as
             hepatic aminotransferase levels greater than 300% of the uper limit of normal or
             direct bilirubin levels 150% of the upper limit of normal) on the basis of medical
             history, physician examination, or routine laboratory evaluation. Serum creatinine
             level of &gt; 1.2 mg/dl will also be exclusionary. Other specific exclusionary disorders
             include:

               -  patients with a history of renal calculi

               -  patients with a history of hypersensitivity to zonisamide or any sulfonamide,

                  allergic reaction

               -  patients with a significant history of systemic autoimmune disease such as lupus
                  erythematosis, fibromyalgia, or rheumatoid arthritis

             exclusionary

          -  are considered by investigators to be clinically inappropriate for study participation

          -  because individuals with a history of seizure disorder could potentially be at
             increased risk of experiencing a seizure due to their drinking, such individuals will
             also be excluded

          -  have participated in another pharmacotherapy study in the past thirty days

        <title>Change in the Urge to Drink Alcohol as Measured by the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ)</title>
        <description>This is the change in measured urge to drink alcohol as measured by the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ), measured every 2 weeks from baseline until the last week of the study (over twelve weeks, 7 timepoint measurements of AUQ, 6 calculated changes). It is reported in terms of change per visit (every 2 weeks). AUQ measures a feeling state, and uses a 7 point (1-7)Likert scale for each of 8 items (questions). The lowest urge score is 8 (representing less urge to drink), and the highest would be tabulated as 56 (meaning more urge to drink). Repeated measures SPPS linear mixed models used.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The small sample size and the short duration of treatment are limitations. High rates of retention in the treatment and adherence to the medication regimen are strengths. The concomitant psychotherapy may have caused a ceiling effect on medication.</limitations_and_caveats>
