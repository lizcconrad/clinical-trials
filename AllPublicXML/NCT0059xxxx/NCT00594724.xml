  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how the brain re-learns to control the tongue in speaking
      and swallowing when either portions of the tongue have been removed, or when the tongue has
      been treated with radiation, in order to treat cancer. We hope the results of this study will
      help us to improve healing for patients who are being treated for cancer of the tongue.

      When patients with cancer of the tongue are treated by removing parts of the tongue (surgery)
      or by destroying the cancer with radiation to the tongue, they have significant difficulty
      speaking and swallowing after such treatments. At this time, patients who have been treated
      for cancer of the tongue re-learn speaking and swallowing through exercises taught by a
      speech pathologist.

      What is needed is information on how the brain re-learns to control speaking and swallowing
      so that we can help these patients re-learn faster after their treatments.

      The purpose of this investigation is to determine cortical mechanisms of adaptation to
      surgical or radiation treatment to the tongue. This study will use a non-invasive imaging
      technique, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to investigate cortical responses to
      partial glossectomy or radiation therapy for treatment of a tongue malignancy. Patients with
      Stage I-IV (AJCC) malignancies of the tongue who are treated with surgery and or radiation
      therapy will be imaged using fMRI pre-operatively and at approximately six months
      postoperatively.

      Patterns of brain activity from the fMRI studies will be compared with matched healthy
      control subjects. The results of this investigation will provide needed information on both
      central and peripheral mechanisms of adaptation.
