  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study of five escalating dose
      levels of SD-101 in healthy male volunteers. The objectives of the study are to assess the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and pharmacodynamics of SD-101. Approximately
      40 subjects will participate.

      Once subjects have been consented, screened, and assigned to one of the dose levels of
      SD-101, subjects will receive a single subcutaneous injection of either SD-101 or placebo
      (PBS) in a ratio of 6:2.

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by occurrence of adverse events, blood and urine
      laboratory tests, physical examination findings, vital signs , and electrocardiogram
      findings. Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated by levels of blood biomarkers and serum
      cytokines, and flow cytometric cell counts. Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated by levels of
      study drug in serum.
