    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the gentamicin-collagen sponge when
      combined with standard of daily wound care is safe and effective in treating mildly infected
      skin ulcers compared to treatment with an oral antibiotic (levofloxacin) and standard daily
      wound care.

      Infected skin ulcers in patients with diabetes can be very debilitating because they are
      difficult to heal. Diabetic ulcers are responsible for frequent health care visits, and are a
      major predictor of amputation. Diabetic ulcers can be caused by a patient's inability to
      sense pain or warmth as well as peripheral vascular disease, which causes diminished blood
      flow to the foot. Early aggressive treatment is necessary to treat infection and prevent the
      need for amputation.

      Gentamicin is an antibiotic that is effective in treating certain kinds of infection.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The gentamicin-collagen sponge is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and containing gentamicin. When
      applied to an open ulcer, the collagen breaks down and the gentamicin is released into the
      ulcer, but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of gentamicin in
      the open infected ulcer may help treat the infection.

      In this study, all subjects will be given the necessary supplies and taught how to take care
      of their foot ulcer. Subjects who are randomly assigned to the gentamicin-collagen sponge
      treatment group will place a gentamicin-collagen sponge on their ulcer during daily wound
      care. Subjects who are randomly assigned to the oral levofloxacin treatment group will also
      perform daily wound care, but they will not be given the gentamicin-collagen sponge. Instead
      they will be given the antibiotic, levofloxacin to take by mouth during the treatment period.
