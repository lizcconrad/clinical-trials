    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Leuprolide Acetate for
      Injectable Suspension 22.5 mg in reducing serum testosterone to castrate levels in patients
      with prostate cancer.

      This study is an open-label, multi-center study in which a minimum of 165 patients will
      receive one (1) of three (3) lots of Oakwood Laboratories' Leuprolide Acetate for Injectable
      Suspension 22.5 mg for two cycles. A subset of patients (minimum of 12) will be assigned to
      each lot (A, B or C) and will have additional blood sampling to characterize leuprolide
      release kinetics for each dose administered.
