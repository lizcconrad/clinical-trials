      In the literature, cases of thrombosis in the venous system have been described in girls and
      women with Turner syndrome. By screening a group of women with Turner syndrome, the
      researchers wish to find out if this condition is more frequent in this patient population.

      In the literature cases of thrombosis in the venous system has been described in girls and
      women with Turner syndrome. By screening a group of women with Turner syndrome we wish to
      find out if this condition is more frequent in this patient population. Participants are
      examined with screening blood tests evaluating thromboembolic disturbances.
