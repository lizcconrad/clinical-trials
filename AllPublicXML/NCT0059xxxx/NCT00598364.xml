      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how common gene mutations are in benign and
      malignant thyroid lesions.

      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of molecular markers in
      patients with benign and malignant thyroid lesions. This study consists of:

      Retrospective review of archived surgical pathology specimens at Oregon Health &amp; Science
      University (OHSU) from patients with thyroid cancer or benign thyroid disease (nodules or
      goiter) who underwent thyroidectomy and/or neck dissection as standard of care. Molecular
      markers will be evaluated on archived tissue.

      Molecular markers will be correlated with clinical information extracted from OHSU medical
      records: histologic subtype of cancer, measures of tumor aggressiveness (capsular and
      angiolymphatic invasion, local invasion, lymph node and distant metastases, TNM stage(TNM
      Classification of Malignant Tumours)) and clinical outcome (recurrence, distant metastases
      and death).

      Patients with other malignancies presenting for standard of care services will have
      peripheral blood collected for DNA, RNA and buffy coat/white blood cells as a &quot;positive&quot;
      control for the DNA/RNA isolation techniques and mutation assays, as other cancers commonly
      express some of the same mutations. Normals will have peripheral blood collected for DNA, RNA
      and buffy coat/white blood cells as a &quot;negative&quot; control for the DNA/RNA isolation techniques
      and mutation assays.
