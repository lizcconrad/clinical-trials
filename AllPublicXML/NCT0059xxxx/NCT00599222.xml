  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss
      in the Western world. Intravitreal ranibizumab has recently become the treatment of choice
      for neovascular (AMD). Limitations to ranibizumab however include the high cost for the drug
      and the need for frequent intravitreal re-injections. The investigators' hypothesis is that
      when ranibizumab is combined with transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) the number of necessary
      retreatments with Lucentis will be significantly reduced as compared to ranibizumab alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is caused by an ingrowth of pathological
      vessels under the macula. Experimental studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) is centrally involved in this process. For this reason, anti-VEGF drugs,
      in particular ranibizumab, as become the treatment of choice for neovascular AMD. Ranibizumab
      use is limited by its high cost. Also, ranibizumab requires repeated (sometimes up to
      monthly) intravitreal injections for many years. Strategies to reduce the burden of this
      treatment on the patient as well as on the health care system will be critical. Combination
      therapy is an attractive such possibility. Transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) is a technique
      by which vascular occlusion can be induced by delivering radiation at near infrared intensity
      to the target tissue through the pupil. Several reports have indicated that TTT may be used
      to slow disease progression in patients with neovascular AMD. In this study we examine
      whether combined ranibizumab and TTT will reduce the number of ranibizumab injections
      compared with ranibizumab alone (sham TTT). The study will go on for 2 years with an interim
      report after 1 year.
