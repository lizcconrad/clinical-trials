  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 5-year extension of the AREDS protocol, in which investigators followed the
      natural course of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. Participants in the
      former AREDS protocol are eligible for this study.

      Participants have a complete eye examination once a year and are contacted at least once a
      year between visits to check on their status. The eye examination includes measurement of
      visual acuity (vision chart test) and examination of the inside of the eye after the pupils
      have been dilated with eye drops. Photographs of the inside of the eye may be taken using a
      special camera that flashes a bright light in the eye. A blood sample may be obtained to test
      for cholesterol level and genes related to inflammation.

      The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) Follow-Up protocol allows us to continue with the
      follow-up of participants who were enrolled in the clinical trial of antioxidant vitamins and
      zinc. AREDS study was designed in the beginning to determine the clinical course and
      prognosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. In addition, AREDS
      evaluated the possible risk factors associated with the development of AMD and cataracts; the
      nutritional risk factors were evaluated and published in October, 2001.

      Study results showed that antioxidant vitamins and zinc therapy reduced the risk of
      developing advanced AMD in participants with intermediate and greater risk of developing AMD
      (categories 3 and 4) by 25%. The risk of vision loss of three lines or more on the
      logarithmic visual acuity charts was also reduced by 19% for these participants. For those
      who developed AMD, their risk of vision loss was reduced by 25%. Antioxidants and zinc are
      now recommended for participants who have an intermediate risk of developing advanced AMD.

      Upon completion of the AREDS clinical trial in September, 2001, participants were invited for
      follow-up for an additional five years to collect further data on the natural course of both
      AMD and cataracts. Although the multi-center trial was complete in December, 2005, we wish to
      continue to follow these participants on an annual basis for a minimum of five years from the
      date of enrollment in this study to collect additional data.

      Although results from AREDS on the relationship of lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 long-chain
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) intake with advanced AMD were informative, the
      non-experimental sampling (observational) design limited our strength of inference. AREDS2, a
      multi-center Phase III randomized clinical trial, was designed to assess the effects of oral
      supplementation of high doses of macular xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) and/or omega-3
      LCPUFAs as a treatment for AMD, cataract and moderate vision loss. In addition to this
      objective, the study will provide information on the clinical course, prognosis, and risk
      factors for development and progression of both AMD and cataract. Other study goals include
      the evaluation of eliminating beta-carotene and/or reducing zinc in the original AREDS
      formulation on the progression and development of AMD. AREDS2 will also seek to validate the
      fundus photographic AMD scale developed from AREDS. Upon completion of AREDS2, participants
      will be invited for follow-up on an annual basis for at least five years from the date of
      enrollment in this study to collect additional data.
