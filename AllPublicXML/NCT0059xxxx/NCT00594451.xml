  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to assess the role of smoking and complex gene-smoking
      interactions in two understudied Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease affecting over 2 million people
      in the U.S. alone, a condition characterized by progressive joint destruction, significant
      work-related disability and accelerated mortality. While the precise cause of RA is unknown,
      it is clear that the disease does not result from a single heritable factor or single
      environmental exposure. Of the many environmental exposures that have been studied, cigarette
      smoking is the factor most consistently shown to be associated with RA onset. In addition to
      its role in disease susceptibility, recent studies have found that smoking, along with
      genetic factors, contribute to RA-related autoimmunity and disease severity. Moreover,
      studies to date looking at disease severity in RA have exclusively involved women of
      Caucasian/European ancestry. This is an important distinction since although RA is more
      common in women, smoking appears to be most closely linked to RA risk in men. Additionally,
      the burden of other smoking-related illnesses appears to be greatest among non-Caucasian
      populations. For this reason and because smoking rates and prevalence of risk-alleles differ
      in ethnic/racial minorities (i.e. SE and GSTM1-null polymorphism), further studies are needed
      to define the association of smoking and possible gene-smoking interactions and their role in
      autoimmunity and disease severity in these understudied populations.
