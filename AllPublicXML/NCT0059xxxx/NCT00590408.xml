  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are medications that lower blood cholesterol by inhibiting cholesterol production in
      the liver. Overall, statins are well tolerated. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients report
      muscle aches/pain while taking statins. In a very small percentage of patients (&lt;0.01%; less
      than one in 10,000 people), muscle aches/pains may be accompanied by more serious muscle
      damage. In these patients, statins must be discontinued. In some reports, patients taking
      statins have reduced blood levels of coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 is an essential protein which
      is present in all human cells needed for normal cell function. Coenzyme Q10 has been tested
      in patients with heart failure where it has been shown to be safe and effective. Many
      patients with heart conditions take coenzyme Q10, but the risks and benefits of
      supplementation with this product is unknown. Coenzyme Q10 is considered a dietary supplement
      and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any medical condition.
      Coenzyme Q10 has very few, if any, side effects. Upset stomach (gastritis), headache, body
      ache, and low blood pressure have been reported. The objectives of this project are to test
      the efficacy and safety of coenzyme Q10 in treating muscle aches/pain in patients already
      taking statins who develop these symptoms.
