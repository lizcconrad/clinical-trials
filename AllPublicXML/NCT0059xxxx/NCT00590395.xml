  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the ability of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
      tomography (FDG-PET) and Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) as a
      direct method of detecting infection and/or inflammation of the gallbladder.

      Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine scan used to
      evaluate patients suspected of having acute cholecystitis (infection/inflammation of the
      gallbladder). Because it is an indirect test that looks for obstruction of the cystic duct
      structure, there are many causes for a false-positive HIDA study. There is a need for a more
      sensitive and specific test that can accurately assess gallbladder infection and/or
      inflammation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a
      direct means of detecting patients with acute cholecystitis. FDG is an imaging agent that has
      previously been shown to accumulate in areas of infection and/or inflammation. The location
      and intensity of FDG accumulation in the body can be detected with a camera system called a
      &quot;positron emission tomography&quot; (PET) camera. In theory, this test should be effective in
      detecting acute infection and/or inflammation of the gallbladder.

      Consenting participants will receive injection of FDG one hour prior to the FDG-PET/CT
      examination. The participant will then be imaged using a PET/CT machine, which is a special
      camera system that is capable of performing both a PET and CT scan at the same time. A CT
      scan is an anatomical imaging test and, for this research study, will mainly be used to
      localize the area of 18FDG accumulation recorded by the PET scan. The examination will take
      approximately one hour.

    <description>20 patients with suspected acute cholecystitis and a positive HIDA will be included in the study. This is purposely a highly selective population which most likely will have surgical proof of the findings. Subjects will receive an FDG PET/CT exam to determine the presence of gallbladder inflammation/infection(cholecystitis). Please note that 18FDG is an FDA approved radiopharmaceutical.</description>
