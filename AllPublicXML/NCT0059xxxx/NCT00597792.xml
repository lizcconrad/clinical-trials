    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect post-marketing data on patient outcomes and
      satisfaction following treatment with the Plicator™. The outcomes will be tracked through
      analysis of patient Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires and medication use. The QoL and
      medication use questionaires will be administered and documented twice before the procedure
      and then again at outlined intervals following the procedure. Additionally, financial
      measures will be evaluated (i.e. pre-procedural and procedural time and costs,
      staffing/personnel needs during procedure, anesthesia and related costs, recovery time and
      associated cost, etc.) and post-procedure GERD-related medical history questionnaires will be
      completed.

      This post-market evaluation is a multi-center study design using the NDO Surgical, Inc.
      Plicator as the treatment device. Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by comparing QoL and
      medication use before and after treatment with the device. Patient follow-ups will be
      completed at 1 week and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post treatment.

    <description>A low-profile (≤6mm) gastroscope was advanced and an EGD followed by Savary wire placement was performed. The gastroscope was then removed and the Plicator was advanced directly over the wire and into the stomach. The gastroscope was re-introduced through the Plicator, and the Plicator was retroflexed under direct endoscopic visualization to the anterior gastric cardia, approximately 1cm below the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The Plicator arms were opened and the endoscopic tissue retractor was advanced deeply into the gastric cardia. The gastric wall was then retracted into the open arms of the Plicator. The arms were closed and a single, transmural pledgeted suture was deployed. The Plicator and gastroscope were then removed and the gastroscope re-inserted to evaluate the post-plication GE junction.</description>
