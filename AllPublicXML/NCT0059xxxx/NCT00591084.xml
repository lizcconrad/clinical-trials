      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ginsenoside-Rd for acute
      ischemic stroke.

    <textblock>
      A major contributor to brain injury after stroke is disordered inward flow of Ca2+ and its
      toxic accumulation in the nervous system following cerebral ischemia. Ginsenoside-Rd, a
      purified component from total saponins of Panax notoginseng, has a molecular formula of
      C48H82O18•3H2O with a molecular weight of 1001.2. Ginsenoside-Rd has been shown to inhibit
      receptor-operated Ca2+ influx through receptor-and-store-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCC) ,
      attenuate oxidative stress in stroke, reduce the size of the cerebral infarction and preserve
      brain functioning in animal models of acute ischemic stroke.
