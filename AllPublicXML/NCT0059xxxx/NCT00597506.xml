  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the safest and most effective dose of the drugs
      bevacizumab and everolimus given in combination for the treatment of metastatic colorectal
      cancer. Bevacizumab (also called Avastinâ„¢) is a drug that is given intravenously (through a
      vein). Everolimus (also called RAD001) is a tablet that is taken by mouth.

      Bevacizumab is a protein that is thought to prevent the formation of blood vessels tumors
      need to grow. RAD001 has multiple capabilities, like bevacizumab it may prevent the formation
      of blood vessels needed by tumors and it also may stop tumor growth.

      This study will try to find the safest dose of these drugs that can be tolerated when taken
      in combination. The study will look at how the drugs work in the body, and will see if there
      is any effect on metastatic colorectal cancer.

    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized expanded cohort trial of bevacizumab and RAD001 for patients
      with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer is designed to assess preliminary efficacy as
      well as the safety and tolerability of this combination. Patients will be accrued to this
      study at Duke University Medical Center and The Duke Oncology Outreach Network (DON)

      After satisfying eligibility and screening criteria, patients will be treated on 28 day
      cycles.

        -  The treatment regimen is as follows:

           10 mg/kg Bevacizumab intravenous on days 1 and 15 and 10mg everolimus (RAD001) daily by
           mouth

        -  Toxicity will be assessed every visit, and as clinically indicated.

        -  Efficacy will be assessed every 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated.

        -  Patients may remain on treatment as long as they are deemed to be clinically benefiting
           from treatment, do not have progressive disease on restaging imaging (Section 6.0), or
           do not have any other reason for discontinuation of treatment as outlined in Section
           3.4.

        -  Patients will undergo correlative studies as outlined in the study protocol

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum that
             has progressed on, or patient could not tolerate, fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin,
             irinotecan, and cetuximab and/or panitumumab chemotherapy. Disease must be measurable
             or evaluable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria

          -  Patients must not have had radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy or
             chemotherapy for cancer within the 28 days prior to study day 1. Patients must not
             have had major surgery within the 28 days prior to study day 1 or minor surgical
             procedures within the 7 days prior to study day 1.

             and study PI immediately. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be
             affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective
