  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The laboratory test, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), has become well established as a marker of
      inflammation. Recently a high CRP level (indicating an increase in inflammation) was
      identified as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. We are conducting this study with
      patients such as yourself with atrial fibrillation who are planning to undergo cardioversion
      to determine what sort of relationship exists between CRP levels and atrial fibrillation. We
      will then look at success rates of converting atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm,
      compared to patients' CRP levels.
