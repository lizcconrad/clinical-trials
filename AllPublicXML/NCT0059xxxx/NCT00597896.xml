  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the medication pramipexole (Mirapex) may be
      able to improve cognitive problems (i.e. difficulties with thinking, memory, and
      concentration) that may be associated with bipolar disorder.

      To address the primary aim, the study is an eight-week, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled treatment trial of pramipexole in 50 euthymic bipolar I and II disorder
      (BPD) patients, who demonstrate cognitive impairment.

    <measure>Double-blind: Change From Baseline in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21) Total Score at Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is a clinician-rated scale used to rate depression severity. The items are rated on either a 5-point (0 to 4) or a 3-point (0 to 2) scale. The 5-point scale uses a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to severe), and 4 (very severe). Higher scores indicate worsening. The responses are summed to yield the HAM-D-21 score that ranges from 0-64.</description>

    <measure>Double-blind: Change From Baseline in Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M)Total Score at Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CARS-M is a 15-item clinician-rated scale designed to assess severity of both manic and psychotic symptoms. There are 2 subscales: a mania scale and a scale for psychotic symptoms and disorganization. There are a total of 15 items on the CARS-M, each of which is rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0/Absent to 5/Extreme), with the exception of item 15 (&quot;Insight&quot;) which is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. These items yield two subscale scores—one for Mania (items 1-10) and one for Psychosis (items 11-15). Higher scores indicate worsening. The responses are summed to yield the CARS-M-15 score that ranges from 0-74.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects between 18 and 65 years of age, who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for BPD I or II (by SCID) and
             confirmed in the diagnostic consensus conference will be included.

          -  Subjects must also meet criteria for euthymia described above.

          -  All subjects must be taking a standard mood stabilizer at a stable therapeutic dose
             (i.e. lithium, carbamazepine, valproate, lamotrigine).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of central nervous system (CNS) trauma, neurological disorder,
             Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), or learning disability will be
             excluded.

          -  Subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of current or recent substance abuse or dependence
             (in the previous 1 month) will be excluded.

          -  Moreover, subjects with rapid-cycling during the past year will be excluded (based on
             SCID).

          -  Any subject with an active, unstable medical problem that may interfere with cognition
             will be excluded based on the investigator's judgment.

          -  While medication status is an important consideration in any study of bipolar
             disorder, the exclusion of patients taking any medication is not practical, given the
             high prevalence of combination pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder. To help control
             for medication effects on cognition, we plan to limit the types of medications allowed
             by excluding certain medications with a known impact on cognitive performance.

               -  Subjects taking clozapine will be excluded due to it's potential overlapping
                  mechanisms of action with pramipexole.

               -  Subjects taking prescription or over-the counter medications may also be excluded
                  if these medications have been shown to impact cognition (i.e. diphenhydramine).

               -  The use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, or sleeping pills, within 6 hours of
                  neurocognitive testing will not be allowed. In addition, patients taking
                  topiramate, tricyclic antidepressants, or anticholinergic medications that are
                  known to impact cognition will be excluded from participation.

               -  Subjects taking any medications that are known to interact with pramipexole (i.e.
                  Zantac, Tagamet, Reglan, Benemid, Probalan, Compazine, Phenergan, quinidine,
                  selegiline, verapamil, and any other medication with a known interaction) will
                  also be excluded.

        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is a clinician-rated scale used to rate depression severity. The items are rated on either a 5-point (0 to 4) or a 3-point (0 to 2) scale. The 5-point scale uses a rating of 0 (absent), 1 (doubtful to mild), 2 (mild to moderate), 3 (moderate to severe), and 4 (very severe). Higher scores indicate worsening. The responses are summed to yield the HAM-D-21 score that ranges from 0-64.</description>

        <description>The CARS-M is a 15-item clinician-rated scale designed to assess severity of both manic and psychotic symptoms. There are 2 subscales: a mania scale and a scale for psychotic symptoms and disorganization. There are a total of 15 items on the CARS-M, each of which is rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0/Absent to 5/Extreme), with the exception of item 15 (“Insight”) which is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. These items yield two subscale scores—one for Mania (items 1-10) and one for Psychosis (items 11-15). Higher scores indicate worsening. The responses are summed to yield the CARS-M-15 score that ranges from 0-74.</description>

          <description>Using a key, the examinee copies symbols that are paired with numbers within a specified time limit. Measures visual scanning and graphomotor speed. The standard scores were reported for this measure. Values indicate the change from baseline to week 8, with positive values reflecting higher scores at week 8 and negative values reflecting lower scores at week 8.</description>

        <description>The Stroop Color-Word Test consists of a word page with words printed in black ink, a color page with ‘Xs’ printed in color, and a color-word page where the color and the word do not match. The examinee reads the words or names the ink colors as quickly as possible within a time limit. Measures selective attention and inhibitory control. The raw scores (total number of words read) for each trial were reported for this measure. Values indicate the change from baseline to week 8, with positive values reflecting higher scores at week 8 and negative values reflecting lower scores at week 8.</description>

        <description>The examinee is required to recall a list of 12 words over 3 immediate learning trials, a delayed recall trial and a recognition trial. Measures learning and retention of verbal material. The total number of words recalled during the delayed recall trial was reported. Values indicate the change from baseline to week 8, with positive values reflecting higher scores at week 8 and negative values reflecting lower scores at week 8.</description>

        <description>The examinee is required to say as many words as they can think of in one minute that begin with a given letter of the alphabet. The task contains three trials. Measures phonetic verbal fluency. The raw score (total words recorded across the three trials) was reported. Values indicate the change from baseline to week 8, with positive values reflecting higher scores at week 8 and negative values reflecting lower scores at week 8.</description>
