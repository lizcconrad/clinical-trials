  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased brain glutamate and its N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors found in the brain of
      younger Rett syndrome (RTT) patients cause toxic damage to neurons (the brain's nerve cells),
      and contributing to EEG spikes. Dextromethorphan (DM) acts by blocking NMDA/glutamate
      receptors. This study is being done to determine if DM will prevent the harmful
      over-stimulation of the neurons thereby reducing EEG spike activity. Treatment with DM
      consists of one of 3 different doses (0.25 mg/kg per day; or 2.5 mg/kg/day; or 5mg/kg/day),
      and aims to find out which dose if any will help improve EEG abnormalities, behavior,
      cognition, and reduce seizures, as well as improve breathing abnormalities, motor
      capabilities, bone density, and GI dysfunction.

      The study will include 90 females and males with RTT, 2 years-14.99 years of age, with a
      mutation in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene, and spikes on EEG, with or without
      clinical seizures.

      Patients meeting eligibility criteria(mutation +ve and having EEG spikes), will be admitted
      to the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital and will have
      pharmacokinetics of DM determined to establish that they are rapid metabolizers of the drug.
      The baseline studies on initial admission include neurological, neuropsychology,EEG,
      gastroenterology, Occupational and Physical therapy evaluations. If the subject is a rapid
      metabolizer they will be randomized to one of the three drug doses. They are contacted by
      telephone, weekly in the first month, and monthly thereafter. They will be examined by a
      neurologist at 2 weeks,1 month, and 3 months during the drug trial. At each of these visits
      they will also be monitored for changes in complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and EKG.
      At the end of the 6 month drug trial the patients will be readmitted to Johns Hopkins
      Hospital when all baseline studies are repeated. Cost of travel, hospitalization and interim
      tests are free to participants.

    <description>The Screen for Social Interaction (SSI) is a 54-item parent/caregiver-report screening instrument that emphasizes reciprocal social interaction including joint attention skills. The items are positive (prosocial) and are scored on a four-point frequency scale (child displays the behavior &quot;almost never&quot; = 0 to &quot;almost all the time&quot; = 3). Thus lower scores reflect a slower or delayed development, and higher scores reflect more normative development. SSI total scores range from 0-162. There are no subscales. Difference in Screen for Social Interaction (SSI) mean scores between baseline and 6 months post-treatment for each treatment arm are reported.</description>

        <title>Difference in SSI Mean Score at Six Months Compared to Baseline for Each Treatment Arm.</title>
        <description>The Screen for Social Interaction (SSI) is a 54-item parent/caregiver-report screening instrument that emphasizes reciprocal social interaction including joint attention skills. The items are positive (prosocial) and are scored on a four-point frequency scale (child displays the behavior “almost never” = 0 to “almost all the time” = 3). Thus lower scores reflect a slower or delayed development, and higher scores reflect more normative development. SSI total scores range from 0-162. There are no subscales. Difference in Screen for Social Interaction (SSI) mean scores between baseline and 6 months post-treatment for each treatment arm are reported.</description>
