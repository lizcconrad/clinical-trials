  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between peripheral venous saturation and central hemodynamics (including
      right and left heart filling pressures and cardiac output), mixed venous oxygen saturation,
      and contemporary biomarkers of heart failure is not clear. We aim to determine the
      relationship between mixed venous, central venous, and peripheral venous oxygen saturation in
      patients with advanced (class III or IV) heart failure. We will determine the relationship
      between cardiac output measured via thermodilution and the Fick equation calculated using
      concurrent oxygen saturations from the distal PA, central vein, and peripheral vein. We also
      aim to examine the relationship of selected cardiac biomarkers with cardiac filling pressures
      and cardiac output over time in patients with decompensated heart failure.

        The study population will consist of 30 patients admitted to the Massachusetts General
        Hospital Coronary Care Unit (CCU) for PA catheter-directed therapy for advanced heart
        failure. Only patients for whom the attending cardiologist has already decided upon
        PA-catheter insertion will be recruited for the study.

        Potential subjects will be identified by the CCU attending cardiologist, and a study nurse
        will review each patient for the exclusion criteria as above. Final decisions on patient
        eligibility will be made by Dr. Wang.
