      To demonstrate that the device is safe and potentially efficacious for use as a left
      ventricular cardiac assist device for postcardiotomy patients who require hemodynamic support
      post weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Postcardiotomy patients, weaned from a
      cardiopulmonary bypass system (CPB) in need for hemodynamic support due to ineffective
      standard medical therapy will be considered for enrollment. An attempt shall be made to
      reverse the hemodynamic situation with medications (e.g. inotropes, vasopressors). The
      IMPELLA RECOVER LP/LD 5.0 will be implanted by the surgeon when no improvement in
      hemodynamics is observed.
