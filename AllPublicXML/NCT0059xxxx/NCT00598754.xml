    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform ground-based research to study what happens to the
      heart muscle in space. People who have problems with their aortic valve have an increase in
      the amount of muscle in the left ventricle of the heart. After valve surgery, the amount of
      muscle should decrease and return to normal. Astronauts lose heart muscle mass during space
      flight. Our study will look at these changes in your heart, which we believe are similar to
      what happens during long term space travel.

      This study will look at the accuracy of three dimensional ultrasound imaging (echo) in
      monitoring the changes in heart size and function following aortic valve replacement. We are
      studying ways to prevent health-related problems that men and women will face on
      long-duration space missions.

      The hypothesis is that serial two dimensional and three dimensional echo will show accurate
      changes in the left ventricle mass and volume following aortic valve replacement for aortic
      stenosis or regurgitation

      Diagnostic Three Dimensional Echocardiography Study Protocol

      A. Aims The overall purpose of this study is to perform ground-based research, development,
      and validation aimed at optimizing diagnostic ultrasound in manned spaceflight, with the
      following unifying hypothesis: Serial 3D ultrasound examinations will enhance diagnostic
      capabilities in manned spaceflight.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To optimize acquisition methods for 3D sonography using reconstruction and real-time
           techniques

        2. To determine the utility of serial 3D ultrasound examinations in identifying renal
           calculi and their complications including the development and resolution of
           hydronephrosis and calyceal dilatation.

        3. To determine the utility of serial 2D and 3D ultrasound examinations in demonstrating
           cardiac remodeling (changes in cardiac dimensions, volume, mass and function) and
           defining its determinants after left ventricular unloading following aortic valve
           replacement for aortic stenosis or regurgitation.

        4. To determine whether changes in plasma BNP levels accurately reflect changes in LV mass
           and volume.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Serial 3D ultrasound examinations will allow accurate diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and
           tracking of complications including hydronephrosis and calyceal dilatation

        2. Serial 2D and 3D ultrasound will allow accurate tracking of changes in LV mass and
           volume following aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis or regurgitation.

        3. Changes in plasma BNP levels will fall in proportion to the decrease in LV mass and
           volume.
