      Small vascular malformations (SVM) on the vocal fold is a common problem that can disturb the
      voice. The pulsed dye laser (PDL) has been successfully used for treatment of blood vessel
      abnormalities in surface tissue, through its high selectivity for destroying targeted blood
      vessels while sparing normal tissue. However, there is no study to determine its clinical
      benefit for treatment of SVMs on vocal fords. In this proposed study, we plan to make such a
      determination.We will determine whether PDL will produce better and quicker voice improvement
      than the conventional surgeries, in 20 patients (10 cases of each group) with vocal fold SVM.
      We expect that this less invasive laser treatment will provide an ideal and excellent option
      for this disease.

      Clinically, small vascular malformations (SVM) on the vocal fold is a common problem that can
      disturb the voice. Currently, this problem is treated with endoscopic microsurgery with the
      use of a Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser or other microsurgeries. However, those treatments are
      unsatisfactory because of their invasive nature. The pulsed dye laser (PDL) has been
      successfully used for treatment of blood vessel abnormalities in surface tissue, through its
      high selectivity for destroying targeted blood vessels while sparing normal tissue. Even
      thought this process has been in use clinically for the past 5 years, there is no study to
      determine its clinical benefit for treatment of SVMs on vocal fords, by comparing it with
      routine surgeries. In this proposed study, we plan to make such a determination, by comparing
      the voice recovery and voice improvement between this laser and those routine surgeries (with
      CO2 laser or &quot;cold&quot; instrument).

      Our specific aim is to determine whether PDL will produce better and quicker voice
      improvement than the conventional surgeries, in 20 patients (10 cases of each group) with
      vocal fold SVM. This is the first study to determine clinical benefit of the microvascular
      targeting (MVT) technique of laser to treat vocal fold SVMs, by a comparison of the voice
      results between these two groups. We expect that this less invasive laser treatment will
      provide an ideal and excellent alternative to current surgical approaches for treatment of
      this disease.
