      BACKGROUND. Arterial access site complications remain the most frequent adverse events after
      percutaneous transluminal procedures. We investigated the safety and efficacy of the
      pro-coagulant wound dressing Neptune Pad ® compared to conventional manual compression for
      access site management after peripheral percutaneous interventions.

      METHODS. We enrolled 201 consecutive patients and randomly assigned patients for Neptune Pad
      ® (n=100) vs. conventional manual compression (n=101). Patients were followed clinically
      until hospital discharge and by duplex ultrasound at 24 hours postprocedure for occurrence of
      access site complications. Time-to-hemostasis and time-to-ambulation were recorded, patients´
      and physicians´ discomfort were measured using a visual analogue scale.

    <description>The Neptune Pad ® (Biotronik GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) is a soft and hydrophilic wound dressing, which has been developed to accelerate local hemostasis, reduce compression times, enable early ambulation and minimize the risk for bleeding complications. Neptune Pad ® consists of calcium alginate, which is cationically charged and exerts potent procoagulant properties.</description>

    <description>The most common technique for puncture site management is manual compression. This technique requires an extended pressure on the puncture site, and after achievement of hemostasis a pressure bandage is applied for several hours at bed rest.</description>
