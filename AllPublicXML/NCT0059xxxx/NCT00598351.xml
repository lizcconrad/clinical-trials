    <textblock>
      This study will examine over the long-term the progress of patients with neurofibromatosis
      Type 2 (NF2), a condition associated with tumors of the nerves, brain and spinal cord. It
      will study patients tumors to learn how fast they can grow and if certain factors might
      affect their growth. It will also examine the effects of the tumors on patients abilities to
      carry out activities of daily living.

      People between 8 and 75 years of age with NF2 may be eligible for this study. Participants
      undergo the following procedures:

      Initial evaluation, including hearing, eye and balance testing, gait (walk) testing, magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain and spine, blood tests, and physical and
      neurological examinations.

      MRI scans of the brain and spine every 6 months to follow the size and number of tumors.

      Physical and neurological examinations and blood tests every 6 months.

      Auditory tests every 12 months. These tests evaluate middle and inner ear function and the
      patient s ability to hear tones at different frequencies and to hear words at different
      volumes. The subject responds to tones and words that are delivered through earphones.

      Eye examination every 1 to 2 years.

      Gait testing every 12 months if a spinal cord tumor causes problems with sensation or muscle
      control in the arms and legs Subjects joints are measured while they walk across a room
      several times as scientific cameras record their movements.

      Vestibular testing if the patient experiences changes in balance or undergoes treatment for
      vestibular schwannoma (a tumor that develops on the hearing and balance nerves). These tests
      check the function of various components of the balance system (eyes, inner ear, or leg and
      body sensation and muscles). They include:

        -  Videoelectronystagmogram Tracks subjects eye movements while they follow moving red
           lights with their eyes.

        -  Vestibular evoked myogenic potential Assesses subjects neck muscle movements in response
           to noise.

        -  Posturography Determines which parts of the balance system the subject relies on most.
           Subjects stand on a platform and try to maintain their balance while changes are made to
           the platform and the environment.

        -  Rotary chair test Subjects eye movements are monitored as they follow red spots and
           strips of light with their eyes while seated in a rotary chair that turns side to side
           at several speeds.

      Objective

      The objective of this prospective natural history study on neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is
      to gain clinical and molecular insight into the effects of this tumor suppressor syndrome on
      tumor development and progression and to identify factors linked to symptom evolution.

      Study Population

      Two hundred fifty participants, ages 8-75, with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of NF2 will
      participate in this study.

      Design

      Study participants will be evaluated with a thorough physical and neurologic examination upon
      enrollment. This initial outpatient evaluation will include ophthalmologic examination,
      magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the craniospinal axis, NF2 research blood
      procurement and serum biomarker testing. Participants with measurable hearing will have
      audiology assessment performed during the initial visit. Participants with untreated
      vestibular schwannomas will have vestibular assessment performed during the initial visit.
      Whole genome/whole exome sequencing may be performed on blood or tissue obtained from
      subjects enrolled in this study who have surgery under a related study.

      Participants with tumors that affect speech and swallowing production will be seen by a
      speech language pathologist at the following visit, where a standard clinical assessment of
      speech and swallowing function will be done. In participants with tumors that affect
      independent functioning associated with activities of daily living, a physical therapy and
      occupational therapy assessment will be performed at the following visit.

      Subjects will be followed as outpatients for five years, during which clinical, radiologic
      and serum biomarker evaluation will be performed annually. Auditory testing will be performed
      annually for participants with measurable hearing. Participants with initially untreated
      vestibular schwannomas will be followed annually with vestibular testing. Ophthalmologic
      evaluation will performed every one to three years, depending on the severity of ocular
      lesions. Peri-operative speech and swallowing reassessments will be performed as medically
      indicated, when tumors that may affect these abilities are treated. Functional status testing
      will be repeated peri-operatively and annually thereafter when tumors that may affect
      independent functioning are treated.

      If clinical symptoms attributable to any NF2-associated lesion are progressive in nature or
      warrant treatment intervention, testing may be repeated more frequently.

      Outcome measures

      Based on data derived from this study, we hope to identify factors that predict tumor
      development, forecast tumor growth and that underlie symptom formation. These findings should
      permit the safer treatment of the subset of tumors that will cause symptoms and avoid the
      unnecessary treatment of lesions that will remain stable (not requiring treatment) in these
      participants. Moreover, this prospective natural history study should be useful in
      identifying the stochastic factors that underlie the biology of these tumors.
