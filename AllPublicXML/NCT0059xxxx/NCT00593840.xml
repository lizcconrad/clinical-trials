  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if reducing or eliminating radiation treatment to
      one or both sides of the neck where there is no evidence of cancer can help spare the side
      effects of radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. In this study, the investigators
      plan to reduce the amount of radiation treatment received to healthy tissue

    <time_frame>12 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrence in a PN0 neck that was not treated is the critical endpoint in this study.
Recurrence is defined as the return of cancer after treatment
Recurrence is determined by a CT, PET/CT, or MRI and it will be fused with the original treatment planning CT scan. This will allow correlation between the original dose distribution and contours with any recurrent disease.</description>

    <measure>Patterns of Failure Associated With Implementation of Primary Objective</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years from completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who demonstrate a local failure during follow-up, a computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, or magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) scan is fused with the original treatment planning CT scan using the computational environment for radiation research (CERR) developed at Washington University Medical Center. The methodology to transfer the digital imaging study via network to the radiation therapy research servers is mature. The original dose distribution and contours are correlated with the recurrent disease noted on the follow up imaging study. The recurrence is then classified as infield, marginal to the treatment field, or out of the treatment field depending on the dose received by the recurrent disease. Failures that occur in the treatment field are due to aspects of tumor biology rather than errors in the volume irradiated. As has been the case in our historical controls, the investigators expect most failures to be in the treatment field.</description>

    <description>-This study provides guidelines for volume to be contoured during IMRT based on tumor site and stage of tumor site. The clinical tumor volume (CTV)1 will be treated to 66 Cy in 33 fractions or 60 Gy in 30 fractions. The CTV2 will be treated to 54 Gy in 33 fractions or 52 Gy in 30 fractions. The CTV3 will be modified based on tumor site and stage of tumor site in order to reduce volume.</description>

        <title>Patterns of Failure Associated With Implementation of Primary Objective</title>
        <description>For patients who demonstrate a local failure during follow-up, a computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, or magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) scan is fused with the original treatment planning CT scan using the computational environment for radiation research (CERR) developed at Washington University Medical Center. The methodology to transfer the digital imaging study via network to the radiation therapy research servers is mature. The original dose distribution and contours are correlated with the recurrent disease noted on the follow up imaging study. The recurrence is then classified as infield, marginal to the treatment field, or out of the treatment field depending on the dose received by the recurrent disease. Failures that occur in the treatment field are due to aspects of tumor biology rather than errors in the volume irradiated. As has been the case in our historical controls, the investigators expect most failures to be in the treatment field.</description>

          <title>Arm 1: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)</title>
          <description>-This study provides guidelines for volume to be contoured during IMRT based on tumor site and stage of tumor site. The clinical tumor volume (CTV)1 will be treated to 66 Cy in 33 fractions or 60 Gy in 30 fractions. The CTV2 will be treated to 54 Gy in 33 fractions or 52 Gy in 30 fractions. The CTV3 will be modified based on tumor site and stage of tumor site in order to reduce volume.</description>
