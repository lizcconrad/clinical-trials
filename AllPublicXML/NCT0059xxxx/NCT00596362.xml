    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of Avastin introduced into
      the inside of the eyeball in causing shrinkage of the uveal melanoma (tumor of the eye).
      Avastin is an anti-cancer drug specially designed to shrink blood vessels within tumors.
