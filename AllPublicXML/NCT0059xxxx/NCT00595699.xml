      This is a research study evaluating the use of escitalopram (LexaproÂ®) for the treatment of
      major depression in subjects with temporal lobe epilepsy. The purpose of the study is to
      measure the severity and change in depressive and anxiety symptoms after 10 weeks of study
      treatment with escitalopram or placebo as measured by certain rating scales and
      questionnaires. In addition, the study will measure the frequency of seizures using a patient
      diary during the study. Finally, the study will assess the change in the quality of life
      using rating scales.
