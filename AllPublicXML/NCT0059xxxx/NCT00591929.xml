  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased range of motion is common after fractures around the knee and can impact a
      patient's ability to perform activities of daily living such as rising from a seated position
      or getting in and out of a bathtub. A continuous passive motion (CPM) machine is a machine
      that continuously moves a joint (such as the knee) without the patient having to use the
      muscles in his/her leg. A goal of this therapy is to maintain as much motion as possible
      following this injury. This study is a randomized, prospective study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of CPM in maintaining knee range of motion following open reduction and
      internal fixation (ORIF) of fractures around the knee
