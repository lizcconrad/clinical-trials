  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project we are collecting cerebrospinal fluid and blood from patients at Vanderbilt
      Medical Center who have a subarachnoid hemorrhage which has followed the rupture of a brain
      aneurysm. We then propose to study the cerebrospinal fluid using a novel microscopic laser
      directed mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI) available at Vanderbilt. The cerebrospinal fluid
      and blood will then be analysed for different biological markers, protein expression and gene
      expression. These markers will then be statistically correlated with clinical data including
      prediction of vasospasm, time to vasospasm and response to standard therapy.

      In this project we are collecting cerebrospinal fluid and blood from patients at Vanderbilt
      Medical Center who have a subarachnoid hemorrhage which has followed the rupture of a brain
      aneurysm. We then propose to study the cerebrospinal fluid using a novel microscopic laser
      directed mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI) available at Vanderbilt. The cerebrospinal fluid
      and blood will then be analysed for different biological markers, protein expression and gene
      expression. These markers will then be statistically correlated with clinical data including
      prediction of vasospasm, time to vasospasm and response to standard therapy.

      The goal of this study is to determine cerebrospinal fluid and serum markers which will be
      predictive of vasospasm. This in turn may lead to improved outcomes in this population of
      patients.

      The data will be compared to excess cerebrospinal fluid collected from patients who are
      undergoing lumbar puncture in the Neurology Clinic or excess cerebrospinal fluid from
      patients undergoing cranial surgery for other causes like tumor excision.

      For patients enrolled in the study, cerebrospinal fluid will be collected by either lumbar
      puncture or external ventricular catheter. Specimens will be collected immediately
      pre-operatively if an external ventricular drain is in place or intraoperatively if an
      external ventricular drain is not present. We will also collect cerebrospinal fluid post
      operatively after placement of an external ventricular drain regularly from the excess
      cerebrospinal fluid that has been collected in the drainage bag. CSF will be collected in a
      serial fashion at multiple time points: immediately post operatively, during vasospasm and
      before the external ventricular drain is removed.
