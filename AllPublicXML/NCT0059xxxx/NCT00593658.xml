  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) results from intrapulmonary microvascular dilatation that
      impairs arterial oxygenation in the setting of cirrhosis or portal hypertension. As many as
      10-20% of cirrhotics being evaluated for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have advanced
      HPS and mortality is greater in those with HPS than in those without HPS. Currently, OLT is
      the only effective treatment, although post-operative mortality in HPS is increased relative
      to cirrhotic patients without HPS, with a one-year survival of between 68-80 %. Therefore, an
      effective medical therapy for advanced HPS could improve both pre-operative and
      post-operative mortality.

      Recent work in experimental models of HPS has revealed that both nitric oxide
      synthase-derived nitric oxide and heme oxygenase-derived carbon monoxide cause intrapulmonary
      vasodilatation. These alterations appear to be driven in part by TNF-α modulation of
      pulmonary blood flow and intravascular monocyte accumulation. Pentoxifylline is a nonspecific
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor with inhibitory effects on TNF-α and has recently been shown to
      be beneficial in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis where TNF-α overproduction
      contributes to liver injury. In experimental HPS, pentoxifylline administration also
      decreases the severity of oxygenation abnormalities. However, pentoxifylline therapy has been
      associated with dose limiting side effects in patients with liver disease and the
      tolerability of pentoxifylline in cirrhotic patients with advanced HPS is unknown. Therefore,
      this open label single arm clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of 8 weeks of pentoxifylline in cirrhotic patients with advanced HPS being
      considered for OLT.
