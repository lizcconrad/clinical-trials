      -  Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history, physical examination
           (including digital rectal examination), serum PSA, free/total testosterone, lipids,
           serum isoflavone levels (genistein, daidzein, and equol), and assessment of quality of
           life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Prostate, FACT-P questionnaire).

        -  Whole blood will be obtained prior to initiation of the study to assess for DNA
           polymorphism.

        -  Follow-up serum PSA levels to assess efficacy were obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
           after initiation of treatment.

        -  Medical history, physical examination, serum testosterone, lipids, isoflavone, and
           quality of life were assessed at 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment.
