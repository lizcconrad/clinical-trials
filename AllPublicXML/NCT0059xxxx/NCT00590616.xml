  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic atheroma has been correlated with traditional cardiac risk factors, coronary, carotid,
      renal and peripheral atherosclerosis, and is probably a manifestation of generalized
      atherosclerosis. Aortic atheroma has also been shown to be associated with atrial
      fibrillation, aortic valve sclerosis, and other calcification of the fibrous skeleton of the
      heart. None of the previous studies have looked at the noninvasive prediction of aortic
      atheroma using the history and physical signs of cardiovascular disease. This would be a time
      and cost-effective bedside diagnostic tool that would be useful prior to cardiac surgery,
      cardiac catheterization, and workup of ischemic stroke patients, especially when
      transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is being considered for diagnosis but cannot be obtained
      due to previously mentioned reasons. Although physical examination of peripheral vascular
      disease is non-specific, a combination of physical examination signs increases the
      probability of generalized atherosclerosis.

        All patients referred for TEE examination, since the primary end-point would be diagnosis
        of aortic atheromatous disease on TEE. Prevalence of aortic atheroma, based on previous
        data at Creighton and other studies in any aortic atheroma ~50% and severe aortic atheroma
        ~5%.
