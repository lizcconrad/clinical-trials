  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal is to determine whether adding cognitive behavioral therapy to physician
      management will increase the efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone treatment in an office-based
      primary care setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the need for drug counseling aimed at reducing illicit drug use and increasing
      buprenorphine/naloxone adherence, the proposed study compares manual-guided Physician
      Management (PM) and PM combined with on-site manual-guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
      in a 24 week randomized clinical trial of buprenorphine/naloxone in a heterogeneous
      population of opioid dependent patients (N=140) in a primary care clinic. PM, consistent with
      federal regulations, is designed to reflect usual care by primary care physicians and
      includes referral to ancillary services. CBT will be provided by skilled psychologists in
      weekly sessions for the first 12 weeks and focuses on reducing illicit drug use and
      increasing buprenorphine/naloxone adherence. The study will test the hypothesis that that the
      addition of CBT to PM will lead to decreased illicit drug use, durable effects after
      counseling has been discontinued, improved buprenorphine/naloxone adherence and will
      demonstrate incremental cost-effectiveness in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone
      maintenance in primary care. Primary outcome measures include reductions in illicit opioid
      use and abstinence achievement, as assessed by weekly urine toxicology testing and self
      report. Secondary outcome measures include retention in treatment, reductions in cocaine use
      and HIV risk, decreased criminal activity and improved health and employment status.
      Utilization and costs of services, spillover effects in the PCC, and patient and staff
      perceptions of benefits and problems associated with primary care agonist maintenance
      treatment will also be evaluated. The results of this study will help define the role of
      professional evidence-based drug counseling in expanding access to treatment with
      buprenorphine/naloxone.

    <description>Short Form (36) Health Survey overall score ranges from 0 to 100. Computed as the mean of all SF-36 subscales.
The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with only 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index. Lower scores are greater disability and higher scores are greater health functioning.</description>

          <description>Physician management was provided during fifteen to twenty minute sessions by Internal Medicine physicians with experience providing buprenorphine. Sessions occurred weekly for the first two weeks, every two weeks for the next four weeks, then monthly. During physician management the physician followed a structured note that reviewed the patient’s recent drug use, provided brief advice on how to achieve or maintain abstinence, supported efforts to reduce drug use or remain abstinent, reviewed medical and psychiatric complaints, assessed social, work and legal function, discussed weekly urine toxicology results and reviewed attendance at self-help groups.</description>

Cognitive behavioral therapy was provided by masters- and doctoral-level clinicians who were trained to competence using a manual adapted from the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for cocaine dependence. To ensure fidelity, all sessions were audio- or video-taped, and clinicians underwent weekly supervision. The main components of counseling focused on a functional analysis of behavior, behavioral activation, identifying and coping with drug cravings, enhancing drug-refusal skills, enhancing decision making about high-risk situations and improve problem-solving skills.</description>

          <description>Short Form (36) Health Survey overall score ranges from 0 to 100. Computed as the mean of all SF-36 subscales.
The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with only 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index. Lower scores are greater disability and higher scores are greater health functioning.</description>

          <title>Physician Management</title>
          <description>Physician management was provided during fifteen to twenty minute sessions by Internal Medicine physicians with experience providing buprenorphine. Sessions occurred weekly for the first two weeks, every two weeks for the next four weeks, then monthly. During physician management the physician followed a structured note that reviewed the patient’s recent drug use, provided brief advice on how to achieve or maintain abstinence, supported efforts to reduce drug use or remain abstinent, reviewed medical and psychiatric complaints, assessed social, work and legal function, discussed weekly urine toxicology results and reviewed attendance at self-help groups.</description>

          <title>Physician Management Plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</title>
          <description>In addition to recieving Physician Management identical to the Physician Management only condition, patients were offered up to 12, 50-minute weekly sessions during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy was provided by masters- and doctoral-level clinicians who were trained to competence using a manual adapted from the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for cocaine dependence. To ensure fidelity, all sessions were audio- or video-taped, and clinicians underwent weekly supervision. The main components of counseling focused on a functional analysis of behavior, behavioral activation, identifying and coping with drug cravings, enhancing drug-refusal skills, enhancing decision making about high-risk situations and improve problem-solving skills.</description>
