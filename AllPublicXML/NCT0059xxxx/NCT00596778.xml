      Abdominal surgical procedures can increase risks of pulmonary complications.The aim of the
      study was to evaluate the benefits of an early intervention of chest physiotherapy during
      immediate post-operative in patients submitted to elective abdominal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-one adults were randomly assigned to control and chest physiotherapy groups.
      Spirometry, pulse oximetry and anamneses were performed before (pre-operative) and in the
      second post-operative day. Chest physiotherapy group received treatment at the
      post-anesthesia unit care and control group did not. Chest physiotherapy improved
      oxygen-hemoglobin saturation in elective post-operative abdominal surgeries.
