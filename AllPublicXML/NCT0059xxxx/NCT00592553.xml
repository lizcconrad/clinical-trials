  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It
      is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for
      maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility
      that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A
      specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of
      DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. PTC124 is an orally delivered,
      investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.
      This study is a Phase 2b trial that will evaluate the clinical benefit of PTC124 in boys with
      DMD/BMD due to a nonsense mutation. The main goals of the study are to understand whether
      PTC124 can improve walking, activity, muscle function, and strength and whether the drug can
      safely be given for a long period of time.

      This study is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      dose-ranging, efficacy and safety study, designed to document the clinical benefit of PTC124
      when administered as therapy of patients with DMD/BMD due to a nonsense mutation (premature
      stop codon) in the dystrophin gene. It is planned that ~165 boys who are at least 5 years of
      age and can walk at least 75 meters (80 yards) will be enrolled. Study subjects will be
      enrolled at sites in North America, Europe, Israel, and Australia. They will be randomized in
      a 1:1:1 ratio to either a higher dose of PTC124, a lower dose of PTC124, or placebo. Subjects
      will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for 48 weeks.
      Subjects will be evaluated at clinic visits every 6 weeks. Additional safety laboratory
      testing, which may be performed at the investigational site or at an accredited local
      laboratory or clinic, is required every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks of the study. At the
      completion of blinded treatment, all compliant participants will be eligible to receive
      open-label PTC124 in a separate extension study.
