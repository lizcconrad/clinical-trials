  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relatively few health promotion and disease prevention programs have included or targeted
      people with disabilities, and even fewer have focused on individuals with intellectual
      disabilities.

      The long-term objectives of the Healthy Lifestyles for People with Intellectual Disabilities
      Study (HLID) are to increase the health of persons with intellectual disabilities by
      establishing the efficacy of a health promotion program and promoting its adoption. The HLID
      Study is based in the Center on Community Accessibility (CCA) at Oregon Health &amp; Science
      University. The mission of CCA is to increase the health and health-related quality of life
      of persons with disabilities.

      A pilot study conducted by CCA has established the effectiveness of the Healthy Lifestyles
      (HL) intervention among a cross-disability population in increasing health behavior adoption.
      The specific aim of the HLID Study is to test the efficacy of the HL program specifically
      with adults with intellectual disabilities.

      The HLID Study uses a randomized control study design. The HL intervention will be
      administered to 75 adults and will compare results to those of an additional 75 adults who
      receive no intervention. Measurement will include anthropometric assessments to measure
      impacts on overweight and obesity, as well as self-report measures of healthy behaviors,
      health status, health care utilization, and secondary conditions. Results will be shared with
      research participants, presented through professional conferences and newsletters, and
      published in peer-reviewed journals with the assistance of community partners.
