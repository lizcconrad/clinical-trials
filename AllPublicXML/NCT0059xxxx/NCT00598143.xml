  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors at MSKCC are doing this research study to see if smokers are interested in the idea
      that genes might be markers of cancer risk, and to see if smokers would want to learn this
      information about their risk if it were available.

      Different versions of the gene called UGT1A7 are found in different people. Certain versions
      of this gene can increase the risk of cancer in people. In this study, doctors will determine
      the different types of UGT1A7 in smokers and find out whether smokers show good interest and
      understanding. The information from this study will be used in future studies to identify
      smokers at increased risk for cancer, and to help smokers quit.

      This study consists of two arms; both of which are observational studies of molecular
      assessments of risk for tobacco related cancer. Arm A of the protocol is a pilot
      crosssectional study that evaluates the feasibility of obtaining and testing a genetic marker
      of cancer susceptibility (UGT1A7 polymorphisms) in smokers. It also explores smokers'
      interest in and comprehension of genetic risk assessments as possible tools for increasing
      motivation for smoking cessation. The second arm of this protocol, Arm B, is an observational
      prospective evaluation of a putative noninvasive biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure -
      urinary prostaglandin E-metabolite (PGE-M) - in smokers motivated to reduce and/or cease
      smoking.

    <description>Thirty smokers will receive standard smoking cessation therapy and provide urine specimens for PGE-M analysis at approximate 3-monthly intervals over one year.

    <intervention_name>Vignette, questionnaires and Saliva Samples</intervention_name>
    <description>The short vignette discusses the health implications of potential molecular markers of cancer risk assessment. The questionnaire asks several multiple-choice questions to assess the participant's interest in and understanding of molecular risk assessment. Patients are instructed to swish with 10cc of Scope mouthwash and to expectorate into a sterile 50cc conical tube.</description>

    <description>Single void urine specimens (approximately 50 ml) will be collected in pre-labeled specimen containers on a 3-monthly (Â±1 month) basis for 12 months. Standard evidence-based therapy for smoking cessation, including behavioral therapy and pharmacological therapy, is provided.</description>
