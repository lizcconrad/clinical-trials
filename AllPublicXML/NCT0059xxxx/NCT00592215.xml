  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A superior second trimester medical abortion regimen has not been identified. Studies suggest
      that a regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol given 36 to 48 hours apart has the shortest
      median induction-to-abortion interval, highest 24-hour abortion rate, and low rates of
      adverse events. Narrowing the interval between the two medications without clinically
      reducing effectiveness may increase access and acceptability for patients and reduce costs.
      Data from studies on first trimester abortions suggest that the 6 to 8 hour interval between
      mifepristone and misoprostol is as efficacious as the 36 to 48 hour interval. There are no
      studies on shorter intervals with same day administration between mifepristone and
      misoprostol in second trimester abortions.

      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of the combined mifepristone/misoprostol
      regimen for abortions between 17 0/7 and 23 6/7 weeks' gestation using an interval of 6 to 8
      hours between the two medications.
