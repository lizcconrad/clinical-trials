  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses the drug PPX (also called Xyotax and CT-2103) in women with advanced
      colorectal cancer. PPX is an experimental drug that has not been approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA). PPX has been shown in the laboratory and in studies in humans to
      cause some cancer cells to die and some tumors to shrink. Women in some studies with PPX have
      been shown to live longer than the men that receive the drug. Some studies in humans suggest
      that estrogen (a hormone found in women) may protect women from getting colorectal cancer and
      allow women that do get colorectal cancer to live longer than men that do.

      The purpose of this study is to see if women with colorectal cancer and a certain level of
      estrogen experience tumor shrinkage after they receive the drug PPX. This study will also
      study genes (genes are the cell's blueprint) in participant's tumors and in their blood.
      Several genes can affect how people's bodies react to the cancer drugs. We want to see if
      these predict response to the study drugs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.
             The primary histologic diagnosis is sufficient if there is clear evidence by imaging
             and/or markers of metastatic disease sites.

          -  Must have failed or are intolerant of or ineligible for CPT-11, 5-FU, oxaliplatin,
             bevacizumab and either cetuximab or panitumumab therapies.

          -  Tumor must be accessible for biopsy or paraffin embedded tissue must be available for
             review.

          -  SWOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Estradiol levels &gt;30 pg/mL **This may be supplemented by exogenous estrogen (by gel)

          -  AGC &gt;1,500, platelets &gt;100,000

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal, Transaminase (AST and/or ALT) &lt; 2 x upper
             limit of normal or &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal in patients with liver metastasis.

          -  Patients must have a creatinine of &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal or a measured or
             calculated creatinine clearance greater than 35 mL/min obtained within 7 days of first
             receiving study drug.

          -  Except for cancer-related abnormalities, patients should not have unstable or
             pre-existing major medical conditions.

          -  At least one measurable lesion according to the RECIST criteria which has not been
             irradiated (i.e. newly arising lesions in previously irradiated areas are accepted).
             Ascites, pleural effusion, and bone metastases are not considered measurable. Minimum
             indicator lesion size: &gt; 10 mm measured by spiral CT or &gt; 20mm measured by
             conventional techniques.

          -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of chemotherapy
             (female patients of childbearing potential).

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a malignancy other than colon or rectal cancer, except for adequately
             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other
             cancer for which the patient has been disease-free for five years.

          -  Estradiol levels &lt; 30 pg/mL, not responsive to supplementation.

          -  History of previous thromboembolic event, unless patient is on anticoagulation
             therapy.

          -  Grade 2 or greater neuropathy.

          -  Pregnant or lactating woman. Woman or men of childbearing potential not using a
             reliable and appropriate contraceptive method (either a barrier or hormonal method is
             acceptable). Patients must agree to continue contraception for 30 days from the date
             of the last study drug administration. (Postmenopausal woman must have been
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential).

          -  Patients with known brain metastases, unless they are well controlled - i.e. on a
             stable dose of steroids or if steroid therapy has been completed.

          -  Patients that have received experimental therapies or other approved bio- or
             chemotherapies within 30 days of study entry.
