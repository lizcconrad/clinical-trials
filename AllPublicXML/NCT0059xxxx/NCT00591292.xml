        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects with histological or cytological confirmation of advanced cancer, refractory
             to standard therapies for their condition

          2. ≥ 18 years of age

          3. ECOG performance score ≤ 2 (see Appendix 3)

          4. Eligible subjects MUST have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST
             guidelines (See Appendix 4). If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary
             lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology. Measurable
             lesions MUST not have been in a previously irradiated field or injected with
             biological agents.

          5. Life-expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          6. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements to be conducted &lt; 2 weeks prior to Baseline:

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR a calculated creatinine
                  clearance ≥ 50 cc/min

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 2.5 X ULN

               -  White blood cell count ≥3.0 x 109/L

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L

               -  Platelets ≥100 x 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL

          7. Written informed consent in compliance with ZIOPHARM policies and the Human
             Investigation Review Committee with jurisdiction over the site.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class ≥3 or myocardial infarction within
             6 months (see Appendix 5)

          2. Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia other than asymptomatic atrial fibrillation

          3. Pregnant and/or lactating female (a reliable method of contraception must be used in
             all men and in women of childbearing potential during the study and for 3 months after
             last study drug administration).

          4. Uncontrolled systemic infection (documented with microbiological studies)

          5. Anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy during the study or within 4 weeks of study
             entry. Mitomycin C or nitrosureas should not be given within 6 weeks of study entry.

          6. Radiotherapy during the study or within 3 weeks of study entry

          7. Surgery within 4 weeks of start of study drug excluding tumor biopsy for
             pharmacodynamic parameters

          8. Investigational drug therapy outside of this trial during or within 4 weeks of study
             entry

          9. History of an invasive second primary malignancy diagnosed within the previous 3 years
             except for Stage I endometrial/cervical carcinoma or prostate carcinoma treated
             surgically, and non-melanoma skin cancer

         10. Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with
             the subject's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results

         11. Any condition that is unstable or which could jeopardize the safety of the subject and
             his/her compliance with the study protocol.
