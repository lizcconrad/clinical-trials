    <textblock>
      This study was undertaken to investigate safety and scar-improvement activity of different
      applications of Juvista (avotermin), administered to surgical incisions made to the skin of a
      healthy population of male volunteers aged 18-45 years. The study addressed two issues:
      whether Juvista (avotermin) administered at 200ng/100μl/linear cm wound margin is more
      effective than 50ng/100μl/linear cm for scar improvement and, secondly, whether dosing once
      only (before wounding) or twice (before and after wounding) is optimal for scar improvement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically healthy, male subjects aged 18 to 45 years (inclusive)

          -  Body weight between 40kg and 150kg or a body mass index within the range 15-55kg/m2,
             calculated using Quetelet's index

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with history or evidence of hypertrophic or keloid scarring, or with tattoos
             or previous scars in the area to be biopsied.

          -  Subjects with tattoos or previous scars within 3cm of the area to be incised during
             the trial.

          -  Afro-Caribbean volunteers, because of their increased susceptibility to hypertrophic
             and keloid scarring.

          -  Subjects who, on direct questioning and physical examination, have evidence of any
             past or present clinically significant disease.

          -  Subjects with a chronic or currently active skin disorder, which would adversely
             affect the healing of the acute wounds or involved the areas to be examined in this
             trial.

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant allergies.

          -  Subjects with any clinically significant abnormality following review of pre-trial
             laboratory data and physical examination.

          -  Subjects taking, or who had taken, certain prescribed drugs in the 4 weeks before to
             Day 0 and, in particular, topical or systemic steroids, anti-inflammatory,
             anti-coagulant, anti-proliferative drugs, and antibiotics.

          -  Subjects who have taken part in a clinical trial within 3 months before admission to
             this trial, or who are currently participating in a clinical trial, whether an
             investigational drug was involved or not.

          -  Subjects with any clinical evidence of severe ongoing, or prolonged, depression or
             mental illness.

          -  Subjects smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day.

          -  Subjects drinking more than 28 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = ½ pint of beer
             [285ml], 25ml of spirits, or 1 glass of wine).

          -  Subjects showing evidence of drug abuse.

          -  Subjects known to have, or to have had, serum hepatitis or who were carriers of the
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) or hepatitis C antibody.

          -  Subjects previously testing positive for HIV antibodies, or who admit to belonging to
             a high-risk group.

          -  Subjects with pre-existing clinically significant neurological conditions.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of an investigator, are not likely to complete the trial
             for whatever reason.
