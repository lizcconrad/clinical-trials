    <textblock>
      Photon beam radiation is the standard type of radiation used to treat nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. Photon beam radiation enters the body and passes through healthy tissue,
      encounters the tumor and leaves the body through healthy tissue. Proton beam radiation has
      been shown to have the same effect on tumors as photon beam radiation but it enters the body,
      passes through healthy tissue, and encounters the tumor but then stops. This means less
      healthy tissue is affected by proton beam treatment than by photon beam treatment. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of proton beam radiation in treating
      nasopharyngeal cancer and reducing the acute and long-term side effects from the treatment.
      This study will also test to see if the sparing of the healthy tissue can improve quality of
      life

      -  Before beginning study treatment, participants will be asked to fill out a Quality of
           Life (QOL) questionnaires, a Speech Assessment, a ChemoSensory Questionnaire, a Patient
           Swallowing Diary, A Swallowing Study, Salivary Tests and a Trismus Assessment.
           Participants will need to go to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) or
           Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for these tests.

        -  Radiation therapy will be given once a day, five days a week, for seven weeks. This will
           be given as outpatient care at the Northeast Proton Therapy Center (proton component)
           and Massachusetts General Hospital (photon component).

        -  During radiation treatments, participants will receive cisplatin intravenously once
           every three weeks. This three-week period is called a cycle of treatment.

        -  After the completion of radiation, participants will receive cisplatin intravenously
           once every 4 weeks along with fluorouracil as a continuous infusion over 4 days starting
           on the day cisplatin is given, for three cycles.

        -  Participants will have a physical exam and blood work drawn weekly to monitor their
           health.

        -  An MR/CT scan of the head and neck will be done 2 months after the radiation treatment.

        -  Follow-up visits will occur once every three months for 2 years, then once every 6
           months during years 3-5, then annually. During these follow-up visits, participants will
           have the following tests and procedures: physical examination; blood work; chest CT scan
           and CT/MRI of the head and neck will be repeated once every 6 months during the first
           three years; swallow study; salivary study; QOL questionnaires; speech assessment;
           ChemoSensory Questionnaire; and Trismus Assessment.

    <description>Health related quality of life outcomes evaluated by validated measures. Sialometry is used to evaluate xerostomia (dry mouth). Videofluoroscopic measurements are used to evaluate swallowing function. Serial measures of the changes of the maximal inter-incisal distance in the vertical opening, right lateral, and left lateral jaw movements are used to evaluate trismus (lockjaw). The ChemoSensory Questionnaire (CSQ) is used to evaluate smell and taste function. Speech is assessed with the Speech Assessment/Head and Neck Health Status Assessment Inventory (HNHSAI). General quality of life is measured with the European organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaires (QLQ) for head and neck (H&amp;N) (EORTC-QLQ-H&amp;N) and the EORTC QLQ-C30 (cancer 30).</description>
