  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve the use of therapeutic hypothermia. This prospective cohort pilot
      study will evaluate the clinical performance of a new device, the ThermoSuit™ System, to
      achieve therapeutic hypothermia in comatose patients following resuscitation from cardiac
      arrest, and the impact of the vasodilator, magnesium sulfate, on cooling performance and
      hemodynamics in these patients. The study hypothesis is that magnesium sulfate will
      significantly increase the rate of cooling.

      This study will involve the use of therapeutic hypothermia, an accepted medical treatment
      recommended for comatose post resuscitation patients by the International Liaison Committee
      on Resuscitation (ILCOR), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the European
      Resuscitation Council. This prospective cohort pilot study will evaluate the clinical
      performance of a new device, the ThermoSuit™ System, to achieve therapeutic hypothermia in
      comatose patients following resuscitation from cardiac arrest, and the impact of the
      vasodilator, magnesium sulfate, on cooling performance and hemodynamics in these patients. 14
      patients will be prospectively randomized to receive either magnesium sulfate or normal
      saline (placebo) in this study.
