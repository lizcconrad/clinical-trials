        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with advanced, histologically confirmed solid tumors for which no standard
             therapy exists and for whom treatment with erlotinib is considered medically
             acceptable.

          2. ≥18 years of age

          3. ECOG performance score ≤2

          4. Eligible subjects MUST have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST
             guidelines. Measurable lesions MUST NOT have been in a previously irradiated field or
             injected with biological agents.

          5. Life-expectancy ≥12 weeks

          6. No more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease

          7. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements to be conducted &lt;2 weeks prior to Study Day 1:

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN) OR a calculated creatinine clearance
                  ≥50 cc/min

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5×ULN

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤2.5×ULN

               -  White blood cell count ≥3.0×109/L

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1.5×109/L

               -  Platelets ≥100×109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL

          8. Written informed consent in compliance with ZIOPHARM policies and the Human
             Investigation Review Committee with jurisdiction over the site.

          9. Each man and woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a reliable method of
             contraception during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class ≥3 or myocardial infarction within
             6 months (see Appendix 5)

          2. Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia other than asymptomatic atrial fibrillation

          3. Subjects cannot be receiving cytochrome P450-inducing anticonvulsants (EIAEDs: eg,
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, oxcarbezine)

          4. Subjects may not be taking CYP3A4 inducers (rifampicin)

          5. Subjects must not have any evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          6. Subjects with international normalized ration (INR) &gt;1.5 are excluded, unless the
             subject is on full dose warfarin

          7. Subjects on full-dose anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) are eligible provided that both of
             the following criteria are met:

               -  The subject has an in-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of
                  oral anticoagulant or on a stable dose of low molecular weight heparin

               -  The subject has no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high
                  risk of bleeding (eg, tumor involving major vessels or known varices.

          8. Subjects on prophylactic anticoagulation (ie, low-dose warfarin) are eligible provided
             their coagulation parameter levels are as follows: prothrombin time (INR of
             prothrombin time) &lt;1.1×institutional ULN

          9. Pregnancy and/or lactation

         10. Uncontrolled systemic infection (documented with microbiological studies)
