  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid hormones are known to reduce cholesterol levels through regulation of a number of key
      enzymes involved in synthesis, degradation, and lipid transport. However, the currently
      marketed thyroid agonists are non-selective, and cannot be used for the treatment of
      hypercholesterolemia due to extrahepatic consequences of hyperthyroidism, especially on
      heart, bone, and muscle.

      To take advantage of thyroid hormone effect on lipid metabolism for the treatment of
      hypercholesterolemia, it is necessary to develop a selective thyroid receptor agonist that
      can induce hyperthyroidism in the liver, while an euthyroid state is preserved in the
      extrahepatic tissue. KB2115 is a thyroid agonist developed to be liver selective.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of KB2115 as add on therapy to
      low and middle doses of statin following 12 weeks of exposure compared to placebo. The aim of
      the study is to assess efficacy (LDL-cholesterol lowering effects) and safety of KB2115 at
      doses between 25 and 100 µg and to define a clinically relevant dose or dose range for future
      studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent

          2. Males or females aged 18 to 75 years. Female patients must be non-fertile. To be
             considered as non-fertile, females must fulfil the following:

                  ligation) or post-menopausal. Post-menopausal is defined as serum
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the post-menopausal range combined
                  with amenorrhea for more than 1 year in a woman above 50 years of age, or
                  amenorrhea for more than 2 years below 50 years of age

          3. Patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with stable doses of the below listed lipid
