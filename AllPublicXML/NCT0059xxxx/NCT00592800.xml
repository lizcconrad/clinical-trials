  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To make medical decisions involving pros and cons, one also has to understand probability and
      percentages. This is a preliminary study to evaluate the ability of children to understand
      probability and percentages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of patients making decisions with respect to their health care is well accepted
      in adult medicine but, the value and importance of decision making in the care of children is
      not recognized. The major objection raised against allowing children to express their
      opinions concerning outcomes is that children do not understand probability.

      One way of assessing children's ability to understand probability is to test their
      mathematical knowledge using tests focused on probability and percentage.

      We have designed a set of questionnaires with 10 questions each, taken from the US Department
      of Education's National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). They are divided into 3
      different groups (4th, 8th, and 12th grade), based on grade-level. We have also obtained the
      average percentage of correct-incorrect answers given to these questions by students
      nationwide, and the scoring system used to assess the student's proficiency level.

      In this preliminary study we intend to present this set of 10 mathematical questions to
      children and to one of their parents.

        This prospective study will involve one or two encounters with each child and a parent at
        the Anesthesia Resource Center (ARC) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and
        the second visit at CHOP during the post-operative phase of recovery prior to discharge
        from the hospital.
