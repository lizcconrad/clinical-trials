    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and continued efficacy of
      perampanel in patients previously enrolled in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for
      Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN) or Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN).

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ): Sensory and Affective Scores, From Baseline to Week 48.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline to open-label study endpoint and other study visits in SF-MPQ scores sensory and affective). SF-MPQ was completed to assess intensity of pain over the past 48 days for all 15 descriptors: throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot-burning, aching, heavy, tender, splitting,tiring-exhausting, sickening, fear-causing, punishing-cruel. Each descriptor was scored by participant on a 4-point intensity scale (0=none to 3=severe) and totaled in each subclass (sensory range 0-45); higher scores indicated higher intensity of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in SF-MPQ Visual Analog Scale (VAS): From Baseline to Week 48.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>SF-MPQ VAS consists of a line 0 to 100 millimeters (mm) in length; range is 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst possible pain). Subjects placed a mark indicating the intensity of their pain. Distance from left-hand end of line was measured and entered on Case Report Form (CRF) as score in mm. Higher score indicates greater level of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in SF-MPQ Current Pain Intensity (CPI): From Baseline to Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in SF-MPQ (CPI) at study endpoint. Affective score ranges from 0-5. Higher scores indicate more severe pain (0=no pain, 1=mild, 2=discomforting, 3=distressing, 4=horrible, 5=excrutiating).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Week 48/End of Treatment (EOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC asked subjects to evaluate the change in their overall status compared with the start of open-label treatment on a scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). [Please note high withdrawl rate during study].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Short Form 36 Item (SF-36) Health Survey: Physical and Mental Component Scores From Baseline to Week 48/EOT</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in SF-36 Item Health Survey Scores at study endpoint. Each component on the SF-36 Item Health Survey is scored from 0-100 with higher scores reflecting better subject status.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:

          1. Met and continues to meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria for the
             preceding PDN or PHN study and received study drug or placebo under double-blind
             conditions.

          2. Completed the preceding double-blind study End of Treatment (EOT) Visit no more than
             12 weeks prior to Baseline (Visit 1) for the open-label study. The eligibility status
             of patients who do not enroll during this 12 week period will be evaluated on a case
             by case basis via discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor.

          3. Males and females ≥18 years of age. Female patients should be either of
             nonchildbearing potential as a result of surgery or menopause (1 year after onset), or
             of childbearing potential and practicing a medically acceptable method of
             contraception (e.g., abstinence, a barrier method plus spermicide, or intrauterine
             device [IUD]) for at least 1 month before the Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and for 1 month
             after the end of the study (Visit 16). They must also have a negative pregnancy test
             at Baseline (Visit 1). Female patients using hormonal contraceptives must also be
             using an additional approved method of contraception (e.g., a barrier method plus
             spermicide or IUD) throughout the study.

          4. Provide written informed consent prior to entering the study and prior to undergoing
             any study-related procedures.

          5. Is reliable, willing, and able to cooperate with the study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet the following criterion will be excluded from this study:

          1. Patients who discontinued early for any reason from the preceding double-blind study.

          2. Patients who have a clinically significant finding(s) that would make them unsuitable
             for the study in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor.

        <description>Mean change from baseline to open-label study endpoint and other study visits in SF-MPQ scores sensory and affective). SF-MPQ was completed to assess intensity of pain over the past 48 days for all 15 descriptors: throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot-burning, aching, heavy, tender, splitting,tiring-exhausting, sickening, fear-causing, punishing-cruel. Each descriptor was scored by participant on a 4-point intensity scale (0=none to 3=severe) and totaled in each subclass (sensory range 0-45); higher scores indicated higher intensity of pain.</description>

        <title>Analysis of Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Week 48/End of Treatment (EOT)</title>
        <description>The PGIC asked subjects to evaluate the change in their overall status compared with the start of open-label treatment on a scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). [Please note high withdrawl rate during study].</description>

        <population>Subset of ITT population used, including subjects that completed PGIC at Week 15 visit, and using BOCF (baseline observation carried forward) subjects that terminated prior to Week 15 received a 'No Change' if due to AE or Lack of Therapeutic Efficacy, subjects who discontinued due to other reasons used PGIC scores from Early Termination visit.</population>
