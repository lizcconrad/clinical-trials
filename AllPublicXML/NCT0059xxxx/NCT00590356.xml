    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Starclose (Abbott Vascular
      Devices) for femoral access site closure in patients undergoing PCI compared to Angio-Seal
      STS Plus (St. Jude Medical).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growing success of interventions and requirement for day case or outpatient procedures
      has led to a concomitant rise in the use of arteriotomy closure devices (ACD) to achieve
      hemostasis and allow early mobilization following arterial punctures. ACD have emerged as an
      alternative to traditional mechanical compression after percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI). When compared to manual compression, several studies have confirmed patient comfort,
      reduced time to achieve hemostasis, reduced time to ambulation, and early discharge.

      Recently, CLIP Trial was conducted to evaluated the safety and efficacy of the StarClose
      device in subjects undergoing diagnostic and interventional catheterization procedures. A
      total of 17 U.S. sites enrolled 596 subjects, with 483 subjects randomized at a 2:1 ratio to
      receive StarClose or standard compression of the arteriotomy after the percutaneous
      procedure. The study included roll-in (n=113), diagnostic (n=208), and interventional (n=275)
      arms with a primary safety endpoint of major vascular complications through 30 days and a
      primary efficacy endpoint of postprocedure time to hemostasis. This trial demonstrated that
      the StarClose Vascular Closure System is noninferior to manual compression with respect to
      the primary safety endpoint of major vascular events in subjects who undergo percutaneous
      interventional procedures. StarClose significantly reduced time to hemostasis, ambulation,
      and dischargeability when compared with compression.

      However, there are no studies randomly comparing these two closure devices. Therefore, this
      study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Starclose (Abbott Vascular Devices)
      for femoral access site closure in patients undergoing PCI compared to Angio-Seal STS Plus
      (St. Jude Medical).
