  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to see whether Sho-saiko-to (SST) can help in patients with chronic
      hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C may cause swelling within the liver and this can lead to
      scar tissue. In some patients, severe scarring of the liver, liver failure and liver cancer
      can occur. Standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C is a drug called interferon with or
      without another drug called ribavirin. There are a number of side effects that some patients
      are unable to take. Other patients may have an initial response, but then the virus and the
      inflammation come back.

      Sho-saiko-to is an herbal medicine that has been used for many years in Asia to treat liver
      disease. The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether Sho-saiko-to may improve liver
      swelling and injury caused by chronic hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C affects nearly three million Americans. Of these, 15% will develop liver
      cirrhosis and approximately 5% will progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment for
      chronic hepatitis C is limited to interferon-based therapy. Many patients decline or cannot
      tolerate interferon because of its serious side effects. Sho-saiko-to, an Asian herbal
      medicine consisting of seven botanicals, has demonstrated anti-fibrotic affect by inhibition
      of lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes and stellate cells in an animal study. It has also been
      demonstrated to prevent progression of cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma in human trials.
      This study is a single arm, single center trial of Sho-saiko-to in patients with chronic
      active hepatitis from hepatitis C infection who cannot tolerate or who have specific
      contraindications to interferon therapy. Patients will receive 52 weeks therapy with
      Sho-saiko-to. Outcome will be assessed by comparing pre- and posttreatment liver biopsies.
      Patients will be said to respond if they have an improvement of two points or greater on a
      standard measure of liver histology. If five or more of 25 evaluable patients respond,
      Sho-saiko-to will be deemed worthy of further testing.

    <description>All patients will receive treatment with 2.5grams of SST as granules in packet form by mouth three times a day every day for 52 weeks unless occurrence of unacceptable adverse events or patient withdrawal. Patients will be seen for clinical follow-up at three month intervals: at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and assessed for compliance and asked about side effects and pulmonary symptoms. At each clinic visit, a comprehensive metabolic profile will be performed. At the 6-month clinic visit, a CBC will be performed. At the 12-month clinic visit, quantitative HCV-RNA by PCR will be obtained (Viromed Labs, Inc., 6101 Blue Circle Drive, Minneapolis, MN 5534). Within 4 weeks after the 12-month clinic visit (after 52 weeks of SST therapy), the second liver biopsy will be scheduled and performed.</description>
