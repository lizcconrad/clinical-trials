      A comparative evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two recombinant
      regular human insulin injections administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers. It is a
      crossover study. The subjects shall be administered single doses of each insulin during two
      separate visits under the conditions of euglycemic clamp.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subject.

          2. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 45 years.

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 27.0 kg/m2, inclusive.

          4. Non-smoker, defined as no nicotine consumption for at least one year.

          5. Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.
             (Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during
             normal management of the subject.).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous participation in this trial or other clinical trials within the last 3
             months.

          2. Pregnant, breast-feeding or the intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate
             contraceptive measures (intrauterine device (IUD) that has been in place for at least
             3 months, or sterilization, or the oral contraceptive pill, which should have been
             taken without difficulty for at least 3 months, an approved hormonal implant).

          3. Clinically significant abnormal hematology or biochemistry screening tests, as judged
             by the Investigator. In particular, subjects with elevated liver enzymes (AST or ALT &gt;
             2 times the upper limit of normal) or impaired renal function (elevated serum
             creatinine values above the upper limit of normal) will not be allowed to enter the
             trial.

          4. Any serious systemic infectious disease during the four weeks prior to the first dose
             of test drug, as judged by the Investigator.

          5. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the
             results of the trial or pose risk in administering the trial drug to the subject. In
             particular, subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, anemia (haemoglobin
             below the lower limit of normal) or hemoglobinopathy will not be allowed to enter the
             trial.

          6. History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          7. Any positive reaction of drugs of abuse.

          8. Hepatitis B or C or HIV positive.

          9. Use of prescription drugs within 3 weeks preceding the first dosing of insulin, except
             for oral contraceptives/hormonal implants.

         10. Use of any insulin product for therapeutic purposes in the past.

         11. Use of non-prescription drugs, except routine vitamins, within 3 weeks prior to the
             first dose of the test drug. Occasional use of paracetamol is permitted.

         12. Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or co-operation.

         13. Blood donation of more than 500 ml within the last 12 weeks.

         14. History of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of severe
             anaphylactic reaction.

         15. Known or suspected allergy to trial product or related products.
