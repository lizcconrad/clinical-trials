  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Approximately one third of all deaths in Denmark are caused by cancer. Both Danish and
      international research shows that the majority of terminally ill cancer patients wish to die
      at home. In Denmark only about 25% has this wish fulfilled. The General Practitioner (GP) has
      traditionally had the full responsibility for the palliative care of terminally ill cancer
      patients. In recent years changes have been made to the organisation of palliative care: some
      hospitals have set up specialised palliative care teams and in some areas of Denmark hospices
      have been established.

      Recent research defines a problem when it comes to communication between the hospital and
      general practice when the patient is being discharged. This is often done in a way that can
      cause the patient to feel &quot;left in limbo&quot;, especially if it is not completely clear to the
      patient and his or her relatives who has the responsibility for the palliative care.

      Objective:

        1. To describe consequences for patients, relatives and health care professionals of three
           different ways of organising palliative care

        2. To collect data which describes patients who are candidates to a shared care approach
           between general practice and a specialised palliative care team

        3. To collect data which describes the palliative phase (place of death and palliative
           care, admissions to hospital, involvement of GP and district nurse etc.)

        4. To describe terminally ill cancer patients and their relatives expectations of the
           health care system

      270 terminally ill cancer patients will be invited to take part in the study. Data will be
      collected by interview with patients and questionnaires for patients, relatives and involved
      health care professionals.

      The intervention in the study is of organisational character. The patients will be randomised
      into two groups (groups B and C). A group of usual care patients will be included primary to
      the intervention (group A). The groups are:

      A. Usual discharge with regular discharge letter to the GP. The GP, together with the
      community nurse, is responsible for the palliative care, including referral to a specialist
      palliative care team, hospice, hospital, etc., if necessary

      B. Discharge with referral to a specialist palliative care team. This is a patient-centred
      shared care model in which the palliative team helps to organise the patient's treatment and
      care

      C. Discharge with extra effort put into improving the communication between the hospital and
      the GP. The GP will receive a phone call from the doctor who is discharging the patient, a
      detailed discharge letter, written information about the patient's type of cancer and acute
      oncological symptoms, name and phone number of the community nurse and name and phone number
      of a specialist in palliative medicine, who can be contacted for advice. This is a shared
      care model, where focus is on supporting the health care professionals.
