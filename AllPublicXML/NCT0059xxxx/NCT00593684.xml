  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of silver alginate (Algidex™) dressing in
      VLBW infants in preparation for a large efficacy trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in VLBW infants to evaluate the safety
      of silver alginate (Algidex™) dressing compared to standard catheter care. Following parental
      consent, infants are randomized to receive silver alginate or standard of care dressing.
      Infants with birth weights less than 1,500 grams admitted to Baylor University Medical Center
      (BUMC) NICU with any of the following lines are eligible for inclusion into this study up to
      72 hours after birth: umbilical arterial line (UAL), umbilical venous line (UVL), peripheral
      arterial line (PAL), peripheral long line (PLL), and central venous line (CVL). Safety is
      assessed by measuring silver levels and monitoring for cutaneous reactions. Dressings are
      changed every seven days. Silver levels are drawn on study days 1, 7, and 28. Blood culture
      results are used to compare infection rates between the two groups. Patient demographics and
      clinical conditions are recorded. Results will be analyzed based on intention to treat.

    <measure>Serum Silver Concentration at 1 Day</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day (first 24 hours from enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Serum silver concentrations were obtained from both groups on study days 1, 7, and 28. Study day 1 was defined as the 24 hour period in which participants enrolled in the study. Here we are examining the results of first day, or 24 hours from enrollment. Silver samples were analyzed using a dual inductively coupled plasma -mass spectrometry methodology. Accepted reference values for non-exposure silver concentrations are defined as &lt;15 ng ml -1 with standard Mayo Clinic reference technique.</description>

    <description>Serum silver concentrations were obtained from both groups on study days 1, 7, and 28. Study day 1 was defined as the 24 hour period in which participants enrolled in the study. Here we examine the results at 7 days from enrollment. Silver samples were analyzed using a dual inductively coupled plasma -mass spectrometry methodology. Accepted reference values for non-exposure silver concentrations are defined as &lt;15 ng ml -1 with standard Mayo Clinic reference technique.</description>

    <description>Infants in this group received the Algidex patch on top of the line insertion sites of any of the following lines: umbilical arterial line, umbilical venous line, peripheral arterial line, peripheral long line, and central venous line. This is a sterile patch of polyurethane foam coated with silver alginate and maltodextrin matrix that is impregnated with 141 mg of ionic silver per 100 cm2. Every 7 days, each insertion site was cleansed and then a new patch was placed and covered with a fresh occlusive dressing (Tegaderm, Opsite).</description>

    <description>Infants in this group served as the control group and received line-dressing changes every 7 days according to standard hospital protocol specific for the type of line inserted. Insertion sites were covered with only an occlusive dressing (Tegaderm, Opsite).</description>

        <title>Serum Silver Concentration at 1 Day</title>
        <description>Serum silver concentrations were obtained from both groups on study days 1, 7, and 28. Study day 1 was defined as the 24 hour period in which participants enrolled in the study. Here we are examining the results of first day, or 24 hours from enrollment. Silver samples were analyzed using a dual inductively coupled plasma -mass spectrometry methodology. Accepted reference values for non-exposure silver concentrations are defined as &lt;15 ng ml -1 with standard Mayo Clinic reference technique.</description>
