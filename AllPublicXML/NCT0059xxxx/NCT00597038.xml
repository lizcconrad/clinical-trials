      The purpose of this study is to:

      Phase I Objectives:

        -  Find the most tolerated dose to use for Phase II

        -  Collect information on how the body responds to this combination of study drug

      Phase II Objectives:

        -  To determine the overall response of participants using this combination of study drug

      The expression of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src), a substance present in a
      significant proportion of melanomas plays a role in the growth, multiplying, and dividing of
      cancer cells. Melanoma cells appear to be sensitive to these agents that block the action of
      Src in concentrations that can be achieved in patients. We suggest that Src inhibitors (such
      as Dasatinib) may be a good choice for treatment of melanoma in combination with Dacarbazine
      (a chemotherapy drug that can cause the shrinkage of melanomas). We wish to to evaluate the
      Src inhibitor Dasatinib in combination with the chemotherapy drug Dacarbazine. The novel oral
      Src inhibitor Dasatinib may be able to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy for
      melanoma compared to chemotherapy alone. Dacarbazine is a standard treatment for melanoma
      currently. The effectiveness of this chemotherapy drug may be increased by combination with
      Dasatinib. Dacarbazine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      treating melanoma; Dasatinib has been approved by the FDA to treat leukemia, but it has not
      been approved alone or in combination with Dacarbazine to treat melanoma.

      Patient will receive Dacarbazine intravenously (IV), which means it is given through a needle
      in a vein in the arm or through a venous port (if patient already has one). Dasatinib will be
      given orally starting day 2 for 17 days straight (days 2 through 19) starting the day after
      patient receives their first dose of Dacarbazine. The therapy will be repeated every 21 days
      (21 days = 1 cycle). Patient may be given other drugs before each cycle to help reduce side
      effects of the therapy. If patient experiences severe side effects, the amount of Dacarbazine
      and/or Dasatinib they receive in future cycles may be decreased.

      Cycle 1 day 1:

        -  Dacarbazine Intravenous

        -  Toxicity assessment - evaluation of any side effects that patient may be experiencing

        -  Medical history*

        -  Physical examination* - measure height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate,
           temperature, assessment of patient's energy and activity level (Eastern Cooperative
           Group [ECOG] Performance Status)

        -  Blood tests (3 tablespoons) for safety tests*- Complete blood count with differential
           and platelets (CBC), Comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP), &amp; Magnesium test *(certain
           tests may not need to be performed if they were performed during screening within 1
           week; study doctor will tell patient if they need to have these tests redone)

      Cycle 1 day 8:

        -  Toxicity assessment - (these will be done for the first cycle of treatment, but will be
           discontinued for later cycles unless deemed necessary by study doctor)

        -  CBC - (1 tablespoon) (this will be done for the first cycle of treatment, but will be
           discontinued for later cycles unless deemed necessary by study doctor)

        -  Dasatinib orally

      Cycle 1 day 15:

        -  Toxicity assessment - (these will be done for the first cycle of treatment, but will be
           discontinued for later cycles unless deemed necessary by study doctor)

        -  CBC - (1 tablespoon) these will be done for the first cycle of treatment, but will be
           discontinued for later cycles unless deemed necessary by study doctor)

        -  Dasatinib orally

        -  Blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis

      Patient will also take Dasatinib orally as instructed days: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12,
      13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 each cycle.

      Day 1 for all cycles after the first cycle:

        -  Dacarbazine Intravenous (IV)

        -  Dasatinib orally

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical examination: measure height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate,
           temperature, assessment of patient's energy and activity level (ECOG Performance Status)

        -  Blood tests (2 tablespoon) for safety tests: CMP &amp; CBC

        -  An electrocardiogram (EKG)

        -  Computed tomography (CT) scan (done every other cycle starting with cycle 2)

        -  Toxicity assessment

      If patient decides not to continue participation in this study or is taken off the study by
      their study doctor or the sponsor they will return to the clinic for one more visit.

      During this visit the following procedures will be performed:

        -  Medical history

        -  Perform a physical examination: measure height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, breathing
           rate, temperature, assessment of patient's energy and activity level (Eastern
           Cooperative Group [ECOG] Performance Status)

        -  Blood tests (2 tablespoons) for safety tests: CBC &amp; CMP

        -  Toxicity assessment Patient will need to take their assigned Dasatinib dose twice daily.
           It may be taken with or without food.
