  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a small electrical current to the
      vestibular nerve (balance organ) will decrease the time it take for participants to fall
      asleep.

      This 2 arm study will look at the proposed treatment (electrical stimulation of the
      vestibular nerve) versus a sham or placebo device. The effect of the device will be evaluated
      in a study that uses normal sleepers and advances them(puts them to bed 5-hours earlier than
      normal) to see if they fall asleep faster in one group or the other. Stimulation in the
      treated or sham group is only for the first hour after lights off.

        <population>It was noted on initial evaluation of the results, that Site 6 indicate that there are properties of either the population or the study site that make it different from the remaining sites. For this reason, the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial were done with Site 6 excluded.</population>

            <description>Normal sleepers (7.5 - 9.0 hours), MSLT &gt;=14 min; phase-advance 5-hours studied under full polysomnogram (PSG) with active device (electric stimulation of the Vestibular nerve).
Electric stimulation of the Vestibular Nerve - &quot;VirtuSom&quot;: This device is similar to a Tens or Micro-Current electrical stimulator with respect to current levels deliver; however, because of the location of the stimulation it is similar to a Cranial Electrical Stimulator. A small electric stimulation (100 uA - 1000 uA) will be provided at the mastoids (bi-laterally) via small hydrogel electrodes.</description>

Electric stim of the Vestibular Nerve - &quot;VirtuSom&quot; - SHAM: This device is similar to a Tens or Micro-Current electrical stimulator with respect to current levels deliver; however, because of the location of the stimulation it is similar to a Cranial Electrical Stimulator. For the Sham Group, NO electric stimulation (100 uA - 1000 uA) will be provided at the mastoids (bi-laterally) via small hydrogel electrodes. This is a sham / placebo device only.</description>
