    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare disease-free survival (DFS) of women treated with
      concomitant trastuzumab plus docetaxel followed by FEC to that of the women treated with the
      same regimen followed by single-agent trastuzumab to complete one year of trastuzumab
      administration as adjuvant treatments of early HER2-positive breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has provided a written informed consent prior to study-specific screening
             procedures, with the understanding that she has the right to withdraw from the study
             at any time, without prejudice.

          2. Woman &gt; 18 years of age.

          3. Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer.

          4. HER2-positive breast cancer (preferably assessed with CISH or FISH; if not available
             with immunohistochemistry 3+)

          5. A high risk of breast cancer recurrence with one of the following:

               -  Pathological N0 with the longest invasive tumor diameter &gt;5 mm

               -  Histologically confirmed regional node positive disease (pN+; nodal isolated
                  tumor cells/cell clusters &lt; 0.2 mm in diameter (ITP) are not counted as a
                  metastasis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of distant metastases.
