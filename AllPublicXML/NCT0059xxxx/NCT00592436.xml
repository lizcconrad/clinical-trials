      The objective of this protocol is to establish a comprehensive screening process to evaluate
      the eligibility of potential pediatric subjects for appropriate ADHD clinical research
      studies.

    <textblock>
      The ADHD Clinical Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital currently offers a range
      of protocols addressing different aspects of ADHD in children and adolescents. Although these
      protocols have received prior IRB approval, potential participants present with a widely
      varied set of complaints not always discernable in a telephone screening interview. This
      state of affairs often makes it difficult to ask subjects and their parents to sign a
      specific protocol's consent form without obtaining additional clinical information. Because
      of this, we are proposing that potential subjects and their parents undergo an in-depth
      clinical assessment that will allow them to be screened by a clinician for eligibility to a
      diverse clinical research program.
