      The purpose of this study is to determine if bread containing fenugreek reduces blood sugar
      and insulin compared to identical bread without fenugreek.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment
      of diabetes. Fenugreek has been demonstrated to lower blood glucose in response to a glucose
      load while leaving the levels of serum insulin unaffected in rodents. This effect of lowering
      blood sugar without changing insulin levels demonstrates improved insulin action. Fenugreek
      has also been shown to decrease glucose absorption by inhibiting intestinal disaccharidases.
      Fenugreek decreases glycohemoglobin in diabetic rodents. An amino acid extracted from
      fenugreek seeds, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, decreases glucose and insulin in diabetic rodents,
      improves glucose tolerance and stimulates insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic rodent
      islets.

      Fenugreek imparts a bitter taste to products into which it is placed, and this property has
      limited its use in treating diabetes. Dr. Losso and his associates developed a process that
      allows incorporation of fenugreek into bread and other bakery goods without imparting a
      bitter taste, and the success of this process was confirmed in taste testing. This study is
      designed to evaluate the effect of fenugreek bread made by Dr. Losso's proprietary process on
      glucose and insulin.
