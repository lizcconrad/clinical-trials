  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled, multi-center clinical trial of 6
      months duration is designed to assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of PN400 versus
      diclofenac/misoprostol in subjects at high risk for developing NSAID-associated gastric
      ulcers. Approximately 100 sites will participate to enroll a total of 200 subjects (100 per
      arm).

      At least 20% of the subjects enrolled will be age 65 years and older.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the incidence of gastric ulcers following administration of PN 400 in a high
      risk population over six months. Diclofenac/misoprostol will be used as a positive control.

      Secondary:

        -  To determine the incidence of duodenal ulcers during treatment with PN 400 and
           diclofenac/misoprostol in a high risk population

        -  To evaluate the degree of upper gastrointestinal injury as measured by Lanza scores
           (1991) during treatment with PN400 and diclofenac/misoprostol in a high risk population

        -  To compare gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects treated with PN 400 versus
           diclofenac/misoprostol as measured by scores on the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating
           Scale (GSRS) instrument

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PN400 and diclofenac/misoprostol in a high
           risk population

    <description>The degree of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) injury as measured by Lanza scores (1991) during treatment with PN 400 and ARTHROTEC® in a high-risk population. The Lanza (1991) score is based on endoscopic obeservations and rating these, with no damage, petecchiae, erosions and ulcers. On the 1991 scale, a Lanza score of 0 represents normal mucosa (no damage), while a score of 4 indicates 6-10 erosions, and a score of 7 indicates an ulcer.</description>

        <description>The degree of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) injury as measured by Lanza scores (1991) during treatment with PN 400 and ARTHROTEC® in a high-risk population. The Lanza (1991) score is based on endoscopic obeservations and rating these, with no damage, petecchiae, erosions and ulcers. On the 1991 scale, a Lanza score of 0 represents normal mucosa (no damage), while a score of 4 indicates 6-10 erosions, and a score of 7 indicates an ulcer.</description>
