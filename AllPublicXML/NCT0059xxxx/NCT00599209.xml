  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The magnitude and intensity of medication use among our nation's 1.6 million nursing home
      residents matches or exceeds that of hospitalized patients. The residents of nursing homes
      are among the most frail patients in the population; the challenges of using medications in
      this setting are great, not only because of the physiologic declines and pharmacologic
      changes that occur with aging, but also because of the special clinical and social
      circumstances that often characterize nursing home care. In our previous research, we have
      determined that medication errors resulting in adverse drug events occur most often at the
      ordering and monitoring stages of pharmaceutical care. Clinical decision-support systems are
      clinical consultation systems that combine individual patient information with population
      statistics and scientific evidence to offer real-time information to health care providers.
      These systems have been found to improve the quality of medication prescribing in the
      hospital setting. In this study, we intend to determine the extent to which a computer-based
      clinical decision-support system (accompanying computerized provider order-entry) can improve
      the quality of medication ordering and monitoring for residents in the long-term care setting
      through a randomized trial. We will track the costs associated with this system and the
      system's impact on the productivity of providers. We will also assess the culture of U.S.
      nursing homes and the organization of the nursing home setting with respect to readiness to
      incorporate computerized provider order-entry with computer-based clinical decision support.
      Our project addresses specific areas that are of particular interest to AHRQ with special
      relevance to the delivery of high-quality care to a priority population--the frail elderly
      patient population residing in nursing homes. The project will assess the economic
      implications of health information technology in the nursing home environment that will be of
      interest to key stakeholders, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, payers,
      policymakers, the nursing home industry, and pharmaceutical vendors to long-term care
      institutions.
