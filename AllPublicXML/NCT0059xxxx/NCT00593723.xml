  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy are the standard of care for inoperable
      patients with esophagus cancer. Unfortunately, the 5-year survival of 20% for this population
      is quite low. Methods to intensify radiation therapy delivery without increasing local
      toxicities are needed. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced method of
      delivering external beam radiation that may minimize the volume of normal tissue irradiated
      to high dose and thus decrease the risk of normal tissue toxicity. The proposed study will
      prospectively test whether IMRT is tolerable for delivering IMRT doses of 60 Gy for patients
      with esophagus cancer.

    <time_frame>One year after protocol registration</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be deemed infeasible if one or more of the following results occur:
15% of patients experience any grade 4 acute toxicity judged to be related to his/her external radiation treatment
within 1 year of protocol registration, &gt;15% of patients develop any grade 4 late toxicity judged to be related to his/her external radiation treatment
within 1 year of protocol registration, any patient dies from causes judged to be related to his/her external beam radiation treatment</description>
