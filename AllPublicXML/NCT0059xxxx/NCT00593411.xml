  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The collection of data from the myriad of services described is significantly impacted by NIH
      guidelines defining medical research involving humans as well as the recent implementation of
      HIPAA constraints which further complicate the conduct of retrospective clinical outcomes
      research. Simple case reports or case series analysis now involve IRB participation as well
      as voluminous documentation.

      The solution to this dilemma lies in developing and promoting secure, confidential
      prospective clinical databases for storing clinical data for subsequent retrospective
      de-identified inquiry. These databases function in a way analogous to &quot;tissue banks&quot; for
      subsequent basic science research. Patients consent to prospective entry of their clinical
      information into the database so long as they continue to be a patient with the Department of
      Neurological Surgery or the Departments or Divisions in association with the affiliated
      programs briefly described above. The consent is obtained during the patient's first
      inpatient or outpatient encounter in parallel with the HIPAA consent. It can be withdrawn by
      request of the patient at any time, but it does not expire unless the patient withdraws it,
      or the patient severs their patient care relationship with UCI Neurosurgery or the affiliated
      programs. The database is stored on a separate secure server maintained and backed up by the
      UCIMC Information Technology Department. Access to the database is restricted at multiple
      levels, with the majority of personnel allowed only limited access for data entry purposes.
      Only the database programmer/coordinator, the Department Administrator and the Chairman of
      the Department will have unrestricted access to the database. Authority for permission for
      levels of security clearance and access to the database, for other individuals, will be
      vested in the Chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery.

      A separate IRB proposal will be formulated for individual study related to the acquisition of
      data from the de-identified database. Since these future studies will be performed on data
      sets derived from the previously consented subjects of this IRB-approved project, the
      requirement for additional consent forms are not anticipated. As a result IRB research
      proposals utilizing the database can be expedited. Once the specific study is approved, the
      investigator(s) are provided with the clinical information from the database in the form of a
      de-identified data set.

      The Department of Neurological Surgery is entering a period of rapid growth accompanied by
      significant investment in its infrastructure. The goals of this effort is to re-establish a
      full academic mission and for the return of a residency program as part of this paradigm with
      the target of initiating the program in three to five years. This rebuilding project will be
      based on the pre-existing neurotrauma and critical care program and three new comprehensive
      and multidisciplinary clinical programs and medical center product lines. These include
      neuro-oncology, operative and non-operative spine services and cerebrovascular services. The
      care and treatment of patients with ischemic stroke is a part of the cerebrovascular program.

      Aggressive and accelerated clinical outcomes research and rapid peer-review publication is a
      mission critical need for successfully applying to re-establish the residency training
      program. The collection of this data will also strengthen marketing and will promote the
      advancement of the multidisciplinary programs. While the Neurosurgery Department is central
      to the multidisciplinary program evolution these affiliated programs and product lines
      involve multiple departments. These include: Neurology with the stroke service and neurology
      critical care services; Radiology with the neuroradiology and interventional neuroradiology
      services; the Hematology/Oncology Services associated with the Chao Family Comprehensive
      Cancer Center; Radiation Oncology; Otolaryngology Services; Orthopedic Spine Services; and,
      Physiatry with the Physical and Rehabilitative Medicine Services.

      MD Analyze is a commercially available relational data base software program designed to
      accumulate clinical data for future analysis. It allows the investigators to determine what
      clinical data they wish to collect, including, but not limited to history, physical,
      laboratory, radiographic, surgical and follow-up information. It can be programmed to allow
      data entry from any data collection instrument so desired by the investigators.

      Patients treated by the investigators in their practices at UCI will be asked to sign consent
      and HIPAA forms making them aware of their rights and protection regarding their health care
      information and giving informed consent to collect and analyze their health care data.
      Throughout the course of their care they may be asked to complete various surveys or data
      collection instruments depending on their diagnosis and treatment. See Appendix A for copies
      of the data collection instruments and surveys. The system allows the personal clinical data
      to be de-identified (i.e., made anonymous). A full-time data entry clerk will collect and
      enter clinical data into the MD Analyze data base. This person will also be asked to search
      and retrieve data based on investigators' research questions after their proposals have been
      IRB approved. Only the Department Chairman, the Data Base Manager, and the Department
      Administrator will have access to personal identification data. This information will not be
      available to the investigators. Potential investigators of the data base will have to provide
      documentation of IRB approval of their project to the Chair before their requested data set
      can be harvested from the data base. The chair will then direct the Data Base Manager to
      generate a report of the requested data. The report of de-identified data will then be
      securely delivered to the investigator. The Data Base Manager will maintain a file of all
      requests for data and a copy of the IRB approval for investigators research and data request.

      Minors may be asked to complete surveys and questionnaires appropriated to their reading
      level. Patients may withdraw at any time by making a request to their physician investigator
      or their staff.
