  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Ammonul® in
      subjects who become hospitalized with Grade 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy (HE).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in patients with
      liver disease. The pathogenesis of HE is incompletely understood, but several pieces of
      evidence identify ammonia as a key factor in the development of HE. The liver normally
      detoxifies ammonia produced in the gastrointestinal tract. However, in patients with
      cirrhosis, portosystemic shunting allows ammonia to bypass the liver and reach the systemic
      circulation and the brain. The accumulation of ammonia in the brain, through mechanisms not
      yet fully defined, lead to changes of consciousness, intellectual function, and behavior.

      Ammonul is currently approved as adjuvant therapy for the management of hyperammonemia and
      associated encephalopathy in patients with deficiencies in the enzymes of the urea cycle.
      Ammonul removes nitrogenous ammonia in these patients through pathways alternative to the
      urea cycle. It is anticipated that in patients with HE, Ammonul may lead to the scavenging of
      ammonia through these alternative biochemical pathways taking place in tissues other than the
      liver.

      This study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of IV Ammonul® as a treatment for
      acute episodes of elevated ammonia in patients with Grade 3 or 4 HE. Study was terminated due
      to lack of enrollment and business decisions.
