    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this study is that bilateral sacral neuromodulation will improve symptoms
      of interstitial cystitis by at least 25% when compared to unilateral sacral neuromodulation
      as reported by patient's responses to the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Indices.

      This study will be a prospective randomized study comparing bilateral to unilateral sacral
      neuromodulation. The study population will include all patients diagnosed with interstitial
      cystitis, using the NIDDK criteria, having staged sacral neuromodulator stimulators placed at
      Hahnemann University Hospital.
