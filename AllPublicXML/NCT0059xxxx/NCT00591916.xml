      Primary research questions/Purpose of the Research.

        1. Determine the short term (epidermal regeneration, reduction of pain, infections and
           length of stay) and long term (scarring, long term recovery, and cost of treatment)
           outcomes of Microbial Nanocellulose (NC) and fine mesh gauze impregnated with hyaluronan
           and thrombin (HT).

        2. Determine if donor site treatment with NC and HT is as safe as the use of Scarlet Red
           ointment dressing.

           b. Describe the importance of the knowledge that you expect to gain from the research.

           To find a donor site dressing that has outcomes equal or better than that of scarlet
           red.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Donor site material (scarlet red ) came back on the market, therefore new treatements for donor
    sites was not needed.
