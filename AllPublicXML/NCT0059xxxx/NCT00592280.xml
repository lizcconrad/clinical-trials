  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to compare the effect of oxygenated preservation of the
      pancreas before transplantation using the &quot;Two-Layer Method&quot; (TLM) against outcomes
      previously experienced with organs preserved using only standard University of Wisconsin (UW)
      storage solution. It is our hypothesis that TLM preservation will reduce the frequency and
      severity of complications of pancreas transplantation, increase the number of organs
      acceptable for transplantation, and spare individual patients and their families suffering
      and hardship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two-Layer Method (TLM) preservation consists of a storage chamber containing a layer of
      highly oxygenated, water-immiscible liquid perfluorocarbon (perfluorodecalin, C10F18)
      surmounted by a layer of conventional UW (or similar) organ preservation solution. The
      perfluorocarbon is sufficiently dense (~2 g/ml) that the pancreas floats on top of it, in
      contact with both layers. The perfluorocarbon combines low toxicity with an oxygen content 75
      times greater than the UW solution used in standard pancreas storage. When preserved under
      these conditions, the pancreas absorbs oxygen by diffusion and steadily consumes it,
      supporting sufficient aerobic metabolism to maintain tissue ATP concentrations at
      near-physiologic levels and prevent, or even reverse, pancreas anoxic injury. In animal
      models of pancreas ischemic and storage injury, TLM preservation has been strikingly
      successful at improving the outcome of both islet isolation and pancreas transplantation.
