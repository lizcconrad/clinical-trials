  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us better understand the cellular changes that may lead
      to the development of lung cancer. We want to compare people who have never smoked and yet
      have been diagnosed with lung cancer to never smokers who have not developed lung cancer. We
      hope to use the information obtained in this study as the basis for future studies and will
      not regard the results from this study as final.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases will be eligible for inclusion if:

          -  They have been diagnosed with a lung cancer or have had previous surgical treatment
             for their lung cancer and have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime,
             are/were not regular cigar or pipe smokers, and

          -  They have had no prior chemotherapy or radiation treatment within the last year
             (Exception: genotyping analysis/screening can be performed on specimens from
             individuals who had chemo/radiation treatment within the last year as germline DNA
             will not be affected)

          -  They speak and read English

          -  They understand and agree to sign informed consent, and

          -  They agree to give us a blood sample, and

          -  They agree to complete the study questionnaire, and

          -  They agree to have their pathology information reviewed by study personnel.

          -  Controls will be eligible for inclusion if:

          -  They have not been diagnosed with any type of cancer, exclusive of nonmelanoma skin
             cancer and have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, are/were not
             regular cigar or pipe smokers, and

          -  They speak and read English

          -  They understand and agree to sign informed consent, and

          -  They agree to give us a blood sample, and

          -  They agree to complete the study questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who do not meet the inclusion criteria for either the case or control groups
             will not be eligible for this study.

          -  All individuals who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements above, but who have
             had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 1 year of evaluation will be excluded
             (Exception: genotyping analysis/screening can be performed on specimens from
             individuals who had chemo/radiation treatment within the last year as germline DNA
             will not be affected).
