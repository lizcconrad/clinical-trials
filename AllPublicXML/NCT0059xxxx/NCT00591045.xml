  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II multicenter controlled study of oxaliplatin, calcium folinate,
      and 5-fluorouracil (mFOLFOX7) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable advanced gastric
      cancer.

      Hypothesis: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve 5 year overall survival compared with the
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the 5 year survival rate will reach 35% from 25% when
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy is carried out. With the alpha value to be 0.05 and beta value to be
      0.80 as well as 10 percent of patients' lost-of-followup, the sample size will be 263.
