      This study retrospectively looks to determine the clinical success of ProRoot MTA used as an
      artificial apical barrier in teeth with immature apices.

      The normal development and maturation of a root depends on a vital, healthy pulp. If the pulp
      becomes necrotic in a tooth with an immature apex, endodontic treatment can be performed
      using an artificial barrier technique. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has become the
      material of choice to accomplish this procedure, however, few studies have evaluated its
      clinical success. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the clinical
      success of ProRoot MTA used as an artificial apical barrier. Twenty patients were included in
      this study. After approximately one week of Ca(OH)2 treatment, each patient had MTA placed as
      an apical barrier in a tooth with a single canal and open apex followed by placement of a
      final restoration. Patients were recalled and evaluated for clinical signs and symptoms and
      osseous healing. Immediate post-treatment and recall radiographs were evaluated by two
      endodontists calibrated for use of the Periapical Index (PAI).
