      The purpose of this study is to identify all the bacterial species present in the respiratory
      tracts of patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), and to connect them with clinical information.
      Traditional culture methods of throat swab and sputum samples can only identify the most
      prevalent bacteria in samples, those of which there are over about 5 million bacteria per
      teaspoon. A recently developed method has been found to be more sensitive and can detect up
      to several hundred bacterial species in throat swab or sputum sample of individual CF
      patients.

      This study does not include testing of any investigational drugs and this is a noninvasive
      study requiring only a sputum/swab sample paired with information contained in the routine
      clinic letters and laboratory results your CF physicians obtain at your regular clinic
      visits.
