    <textblock>
      Acquired brain injury can result in impaired everyday functioning as well as psychosocial
      problems, including depressive symptoms, irritability, or negative self-concept. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether a combination of neuropsychological and cognitive
      behavioral therapy is effective in the treatment of these sequelae.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired brain injury (ABI) commonly results in persistent cognitive, emotional and
      motivational problems. About 50% of patients involved develop psychiatric illness, most
      likely in the first year following ABI, which is associated with reduced psychosocial
      functioning and less favorable rehabilitation outcome. Treatment of these complex conditions
      requires a combination of neuropsychological and psychotherapeutic intervention techniques.

      This study aims at evaluating a combination of neuropsychological intervention methods, which
      include developing and using compensation strategies for cognitive impairments (attention,
      memory and executive functions), and psychotherapeutic intervention focusing on emotion
      regulation, developing positive self-concepts and adjustment of life-goals. These therapeutic
      interventions are modularized and patients are assigned to intervention modules according to
      results of objective neuropsychological testing and interviews.

    <description>Neuropsychological cognitive behavioral psychotherapy for patients with acquired brain injury consists of 25 weekly 1-hr sessions of individualized outpatient treatment. The therapeutical intervention is modularised, patients are assigned to specific interventional modules according to the results of cognitive testing and interviews. Modules concern on the one hand the treatment of deficits in attention, memory, and executive functions. On the other hand psychosocial adjustment to chronic illness is addressed through modules that concern the development of a positive self-concept, the adjustment of life-goals and coping with negative affect (e.g. depressive symptoms, irritability, guilt).</description>

    <description>Waiting list: Patients are randomly assigned to one of two existing groups after completion of the first session of various neuropsychological tests and interviews.
Patients assigned to the experimental group receive therapy immediately after completing the first session of various neuropsychological tests and interviews. Patients randomized to the waiting list receive the treatment as specified above after waiting for 5 month.</description>

    <description>Neuropsychological Cognitive Behavioral Therapy encompasses 2 foci: First emphasis is on neuropsychological compensatory strategies for the treatment of deficits in attention, memory, and executive functions. Secondly, cognitive behavioral intervention techniques are employed to support the patient in the process of coping with chronic illness: i.e. improve regulation of negative affect, diversify the impaired self-concept after acquired brain injury, and adjust important life-goals to changed circumstances.</description>
