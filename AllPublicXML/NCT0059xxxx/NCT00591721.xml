  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60% of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) describe fatigue as their most
      disabling symptom. Energy conservation education involves teaching people with MS different
      strategies to manage fatigue and reduce its impact on daily life. Despite growing evidence of
      the effectiveness of face-to-face energy conservation education, not all people with MS are
      able to access these programs. The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness and
      efficacy of a teleconference-delivered energy conservation education program for people with
      MS. The primary goals of the project are to reduce the impact of fatigue on participants'
      everyday lives, reduce fatigue severity, and improve quality of life. Secondary goals are to
      increase self-efficacy for managing fatigue and increase the number of energy conservation
      strategies used. The study will employ a randomly allocated two group time series design with
      a wait-list control group, which is one type of randomized control trial. A total of 181
      people with MS will be recruited through direct mailing and advertising. The program will be
      delivered by telephone teleconference by a licensed occupational therapist. Outcome measures
      will be administered over the telephone by a research assistant before and after the program,
      at three months and at six months. We hypothesize that: (1) individuals in the immediate
      intervention group achieve better outcomes than individuals in the wait-list control group;
      (2) the program leads to significant reductions in fatigue impact and fatigue severity, and
      improved quality of life; and (3) improvements in the outcomes can be maintained over six
      months.

    <description>Fatigue impact was measured using the &quot;Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS)&quot; (Fisk et al, 1994). This 40-item scale evaluates the construct of perceived impact of fatigue on everyday life. Respondents rate each statement using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (extreme problem). A total score (range from 0 to 160) and three subscale scores (physical - 10 items, score range 0 to 40; psychosocial - 20 items, score range 0 to 80; cognitive - 10 items, score range 0-40) can be produced from participants' responses. Higher scores reflect greater fatigue impact. What is reported here is the mean individual differences in the 7 week post subscale scores minus the baseline subscale scores</description>

    <description>The intervention for this study is a group-based educational program delivered by teleconference to 4-6 individuals with MS by a licensed occupational therapist. The program involves 6 weekly sessions. Each session is 1 hour and 15 minutes in duration. Key topics addressed include: importance of rest, positive and effective communication, modification of the environment, using equipment and technology, setting priorities, and activity analysis and modification. Direct instruction, group discussion, and peer support are key elements of the program. Participants receive a manual with application activities that are completed in between sessions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Subscale Scores of the Fatigue Impact Scale</title>
        <description>Fatigue impact was measured using the &quot;Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS)&quot; (Fisk et al, 1994). This 40-item scale evaluates the construct of perceived impact of fatigue on everyday life. Respondents rate each statement using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (extreme problem). A total score (range from 0 to 160) and three subscale scores (physical - 10 items, score range 0 to 40; psychosocial - 20 items, score range 0 to 80; cognitive - 10 items, score range 0-40) can be produced from participants’ responses. Higher scores reflect greater fatigue impact. What is reported here is the mean individual differences in the 7 week post subscale scores minus the baseline subscale scores</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Subscale Scores of the Fatigue Impact Scale</title>
          <description>Fatigue impact was measured using the &quot;Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS)&quot; (Fisk et al, 1994). This 40-item scale evaluates the construct of perceived impact of fatigue on everyday life. Respondents rate each statement using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (no problem) to 4 (extreme problem). A total score (range from 0 to 160) and three subscale scores (physical - 10 items, score range 0 to 40; psychosocial - 20 items, score range 0 to 80; cognitive - 10 items, score range 0-40) can be produced from participants’ responses. Higher scores reflect greater fatigue impact. What is reported here is the mean individual differences in the 7 week post subscale scores minus the baseline subscale scores</description>
