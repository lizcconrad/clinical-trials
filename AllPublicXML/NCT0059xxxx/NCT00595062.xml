  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was started to validate the possibility of administering radiation therapy during
      surgery to the tissue surrounding the tumor once the tumor has been removed. This surrounding
      breast tissue is at greater risk for developing breast recurrences. This treatment may be as
      effective as the conventional 5-6week radiation treatment in reducing the risk of further
      local recurrences after breast-conserving surgery.

      Through this study, we would like to confirm that this procedure is a safe alternative to
      conventional breast radiation, with no additional side effects when compared with the
      conventional surgery and radiation therapy.

      This pilot trial will evaluate the feasibility of intra operative radiation therapy (IORT)
      given in one fraction at the time of wide local excision as the only adjuvant radiation
      treatment in a group of patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer.

      This study will enroll 60 women, older than 60 years of age, with breast cancer not more than
      2 cm in size and without evident additional tumoral foci around the tumor or in other areas
      of the breast. An MSK radiologist will review your mammography to be sure you qualify for
      this study. You may be asked to undergo additional mammography or other examinations, such as
      breast ultrasound in order to verify that the tumor is located in a single quadrant of the
      breast. Some of these procedures are routinely performed in all candidates for conservative
      breast surgery.
