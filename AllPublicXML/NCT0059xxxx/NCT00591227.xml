  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine two questions: 1. Whether insulin treatment of high blood sugar in
      patients with diabetes while they are in the emergency room will improve how quickly they
      recover from illness if they need to be hospitalized. 2. Whether immediately beginning long
      lasting insulin detemir in patients with diabetes when they are admitted to hospital from the
      emergency room will improve how quickly they recover from the illness which necessitated
      hospitalization.
