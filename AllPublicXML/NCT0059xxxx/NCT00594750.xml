      The purpose of this study is to identify the causes of asthma that were not previously
      suspected, to better understand the effects of inhaled steroids on asthma and to identify new
      way to treat asthma.

      In this study, we will explore mechanisms of exacerbation in asthma by careful
      characterization studies in asthmatics presenting in acute severe exacerbation. Specifically,
      we will determine the frequency of secretor status in these subjects by blood and saliva
      testing, and we will also perform a detailed cellular and biochemical analysis of their
      airway secretions. We will collect airway secretions using two methods. One method will be to
      have subjects cough sputum into a clean plastic container. The other method only applies to
      asthmatics with near-fatal asthma requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. In these
      asthmatics, we will collect airway secretions by tracheal aspirate using methods normally
      applied in their clinical care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects with a history of asthma between the ages of 18 to 75 years.

          2. Physician diagnosis of asthma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lung disease other than asthma.

          2. Females who are lactating or who are pregnant.

          3. Use of recreational drugs in the 1 month preceding the study.
