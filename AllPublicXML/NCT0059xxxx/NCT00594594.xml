  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that probiotic Lactobacillus can augment antibiotic treatment of symptomatic
      urinary tract infection (UTI) in spinal cord injured patients, and also increase the time to
      the next episode of UTI.

      Subjects will be recruited from the outpatient population and 'alumni' of the Regional SCI
      Rehabilitation Programs in London (Parkwood Hospital/St Joseph's Health Care) and Hamilton
      (Hamilton Health Sciences Centre) Ontario.

      Community living paraplegic and tetraplegic men and women (18 years and above) who present to
      their family physician or specialist with symptomatic UTI will be prescribed an antibiotic
      treatment for up to 14 days (using the drug of choice i.e. which the treating physician deems
      appropriate) and randomized to also receive by mouth two capsules containing placebo or
      probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 daily.
