  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral therapy with montelukast may lead to improved polysomnographic findings in children with
      mild to moderate OSAS with and without allergic rhinitis who a priori require T&amp;A for OSAS.

      - A significant proportion of the children with OSAS treated with montelukast will show
      reduced severity of OSAS, and this will obviate the need for surgical T&amp;A.

      Primary Specific Aim. To conduct a randomized double blind 16-week trial comparing the effect
      on polysomnographic measures of the administration of once a day oral montelukast therapy vs.
      placebo in children with OSAS.

      Secondary Specific Aim. For all children with the original AHI at diagnosis of &gt;2 hrTST, we
      expect improvements in the severity of sleep apnea to occur following treatment with
      montelukast. Therefore, we will examine the overall reduction in AHI and also how many of
      these children have AHI&lt; 2 after the 16-week treatment. In other words, the percentage of
      children converting from needing T&amp;A surgery before treatment with montelukast to not needing
      surgery after treatment will be examined.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic snoring children &gt; 2 years of age and &lt; 10 years of age, who snore and
             have an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;2/hrTST (hour total sleep time), and in whom T&amp;A
             is therefore contemplated. Also among these, we will include children referred for
             evaluation for snoring who have a history of allergic rhinitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hypersensitivity to montelukast

          -  Immunodeficiency or immunosuppressant therapy

          -  Craniofacial, neuromuscular, syndromic or defined genetic abnormalities

          -  Acute upper respiratory tract infection

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy or antibiotic therapy in the 2 weeks previous to the
             study

          -  Children who already had adenotonsillectomy.

        In addition, children chronically receiving oral antihistamine preparations or nasal
        decongestants will be required to continue using these medications throughout the duration
        of the study. Patients receiving immunotherapy will continue on the same regimen without
        escalation of dose and frequency throughout the duration of the study. In addition,
        patients with severe OSA who in the opinion of their treating physicians require early
        surgical intervention for their OSA will be excluded from eligibility to the study.
