    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare how PF-00734200 is adsorbed, distributed, broken down
      and eliminated by subjects with mild, moderate and severe kidney impairment, by subjects
      receiving chronic hemodialysis, and by subjects with normal kidney function. The removal rate
      of PF-00734200 by hemodialysis will be calculated. The safety and tolerability of PF-00734200
      in subjects with various degrees of kidney function or undergoing chronic hemodialysis will
      be assessed.
