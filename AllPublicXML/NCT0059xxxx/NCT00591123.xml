  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, Erlotinib and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin (a regimen
      known also as FOLFOX-6) will be the chemotherapy study drugs. The main purpose of this study
      is to test the safety and effectiveness of this combination of chemotherapy drugs and to see
      how they affect your cancer.

      Another purpose of this study is to examine samples from your blood and tumor. This research
      will be done to better understand how subjects respond to treatment. Specifically,
      researchers will look at the way your genes and proteins respond to drugs like those used in
      this study.

    <description>Once every two weeks all patients will receive Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV, Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV and 5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV infusions, after which 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 IV will be given via pump for 46-48 hours at home. All patients will also be given Erlotinib, 100 mg orally daily for the first 4 weeks. Those patients who have not experienced toxicities will increase the dose level to 150 mg daily. Patients who have toxicities will remain at the 100 mg dose level or lower if necessary.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Metastatic or unresectable adenocarcinoma of the upper gastrointestinal tract that can
             be measured in at least one dimension according to RECIST criteria by CT or MRI

          2. Gastric adenocarcinomas may be included if the primary tumor arises within 5 cm of the
             anatomic gastro-esophageal junction (distal esophagus) or from the gastric cardia as
             indicated by either endoscope or imaging.

          3. Previously untreated with chemotherapeutic agents for unresectable or metastatic
             disease.

          4. Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are allowed as long as no oxaliplatin was
             used in the past 12 months.

                  metastasis).

         13. Creatinine clearance of &gt; 60 ml/min as calculated by the Cockcroft Gault formula. (Ccr
             = ((140-Age) X Wt (kg))/ (72 X SCr (mg/100ml) for males).

             (Ccr = ((140-Age) X Wt (kg))/ (72 X SCr (mg/100ml) x 0.85 for females)

          6. Any other medical conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             preclude subjects to participate in the study.

          7. Patients who have received chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy within 30 days
