    <textblock>
      Allergy skin tests and allergen immunotherapy are common procedures for both the diagnosis
      and treatment of atopic diseases. Allergen immunotherapy has proved to be effective in
      reducing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and asthma1-2. Despite its clinical benefit, there
      is risk of systemic reactions associated with these procedures.

      The systemic reaction rate to skin testing for aeroallergens is significant lower than the
      rate of reactions to immunotherapy, but it is not negligible. Lin et al reported only 2
      patients who had systemic allergic reactions to skin testing for respiratory allergies in
      10,400 patients tested.3 They determined the overall risk of inducing anaphylactic reactions
      by skin testing to be less than 0.02% and other studies have produced similar results.4-5 The
      rate of systemic reactions to skin testing is likely underscored. Thompson et. al reported a
      systemic reaction rate of 6% of patients receiving skin testing.6 It is important to
      recognize the risk of systemic reactions seeing skin testing is commonly done. It is also
      imperative to recognize the treatments for these reactions to prevent progression.

      Hypothesis The systemic reaction rate to allergen immunotherapy and skin testing to
      aeroallergens is higher than previously reported. Biphasic anaphylactic reactions rarely
      occur with allergen immunotherapy and skin testing.
