    <textblock>
      For patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure, current treatment can include AV
      nodal ablation with biventricular pacing. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a new procedure
      for this patient population which attempts to restore sinus rhythm. This trial is a
      randomized controlled trial of AVN ablation with biventricular pacing versus PVI for atrial
      fibrillation patients with congestive heart failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation with NYHA II-III symptoms despite the
             use of anti-arrhythmic medications.

          -  Ejection fraction was required to be ≤ 40%.

          -  Patients were required to be on a heart failure regimen that included beta-blockers
             and ace-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for all patients and
             spironolactone for NYHA III patients.

          -  Patients were required to complete a 6-minute walk test and to be ≥ 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Reversible causes of AF and heart failure (HF) such as pericarditis, hyperthyroidism,
             valvular heart disease and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

          -  Post-operative AF, previous MAZE or MAZE-like surgery, previous left atrial
             instrumentation

          -  Life expectancy ≤ 2 years

          -  Likely cardiac transplant within the next 12 months

          -  Contraindication to anti-arrhythmic medications and/or anticoagulation

          -  Severe pulmonary disease
