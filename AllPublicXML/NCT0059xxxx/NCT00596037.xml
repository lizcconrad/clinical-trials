      The objective of this rollover study is to evaluate the long term (1 year) safety of a new
      weekly administered growth hormone preparation in adults with growth hormone deficiency who
      were treated with the same experimental preparation in study BPLG-005. In addition, further
      change in efficacy endpoints of BPLG-005 by prolonged treatment will be evaluated. Additional
      efficacy and safety data of the experimental preparation will be obtained from the
      switch-over patients.
