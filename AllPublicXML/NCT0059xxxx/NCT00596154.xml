  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of this new treatment offered in this
      study. PCNSL can be cured in less than half of patients with standard treatment, a
      combination of chemotherapy and brain radiation. Also, the combination of chemotherapy and
      brain radiation may result in serious lasting side effects. Most patients older than age 60
      develop memory problems, difficulty walking or inability to control their bladder. Some
      patients younger than age 60 also develop these side effects.

    <description>Rituximab, methotrexate (MTX), procarbazine and vincristine (R-MPV). The peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest procedure will be performed at the discretion of the hematology attending (usually after the 1st or 2nd cycle of R-MPV)and high dose chemotherapy Busulfan, Thiotepa, and Cyclophosphamide.</description>

    <description>The initial treatment will consist of cycles of 14 days. Each cycle will start with rituximab, which will be given by vein on day 1.
On day 2 you will be admitted to the hospital and will receive 3 other drugs:
Methotrexate will be given by vein over 2 to 3 hours only on day 2. Vincristine will be given as a single injection over a few minutes only on day 2.
Procarbazine is a pill that you will take at bedtime for 7 nights starting on day 2. Procarbazine is only given every other cycle.</description>
    <arm_group_label>1</arm_group_label>
    <other_name>During each cycle, you will receive Rituximab typically as an outpatient on day 1 and then be</other_name>
    <other_name>admitted on day 2 to receive the other chemotherapy. You will be in the hospital for about 5 days and will be re-admitted to the hospital about 9 days</other_name>
    <other_name>later to start the next cycle. After each cycle of chemotherapy you will take a medicine called G-CSF to protect you against</other_name>
    <other_name>infection. PBPCs will be collected when determined by your doctor and may occur with cycle 1 or cycle 2.</other_name>
    <other_name>You will be admitted again for the high-dose chemotherapy and will receive supportive</other_name>
    <other_name>medications to help avoid complications, including antibiotics and blood transfusions. Three</other_name>
    <other_name>drugs, Busulfan, Thiotepa, and Cyclophosphamide will be given to you over 8 days. After a</other_name>
    <other_name>rest period of approximately 1-2 days, we will give your PBPCs (or bone marrow) back to you</other_name>
    <other_name>by vein. You will be in the hospital for at least 3 weeks.</other_name>
