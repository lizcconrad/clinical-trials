      The objective of this trial is to assess the toxicity of thymus transplantation following
      unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. Emphasis will be placed on adverse events
      that are not typically associated with umbilical cord blood transplantation. Also, to
      determine whether engraftment of a third party thymus allograft is feasible in patients who
      have undergone unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation.

      The objective of this trial is to assess the toxicity of thymus transplantation following
      unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. Emphasis will be placed on adverse events
      that are not typically associated with umbilical cord blood transplantation. Also, to
      determine whether engraftment of a third party thymus allograft is feasible in patients who
      have undergone unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. Thymic engraftment will be
      determined by biopsy of the thymus allograft and immunohistochemical evidence of
      thymopoiesis. In addition, we would like to assess thymic function by measuring the number of
      naive T cells and the number of T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECS), and
      by assessing the diversity of the T cell receptor beta chain. These data will be compared to
      age, stem-cell donor source and disease matched historical controls whose stem cell
      transplants were not followed by a thymus transplant. This will be done in descriptive
      fashion. Other immune parameters will be followed including T, B, and NK cell numbers, T cell
      responses to mitogens, antigens, and immunoglobulin production.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who received a dual cord blood transplant are eligible and must have achieved
             donor cord blood chimerism of &gt; 75% in both T-cell and myeloid lineages

          -  At the time of thymus transplantation, subjects cannot have active grade II-IV acute
             graft versus host disease.

          -  At the time of thymus transplantation, the subject must have an absolute neutrophil
             count of &gt; 500/ul and a platelet count of 50,000/ul (even if achieved via
             transfusion).

          -  At the time of thymus transplantation, the subject must have &lt; or equal to 50
             circulating CD 34+ cells/ul (as measured within 3 weeks of transplant date).

          -  At the time of thymus transplantation, subjects cannot be on greater than 2 mg/kg/day
             methylprednisolone or its equivalent of steroids.

          -  At the time of thymus transplantation, PT and PTT must be less that 1.5 times the ULN
             or must be correctable to this level.

          -  At the time of thymus transplantation, subjects cannot require oxygen or have
             pulmonary disease that would be thought to make general anesthesia a high risk.

          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 18 and 60 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects cannot have bone marrow flow cytometry demonstrating residual leukemia

          -  Subjects cannot have insufficient subcutaneous tissue and muscle mass to be able to
             accept and heal a thymus transplant, as assessed by a surgeon.

          -  Prior to thymus transplantation, subjects cannot have evidence of active disease with
             HHV6, West Nile Virus, EBV, and CMV.
