      The researchers' long-term goal is to develop a small implantable device that can continually
      monitor glucose levels. This will be an antenna. Changes in the glucose levels in will affect
      the antenna signals and those can be used to predict the patient's glucose levels.

      Our goal is to develop a small size implantable device that can continually monitor glucose
      levels. The scientific objective of this application is to examine the efficacy of using
      implantable antennas to measure the glucose levels. The central hypothesis of this
      application is that the changes in the glucose levels in the medium surrounding the antenna
      will affect the antenna parameters such as input impedance and resonance frequency, and these
      changes can be used to predict the patient's glucose levels. We have formulated this
      hypothesis on the basis of our preliminary data, which will be detailed later, in the
      Preliminary Studies section. The rationale for the proposed research is that, once the
      correlation between the glucose levels and antenna parameters are determined, the design of a
      miniaturized long term glucose monitoring device will become a reality.
