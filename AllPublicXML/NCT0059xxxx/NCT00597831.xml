      The purpose of this study is to determine whether electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has an
      influence on pressure within the human brain before, during and after ECT.

      1. Aim:

             1. Our main objective concerning this study is to determine to what extent ECT does
                lead to an increase of the Pulsatility Index (as an indicator of intracerebral
                pressure) measured by a Transcranial Doppler Device (TCD).

             2. As a secondary objective we want to compare the PI measurements with simultaneously
                measured systemic blood pressure.

        2. Study design:

           a.Observational study: cohort study

        3. Treatment:

           a. Treatment as usual, PI and blood pressure measurement at baseline, just before ECT,
           during and 5 minutes after ECT. Data will be collected during unilateral treatment
           during 3 consecutive ECT treatments.

        4. Endpoints:

             1. A minimum of sixteen patients are needed according to the power analysis.
