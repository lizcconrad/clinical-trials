    <textblock>
      Background: During the first half of the 20th century, scalp irradiation was a standard
      treatment for induction of epilation in children suffering from Tinea Capitis. These children
      are now more than 50 years old and the aim was to investigate the possible association
      between their childhood low dose irradiation exposure and development of carotid
      atherosclerotic disease in adulthood.

      Methods: The study included 145 individuals treated by irradiation in their childhood, and
      150 matched control subjects with no history of irradiation. B-mode ultrasound imaging and US
      Doppler were used to measure carotid and femoral stenosis and Intima-Media Thickness (IMT).
      Blood samples were taken for lipid profile and homocysteine evaluation.

      Blood samples, 10 ml, were procured for assessment of creatinine, total cholesterol, high
      density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides (TG), calculated low density lipoproteins (LDL) and
      homocysteine.

        The study was designed to include 150 persons who were treated as children for Tinea
        Capitis by scalp irradiation in the 1950's and 150 subjects who were not exposed to
        radiation. This sample size was determined under the following assumption: power of â‰¥95%,
        alpha error level of 5%, 10% prevalence of carotid stenosis in the non exposed group and
        minimal OR of 2.5.
