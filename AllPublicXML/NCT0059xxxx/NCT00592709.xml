    <textblock>
      We are collecting brain tissue specimens and blood samples from patients at Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center who are undergoing intracranial surgery to remove brain tissue,
      including brain tumors, tissue from epilepsy surgery and brain tissue removed during surgery
      for other non-cancerous types of brain tissus. These specimens will then be studied using a
      novel microscopic laser-directed protein mass spectrometric analysis, looking for unique
      protein signatures.

      We are collecting brain tissue specimens and blood samples from patients at Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center who are undergoing intracranial surgery to remove brain tissue,
      including brain tumors, tissue from epilepsy surgery and brain tissue removed during surgery
      for other non-cancerous types of brain tissus. These specimens will then be studied using a
      novel microscopic laser-directed protein mass spectrometric analysis. Data from different
      brain tissues including tumors of different histological sub-types will be analyzed for
      unique protein signatures. These protein signatures will then be statistically correlated
      with clinical data including time to tumor progression and response to therapy.

      The goal of this study is to determine molecular patterns that will be more predictive of
      tumor behavior, thus leading to an improved understanding of the basic biology of these
      poorly understood cancers. This in turn, may lead to more refined therapies and improved
      outcomes.
