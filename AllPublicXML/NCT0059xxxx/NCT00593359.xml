      This study will compare the effect of two intravenous solutions on eye pressure during spine
      surgery in the following groups:

      Group A - Lactated Ringer's replacement for blood loss and placebo eye drops

      Group B - Lactated Ringer's replacement for blood loss and brimonidine eye drops

      Group C - Albumin replacement for blood loss and placebo eye drops

      Group D - Albumin replacement for blood loss and brimonidine eye drops
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be administered either brimonidine eye drops, or placebo eye drops,
      preoperatively, on the day of surgery and during surgery. Eye pressure will be measured
      before surgery, every 30 minutes throughout your surgery and every hour for 4 hours following
      surgery. Subjects will be evaluated before surgery and on days 5, 8, 15 after surgery. During
      these evaluations, the subject will be asked questions about recovery and his/her eyes will
      be checked by an ophthalmologist and vision will be tested.
