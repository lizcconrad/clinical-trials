    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation pose problems when percutaneous
      coronary intervention with stent implantation (PCI-S) is performed. In the absence of solid
      evidence-based data, no definite recommendations for the management of this patient subset
      are currently given in the guidelines on percutaneous coronary intervention issued by the
      most prominent Cardiology Associations. The management of the antithrombotic treatment before
      invasive cardiac procedures is also incompletely defined. In this study we aim to determine
      in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI-S:

        1. the contemporary antithrombotic management;

        2. the relative safety and efficacy of the various post-PCI antithrombotic regimens;

        3. the safety and efficacy of drug-eluting stents (DES), bare-metal stents (BMS), and
           bioactive stents (BAS);

        4. the safety of various periprocedural antithrombotic strategies including glycoprotein
           IIb/IIIa inhibitors and bivalirudin;

        5. safety and efficacy of radial vs femoral approach.

      AFCAS study is an observational, multi-center, prospective registry including patients with
      atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI-S. Follow-up time is 12 months.

      Primary end points are major hemorrhagic and thrombotic/thromboembolic complications
      including cardiac death and secondary endpoints are Major adverse cardiac events (i.e., need
      for urgent re-revascularization, myocardial infarction, death), stent thrombosis and
      major/non major hemorrhagic complications. Clinical follow-up will be completed for all
      patients via telephone, or clinic visits scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after PCI-S. The
      1 and 6 months visits are optional. The patients will be asked about their clinical outcomes,
      hospitalizations and medications. Any additional information needed, such as specific
      mortality, will be obtained by contacting one of the patient's physicians or other health
      care professional or from death certificates. CRFs will be completed and faxed without delays
      after discharge, and after each follow up visit. Recruitment will take approximately 12
      months. Follow-up will be 12 months for each patient.
