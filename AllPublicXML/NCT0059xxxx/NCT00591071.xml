  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU), the occurrence of a blood glucose
      imbalance is frequent and associated with increased mortality. These observations have
      resulted in the hypothesis that intensive insulin therapy designed to control blood glucose
      would improve the prognosis of patients admitted into the ICU. In a prospective, randomized,
      single center study in a surgical ICU during which the majority of patients had undergone
      cardiac surgery, intensive insulin therapy with the objective to maintain glycemia below 110
      mg/dl (6.1 mmol/L) provided a significant reduction in ICU mortality and hospital mortality
      compared to a group with a glycemic objective of 200 mg/dl.

      In a recent published article, the beneficial effect of intensive insulin therapy seems less
      obvious in a randomized single center study in a medical ICU. One of the potential factors
      limiting the impact of a therapeutic strategy like this one is the absence of achieving
      strict glycemic control for all patients on intensive insulin therapy. Additionally, the
      implementation of such a therapeutic strategy results in an increased risk of hypoglycemia,
      the consequences of which on morbidity remain unclear.

      The aim of our study is to determine, in a mixed population of medical and surgical patients
      admitted to the ICU, requiring artificial ventilation with a expected duration above 48
      hours, the impact of effective strict glycemic control (&lt;6,1 mmol/l) compared to a
      conventional glycemic control (&lt;11mmol/l) on hospital mortality.

      In both randomization arms, continuous insulin infusion will be used via the venous route of
      administration. Rapid action insulin Novorapid HM (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark) will be
      used.

      ICU patient management requires many intravenously administered treatments in a limited
      number of venous lines (catecholamines, sedation, feeding, vascular filling, antioticsâ€¦).
      This situation does not enable to dedicate an infusion line for the intravenous
      administration of insulin. Despite continuous administration of insulin infusion, the
      concomitant administration of other treatments in the same infusion line obviously leads to
      significant variations in the flow of insulin actually delivered, which can lead to
      variations in blood glucose and adjustments secondary to the inappropriate dose of insulin.
      To limit this phenomenon, an OCTOPUS (Vygon, Ecouen, France) type infusion connector will be
      added. The infusion connector is made of 2 infusion lines one of which will be exclusively
      dedicated to insulin therapy subsequently limiting the risk of variations in insulin
      administration flow.

      The determination of the number of subjects to include was carried out by using a 45%
      hospital mortality hypothesis in the conventional glycemic control group. and a 32 % hospital
      mortality hypothesis in the strict glycemic control group.
