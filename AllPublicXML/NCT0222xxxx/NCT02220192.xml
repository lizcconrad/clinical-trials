  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test the short-term effectiveness of an alternative treatment
      approach for precancerous cells of the cervix. The study will also explore whether this new
      treatment is feasible to perform and if it is acceptable to patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for precancerous cells of the cervix is called electrosurgical excision
      procedure (LEEP). Standard LEEP involves treating the entire cervix using FDA-approved
      equipment. Focal LEEP utilizes the same surgery and the same equipment but only treats the
      visually unhealthy part of the cervix and not the entire cervix. Side effects and unusual
      symptoms will be monitored as well as the patient's thoughts and recommendations of the
      procedure. The total amount of time of study participation is six months.

    <description>All patients will undergo focal treatment of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia using LEEP. A two-week follow-up assessment will evaluate the side effects of the treatment and any unusual symptoms. This will be done through a phone survey. At six months a clinic visit is required to assess whether there are any precancerous cells of the patient's cervix.</description>

    <description>Focal LEEP may or may not cause less damage to the cervix versus standard LEEP. This could potentially be an advantage by avoiding future complications during pregnancy.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21-45 years old

          -  Histologically confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2, CIN3, or
             CIN2/3). A copy of the pathology report is required at the time of enrollment. We will
             only include patients that had their biopsy performed at the UAB Colposcopy clinic
             because those that return for treatment represent a select group that is more reliable
             for follow-up given the standard no-show rate of 50% at the clinic.

          -  Focal lesion visualized in its entirety colposcopically and involving less than or
             equal to 2 quadrants of the cervix.

          -  Satisfactory (adequate) colposcopy.

          -  Lives within 100 miles of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any suspicion for invasive cancer.

          -  Glandular abnormalities on cytology or histology.

          -  Cervical lesion incompletely visualized (e.g. extending into the endocervical canal).

          -  Endocervical curettage positive for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

          -  Unreliable for follow-up (drug use, planning to move out of region, etc.). Any patient
             that lives &gt;100 miles away will be excluded due to concern for possible loss to
             follow-up.

          -  Immunosuppression (HIV positive, history of transplantation, lupus on
             immunosuppressive medication, etc.).

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of the study.
