  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System in patients with
      severe age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The Argus II System has already been studied
      in completely blind patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In RP patients, some cells of
      the retina are irrevocably damaged and the Argus II System has been found to restore some
      basic visual function. On these grounds, the device has received authorization for use on the
      European market (the CE certification) in 2011.

      In this study, 5 subjects with severe dry AMD who are legally blind will be implanted with
      the Argus II System. The study will evaluate the safety of the device and surgery, as well as
      functioning of the system and the extent of any restored vision. Each subject will be
      followed for 3 years, with their eye health and visual function tested at multiple time
      points.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must consent to participate in the study;

          2. Subject must be between 25 and 85 years of age;

          3. Subject must be diagnosed with dry AMD (i.e., evidence of drusen and hyperplasia of
             the RPE in the eye with geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD);

          4. Severely sight impaired and meets the following additional criteria:

               1. Visual acuity of logMAR 1.0 (6/60) or worse in both eyes as measured by ETDRS;

               2. Hand motion or worse central vision in the eye to be implanted, as measured with
                  a pinhole occluder;

               3. Geographic atrophy (confirmed by Fundus Autofluorescence) and central scotoma
                  (confirmed by microperimetry) in the central 20Â° or more;

          5. Subject must be pseudophakic with an IOL successfully implanted in the study eye at
             least 2 weeks before baseline testing, or aphakic with a clear capsule. If applicable,
             posterior laser capsulotomy may be performed 2 weeks before baseline testing is
             performed;

          6. Subject must be both motivated and competent to learn to use the Argus II System (by
             the Investigator's assessment), and willing and able to commit to the study
             requirements. This includes an understanding of the requirements of the study and
             acceptance of the time involved in participating;

          7. Subject must not suffer from non-ophthalmic serious adverse events (e.g., myocardial
             infarction, etc.) or from non-curable life threatening conditions (e.g. cancer) at the
             time of the Baseline visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ocular diseases or conditions that could prevent the Argus II implant from working
             (e.g., optic nerve disease, central retinal artery or vein occlusion, history of
             retinal detachment, trauma, etc.);

          2. Evidence of active sub-macular choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in implanted eye;

          3. Ocular structures or conditions that could prevent the successful implantation of the
             Argus II Implant or adequate healing from surgery (e.g. extremely thin conjunctiva;
             axial length &lt;20.5 mm or &gt; 26 mm; corneal ulcers; abnormalities in the typical
             curvature of the retina like staphyloma and all causes of significant protrusions or
             depressions in the area centralis that could compromise the optimal position of the
             electrode array, active or severe blepharitis, etc.);

          4. Ocular diseases or conditions (other than cataracts) that prevent adequate
             visualization of the inner structures of the eye (e.g., corneal opacity);

          5. An Implantable Miniature Telescope in either eye;

          6. Pre-disposition to eye rubbing;

          7. Any disease or condition that prevents understanding or communication of informed
             consent, study demands, and testing protocols, including:

               1. cognitive decline including diagnosed forms of dementia and/or progressive
                  neurologic disease,

               2. psychiatric disease including diagnosed forms of depression;

               3. does not speak a principal language associated with the region, and

               4. deafness or selective frequency hearing loss that prevents hearing device alarms
                  and alerts;

          8. Pregnant or wish to become pregnant during the course of the study;

          9. Participating in another investigational drug or device study that may conflict with
             the objectives, follow-up or testing of this study;

         10. Inability to tolerate general anaesthesia or the recommended antibiotic and steroid
             regimen associated with the implantation surgery;

         11. Conditions likely to limit life to less than 1 year from the time of inclusion.
