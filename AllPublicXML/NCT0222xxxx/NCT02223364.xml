  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a better way to make patients comfortable after their
      knee surgery. The investigators compared three ways of providing pain relief, either by use
      of a nerve block at the femoral and sciatic nerve areas, or with actual injections in the
      surgical joint area with one of two different medicines, either ropivacaine or liposomal
      bupivacaine (ExparelÂ®). The hypothesis was that the nerve block at the femoral and sciatic
      nerve areas would result in lower pain scores and opioid consumption than either of the two
      injections in the surgical joint area.

    <measure>Balance Testing on Operative Leg Using Unipedal Stance Time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to measure clinical balance, unipedal stance time (UST) was collected as an indicator of balance and fall risk. Timing (in seconds) began upon withdrawal of support and continued until the uplifted foot returned to the floor, the subject required support, or if the subject reached a time limit of 30 seconds. The best performance of three repetitions was recorded for analysis. Normative values for the UST are available. A UST threshold of 30 seconds yields a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 58% in identifying those with a history of falls. The first five seconds of unipedal stance is indicative of dynamic balance; inability to maintain unipedal stance for five seconds is a significant predictor of injurious falls.</description>

          <description>This group received intra articular injection with Ropivacaine, a total volume of 120 milliliters (mL) injected in the periarticular structures by the surgeon. Following the current, standardized practice for periarticular infiltration, approximately 30 - 40 mL of solution was injected into the posterior capsule just prior to cementing the implants in place and 40 - 50 mL of solution injected into the medial and lateral retinaculum while the cement was hardening and prior to deflation of the tourniquet. The remaining volume of approximately 40 mL was injected into the quadriceps tendon and subcutaneous tissue prior to skin closure.</description>

        <title>Balance Testing on Operative Leg Using Unipedal Stance Time</title>
        <description>In order to measure clinical balance, unipedal stance time (UST) was collected as an indicator of balance and fall risk. Timing (in seconds) began upon withdrawal of support and continued until the uplifted foot returned to the floor, the subject required support, or if the subject reached a time limit of 30 seconds. The best performance of three repetitions was recorded for analysis. Normative values for the UST are available. A UST threshold of 30 seconds yields a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 58% in identifying those with a history of falls. The first five seconds of unipedal stance is indicative of dynamic balance; inability to maintain unipedal stance for five seconds is a significant predictor of injurious falls.</description>

          <title>Balance Testing on Operative Leg Using Unipedal Stance Time</title>
          <description>In order to measure clinical balance, unipedal stance time (UST) was collected as an indicator of balance and fall risk. Timing (in seconds) began upon withdrawal of support and continued until the uplifted foot returned to the floor, the subject required support, or if the subject reached a time limit of 30 seconds. The best performance of three repetitions was recorded for analysis. Normative values for the UST are available. A UST threshold of 30 seconds yields a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 58% in identifying those with a history of falls. The first five seconds of unipedal stance is indicative of dynamic balance; inability to maintain unipedal stance for five seconds is a significant predictor of injurious falls.</description>
