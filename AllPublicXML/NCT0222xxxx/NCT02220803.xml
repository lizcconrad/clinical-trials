  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a short term open, randomized cross over trial to explore and compare the efficacy of
      pharmacological carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) related
      hypertension. Patients will be randomized to receive Acetazolamide(Diamox®)(ACZ), Continuous
      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)or CPAP plus ACZ for 2 weeks. Following a 2 week wash-out
      period all study participants will receive the alternative treatment regimen. The total
      length of the study will be 10 weeks. The effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition on blood
      pressure,hemodynamics and sleep apnea will be investigated.

      Study hypothesis:

      Carbonic anhydrase inhibition alone or in combination with nCPAP will prominently reduce
      blood pressure in patients with OSA. Further it is hypothesized that CA inhibition will
      induce a direct pharmacological effects on vascular stiffness as evidenced in overnight
      non-invasive assessments of vascular stiffness and that this effect will be particularly
      strong in patients also responding with a reduction of blood pressure.

    <description>Acetazolamide: Diamox®. Hard white capsule, 250 mg. The total treatment is 4 weeks (2+2 weeks). Dosing of acetazolamide will be up-titrated during 3 days according to manufacturer instruction and titration scheme of the study. Maximum dosage (750mg) following titration will be administered as morning (250 mg) and evening(500mg) dosages.Evening medication should be taken 2 hours before bedtime.
CPAP: Continuous positive nasal airway pressure (nCPAP) delivers slightly pressurized air throughout the breathing cycle and will be given through a mask that is placed and secured over the person's nose. nCPAP titration will follow clinical routines. The standard setting is a pressure delivery in the pressure range 5-15 mbar. The adequate performance of the device is controlled by user time readers and built-in memory cards and control readings are routinely performed at the end of each treatment regimen. Total duration of CPAP treatment is 4(2+2) weeks.</description>

    <description>Continuous positive nasal airway pressure (nCPAP) delivers slightly pressurized air throughout the breathing cycle and will be given through a mask that is placed and secured over the person's nose. nCPAP titration will follow clinical routines whereby the patient is equipped with an autotitrating device (Sullivan S9). The standard setting is a pressure delivery in the pressure range 5-15 mbar and the full treatment is maintained in the patient´s home. The adequate performance of the device is controlled by user time readers and built-in memory cards and control readings are routinely performed at the end of each treatment regimen. Patients will be encouraged via telephone calls for maximum use. Total duration of CPAP treatment is 4(2+2) weeks.</description>
