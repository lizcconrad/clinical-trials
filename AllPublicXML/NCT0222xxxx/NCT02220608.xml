      The purpose of this research study is to determine the highest dose of a drug called
      bortezomib that can be given with a drug called G-CSF before stem cell collection to help in
      the mobilization of stem cells.

      The purpose of this phase I study is to define the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib and
      its mobilization effects when given with G-CSF for stem cell mobilization in multiple myeloma
      patients. We hypothesize that bortezomib, in addition to increasing the number of mobilized
      stem cells, will optimize final apheresis product by decreasing myeloma cell contamination.
      Therefore, all multiple myeloma patients rather than multiple myeloma patients with G-CSF
      mobilization failure will be the target of this study.

    <time_frame>Approximately 12 months (completion of all patients on trial)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first 28 days after administration of the first dose of bortezomib and before auto-HSCT. Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached.</description>
