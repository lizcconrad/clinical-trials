  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study the influence of fat cell size/number and adipose function on
      weight development over very long time periods (years). By comparing fat biopsies obtained at
      baseline and after &gt;7 years, the investigators will determine the association between adipose
      morphology/function and changes in weight or development of cardiometabolic complications
      (e.g. insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension).

      The investigators will ask all subjects that have previously been examined at the
      investigators laboratory (from 1992 and forward) in studies of adipose tissue function if
      they are interested to participate in a new study. The minimal follow up time is 7 years.

      Saved blood samples and samples from old fat biopsies will be analyzed together with samples
      from new examinations.

      The investigators plan to examine the subjects in the same way as performed at the baseline
      examinations. This includes estimation of total body fat using bioimpedance, venous blood
      samples for determination of insulin, glucose and lipids, subcutaneous fat biopsies with
      determination of fat cell size/number, lipolysis/lipogenesis as well as analysis of adipokine
      secretion.

      In selected patients, baseline examinations included DEXA-measurement (dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry) for determination of body fat distribution as well as hyperinsulinemic
      euglycemic clamp. In these cases, the same type of examinations will be repeated at their
      follow up visits.
