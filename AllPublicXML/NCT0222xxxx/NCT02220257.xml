  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural course of diabetes mellitus involves gradual reduction of β cell mass within islets
      of Langerhans in the pancreas. Symptoms of diabetes present when the mass of
      insulin-producing cells reaches a point where insulin concentration does not suffice to
      maintain proper glycaemia. In many patients β cells regenerate shortly after the diagnosis of
      diabetes and initiation of insulin therapy. This phenomenon is called a remission.

      The aim of this study is to asses the influence of occurrence and duration of remission on
      development of chronic complications of diabetes and patients outcome.

      Natural course of diabetes mellitus involves gradual reduction of β cell mass within islets

      The aim of this study is to asses influence of occurrence and duration of remission on
      development of chronic complications of diabetes and patients outcome.

      Clinical remission was defined as time in which all of the following criteria were met: HbA1c
      below 6.5 % , dose of exogenous insulin below 0.3 U / kg body weight and serum C-peptide
      concentration above 0.5 ng / ml. Patients were divided into those who were in remission at
      any time during follow-up (remitters) and non-remitters.

      At follow-up occurrence of chronic microvascular complications of diabetes (retinopathy,
      diabetic kidney disease and neuropathy) was evaluated.

        The study included 240 consecutive patients, including 77 women and 143 men hospitalized at
        the Department of Internal Medicine and Diabetology of Poznan University of Medical
        Sciences between 2004 and 2007 due to newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.
