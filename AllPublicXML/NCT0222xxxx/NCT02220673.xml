  <official_title>Serial Lung Function Measurements in 12 Healthy and 48 Mild Asthmatic Adults After Oral Inhalation of Ethanolic Solutions Containing Two Concentrations of the Excipient Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT, 0.1% and 0.5%) Administered With the Respimat® B (RMT-B) vs. Corresponding RMT-B and HFA MDI Without BHT; Repeated Increasing Doses With 2, 4, and 6 Actuations of Low Concentration Prior to High Concentration on Separate Days, Double Blind for RMT-B Use, Randomised 4-way Cross-over Design</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective: To investigate the safety and local tolerability of increasing cumulative
      doses (2, 4, 6 actuations) of a low (0.1%) and a high (0.5%) concentration of BHT
      administered via oral inhalation with the Respimat® inhaler B (RMT-B) vs. 2 inhalation
      solutions without BHT (placebo to BHT given by RMT B and placebo given by hydroxylfluoralkane
      metered dose inhaler (HFA MDI)). In a first step, the trial was performed in healthy subjects
      and - if no safety concerns arose - in a second step in patients with mild asthma who were
      sensitive to metacholine in a respective challenge test. Secondary objective: To explore the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of BHT.
