  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal codominant single gene disorder caused by
      mutations in the LDL receptor gene (LDLR) that disrupt the normal clearance of LDL particles
      from the plasma. Heterozygous patients (HeFH) present a two- to three-fold raise in plasma
      LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations and coronary artery disease occurs earlier among HeFH
      carrying negative-receptor (NR) mutations as compared with HeFH subjects carrying
      defective-receptor (DR) variants. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
      regulates LDL-C levels by binding to LDLR and by enhancing its intracellular degradation.

      The objective of this study is to examine to what extent variations in LDL-C and Lipoprotein
      (Lp) (a) concentrations are related to PCSK9 levels in a large French-Canadian cohort of HeFH
      subjects.

      The primary hypothesis is that that PCSK9 levels have a significant impact on LDL-C
      concentration variability and are associated with Lp(a) levels.
