  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if the drug prazosin:

        -  will decrease alcohol use in active duty members of the military who served in Iraq
           and/or Afghanistan and

        -  determine if presence or absence of posttraumatic stress disorder affects treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a 19-week, titration to stable dose, randomized, two-group
      parallel-design, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of prazosin
      for decreasing alcohol use in 200 active duty Service Members who served in the conflicts in
      Iraq and/or Afghanistan who are receiving standard outpatient treatment for alcohol use
      disorders at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Treatment groups will be stratified by presence or
      absence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and by assignment to the 6-week or 12-week
      Army Substance Abuse Program. The hypotheses are that: 1) prazosin is more effective than
      placebo for alcohol use disorders in these Service Members; and 2) that prazosin effect size
      will be greater in Service Members with PTSD than without PTSD.
