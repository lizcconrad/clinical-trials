    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Rotigotine and Levodopa combination therapy
      for younger and older patients with Parkinson's Disease under real life conditions. Effects
      on ability to perform activities of daily living, sleep, medication dose and other factors
      will be assessed.

    <description>The UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living) consists of 13 items, each to be scored between 0 (normal/none) and 4 (highest level of severity). The sum score is calculated as the sum of the 13 individual scores (13 questions=52 points maximum; the higher the sum score, the greater degree of disability).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to end of the Observation Period in Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of Observational Period (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDSS-2 is a 15 item scale that is used to assess sleep and nocturnal disability in Parkinson's Disease. It is designed for interviewer-administered completion or self-completion by patients.
Patients are asked to rate how often during the past week he/she slept well or experienced various symptoms of sleep disability. Each of the 15 items are to be scored between 0 (never) to 4 (very often) with the total score ranging from 0 to 60; the higher the sum score, the greater the degree of impairment.</description>

    <description>The UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living) consists of 13 items, each to be scored between 0 (normal/none) and 4 (highest level of severity).

    <time_frame>End of the Observation Period (Month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>CGI Item 2 (Global Rating of Change of Condition) requires the clinician to rate how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state. Scores range from 0 to 7 as follows: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse.</description>

        Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease receiving levodopa as monotherapy or in
        combination with a dopamine agonist other than Rotigotine, but either not sufficiently
        controlled on or intolerant to current treatment, or other reason; patients are receiving
        treatment in general practitioner (GP) offices, private clinics or hospitals (including

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following selection criteria must be followed for patients entering the
        Noninterventional Study (NIS):

          -  The decision by the treating physician to prescribe Rotigotine transdermal patch is
             made before participating in the NIS due to a clinical therapeutic indication (e.g.,
             because of intolerance and/or ineffectiveness of another dopamine agonist)

          -  The patient is either male or female and over 18 years of age

          -  A Patient Data Consent form is signed and dated by the patient or by the legal
             representative

          -  The patient has idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, has not received Rotigotine within 28
             days prior to the Baseline Visit and is willing to participate in questionnaire based
             assessments

          -  The patient is receiving L-dopa as monotherapy or a combination therapy composed of
             L-dopa and a dopamine agonist other than Rotigotine

          -  The patient has been on L-dopa therapy for at least 6 months and is responding to
             initial L-dopa therapy

          -  The patient has a Hoehn and Yahr stage score of 1 to 4.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they have participated in a clinical study
             of a medication or a medical device within 3 months prior to Baseline or if they are
             participating in a clinical study at the time of inclusion or have already
             participated in the current study.
