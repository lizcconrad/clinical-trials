      Comparison of four methods for measuring temperature perioperatively in patients scheduled
      for laparoscopic surgery and intensive care patients who are hypo-, normo-and hyper terme;
      Bladder Monitoring, Nasopharyngeal, SpotOn TM, Zero heat flux method and Temporal Scanner.
      The study is a single-center, observational study carried out by the Central Surgical and
      Intensive Section at Vestfold Hospital Trust.

      Issues

        -  Perioperative hypothermia is associated with several serious complications and therefore
           most likely to be avoided. Monitoring of body temperature is therefore required
           perioperatively .

        -  There are in the literature concerns that some methods of measuring temperature
           perioperatively is accurate enough and whether they reflect core temperature adequate.

        -  Some authors have questioned whether temporal scanner (TS ) - and nasopharynx ( NP) -
           measurements are accurate enough to measure the actual core temperature. Much of the
           research on TS measurements have been done on children and newborns in an intensive
           setting, but little perioperatively .

      A total of 120 patients will be included ; 60 at Central Operations and 60 at Intensive
      Section at the Vestfold Hospital Trust. Duration of inclusion will be approximately one year
      . Starting around January 2014. The study emanates from Vestfold Hospital Trust and was
      designed by Espen Lindholm who is responsible for the project , Camilla B Norén who is
      principal investigator and project manager. Kjetil G Ringdal , Karl - André Wian and Knut
      Arvid Kirkebøen (University Hospital of Oslo ) are supervisors. The study is supported by
      research, Vestfold Hospital Trust and 3M Company Norway (study material ) and it is applied
      Regional Ethics Committee. Patients will not get different treatment than standard treatment
      in hospital and it causes no follow-up calls or hospital visits. All patients (if possible)
      give written consent for participation.
