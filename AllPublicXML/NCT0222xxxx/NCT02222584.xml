      Physical activity (PA) is beneficial in the prevention and management of chronic disease.
      However, few data exist regarding the level of PA in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
      whether or not vigorous PA may have beneficial effects on patients' health. To evaluate the
      level of PA and the effect of PA on disease activity of patients with IBD. To evaluate the
      effect of PA on quality of life of patients with IBD.
