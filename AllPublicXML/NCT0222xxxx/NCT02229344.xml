  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe clinical course of newly diagnosed moderate to
      severe ulcerative colitis (chronic inflammatory disease of the colon) in tertiary referral
      hospitals in Korea for 5-year follow-up under usual care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (when medical research study takes place in more than one country),
      prospective (study following participants forward in time), disease-oriented and
      hospital-based 5-year follow-up longitudinal study in Korean participants with newly
      diagnosed moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who visit tertiary referral hospital. As the
      study is observational in nature, no intervention will be received by participants. Efficacy
      will primarily be assessed by number of relapses and percentage of participants achieving
      sustained remission (clinical, endoscopic and combined remission).
