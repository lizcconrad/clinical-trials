      The purpose of the study is to 1) define the operating characteristics of fungal biomarker
      assays in pediatric patients at high-risk for developing invasive candidiasis, 2) determine
      the change in fungal biomarker assay results in children who develop invasive candidiasis,
      and 3) create a biobank of blood samples from pediatric patients at high-risk for invasive
      candidiasis and those with invasive candidiasis for future testing of fungal biomarker assays
      and development of new fungal biomarker assays. The study will assemble a prospective cohort
      of pediatric patients at high-risk for developing invasive candidiasis. Blood samples for
      biomarker testing will be obtained at the time a patient has a clinical indication for blood
      culture attainment. Additional blood sampling will be performed on the sub-set of patients
      that are found to have invasive candidiasis. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of
      biomarker assays will be determined for each biomarker assay. No PHI will be stored in the
      database and limits on blood draws (3 ml/kg in an 8 week period) will be adhered to.

      This study will create an international multi-center cohort of children with new clinical
      concern for infection while in the hospital. Sites used are part of the International
      Pediatric Fungal Network (ipfn.org). The study plans to prospectively enroll pediatric
      patients at high-risk of developing invasive candidiasis over a four year period. The study
      duration per subject will be up to 14 days for blood collection and 30 days for data
      collection from the medical record.

      For the first aim, this study will assemble a prospective cohort of pediatric patients at
      high-risk for developing invasive candidiasis. Blood samples for biomarker testing will be
      obtained within 24-hours of a patient having a clinical indication for blood culture
      attainment. To accomplish the second aim, additional blood sampling will be performed in the
      sub-set of patients that are found to have invasive candidiasis. For the third aim, remnant
      blood samples following biomarker testing from all consenting participants will be stored in
      a biobank. This biobank will be used to examine future, currently undeveloped, biomarker
      assays in an effort to further reduce the time to diagnosis of invasive candidiasis.

               -  have gastro-intestinal insufficiency (eg. chronic short-gut syndrome) and
                  admitted to anywhere in the hospital

               -  have a hematological malignancy (limited to AML, ALL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
                  myelodysplastic syndrome) and admitted to anywhere to the hospital

               -  have a solid tumor malignancy and admitted to anywhere in the hospital
