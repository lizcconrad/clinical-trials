      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate antimicrobial properties of a single test
      product, a vehicle product and a reference product applied in two different areas when used
      as a patient preoperative skin preparation.

      This is an open label pilot study to evaluate antimicrobial properties of a single test
      product, a vehicle product and a reference product applied bilaterally to the skin of the
      abdomen and the inguina. Testing will be performed according to FDA TFM for Effectiveness
      Testing of a Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation.

    <description>Antimicrobial efficacy will be evaluated based upon calculation of mean log10 reductions from baseline populations by subtracting the log10 number of viable microorganisms recovered at each post-product application sample from the log10 number of viable microorganisms recovered in the baseline samples. The performance criteria are mean reductions in microbial flora of ≥2 log10 per square cm on skin of the abdomen and ≥3 log10 per square cm on skin of the inguen.</description>

             Disclose Protected Health Information Form, and List of Restricted Products

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exposure of test sites to antimicrobial agents, medicated soaps, medicated shampoos,
             or medicated lotions, use of biocide-treated pools or hot tubs, use of tanning beds,
             or sunbathing during the 14-day pre-test conditioning period or during the test
             period.

          -  Use of topical or systemic antimicrobials, antibiotics, or steroids (other than
             hormones for contraception or post-menopausal indications), or any other product known
             to affect the normal microbial flora of the skin during the 14-day pre-test
             conditioning period or during the test period.

          -  Exposure of the test sites to strong detergents, solvents, or other irritants during
             the 14-day pre-test conditioning period or during the test period.

          -  Known allergies to vinyl, latex (rubber), alcohols, metals, inks, or tape adhesives,
             or to common antibacterial agents found in soaps, lotions, or ointments, particularly
             chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), citric acid, methylene blue, methylparaben,
             propylparaben, or isopropyl alcohol.

          -  A medical diagnosis of a physical condition, such as a current or recent severe
             illness, asthma, diabetes, hepatitis, an organ transplant, mitral valve prolapse,

             such as AIDS (or HIV positive).

          -  Subjects must be unable to become pregnant, or willing to use an acceptable method of
             contraception to prevent pregnancy, if female of child-bearing potential.

          -  Male

          -  Females unable to become pregnant (i.e., postmenopausal for at least 1 year or
             surgically sterile due to hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, uterine ablation, or
             bilateral tubal ligation)

          -  Females of child-bearing potential but using acceptable methods of contraception,
             including one of the following methods that have been used for at least 2 weeks prior
             to Treatment Day Visit.

        Acceptable methods of contraception include one of the following methods:

          -  Systemic birth control (the same type of birth control for at least 3 months prior to
             entering the study and continuation of this type of birth control throughout the
             study)

          -  Double barrier methods (condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide)

          -  IUD

          -  Vasectomized partner; or

          -  Abstinence from sexual intercourse

                  sites.

               -  Dermatoses, cuts, lesions, or other skin disorders on or around the test sites

               -  A currently active skin disease or inflammatory skin condition (e.g., contact
                  dermatitis) that, in the opinion of the Consulting Physician or Principal
                  Investigator, would compromise subject safety or study integrity.

               -  Showering, bathing, or swimming within the 72 hour period prior to Baseline Day,
                  the first Test Day, and throughout the test period.
