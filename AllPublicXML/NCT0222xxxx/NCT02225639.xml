  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the time of onset and time course of
      efficacy over 16 hours of PRC-063 compared to placebo in adults diagnosed with ADHD in a
      simulated adult workplace environment (AWE) setting, as measured by the PERMP (an
      individually-adjusted math test) at pre-dose, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 11.0, 14.0 and 16.0 hours
      post-dose.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled, optimized-dose, phase 3
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRC-063 (methylphenidate hydrochloride
      controlled-release capsules 25, 35, 45, 55, 70, 85 or 100 mg/day) in the treatment of
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adult subjects greater than or equal to 18
      years of age and less than or equal to 60 years of age. After giving written informed
      consent, subjects will be screened to ascertain their suitability for the study according to
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study will have four phases: (1) Screening and
      subsequent washout, if needed; (2) baseline and open-label dose optimization during which
      subjects will be titrated from a starting dose of 25 mg up to his/her final dose (25, 35, 45,
      55, 70, 85 or 100 mg/day); (3) AWE sessions 1 and 2 in the adult analog setting following a
      practice session; and (4) 14-day safety follow-up. Subjects will be required to visit the
      clinic up to 10 times over a 9-week period.
