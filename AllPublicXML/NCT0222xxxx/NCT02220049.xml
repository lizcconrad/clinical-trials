  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VELCADE has demonstrated marked activity in haematological cancers leading to registration
      (MM, MCL).

      Currently only biweekly or weekly regimens have been explored. Key signalling pathways which
      are aberrant in haematological cancers are also present in solid tumors.

      VELCADE covers a broad spectrum of proteins, which are pivotal in carcinogenesis.VELCADE as a
      single agent &amp; in combination with chemotherapy in solid cancers has shown modest and real
      anti-tumor activity but insufficient for Phase III development.

      VELCADE PK exposure may be inadequate in solid tumors compared to &quot;liquid cancers.&quot; VELCADE
      daily low dose administration may allow a greater PK exposure to be achieved, which is
      tolerated

      Hypotheses:

      VELCADE daily dosing (5-days on, 2-days off) is tolerable at biologically active doses
      VELCADE daily dosing (5-days on, 2-days off) results in increased PK (AUC)/PD (20S proteasome
      inhibition) VELCADE daily dosing (5-days on, 2-days off) with increased PK/PD results in
      improved anti-tumor activity (Increased tolerable VELCADE AUC may potentially cross the
      threshold required for clinically significant anti-tumor activity in solid cancers).

      Some preclinical data suggest that: VELCADE daily dosing results in increased proteasome
      inhibition in tumor tissues Combination of VELCADE + XRT/other daily dosing agent may have
      increased anti-tumor activity compared to monotherapy alone.
