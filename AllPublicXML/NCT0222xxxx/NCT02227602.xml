  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bioactive compounds from mango are bioavailable and their anti-inflammatory efficacy has been
      demonstrated in animals and humans. However, the efficacy of mangoes has not previously been
      compared with respect to mild inflammatory bowel disease. In order to justify future
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses in human clinical trials, a pilot assessment to
      determine efficacy in preventing or resolving Inflammatory bowel disease is a necessary step.
      Therefore, in this aim we will determine the clinical relevance of mango as an adjuvant
      treatment to conventional therapy in Inflammatory bowel disease . The effects of mango with
      common drug treatment in mild-moderate Inflammatory bowel disease will be compared to the
      drug-treatment alone. If mango or any other polyphenolic-rich food could be identified as
      helpful in shortening or reducing severity of episodes of inflammatory bowel disease, the
      addition of polyphenolics to conventional drug treatment in Inflammatory bowel disease would
      have a significant impact on public health.

      The clinical study will be designed as a randomized, controlled trial in subjects with
      mild-moderate active Crohn's disease (CD) or mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). This
      study will be carried out in a randomized cross-over design with up to 8 weeks of mango or
      fiber treatment followed by a 4 week wash-out period and 8 weeks of the other treatment.

      Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; CD or UC) will be recruited from patient
      records at the Ertan Digestive Disease Center and advertisement (letters, emails, flyers,
      newspapers). Additionally, patients may be recruited during standard of clinical care
      clinics: a) patients coming in for their regular, e.g. semi-annual or annual routine
      colonoscopy, b) UC or CD-related pain or symptoms, c) individuals presenting with diarrhoea
      that may be due to Crohn's disease or UC may also be recruited. Informed written consent will
      be obtained by the research personnel before the study begins. Approximately 90 individuals
      are expected to enroll in the study in order to obtain 60 subjects completing this study
      (considering screening failure and potential drop-outs). We expect a maximum of 90 subjects
      for the initial screening since many of these will be preselected from existing patient
      files.

      If subjects are scheduled for one of their regular check-up endoscopies, the results of the
      endoscopy will be used to assess the eligibility of subjects for participation in this study.

      This study is designed to incorporate standard of care routine exams as performed within the
      division of gastroenterology. During the initial screening, the inclusion criteria of
      patients will be assessed using the clinical indices. it will be performed a screening in
      which above listed inclusion criteria and hemoglobin, and exclusion parameters and height,
      weight, calculation of BMI in kg/ (height in meters)2, albumin and C-reactive protein will be
      assessed due to the high correlation to IBD-activity (&gt;45 mg/L). Additionally, hematocrit
      (HcT), erythrocyte sedimentation, blood cell counts, vitamin D status (based on the
      association of IBD and Vitamin D deficiency. Subjects will be asked to give a stool sample
      that has to take place within 1 week before any endoscopic procedure is scheduled and
      laxatives are taken by the patients in preparation for the procedure. Fecal calprotectin
      fecal lactoferrin may be collected as standard of clinical care and this information will be
      used for this study.

      Study Treatments:

      A) Standard of clinical care + Fiber treatment (commercially available fiber product,
      equivalent to fiber contained in the mango treatment) B) Standard of clinical care + 200-400g
      of Mango b.i.d - t.i.d.,frozen or as smoothie. Subjects will be asked to record the exact
      amount consumed each day. Subjects who skip less than 1 day of mango consumption per week or
      less than 8 days over the entire period of 8 weeks of mango consumption will not be excluded
      from this study.

      Subjects will be randomized according to the statistician's guidelines into two groups that
      either start with study treatment A) or B). Subjects will consume their regular diet but
      reduce the intake of plant-based dietary supplements which contain secondary plant compounds
      such as resveratrol, quercetin, tannins, and also reduce their carbohydrate-derived energy by
      the same amount which is supplied through their mango consumption. Patients that are not
      receiving the mango will consume their regular diet, which will be controlled for basic
      nutrients contained in the mango treatment. The mango treatment will start either on this
      first study day, or as soon as subjects can be classified within the inclusion criteria.
      Subjects that underwent an endoscopy before the beginning of this study need to wait at least
      one week before the study treatment can be started. The study duration is 20 weeks,
      consisting of 8 weeks of treatment, 4 weeks of wash-out and another 8 weeks of the other
      treatment in a randomized crossover design.
