    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of sequential
      administration of Prevnar 13™ and Pneumovax™ 23 in healthy participants 50 years of age and
      older. The primary hypotheses in the study are that 1) geometric mean titers (GMTs) to
      pneumococcal serotypes 22F and 33F (serotypes in Pneumovax™ 23 but not in Prevnar 13™) as
      measured at Week 12 are superior in participants administered Prevnar 13™ on Day 1 and
      Pneumovax™ 23 at Week 8, as compared with participants administered Prevnar 13™ on Day 1 and
      placebo at Week 8 and 2) GMTs to pneumococcal serotypes shared by the two vaccines as
      measured at Week 12 are non-inferior in participants administered Prevnar 13™ followed by
      Pneumovax™ 23 as compared with participants administered Prevnar 13™ followed by placebo.
