    <textblock>
      In our era of personalized treatment, both the prognosis and the choice of therapy for upper
      GI malignancies depend on the staging before any treatment. Most experts recommend EUS
      (Endoscopic Ultrasound) as the first line for T-staging but the diagnostic accuracy in
      clinical practice varies in different centers according to the published data. Neither the
      discrepancy between EUS and histological findings nor the variation between centers well
      explained. So the investigators designed this prospective study. In the present study, the
      investigators performed EUS on the resected specimen after surgery before fixation in
      formalin, evaluated the invasion of the GI wall, and marked the deepest location with
      sutures. And try to determine the exact accuracy of EUS staging , find the discrepancy
      between EUS and histologic findings.

      - EUS Examination After the surgery, the specimen is filled with 0.9%NS (normal saline )
      without cut open，and put into a container filled with 0.9%NS before fixation in formalin. EUS
      will be performed on the resected specimen.The endoscopy move from the distal to proximal
      side along the longitudinal axis of stomach, evaluate the invasion of gastric wall, and mark
      the deepest point with sutures under the EUS guided. The images were stored .

      EUS images the are reviewed by two endoscopists. They are asked to stage the tumor according
      to the AJCC(American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system (7th edition) , assign a level
      of confidence to the staging, and score the quality of the EUS image .

        -  Histologic Preparations and Examination Carcinoma invasion into each layer of the
           gastric wall is diagnosed by an experienced pathologist (L.ZW) who is unaware of the
           findings of the EUS imaging. The marked section will be assessed separately.

        -  Data analysis The diagnosis between the pathologic findings and EUS prediction will be
           compared. Whether the marked point was the deepest in pathologic findings is recorded.
           And the histological section and the EUS image of the marked point is compared.
