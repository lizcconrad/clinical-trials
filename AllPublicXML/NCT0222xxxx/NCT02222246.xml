  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to improve emergency department (ED) pain management for
      adults with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic
      disorder in the United States, and occurs primarily among African Americans. Management of
      painful episodes associated with SCD, referred to as vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), is the most
      common reason for SCD patients to visit the ED. Currently, there is no standard approach to
      managing VOC pain in the ED that is widely accepted and used, and pain management for
      vaso-occlusive crisis in persons with SCD is very different between providers and not based
      on research. Many times, patients who come to the ED with sickle cell pain feel that they do
      not receive adequate pain control. If EDs could provide efficient, effective, safe,
      patient-centered analgesic management, it may be possible to improve pain management for
      adults with SCD experiencing a VOC. Guidelines for treating vaso-occlusive crises caused by
      sickle cell disease will soon be published by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of
      the National Institutes of Health. These guidelines recommend patient-specific pain treatment
      protocols or a standardized pain management protocol for SCD when a patient does not already
      have a pain treatment protocol designed for them. The purpose of this pilot study is to
      compare these two ways to treat vaso-occlusive pain in the ED for adults with sickle cell
      disease, and to determine if a large randomized controlled trial is feasible and required.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In August 2012 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI) released for public
      comment their &quot;Management of Sickle Cell Disease&quot; evidence-based recommendations that were
      developed with consensus panel expertise. Because of a lack of empirical data, most of the
      recommendations specific to vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) were based on consensus panel
      expertise. Recommendations included the use of a patient-specific protocol (specific agents
      and doses for an individual patient). While many attempts have been made to implement
      patient-specific analgesic protocols for use in emergency departments (EDs), anecdotally,
      these have been difficult to implement and maintain over time; a practical approach to
      development, implementation, and dissemination has not been determined. As patient-specific
      protocols are not available in most EDs, the guidelines go on to recommend a SCD specific
      standard analgesic protocol. Both of these recommended protocols provide more aggressive VOC
      pain management than a typical generic ED pain protocol. However, there is an urgent need to
      rigorously test the NHLBI recommendations and compare the two approaches for managing VOC in
      the ED. A large randomized clinical trial (RCT) is essential to test these protocols.

      This pilot project will compare these two different, evidence-based, protocols which include
      opioid pain medicines routinely used as standard of care to treat VOC pain in the ED for
      individuals with SCD, and collect the data necessary to determine if a large RCT is feasible
      and required. This study is novel in that it will design an approach to develop and implement
      patient-specific and standard analgesic VOC protocols for use in the ED, will develop a
      bundle of information technology and education interventions to enhance protocol adoption for
      the pilot RCT, and also be the first RCT conducted in an ED setting to compare two different
      ED pain management protocols for SCD patients who experience a VOC.

      The study consists of 3 aims:

        1. Develop and implement patient specific VOC protocols for patients randomized to this
           arm,

        2. Conduct a pilot RCT to determine the necessary sample size needed for a large RCT to
           compare the difference in reduction in pain score from ED arrival to discharge,
           hospitalization, clinical and safety outcomes, between subjects assigned randomly to
           either a standard SCD analgesic protocol or to a patient-specific analgesic protocol,

        3. Measure feasibility of methods and acceptability of and fidelity to protocols by
           evaluating optimal recruitment and retention strategies, and assessing ED providers
           perceptions of facilitators and barriers to protocol use and protocol adherence.

      The soon to be published NHBLI guidelines for managing SCD will be used as the standard
      protocol with the modification of basing the initial dose of pain medicine on patient weight.
      The standard protocol will recommend re-assessment, and re-dosing with possible dose
      escalation, every 20-30 minutes. Repeat doses for patients randomized to the weight-based
      protocol, when necessary, will be maintained or provided at 1 dose level increase (no more
      than 25%) above the initial dose. For patients randomized to the patient -specific protocol,
      the SCD provider has experience with the individual patient and is best qualified to make
      dosing and frequency recommendations based upon doses required during past ED and hospital
      visits for treatment of VOC, and on daily opioid use if applicable. There is no set maximum
      dose for patients randomized to the patient-specific protocols.

      Both the patient-specific and standard protocols will be available in the ED via a patient's
      electronic medical record. Upon ED arrival, providers will retrieve the patient's study
      protocol (patient-specific, or standard) which will include the starting agents, and doses,
      the subsequent analgesic recommendations, and order medications according to the
      pre-determined protocol.

      The study will be conducted at the emergency departments of the University of Cincinnati
      Medical Center and the Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. Patients will be enrolled in the study
      for up to 12-months, but may contribute no more that five different ED visits for VOC pain
      control during enrollment to allow for a larger number of different patients.

      Study outcomes will be compared between ED visits of patients randomized to a
      patient-specific vs. a standard SCD protocol. The primary outcome will be the difference in
      pain score from ED arrival to discharge, up to 6 hours, as measured using a visual analogue
      scale. The trajectories of average pain scores from immediately prior to administration of
      1st analgesic dose to discharge by 30 minute increments for each treatment group will also be
      calculated.

    <description>Each ED study visit was the unit of analysis for the statistical methods addressing the primary outcome. The primary outcome was change in pain score from arrival to discharge. Pain severity was assessed at arrival and discharge from ED using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS range is 0 to 100 with 0 indicating &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 indicating &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;.Discharge was defined by which one of the following occurred first: (a) decision to admit to hospital; (b) patient physically leaves the ED to home; or (c) after six hours of observation in the ED. Thus, the difference in pain scores were calculated as the arrival minus discharge VAS scores, with higher positive pain difference or change scores indicating greater pain reduction.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Scores Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 30 minutes from arrival in ED to discharge from the ED, up to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity was assessed at arrival and every 30 minutes until discharge from the ED using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS range is 0 to 100 with 0 indicating &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 indicating &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. Discharge was defined by which one of the following occurred first: (a) decision to admit to hospital; (b) patient physically leaves the ED to home; or (c) after six hours of observation in the ED.
A hierarchical random coefficients regression model for repeated measurements (type of mixed hierarchical mixed-effect model) was conducted on the pain scores collected at six time points (arrival, post-placement 30-min, 60-min, 90-min,120-min, discharge) to evaluate the trajectory of change in pain. Discharge occurred at 120 minutes or later during each visit, with the exception of one discharge at 54 minutes.</description>

        <title>Difference in Pain Score as Measured by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>Each ED study visit was the unit of analysis for the statistical methods addressing the primary outcome. The primary outcome was change in pain score from arrival to discharge. Pain severity was assessed at arrival and discharge from ED using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS range is 0 to 100 with 0 indicating “no pain” and 100 indicating “pain as bad as it could be” or “worst imaginable pain”.Discharge was defined by which one of the following occurred first: (a) decision to admit to hospital; (b) patient physically leaves the ED to home; or (c) after six hours of observation in the ED. Thus, the difference in pain scores were calculated as the arrival minus discharge VAS scores, with higher positive pain difference or change scores indicating greater pain reduction.</description>

        <description>Severe-to moderate sedation at any point from placement until discharge, based on sedation data collected every 30 minutes during that time period. Thus, a sedation variable was derived in which 0=no and 1=yes that moderate-severe sedation was reported by the patient at least once during the placement to discharge time interval. Sedations scoring was as follows: None was defined as &quot;awake and alert&quot;, Mild sedation was defined as &quot;responds to voice&quot;, Moderate sedation was defined as &quot;responds to touch, with or without voice&quot; and Severe sedation was defined as &quot;somnolent, difficult to arouse&quot;.</description>

          <title>Patient Specific Dose of Morphine Sulfate or Hydromorphone</title>
          <description>A patient-specific analgesic protocol for use in the ED to manage VOC crises. Following randomization, a patient's healthcare team will develop a specific analgesic protocol for use during future ED visits for VOC occurring during the study period (up to 6 visits). Treatment protocols will include either morphine sulfate or hydromorphone (delivered intravenous or sub-cutaneous). Dosage and frequency will be based on a patient's prior treatment history.
Hydromorphone (Patient Specific dosing): Patient specific analgesic management, with specific opioid dosage and frequency based on a protocol developed by a patient's healthcare team.
Morphine Sulfate (Patient Specific dosing): Patient specific analgesic management, with specific opioid dosage and frequency based on a protocol developed by a patient's healthcare team.</description>

          <title>Standard Dose of Morphine Sulfate or Hydromorphone</title>
          <description>A standardized analgesic protocol (based on recent NHLBI recommendations) for use in the ED to manage VOC crises. Treatment protocol will include either morphine sulfate or hydromorphone (delivered intravenous or sub-cutaneous), with dosage based on weight. Repeat doses of opioids may be administered every 20-30 minutes as needed, although dosage will be maintained or provided at no more than 25% above the initial dose.
Hydromorphone (Standardized, weight-based dosing): Standardized analgesic management using a SCD specific standard protocol based on NHBLI guidelines (initial opioid dose weight-based).
Morphine Sulfate (Standardized, weight-based dosing): Standardized analgesic management using a SCD specific standard protocol based on NHBLI guidelines (initial opioid dose weight-based).</description>
