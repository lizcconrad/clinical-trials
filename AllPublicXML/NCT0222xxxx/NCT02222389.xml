  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contingency management (CM) is a type of treatment used in the substance abuse field.
      Patients' behaviors are rewarded for adherence to a treatment plan. As an approach to
      treatment, contingency management emerged from the behavior therapy traditions in mental
      health. By most evaluations, contingency management procedures produce one of the largest
      effect sizes out of all mental health and educational interventions.

      The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the
      ability of a culturally-tailored contingency management (CM) intervention to increase alcohol
      and drug abstinence among American Indian (AI) tribal members from two rural reservations in
      the Northwest.

    <measure>Self- reported data on alcohol and drug use</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measures used for self-reported data on alcohol and drug use:
The Alcohol and Drug Timeline Follow Back (TLFB)
The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM)
The Addiction Severity Index, Native American Version (ASI-NAV)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Other substance use</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana, will be measured by the same procedures described for urine tests of alcohol and drug metabolites.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self- reported data on health behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will also collect secondary outcome data on health behaviors that frequently correlate with alcohol and drug misuse with the following measures:
The Timeline Follow Back will be used to assess daily number of cigarettes smoked.
Brief HIV Risk Behavior Scale
Veteran's Rand- 12
Self-Report Services Utilization Assessment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Measures used for descriptive purposes and to assess success of randomization.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure psychopathology with the Brief Symptom Inventory, a self-report instrument that will assess levels of anxiety, depression, impulsiveness, at baseline to characterize the psychiatric severity of the sample that has been used in previous studies of American Indians.</description>

    <measure>Measures used for descriptive purposes and to assess success of randomization.</measure>

    <measure>Measures used for descriptive purposes and to assess success of randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In addition, other demographic, cultural, and cigarette smoking and alcohol use measures will be administered at baseline. These measures are part of the P20 Center Core measures. These measures include the Veteran's Rand-12 (already gathered as part of this study's protocol), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Alcohol Survey, and demographic, cultural, and smoking behaviors (Behavioral Health Cooperative, Core Measures).</description>
