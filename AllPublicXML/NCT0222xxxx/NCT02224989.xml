    <textblock>
      This pilot project evaluates the efficacy of a mind-body awareness training intervention,
      Mind-Body Bridging (MBB), in veteran patients with PTSD and comorbid symptoms. Evidence for
      relative therapeutic benefit will be indicated by the difference in outcomes from pre- to
      post-intervention for PTSD as the primary outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a difficult illness to treat and there is a lack of interventions that effectively
      reduce it. In recent years, attention has focused on treating PTSD patients by including a
      sleep-focused intervention since those with PTSD, such as military personnel, almost always
      report some form of sleep disturbance (Neylan et al. 1998; Lewis et al. 2009). In fact, since
      sleep disturbance is so prevalent in PTSD, it is considered a hallmark of PTSD diagnosis
      (Ross et al. 1989). Two classical PTSD symptoms, hyperarousal and re-experiencing the
      traumatic event, comprise sleep difficulty and nightmares, respectively (Lamarche and De
      Koninck 2007). Preliminary evidence suggests that interventions targeting sleep may be
      beneficial in the treatment of PTSD (Germain et al. 2007; Swanson et al. 2009; Nakamura et
      al. 2011).

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of mind-body bridging (MBB) as a primary group
      psychotherapy treatment for reduction of PTSD symptoms among veterans. MBB is an awareness
      training program,(Block and Block 2007) which has been recently developed into a workbook
      specifically for PTSD (Block and Block 2010). MBB has been used successfully at the George E.
      Wahlen Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) for more than 5 years as an adjunctive
      treatment. MBB is well accepted by veterans and anecdotally has been reported to improve mood
      as well as PTSD and other anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, published pilot studies have
      provided preliminary evidence of its benefits.(Tollefson et al. 2009; Nakamura et al. 2011).
      In particular, Nakamura et al.(2011) tested a brief sleep-focused MBB intervention program in
      a randomized controlled trial, which demonstrated improved sleep and decreased PTSD symptoms.
      Our clinical experience and these preliminary studies indicate that a pilot feasibility study
      of MBB as a specific treatment for PTSD is warranted.

      The proposed, non-randomized single-group study of MBB will serve as a pilot feasibility
      study investigating a 10-week MBB program offered to veterans who are clinically diagnosed to
      suffer from PTSD. In this pilot study, we determine whether MBB is a beneficial intervention
      program for PTSD and co-morbidities, including insomnia, depression, etc., based on
      self-report measures and clinical evaluations.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the self-report measure of PTSD using the PTSD Checklist for Military (PCLM), from baseline to 3 month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks (mid-treatment), 10 weeks (post-treatment), 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-M is a well-validated 17-item self-report measure to assess PTSD severity among military personnel; both male and female, to assess military-related PTSD. Reliability evidence is very good. Items are based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) criteria, and are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale that allows the derivation of a quantifiable total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective measure of sleep using the Medical Outcomes Study - Sleep Scale (MOS-SS), from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks (mid-treatment), 10 weeks (post-treatment), 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS-SS is a 12-item validated questionnaire evaluating sleep outcomes over the past 7 days. The MOS-SS provides an index of sleep problems, including sleep disturbance, sleep adequacy, daytime somnolence, snoring, waking up short of breath with a headache, and quantity of sleep. The MOS-SS was validated as a retrospective assessment of sleep performance over the previous 4 weeks, and compares favorably with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We have used a modified version of MOS-SS to assess the subject's sleep patterns over the previous 7 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective measure of resilience using the Response to Stressful Experience Scale (RSES), from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks (mid-treatment), 10 weeks (post-treatment), 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The RSES is a multidimensional measure of resilience validated in a large sample of active-duty and reserve military personnel. This 22-item scale demonstrates good internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed reasonable fit for a model of resilience comprising six-dimensions: (1) Cognitive Flexibility, (2) Spirituality, (3) Active Coping, (4) Self-efficacy, (5) Making-meaning, and (6) Restoration. The major strength of this scale is that it is indexed to a specific traumatic or extremely stressful event, such as combat and operational stress in military personnel. .</description>

    <measure>Change in subjective measure of Health Related Quality of Life using the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 for Veterans (VR-36), from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks (mid-treatment), 10 weeks (post-treatment), 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) for Veterans (VR-36). The VR-36 is a modification of the original SF-36, adapted for Veterans. It consists of the same eight sections as the SF-36. The instrument provides a global score, as well as the following subscale scores: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general health condition, vitality, social aspects and emotional aspects, and mental health.</description>

    <measure>Change in subjective measure of depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks (mid-treatment), 10 weeks (post-treatment), 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D is one of the most common validated screening tests for helping an individual to determine his or her depression quotient. The 20-item test measures depressive feelings and behaviors during the past week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective measure of mindfulness using the Five-facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks (mid-treatment), 10 weeks (post-treatment), 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The FFMQ includes 39 items and assesses five distinct, interpretable facets of mindfulness, including: 1) observing, 2) describing, 3) acting with awareness, 4) non-judging of inner experience, and 5) non-reactivity to inner experience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective measure of well-being using the Well-Being Index (WBI), from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks (mid-treatment), 10 weeks (post-treatment), 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The WBI is a five item scale evaluating both positive and negative aspects of emotional functioning, developed and validated by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre in Mental Health.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion of subjects will be based on: pre-screening score of 50 or greater on the
             PTSD Checklist for Military (PCL-M). Since we are also interested in the effects of
             MBB on co-morbid illnesses besides PTSD, we will include subjects who present with
             other behavioral health conditions, including sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety,
             pain, and any general medical conditions, except as defined as exclusion criteria.
             Subjects using anti-anxiety, anti-depressants, sleep and pain medications, and other
             medications for any condition that is not under exclusion criteria will be admitted to
             the study. Participants must be willing to commit to the 10-week course and complete
             all outcome measures, be literate in English and able to provide informed consent.

        Participants will be asked to refrain from engaging in other PTSD treatment programs for
        the duration of the proposed study, but can remain on their medications and continue with
        their usual medical or mental health care. They will also be allowed to continue with other
        activities (such as physical exercise, meditation, yoga, etc.), which they may have already
        incorporated into their life.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient will be excluded from the study under the following conditions:

               1. currently enrolled in active PTSD treatment program.

               2. identifying with major psychopathology (i.e., schizophrenia, mania, or poorly
                  controlled bipolar disorder, borderline or antisocial personality disorder) and
                  was psychiatrically hospitalized within the past 90 days.

               3. cognitive impairment or dementia.

               4. severe medical disease such as uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes, or terminal
                  illness, e.g., cancer.
