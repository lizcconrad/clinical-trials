    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if a smartphone-delivered intervention combined
      with nicotine replacement therapy can help you to quit smoking.

      This is an investigational study. The nicotine patch used in this study is FDA approved and
      commercially available.

      Up to 750 participants will be screened, and up to 250 eligible participants will take part
      in the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      First Visit:

      Signing this consent form does not mean that you will be able to take part in this study.

      The following screening tests will be performed to help the study staff decide if you are
      eligible:

        -  You will have a brief interview during your first visit in which you will be asked about
           your smoking and medical history.

        -  Your carbon monoxide (CO -- a gas that is found in higher levels among cigarette
           smokers) level will be measured. For this test, you will be asked to blow air through a
           CO measuring device.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire that will ask questions about your mood. It will take
           about 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire.

        -  You will be asked to provide a urine sample to test for drug abuse. You will not be able
           to take part if you test positive for such drugs.

        -  Your urine sample will also be used to test your cotinine if the result of your CO test
           is below certain levels.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test. To take part in this
           study, you cannot be pregnant.

        -  If the screening tests show that you are not eligible to take part in the study, you
           will not be enrolled. Other options will be discussed with you. You will only receive
           parking or METRO reimbursement.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and
      procedures will also be performed during your first visit:

        -  You will complete questionnaires about your smoking history and behavior. These will
           take about 30-45 minutes to complete.

        -  Urine will be collected to check your cotinine and anabasine levels. Cotinine is a
           chemical that measures the amount of cigarette by-products in your body. Anabasine is a
           chemical that helps the study staff tell if you are using tobacco or nicotine
           replacement therapy (NRT).

        -  You will have an electroencephalography (EEG) lab session. During the lab session, you
           will perform a task that is designed to measure your attention and emotions. This will
           involve looking at groups of pictures of abstract art, words, and screens with different
           colors as well as pictures with smoking images. During the visit, your brain electrical
           activity will be measured with an EEG. To do this, a net-like cap will be placed over
           your scalp. These tasks will take about 60 minutes to complete.

      Smartphone Use:

      You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive attentional bias modification (ABM) training
           through a smartphone. This type of training is designed to help you quit smoking.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive &quot;sham&quot; training. This program looks like ABM
           training, but is not actually designed to help you.

      You will not know which type of training you are receiving.

      After the lab session on Day 1, you will be provided with a smartphone to use while you are
      on study. You will be trained on how to use the smartphone and smartphone application that
      will help you prepare to quit smoking. This training will take about 20 minutes to complete.

      On Days 2-14, you will complete a training program while at home through the smartphone and
      application provided. Each of the daily training sessions will take about 30 minutes. After
      the training portion has been completed, you will answer questions about your smoking on a
      daily basis. These questions will take about 10 minutes to complete each day.

      Study Visits:

      During Visit 2 (Day 15):

        -  Your CO level will be measured.

        -  You will complete the questionnaires about your smoking history and smoking behavior.

        -  A urine sample will be collected to check your cotinine and anabasine levels.

        -  You will have another EEG lab session.

        -  You will be given the first half of an 8-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy or
           &quot;the patch&quot; and you will track your patch use in your smoking diary.

        -  You will meet with a counselor for counseling on quitting smoking. This counseling
           session will last about 30 minutes.

        -  You will return the smartphone.

      Your smoking &quot;quit date&quot; will be scheduled for the day after your visit 2, although you are
      free to reduce or quit smoking before this visit if you choose to do so.

      Your study counselor will contact you every two weeks (Days 29, 43, and 57) for 3 telephone
      counseling sessions that will last about 15 minutes each.

      During Visit 3 (Day 72):

        -  Your CO level will be measured.

        -  You will complete the questionnaires about your smoking history and smoking behavior.

        -  A urine sample will be collected to check your cotinine and anabasine levels

        -  You will have another EEG lab session.

        -  You will return unused nicotine patches to the study staff

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for about 10 weeks. Your participation in the study will be over after
      Visit 3.
