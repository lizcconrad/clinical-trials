  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic (PE) impact of
      crizotinib and its companion diagnostic test used in a real-life setting in advanced
      ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

      NSCLC represent 80% of all new cases of lung cancer. One molecular subtype of NSCLC is the
      ALK-positive subtype. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor
      tyrosine kinase. Activation of ALK occurs through the formation of gene fusions and in NSCLC,
      the gene fusion partner for ALK is primarily EML4. The resulting fusion protein is capable of
      activating the ALK kinase domain, leading to cell growth. The estimated prevalence for ALK
      rearrangements in NSCLC is 3-5%, and is more commonly found amongst patients with
      adenocarcinoma histology, in never smokers and in those who are known to be wild type for
      EGFR and KRAS.

      Crizotinib is a potent inhibitor of ALK and is approved for the treatment of advanced ALK+
      NSCLC patients. This is an example of personalized medicine, where patients are selected for
      treatment based upon a molecular assay, and are provided a specific therapy (crizotinib) for
      their disease. The pharmacoeconomic impact of using genetic information in early treatment
      decisions in NSCLC has not been determined.

      The study will enable real-life Heath Economics and Outcome Research (HEOR).

      Approximately 90 patients will be recruited. Patients will be asked to complete
      quality-of-life questionnaires at regular intervals in a real-life setting of treatment with
      crizotinib.
