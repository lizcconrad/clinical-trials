  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first in human phase 1 study of TVB-2640 is being conducted in patients with advanced
      stage solid malignant tumors. This research is being done to find out how safe and useful
      TVB-2640 is for patients who have received previous cancer therapy, and for whom no therapy
      exists that would be curative or might provide significant benefit. TVB-2640 belongs to a
      class of drugs called fatty acid synthase inhibitors (FASN inhibitors). This means that they
      interfere with the body's (and the tumor's) ability to use a substance called fatty acid
      synthase (FASN). Research has shown that some tumors appear to need FASN to keep growing.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria Include:

          -  Patient has histologically- or cytologically- confirmed metastatic or advanced-stage
             solid malignant tumor that is refractory to standard therapy and for whom no therapy
             exists that would be curative or might provide significant benefit and therefore for
             whom experimental therapy is a reasonable option.

          -  Patient experienced progressive disease during or following or was intolerant of their
             most recent treatment regimen.

          -  Patient is male or female aged ≥18 years.

          -  Patient has an ECOG performance status of 0 (fully active, able to carry out all
             pre-disease activities without restriction) or 1 (unable to perform physically
             strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary
             nature), as assessed on C1D1, before the first dose of TVB 2640.

          -  Patient has adequate renal function (creatinine ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal
             [ULN]) or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ≥50 mL/min.

          -  Patient has adequate hepatic function,

          -  Patient has adequate bone marrow function

          -  Patient has no significant ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction (MI) within
             6 months before the first dose of TVB 2640 and currently has adequate cardiac function

        For the Monotherapy Expansion Cohorts of the Study ONLY:

          -  Patient has a specific tumor-type and histology, as designated by the Sponsor based on
             nonclinical and clinical data obtained prior to enrollment in the Expansion Cohort.

          -  Patient has measurable disease, as determined by the Investigator using RECIST,
             version 1.1 (1).

        For the Combination Cohorts ONLY:

          -  In addition to meeting monotherapy criteria above, the commercially-available
             anticancer agent of interest being investigated in combination with TVB-2640,
             administered according to the dose regimen in the prescribing information, is deemed
             appropriate for the patient's disease and clinical status.

        Exclusion Criteria Include:

          -  Patient is unable to swallow oral medications or has impairment of GI function or GI
             disease that may significantly alter drug absorption

          -  Patient has uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical condition (including
             uncontrolled brain metastases).

          -  Patient underwent major surgery within 4 weeks before the first dose of TVB 2640 or
             received cancer-directed therapy or an investigational drug or device within 4 weeks
             (6 weeks for mitomycin C and nitrosoureas) or 5 half-lives of that agent (whichever is
             shorter) before the first dose of TVB 2640.

          -  If female, patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Patient has evidence of a serious active infection

          -  Patient has a history of other malignancy treated with curative intent within the
             previous 5 years with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.
