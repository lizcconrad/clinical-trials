  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Technological advances have made computer aided orthodontic treatment planning possible. 3D
      dental scanners and software make it possible to design and approve the outcome before
      treatment begins. Manufacturers have provided different customized appliance systems that
      would help practitioners achieve those computer-designed outcomes. The purpose of this study
      is to determine the accuracy of computer-guided indirect bonding of orthodontic brackets at
      achieving the predicted alignment and comparing that to the accuracy of conventional
      orthodontic bracket placement at achieving a predetermined goal. The results of this study
      will help orthodontists and patients know if there is an advantage to using custom
      appliances. The study will be a prospective clinical study and will include a total of 60
      arches from 30 patients enrolled at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. 15 patients will
      be assigned to each of the two study groups (Motion View or control). Both groups will have a
      3D intra-oral scan to measure the initial discrepancy and determine the computer-simulated
      design that the orthodontist believes is the optimized outcome. At the end of each patient's
      participation, a 3D intraoral scan will be taken and used to assess intra-arch leveling and
      alignment using ABO's objective grading system's criteria for alignment, marginal ridges and
      buccolingual inclination. Each arch will then be superimposed on the predicted outcome to
      determine how accurate each system was at achieving the planned movements in all 3
      dimensions. We hypothesize that the accuracy of computer-guided indirect bonding (Motion
      View) at achieving the predicted outcomes will differ in comparison to the accuracy of
      conventional orthodontic bracket placement at achieving a predetermined goal.
