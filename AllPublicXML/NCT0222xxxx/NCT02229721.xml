    <description>Over 8 weeks, intranasal oxytocin (32 IE) or placebo will be self-administered by women prior to sexual intercourse. Following a washout period of 2 weeks, a cross-over will take place and patients switched to the alternate group for another 8 weeks.
The recommended dose is four puffs per nostril, containing 32 IU of synthetic oxytocin, administered up to 50 minutes prior to sexual activity. The maximal dose should not exceed four puffs per nostril per day; the minimum dose was twice weekly.</description>
