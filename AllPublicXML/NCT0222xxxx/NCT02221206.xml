  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intended study is designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing
      and contrasting the effect of mini-screw implant anchorage-assisted versus regular maximum
      anchorage by retracting the maxillary incisors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the clinical study proposal will be to investigate the performance of early
      root resorption in order to find out if the magnitude and direction of retraction is
      appropriate for the retraction of maxillary incisors following the mini-screw anchorage.

      Therefore, the study will compare and contrast the efficacy and results of the volumetric
      measurement by CBCT.

      Patients

      Males or females whose diagnoses require implant anchorage treatment will be included in the
      study. Inclusion criteria for the study are as followings:

      Orthodontic indication for skeletal anchorage Adequate bone quantity for a palatal implant in
      the CBCT Good oral hygiene and normal wound healing capacity
