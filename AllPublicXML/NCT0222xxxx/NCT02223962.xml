  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe exacerbations are prevalent in a subgroup of patients with COPD and generally warrant
      a hospitalization. During the hospitalization, patients are extremely physically inactive
      with only a limited recovery one month after discharge. Physical inactivity is associated
      with negative health benefits. Therefore intervening in the period after and exacerbation
      seems useful to improve the levels of physical activity. Physical activity counseling and
      real-time feedback have already been applied in stable patients with COPD, with beneficial
      effects.The present study will investigate whether this specific intervention will help to
      improve the activity level in patients after an acute exacerbation. Further we investigated
      the effects of the intervention on improvements in functional exercise capacity.

      After signing the informed consent, the patients will be randomized into a control group,
      receiving usual care, or the intervention group receiving real-time feedback and physical
      activity counseling.

      Intervention: Physical activity counseling will be provided by 3 weekly telephone contacts
      based on the step count from the Fitbit Ultra. In agreement with the patient and based on the
      step counts a patients provided, a new goal for the next week was set. The goal was to strive
      for the highest possible level of physical activity during one month.

    <description>The Dynaport MoveMonitor, a valid device in patients with COPD, was used to accurately measure the level of physical activity. The device was provided 3 times to the patients (baseline, after 2 weeks, after 1 month). The amount of steps, measured by this device, was used as the outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in functional exercise capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Functional exercise capacity was measured by the six minutes walking distance test (6MWD; meter). This measurement was performed at baseline and after 1 month.</description>

    <description>The fitbit Ultra was used to provide real-time feedback on physical activity. An experienced physiotherapist contacted the subjects 3 times a week to receive information about the amount of steps from the previous days. In agreement with the patient, a new goal for the coming weeks was set and patients were motivated to achieve their individual goal.</description>

    <description>Counseling about physical activity will only be provided in the intervention group by 3 weekly telephone contacts.
