      The purpose of this study is to compare the vaginal health between premenopausal and
      postmenopausal women before and after using oral &quot;estradiol&quot; for 14 days then &quot;estradiol&quot; and
      &quot;progesterone&quot; for 14 days.

      This research project recruits 10 healthy, premenopausal women (aged 20-40 years-old) with
      regular menstrual cycle with interval of 24-35 days and duration of 2-7 days and 20 healthy
      postmenopausal women (aged 45-60 years-old) with an intact uterus and at least 12 months but
      not more than 36 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.

      Premenopausal women will not receive any study medication(s). Postmenopausal women will be
      &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups described below.

        -  Oral &quot;estradiol&quot; 0.5 mg tablet for 14 days, then oral &quot;estradiol&quot; 0.5 mg tablet and
           &quot;progesterone&quot; 100 mg capsule for 14 days

        -  Oral &quot;estradiol&quot; 1.0 mg tablet for 14 days, then oral &quot;estradiol&quot; 1.0 mg tablet and
           &quot;progesterone&quot; 100 mg capsule for 14 days
