  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CD40, a member of the Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor superfamily, is expressed on many tumor
      types, including melanoma, prostate, colon, breast, renal, pancreatic, and nonsmall cell lung
      cancers. In preclinical models, activation of CD40 results in increased antigen presentation
      and induction of apoptosis. CD40 is also expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) (B
      cells, dendritic cells, monocytes) and is a key regulator of both cellular and humoral immune
      responses. Activation of CD40 by CP-870,893, an agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody,
      enhances host immune responses and abrogates the growth of tumors independently of the
      expression of CD40 on tumor cells. Therefore, it is hypothesized that therapeutic
      intervention with CP-870,893 may be beneficial to a large number of cancer patients either
      through an immunomodulatory effect or through a direct effect on CD40-positive tumor cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women at least 18 years old with advanced solid tumors relapsed or refractory
             to standard therapy or for whom no effective therapy exists;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1;

          -  Adequate bone marrow function documented within 2 weeks prior to treatment, defined
             as:

          -  White blood cell (WBC) count &gt;3000 cells/μL without growth factor support;

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL without growth factor support;

          -  Platelets &gt;100,000/μL without growth factor support; and

          -  Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL;

          -  D-dimer WNL;

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function documented within 2 weeks prior to treatment,
             defined as:

          -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN);

          -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2.5 × ULN;

          -  Creatinine clearance (CLcr, measured or calculated) &gt;80 mL/min; and

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks;

          -  Fully recovered from the acute effects of prior cancer therapy: 4 weeks for
             chemotherapy (8 weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosoureas), 10 days for prior palliative
             radiation therapy or hormonal therapy, and 4 weeks for prior immunotherapy or other
             biologic therapy; and

          -  Signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously treated with any other agent that targets CD40;

          -  Concurrent treatment with any anticancer agent;

          -  History of autoimmune disorder, including pemphigus vulgaris, systemic mastocytosis,
             systemic lupus erythamatosus, dermatomyositis/polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis,
