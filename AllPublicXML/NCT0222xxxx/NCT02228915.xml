  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to discover and quantitate the differences in
      post-translational modifications found in the Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) of patients
      with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as compared to healthy individuals. SOD1 is a known
      genetic cause of ALS. With certain mutations, SOD1 gains a toxic function which leads to
      motor neuron death.

    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease in which
      mutations in human Cu, Zn Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) have been identified as a cause of
      familial ALS (FALS) cases.1-2 It has been shown that mutant SOD1 develops a novel toxic
      function through experiments demonstrating that many disease mutants maintain enzymatic
      activity, SOD1-null mice do not exhibit ALS symptoms, and co-expressed wild type protein does
      not rescue the disease-state.7-11 The majority of cases, however, are not caused directly by
      mutations of SOD1, instead being caused by a poorly understood interplay of several genes as
      well as environmental factors, which is often referred to as sporadic ALS (SALS).3 It has
      been found that FALS and SALS share similar pathology. 4-6 The hSOD1 protein aggregates
      characteristic of FALS have also been found in SALS patients, furthering the evidence that
      hSOD1 has an important role in the etiology of ALS in sporadic ALS patients.16-19 The exact
      mechanism of SOD1-associated toxicity has not yet been elucidated though many disease mutants
      have been shown to destabilize the SOD1 dimer. In this study we aim to compare the levels of
      SOD1 post-tra slational modifications in ALS patients to levels in healthy donors and to
      determine if there are distinct patterns of protein glutathionylation or phosphorylation. Our
      overall goal is to elucidate a direct mechanism of toxicity in SALS as well as identify
      potentially critical triggers

      A portion of this sample will be stored for future use in study of ALS and how the critical
      protien affects the disease progression long term. This sample will be stored de-identified;
      therefore will not be linked to any identifying informaton about the subject. Sample will be
      stored at the UNC biophysics and Biochemistry lab indefinitely
