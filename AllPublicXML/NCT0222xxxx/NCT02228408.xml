  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study designed to compare the safety and cardiovascular effects of 26
      weeks of combination hydralazine/isorsorbide dinitrate therapy with placebo therapy in
      patients receiving chronic hemodialysis.

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment of chronic hemodialysis (ESRD) patients with a
      combination of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate compared with placebo is safe and that it
      will improve heart function as well blood flow/blood vessel supply.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis will be randomized to 26 weeks of therapy
      with combination hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate or placebo. Study medications will be
      titrated to goal dose during the first 4 weeks and maintained at goal dose (as tolerated)
      between weeks 4-26. A final study visit to assess symptoms after drug discontinuation will
      occur 4 weeks after drug discontinuation.

      Study duration-Maximum of 32 weeks with 26 weeks of active therapy.

      Efficacy Measures -Tissue Doppler echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scanning using
      radioactive NH3 PET will be assessed at weeks 0 and 26.

      Safety Measures-Adverse events rates including inter- and intra-dialytic hypotension,
      ,cardiovascular death and gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed throughout the duration
      of the study.
