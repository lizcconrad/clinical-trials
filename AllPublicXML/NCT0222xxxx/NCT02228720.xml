      This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open label feasibility study aiming to
      enroll at least 10 patients and a maximum of 15 patients to achieve 30 treated sinuses. The
      objective of this feasibility study is to assess the performance, safety and initial signals
      of efficacy of the drug-eluting Propel Nova Sinus Implant when used in chronic sinusitis (CS)
      patients undergoing sinus surgery of peripheral sinus ostia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Patient has CS as confirmed by CT scan and defined as symptoms lasting longer than 8
             consecutive weeks in duration with inflammation of the mucosa of the nose and
             paranasal sinuses.

          -  Patient's condition and the planned intervention will involve at least two and a
             maximum of four peripheral sinuses (frontal or maxillary sinuses or combination of
             both).

          -  Patient is a candidate for a planned intervention involving sinus surgery in the
             operating room or office setting.

          -  Patient has nasal polyps no greater than grade 2.

          -  Patient with nasal polyps greater than 2 are eligible after their reduction/removal
             during ESS without significant complications that would confound the study results and
             leaving the patient's anatomy amenable to sinus implant placement, as judged by the
             operating physician.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant and must agree to not
             become pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use consistent and acceptable
             method/s of birth control during the course of the study.

          -  CS diagnosis confirmed and documented by CT Scan within 6 months of the procedure.

          -  Patient has a minimum total CT stage (Lund-Mackay method) of 6.

          -  Patient has disease in frontal and/or maxillary sinuses confirmed by CT scan.

          -  Planned ESS includes bilateral ethmoidectomy (if judged necessary), frontal sinus
             surgery using Draf II (A or B) dissection and/or balloon dilation, with minimum of
             5-mm diameter opening created. In the case of maxillary sinus surgery, traditional
             antrostomy or balloon dilation, with or without removal of uncinate process, should be
             performed with minimum of 5-mm diameter opening created.

          -  Technique used for frontal or maxillary sinus surgery was the same on both sides (e.g.
             surgical dissection alone bilaterally, balloon dilation alone bilaterally, or both
             bilaterally)

          -  Septoplasty for access to the ostio-meatal complex is permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has presence of grade 3 or 4 polyposis, unless removed during surgery and
             preceding implant placement.

          -  Patient has presence of adhesions/scarring grades 3 or 4, unless removed during
             surgery and preceding implant placement.

          -  Patient has known history of immune deficiency (e.g., IGG subclass deficiency or IGA
             deficiency, HIV).

          -  Patient has concurrent condition requiring active chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy
             management for the disease (e.g., cancer, HIV, etc.).

          -  Patient has oral-steroid dependent condition such as COPD, asthma or other condition.

          -  Patient has known history of allergy or intolerance to corticosteroids or mometasone
             furoate.

          -  Patient has clinical evidence of acute bacterial sinusitis (e.g. acute increase in
             purulent discharge, fever, facial pain etc.).

          -  Patient has clinical evidence or suspicion of invasive fungal sinusitis (e.g. bone
             erosion on prior CT scan, necrotic sinus tissue, etc.).

          -  Patient has evidence of disease or condition expected to compromise survival or
             ability to complete follow-up assessments during the 90-day period.

          -  Patient is currently participating in another clinical trial.

          -  Patient has history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

          -  Patient has previously undergone ESS and experienced a CSF leak or has residual
             compromised vision as a result of a complication in a prior ESS procedure.

          -  Patient has known dehiscence of the lamina papyracea.

          -  Patient has evidence of active viral illness (e.g., tuberculosis, ocular herpes
             simplex, chickenpox or measles).

          -  Significant complication during the current peripheral ostia surgery/such as excessive
             blood loss, CSF leak or punctured lamina papyracea.

          -  Current surgical intervention (operating room or office setting) is aborted for any
             reason.
