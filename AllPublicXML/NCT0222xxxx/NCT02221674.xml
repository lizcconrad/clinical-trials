  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (all people involved know the identity of the
      intervention), single dose trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (how drugs are
      absorbed in the body, how are they distributed within the body and how are they removed from
      the body over time) in children aged from birth to less than 2 years after a surgical
      procedure that routinely produces moderate to severe acute post-surgical pain.

      The trial will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of tapentadol oral solution in the
      population studied and the effect of tapentadol oral solution on pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial has 3 phases: enrollment, treatment (15 hours) and follow up.

      During the enrolment phase consent and eligibility will be determined. After surgery, the
      participant will be given routine pain medication as per standard of care in the hospital.

      Treatment phase: When the participant has a functioning gastrointestinal tract after surgery,
      can tolerate medication administered orally or via a feeding tube, meets the inclusion
      criteria, and does not meet any exclusion criterion, the participant will be allocated to the
      investigational medicinal product (IMP). Evaluations will be performed over the next 15
      hours, including the assessment of the amount of pain. During this time, 2 blood samples will
      be taken for testing of the amount of tapentadol and its main metabolites in the
      participant's blood.

      A final follow-up visit is planned to take place up to 2 weeks after taking the trial
      medication.

        <title>Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Based on Serum Concentrations of Tapentadol After a Single Dose of Tapentadol Oral Solution in Participants Aged 6 Months to Less Than 2 Years</title>
        <description>The pharmacokinetic profile of Tapentadol and its major metabolite tapentadol-O-glucuronide was evaluated to enable data based recommendations for the use of Tapentadol in children of different ages.
Each participant had a single pharmacokinetic sample taken at up to 2 different pre-defined time points.
Serum was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mean and Standard Deviation of Serum Concentrations of Tapentadol were calculated.
Summary statistics at a given time point were only determined if at least 2 participants had observations above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).
If overall only a single sample was available at one of the pre-defined time points, the measured value is presented and the standard deviation is given as N/A.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 8 hours after IMP administration</time_frame>
        <population>The trial used sparse sampling for the assessment of Pharmacokinetic. Overall, there were 6 time points for sampling. Participants were allocated to 2 different time points for a blood sample to be taken. Some participants only had one sample taken. Some samples were below the Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).</population>

          <title>Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Based on Serum Concentrations of Tapentadol After a Single Dose of Tapentadol Oral Solution in Participants Aged 6 Months to Less Than 2 Years</title>
          <description>The pharmacokinetic profile of Tapentadol and its major metabolite tapentadol-O-glucuronide was evaluated to enable data based recommendations for the use of Tapentadol in children of different ages.
Each participant had a single pharmacokinetic sample taken at up to 2 different pre-defined time points.
Serum was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mean and Standard Deviation of Serum Concentrations of Tapentadol were calculated.
Summary statistics at a given time point were only determined if at least 2 participants had observations above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).
If overall only a single sample was available at one of the pre-defined time points, the measured value is presented and the standard deviation is given as N/A.</description>
          <population>The trial used sparse sampling for the assessment of Pharmacokinetic. Overall, there were 6 time points for sampling. Participants were allocated to 2 different time points for a blood sample to be taken. Some participants only had one sample taken. Some samples were below the Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).</population>

        <description>The pharmacokinetic profile of Tapentadol and its major metabolite tapentadol-O-glucuronide was evaluated to enable data based recommendations for the use of Tapentadol in children of different ages.
Each participant had a single pharmacokinetic sample taken at up to 2 different pre-defined time points.
Serum was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mean and Standard Deviation of Serum Concentrations of tapentadol-O-glucuronide were calculated.
Summary statistics at a given time point were only determined if at least 2 participants had observations above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).
If overall only a single sample was available at one of the pre-defined time points, the measured value is presented and the standard deviation is given as N/A.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetic Profile of Serum Concentrations of Tapentadol-O-glucuronide After a Single Dose of Tapentadol Oral Solution in Participants Aged From Birth to Less Than 1 Month</title>
        <description>The pharmacokinetic profile of Tapentadol and its major metabolite tapentadol-O-glucuronide was evaluated to enable data based recommendations for the use of Tapentadol in children of different ages.
Each participant had a single pharmacokinetic sample taken at up to 2 different pre-defined time points.
Serum was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mean and Standard Deviation of Serum Concentrations of tapentadol-O-glucuronide were calculated.
Summary statistics at a given time point were only determined if at least 2 participants had observations above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).
If overall only a single sample was available at one of the pre-defined time points, the measured value is presented and the standard deviation is given as N/A.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 8 hours after IMP</time_frame>
        <population>The trial used sparse sampling for the assessment of Pharmacokinetic. Overall, there were 6 time points for sampling. Participants were allocated to 2 different time points for a blood sample to be taken. Some participants only had one sample taken. Some samples were below the Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Visit 1, After Surgery) in Pain Intensity</title>
        <description>The change from baseline in pain intensity using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Scale (FLACC Scale) at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 15 hours after a single dose of tapentadol.
The FLACC Scale is a behavioral scale for scoring postoperative pain in young children. It includes five categories of pain behaviors, including facial expression, leg movement, activity, cry, and consolability. The scale is scored in a range of 0–10 with 0 representing no pain.
The pain intensity scores were summarized descriptively per scheduled time point.</description>
