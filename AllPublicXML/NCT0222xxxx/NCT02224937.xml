  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percutaneous transportation and pharmacokinetics
      of melatonincream 12,5% when used on 80% of the body area. A test battery consisting of
      blood, saliva, urine samples at 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,24 and 36 hours after cream application.
      Cognitive parameters are investigated using KSS, FTT and CRT tests at above mentioned time
      points.

    <measure>Changes in Karolinska Sleepiness Scale after application of melatonincream 12,5% on 80% of the body-surface area.</measure>
    <time_frame>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,24 and 36 hours post exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Karolinska sleepiness scale is a valid scale for measurement of subjective sleepiness in individuals.
This scale is used to detect any changes in subjective sleepiness over a time period of 36 hours after application of melatonincream 12,5% on 80% of the body-surface area.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in continuous reaction time over a time period of 36 hours after application of melatonin cream 12,5% on 80% of the body surface area.</measure>
    <time_frame>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,24 and 36 hours post exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous reaction time is a neuropsychological test designed to investigate endurance and attention by testing the persons ability to react to external stimuli over a given time period.
This parameter is used to detect changes in endurance and attention over a time period of 36 hours after application of melatonincream 12,5% on 80% of the body-surface area.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in finger tapping test over a time period of 36 hours after application of melatonin cream 12,5% on 80% of the body surface area.</measure>
    <time_frame>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,24 and 36 hours post exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Finger tapping test is a simple way to investigate psychomotoric speed and control. Impaired psychomotoric speed is accepted as a predictor for cerebral dysfunction.
This parameter is used to detect changes in psychomotoric speed and control over a time period of 36 hours after application of melatonincream 12,5% on 80% of the body surface area.</description>

    <measure>Changes in serum melatonin concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,24 and 36 hours post exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples are collected at the above mentioned time points. Serum melatonin is evaluated by laboratory tests.
Blood samples are used to detect the changes in serum melatonin concentration after application of melatonin cream 12,5% on 80% of the body surface area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in saliva melatonin concentration.</measure>
    <time_frame>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,24 and 36 hours post exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva samples are collected at above mentioned time points. The concentration of melatonin in saliva is tested using laboratory analyses.
Saliva samples are collected to detect changes in saliva melatonin concentration over a time period of 36 hours after application of melatonincream 12,5% on 80% of the body surface area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in urine melatonin concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4,4-8,8-12,12-24 and 24-36.</time_frame>
    <description>Urine is collected in the above mentioned time intervals, and the concentration of melatonin is found by measuring the concentration of the metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin using RIA.
The urine samples are collected and used to detect changes in 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentration over a time period of 36 hours after application of melatonincream on 80% of the body surface area.</description>
