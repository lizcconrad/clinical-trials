  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large part of acutely ill patient's access to the health care system starts by calling the
      emergency number 1-1-2 and thereby getting in touch with the emergency medical dispatch
      center (EMDC). In most cases an ambulance is dispatched and the patient is brought to the
      hospital. These patients are not referred by a physician (eg. a GP) and represent an
      unselected subpopulation of the acutely ill patients. At present, all non-critically ill
      patients not evaluated by a pre-hospital physician are normally be transported to hospital as
      category 2 (without activated emergency lightning and sirens).A part of this patient
      population, however, is not critically ill and a proportion of these may not need hospital
      admittance . Emergency medical technicians (EM) are not allowed to treat - and- leave
      patients without a physician's involvement. If the EMT had 24/7 online access to medical
      control i.e. in form of a physician present in the EMDC , the number of patients transported
      to hospital for assessment may be reduced as well as response times for patients actually
      needing ambulance transportation. This could potentially reduce the workload on the whole
      healthcare system involved in the management of these patients - thereby potentially reducing
      costs.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate if a systematic telemedical assessment by an
      EMDC-physician of all patients who receive an ambulance but are not critically ill and would
      have a category 2 transport to hospital can reduce the number of the patients that are
      transported to hospital and save costs and time.

    <description>Cost of 24 hour EMDC physician vs. savings obtained by avoided admissions. Calculations of average transport related costs will be provided by the Prehospital Emergency Medical Services Aarhus and average cost of hospitalization for a patient hospitalized 24 hours or less at the emergency dept. will be provided by the Regional Hospital Horsens. The percentage of treat-and-leave patients in the intervention period will be compared to a historical control group represented by the average percentage of treat-and-leave patients for the previous 12 months (August 2013 to August 2014). The savings obtained by avoided admissions will be calculated by multiplying the difference in the proportion of treat and leave patients with the number of patients the previous 12 months who are receiving an ambulance after dialing 112. The EMDC physician related costs will be calculated from the present table of salary for specialist physicians in Denmark.</description>

    <description>Defined as the average response time for ambulances dispatched by EMDC. The average response time is calculated as the time where the emergency medical dispatcher gets an assignment (registered manually by the dispatcher) to the arrival of the ambulance at scene (registered manually by the EMS technician). This definition of response time is predefined politically and is the gold standard for this measurement across dispatch centers in Denmark.</description>
