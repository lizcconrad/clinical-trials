  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A national, prospective, open-label, non-interventional, multicentre, controlled study
      designed to evaluate a diagnostic method in patients undergoing hip, knee or shoulder
      prosthetic removal regardless of whether or not infection is suspected. Serological test
      results will have no impact on the therapeutic approach.

      Study objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of an antibody detection kit for the
      serological diagnosis of bone and joint prosthetic device infections cause by Staphylococci,
      Streptococci, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and Gram-negative bacteria versus the
      reference method: the bacterial culture of deep intraoperative samples.

    <measure>Sensitivity and specificity of test BJI 2</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnostic performance of the test during unique titration.
Sensitivity: estimated from the proportion of septic group patients with an antibody level above the defined threshold antibody concentration.
Specificity: estimated from the proportion of non-septic-group patients with an antibody level less than or equal to the defined threshold antibody concentration.
Positive likelihood ratio.
Negative likelihood ratio.</description>

    <measure>Interest of test BJI 2</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the diagnostic interest of the BJI Inoplex 2 test in conjunction with the clinical and laboratory data collected: diagnostic strategy and score combining several criteria.
To evaluate the potential medical and economic benefits of using the test: number and cost of joint aspirations or hospital stays that would have been avoided, delayed diagnosis.
To describe the serological outcome after surgery in septic patients.</description>

        The septic patient group will be comprised of patients presenting with bone and joint
        prosthetic device infection confirmed by intraoperative microbiological culture (at least 2
        deep positive samples for the same bacterial strain).

        The non-septic patient group will be comprised of prosthetic patients presenting with
