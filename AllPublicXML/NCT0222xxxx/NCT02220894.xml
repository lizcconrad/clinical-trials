  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be randomized to receive single agent pembrolizumab for up to
      35 treatments or standard of care (SOC) platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel
      or carboplatin + pemetrexed for 4 to 6 21-day cycles). Participants on the platinum-based
      chemotherapy arms with non-squamous tumor histologies may receive pemetrexed maintenance
      therapy after the 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary study hypothesis is that
      pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival (OS) compared to SOC chemotherapy.
