      Design Prospective , randomized, parallel phase IV.

      Objectives Main objective

        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of the placement of a resorbable mesh in the prevention of
           incisional hernia of the abdominal wall at the site of a loop ileostomy when it is
           &quot;closed &quot; to rebuild the intestinal transit. The effectiveness evaluation is done by
           tracking with scheduled patient visits for 12 months, assessing the physical examination
           the presence or absence of an incisional hernia and an abdominal tomography at the end
           of the 12 months .

      Secondary objectives Comparison of complications(morbidity and mortality) to assess safety
      and tolerability of the placement of the mesh described .

      Experimental: Reinforcement with Absorbable Mesh Closure of the ileostomy closure incision is
      reinforced with insertion of a rectangular segment (1 cm wide and the length corresponding to
      the incision) of a prosthetic commercially available GORE® BIO-A® Tissue Reinforcement
      prosthesis (W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) mesh. The BIO-A® prosthesis is
      inserted using a &quot;sandwich&quot; method between the edges of the incision and maintained in situ
      with a continuous polydioxanone (PDS) suture following a suture length to wound length
      (SL:WL) ratio of 4:1.

    <description>Pre-operative :
It was made by barium enema protocol and transanal endoscopy to rule out anastomotic leaks or strictures contraindicating stoma closure .
Surgical technique:
Peristomal incision with electrocautery
Release the handle of ileum
Anastomosis made the with the segment everted sutured by simple manual end to end 3/0 or mechanical side to side (surgeon's election).
Return the ileum into the abdominal cavity and the fascial defect is repaired with continuous polydioxanone 1/0 suture respecting 4:1 measurement rule.
We add the mesh between the edges of the defect during fascia closure.
The skin is sutured &quot;purse string&quot; style.
Post-Op
