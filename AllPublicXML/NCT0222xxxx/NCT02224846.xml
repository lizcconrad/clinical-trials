    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing at Least One Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (Serious or Non-Serious)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) was defined as an event that first occurs or worsens (increases in severity) after baseline, regardless of causality or severity. The percentage of participants with TEAEs was calculated by dividing the number of participants with at least 1 TEAE over the 12-Month treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the International Index of Erectile Function- Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) Domain Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1; Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>IIEF- EF is the sum of Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF. Questions 1-5 are scored 0 (no sexual activity for Question 1, no sexual stimulation for Question 2 and did not attempt intercourse for Questions 3-5) to 5 (high erectile function) and Question 15 is scored 1 (very low confidence) to 5 (very high confidence), for a total score ranging from 1 to 30. Higher scores represent better erectile function. Least Squares (LS) mean of the change from baseline is from Mixed effect Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) model.The model included covariates baseline + visit + pooled investigator + baseline*visit, where participant is a random effect.</description>

        <description>A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) was defined as an event that first occurs or worsens (increases in severity) after baseline, regardless of causality or severity. The percentage of participants with TEAEs was calculated by dividing the number of participants with at least 1 TEAE over the 12-Month treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the International Index of Erectile Function- Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) Domain Questionnaire Score</title>
        <description>IIEF- EF is the sum of Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF. Questions 1-5 are scored 0 (no sexual activity for Question 1, no sexual stimulation for Question 2 and did not attempt intercourse for Questions 3-5) to 5 (high erectile function) and Question 15 is scored 1 (very low confidence) to 5 (very high confidence), for a total score ranging from 1 to 30. Higher scores represent better erectile function. Least Squares (LS) mean of the change from baseline is from Mixed effect Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) model.The model included covariates baseline + visit + pooled investigator + baseline*visit, where participant is a random effect.</description>
