  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress has been implicated to play a pathogenic role in many disease processes,
      especially in age-related disorders such as age-related macular degeneration. It has been
      hypothesized that antioxidative agents such as vitamins and minerals, which are capable of
      scavenging free radicals, may reduce oxidative stress and may, in turn, be beneficial for
      patients with age-related disorders. Based on this hypothesis several different combinations
      of vitamins have been introduced, all targeting at reducing oxidative stress. However, the
      in-vivo effect of the antioxidative properties of a certain drug or vitamin combination is
      hard to investigate. In the current study, we propose to investigate the effect of Retaron®,
      a combination of carotoinoids, omega-3-fatty acids, a herbal extract of Aronia, vitamins and
      trace elements, in a systemic in-vivo inflammation model.

      In the present study, the infusion of LPS, which is a cell wall component of gram-negative
      bacteria and a major mediator in the pathogenesis of septic shock, will be used as a
      standardized experimental model of systemic inflammation in humans. Given that inflammation
      is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and widespread endothelial dysfunction, the LPS
      model is well suitable for determination of the antioxidative effects of Retaron®. As a main
      outcome parameter the vascular reactivity of retinal vessels to systemic hyperoxia (induced
      by breathing 100% oxygen) will be tested in presence or absence of the antioxidant
      combination.
