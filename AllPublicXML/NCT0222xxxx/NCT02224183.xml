  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is the most common pain condition in the military, causing
      substantial physical and psychological suffering, reduction in force readiness, and high
      economic cost. Yoga has been studied in 10 RCTs in civilian populations with cLBP suggesting
      it may be effective in reducing pain intensity, improving back-related function, and lowering
      pain medication use. Multiple differences exist between civilian and military populations
      with cLBP, making it necessary to adapt and test yoga for cLBP in military populations. This
      study's primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of yoga for reducing pain in military
      personnel and Veterans with cLBP through a structured, reproducible 12-week series of hatha
      yoga classes, supplemented with home practice, compared to an education group. Additionally,
      the enormous mental health burden often shouldered by returning military personnel presents
      another important distinguishing factor. Thus, the study's secondary aim is to assess yoga's
      capacity to reduce post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The third aim is to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of yoga for cLBP at 3 months and 6 months from the perspective of the
      provider, the Veteran, and the Veterans Health Administration. The fourth and final aim is to
      evaluate the effect of back pain and yoga on marital and family functioning. The proposed RCT
      will (1) establish a structured reproducible yoga protocol uniquely suited to Veterans
      populations with cLBP; (2) develop web-based delivery systems to assist Veterans in yoga home
      practice; (3) increase our knowledge of the feasibility and impact of yoga for Veterans' cLBP
      and psychological comorbidities. These results will help determine whether yoga is an
      effective modality for addressing cLBP in a Veteran population.
