      Objectives: For major laparoscopic surgery, as with open surgery a multimodal analgesia plan
      can help control postoperative pain. Placing a wound catheter intraoperatively following
      colon surgery could optimize the control of acute pain with less consumption of opioids and
      few adverse effects.

      Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, study of 103 patients scheduled to undergo
      laparoscopic colon surgery for cancer in Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital.

      Patients were recruited and randomly allocated to wound catheter placement plus standard
      postoperative analgesia or standard postoperative analgesia alone. A physician from the acute
      pain management unit monitored all patients for at multiple points over the first 48 hours
      after surgery. The primary outcome variables were verbal numeric pain scale (NRS) scores and
      amount of intravenous morphine used via patient controlled infusion.

    <measure>Assessment of Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRS) after laparoscopic colon surgery using interfascial continuous wound infiltration</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the 48 hours after laparoscopic colon surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical Rating Pain Scale was used to measure the after-intervention Pain. This scale is widely used and shows good correlation with the Visual Analogue scale, specifically in the case of elderly individuals. Compared to other scales, it has low error rates and high validity. This score was assessed in all the participants.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of intravenous morphine consumption after laparoscopic colon surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the 48 hours after laparoscopic colon surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Intravenous morphine consumption was administrated via patient-controlled analgesia device. The consumption was evaluated in all participants in the study at the following measurement points: at 30 min, 2h, 8h, 24h, and 48h after the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complications related to intravenous morphine consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the 48 hours after laparoscopic colon surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Complications related to intravenous morphine consumption were measured: nausea, vomiting and pruritus throughout the treatment period. Paralytic ileus awas measured 24h after surgery. This was assessed for all patients. Moreover, especially for patients belonging to the experimental group, potential adverse effects from placement of the wound catheter such as infection or haematoma at the surgical site or potential toxicity of local anesthetic (e.g., tinnitus, obnubilation) were recorded.</description>
