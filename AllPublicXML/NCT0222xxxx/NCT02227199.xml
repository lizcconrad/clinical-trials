      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of brentuximab vedotin that can
      be combined with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide in treating patients with Hodgkin
      lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or is not responding to treatment (refractory).
      Monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in
      different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide,
      carboplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving brentuximab vedotin together with an ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide
      chemotherapy regimen may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine maximally tolerated dose of brentuximab vedotin that can be combined with
      ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      II. To gain a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the above regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and toxicity of the above regimen.

      II. To determine the ability to proceed to peripheral blood stem cell collection following
      the above regimen (the impact of above regimen on stem cell reserve).

      III. To assess the impact of this regimen on biomarkers from the microenvironment in Hodgkin
      lymphoma tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8;
      ifosfamide IV over 24 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2; and etoposide IV over 1
      hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients planning to go on to consolidative high-dose
      therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may undergo peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) mobilization following the 2nd course of study therapy at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.

             than 6 months or lack of response) to ifosfamide, carboplatin, or etoposide

          -  Patients with evidence of active central nervous system lymphoma

          -  Patients with prior receipt of brentuximab vedotin

          -  Patients with peripheral neuropathy of &gt; grade 1

          -  Patients who have other medical conditions that would contraindicate treatment with
             aggressive chemotherapy (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension,
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the
             past 6 months, or uncontrolled arrhythmia); if the patient's cardiac history is
             questionable, a measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction should be obtained
             within 42 days prior to registration; patients with left ventricular ejection fraction
             &lt; 50% are not eligible

          -  Prior failed (&lt; 5 x 10^6 CD34/kg) peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection

          -  Patients who had pelvic radiation within 12 months

          -  Previous chemotherapy/immunotherapy within 3 weeks before study entry
