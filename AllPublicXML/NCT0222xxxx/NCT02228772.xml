  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a combination of drugs considered standard treatment for
      children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in combination with a new
      drug called MLN 9708. Additionally, the study is also evaluating if bone marrow or stem cell
      transplantation, which will be given to some participants, helps to prevent ALL from
      returning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are studying the optimal dose of the drug MLN 9708
      when given with a standard multi-drug regimen. In the first part of the study, up to 18
      participants will be enrolled at different doses of MLN 9708. Once the maximally tolerated
      (highest, safest dose) is established, an additional 10 participants will be enrolled.

      Additionally, bone marrow (tissue found in the inside of bones) or stem cell transplantation
      will be given to some participants to study whether it helps to prevent ALL from returning.

      The study treatment consists of several different stages

        -  Induction

        -  Consolidation 1

        -  Or Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant (if you are eligible based on your medical
           condition and the availability of a matched stem cell donor)

        -  Or If you do not have a transplant:

             -  CNS Therapy

             -  Consolidation 2

             -  Continuation Therapy

    <description>Dose escalation will occur using a standard 3+3 dose escalation approach, beginning in dose level I with dose cohorts and rules for escalation and de-escalation.
MLN 9708 will be given with standard multi-drug regimen for ALL . MLN 9708 will be administered on determined days during Induction therapy cycle and Consolidation cycle. If remission occurs and if eligible, the next stage with be either Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant.
If not eligible to receive a transplant, the participant will continue on this study for the next 3 stages.
