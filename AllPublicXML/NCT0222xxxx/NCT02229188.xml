  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study divided into two phases. IN phase 1 (completed) participants will be
      randomized to receive 8 weeks of Problem Solving Therapy (PST) alone or 8 weeks of a
      cognitive training game called, Evolution (Evo) plus clinical management. In Phase 2 (now
      recruiting), participants will be randomized to Evo, PST, and a different cognitive training
      program called Words. Words is similar to Evo in that it is an adaptive training program and
      includes case management. IN both studies participants will be assessed for clinical and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) outcomes at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks.

      Evo is a computer game that targets parts of the brain (i.e. the cognitive control network)
      that we think may be associated with depressive symptoms. This study is exploratory and will
      inform future hypotheses the research team will test in subsequent research.

    <description>Evo is a video game that has therapeutic elements targeting the cognitive control network. Impairment in this neural network is associated with a specific subtype of late life depression that puts people at risk for poor response to SSRIs. Evo is built from a research grade training paradigm that has shown to induce improvements in this network in healthy older adults</description>
