        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy men and women according to the following criteria: based upon a complete
             medical history, including physical examination, vital signs (Blood pressure (BP),

             excipients)

          9. Intake of drugs within 1 month or less than 10 half-lives of the respective drug prior
             to first study drug administration

         10. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to
             administration or during the trial

         11. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes daily)

         12. Alcohol abuse (average consumption of more than 20 g/day in women and 30 g/day in men)

         14. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within 4 weeks before Day 1 of Visit 2)

         15. Any laboratory value outside the reference range of clinical relevance

         16. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

             For female subjects of childbearing potential only:

         17. Positive pregnancy test, pregnancy or planning to become pregnant during the study or
             within 2 months after study completion

         18. No adequate contraception during the study and until 1 month after study completion,

             prior to first study drug administration, vasectomised partner (vasectomy performed at
             least 1 year prior to enrolment), or surgical sterilization (including hysterectomy).
             Women who did not have a vasectomised partner, were not sexually abstinent or
             surgically sterile were asked to use an additional barrier method (e.g. condom).
