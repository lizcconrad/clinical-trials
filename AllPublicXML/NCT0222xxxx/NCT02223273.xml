      Phase 1: An observational study ( registry) will be conducted with the objective of
      documenting the practice of stroke treatment in brazilian and latin american hospitals.

      Phase 2: A cluster randomized trial aiming to evaluate the effect of a multifaceted strategy
      to increase evidence based treatments usage for stroke patients. The hospitals will be
      randomized into two groups: the multifaceted strategy group and the usual care group.

      Study Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate a multifaceted strategy to increase
      evidence based therapies for patients with acute ischemic stroke.

      Study Population; Patients with suspected stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with
      symptoms lasting up to 24h hours.

      Quality Improvement Multifaceted Intervention: The strategy includes a simulation based team
      training, case manager, check lists, reminders and educational material.

    <description>Composite Adherence Score: defined as the sum of usage of evidence based therapies in the first 48 hours and at discharge among the patients' total eligible opportunities. For this purpose, patients with contraindications (which are specific for each endpoint) were excluded from the denominators. Evidence based therapies in the first 48 hours include: antithrombotics within 48 hours of admission, use of recombinant Plasminogen Activator (Rt-PA)in patients who arrive at the hospital within 3.5 hours of symptom onset and who are treated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, dysphagia screening, pre-deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, door to needle time &lt; 60 minutes, dysphagia screening). Discharge Therapies include: antithrombotics, lipid lowering agents in patients with LDL 100 or not documented, anticoagulants for atrial fibrilation or flutter, assessment for rehabilitation and smoke cessation education</description>
