      Introduction: the global sugar consumption has increased in the past 50 years and their
      abusive intake is responsible for the insulin resistance and causes the metabolic syndrome -
      obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and coronary heart disease. Objective: To evaluate
      the effect of scheduled diet without glucose as treatment of labyrinthine disorders
      associated with glucose-insulin index. Study Design: A prospective randomized controlled
      trial. Patients and Methods: A study conducted at the University of São Paulo with 51
      patients divided into two groups: Diet Group (DG) that comprises subjects treated with
      fractionated diet with glucose restriction and control group (CG) where individuals were not
      counseled regarding diet. Patients underwent computerized dynamic posturography - sensory
      organization test (CDP - SOT) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in the first and thirtieth days
      of the study.

      51 patientes with dizziness and glucose intolerance diagnosed by the glucose tolerance test
      were selected.

      The subjects were submited to CDP SOT conditions and a visual analogue scale to measure his
      self perception about dizziness.

      Then, they were randomized in two groups: with and without fractioned diet without glucose
      during 30 days.

      The CDP was repeated in order to verify a statistical difference of SOT condition 5 that
      reflects the individual hability to maintain the own posture with the vestibule solely and CS
      - that represents the final balance situation.

      The VAS was repeated too in order to verify the self perception of the dizziness after diet.
