      We aim to determine if adding ShearWave Elastography to a standard ultrasound breast exam can
      improve the characterization (classification) of breast lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chinese women are known to have denser breasts than women in Western countries. Mammography
      cannot find abnormalities easily in denser breasts, while breast ultrasound is not affected
      by density. Adding elastography, a stiffness measurement, to a breast ultrasound exam should
      improve the diagnosis of a lesion.
