    <textblock>
      This study examines whether an integrated alcohol/substance abuse, suicide, and HIV
      prevention protocol is associated with lower onset and frequency of alcohol and other drug
      use, suicidal behavior, and high risk sexual behavior among adolescents receiving community
      based mental health care.

      The purpose of this study is to compare an integrated adolescent alcohol/drug, suicide, and
      HIV prevention program to an assessment only control condition in a randomized clinical
      trial. This prevention protocol is designed as an &quot;add-on&quot; intervention to standard mental
      health care. We will examine the extent to which the addition of this prevention protocol is
      associated with lower rates of alcohol use and drug use, suicidal behavior, and HIV related
      risk behaviors.
