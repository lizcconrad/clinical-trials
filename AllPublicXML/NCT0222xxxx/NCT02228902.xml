      Introduction: There are indications that the absorption of oral iron supplementation is
      reduced after a Roux- en -Y gastric bypass. Nevertheless, oral preparations are used as
      standard therapy for iron deficiency, even in patients who underwent a Roux- en -Y gastric
      bypass. Our goal is to evaluate if iron absorption is disturbed after a RYGB, which leads to
      a insufficient treatment of oral iron suppletion.

      Methods: an iron absorption test will be performed pre- and postoperatively in 24 patients.
      Two groups will be created.

      Preoperatively group 1 receives a daily dose of ferrous fumarate (600mg) and group 2 receives
      a daily dose Losferron (1390mg).

      Before intake of the medicines, a fasting blood sample is taken (baseline), serum iron
      including ferritin, transferrin and transferrin saturation will be measured. After intake of
      losferron/ferrous fumarate blood samples will be taken 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours after
      intake, using a drip. An increase of 80 microgram/l is representative for a sufficient iron
      absorption. All patients undergo a Roux- en -Y gastric bypass.

      Postoperatively; one month postoperatively the same absorption test will be repeated in the
      same patients.

This will take place before surgery and one month after surgery. The primary outcome is de difference between iron values pre- and postoperatively.</description>
