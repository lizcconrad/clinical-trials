    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to know the effects of probiotics on the incidence of
      Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants less than 1500 g.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators performed a clinical, randomized, double-blind trial in preterm infants
      &lt;1500g from March 1, 2010 to February 28, 2012. Group A received enteral stimulation trophic
      five days and later increments 20ml/k/day of breast milk or formula for premature; the group
      B apart from the above the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (boucardii strain) 1 X109
      colonic forming unit (CFU)/ day for 4 weeks was added. Gastric tolerance, evolution, reason
      for discharge, and the development of Necrotizing enterocolitis was monitored. The diagnosis
      of Necrotizing enterocolitis was made by the treating physician according to Bell's criteria
      and was blinded to group assignments.The formulas were prepared by one of the investigators
      according to the group each patient was assigned. Using sterile technique, the probiotic with
      1x109 (CFU) Lactobacillus acidophilus (boucardii strain) was added at a dose of 125 mg/
      kg/dose twice daily for 4 weeks to fresh supplement breast milk or formula for preterm
      infants. In case of control group only breast milk or formula for preterm infants was used.

      All formulas were labeled for each patient and were delivered to the nurse in charge of
      infant feeding at 9:00 and 21:00 h.

      Characteristics of Sample size and statistical analysis:

      Sample size showed that the investigators needed 190 total preterm infants, based on the
      expected 50% decrease in the incidence of severe necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm
      neonates who received probiotics compared with control group with α 0.05 and β 0.20.
      Student´s t test or Mann Whitney U test were performed for mean differences regarding the
      general characteristics in the two study groups, Chi square or Fisher´s test for differences
      in proportions for mortality and complications between groups.
