      This trial will test the hypothesis that treating parents of neonates requiring NICU care
      with intranasal mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine bathing will reduce the spread of S.
      aureus from parents to their neonates.

      The TREAT PARENTS Trial, or Treating Parents to Reduce NICU Transmission of S. aureus, is a
      placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that
      treatment of S. aureus colonized parents with intranasal mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine
      gluconate antisepsis will decrease neonatal S. aureus acquisition. All neonates admitted to
      the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center NICUs will be
      pre-screened and parents will be approached for enrollment in the study. After consent and
      baseline screening, 400 neonate-parent pairs will be randomized; only neonates who have a
      parent colonized with S. aureus will be randomized. Parents will receive a 5 day treatment
      with intranasal mupirocin plus topical chlorhexidine gluconate antisepsis or placebo.

      After recruitment and informed consent, parents will undergo pre-randomization screening. If
      both parents screen negative for S. aureus colonization, the neonate will be ineligible for
      the randomization and parents will be informed that they are not colonized at that time with
      S. aureus. If either parent screens positive for S. aureus, then both parents as a pair will
      be eligible for randomization to one of the two possible masked treatment arms. The
      neonate-parent &quot;pair&quot; will be the unit of randomization and each parent will be allocated to
      the same group if both consent.

      After the baseline neonate testing for S. aureus colonization, repeat testing will be
      performed every 7 days for the neonates until the neonate acquires S. aureus colonization or
      is discharged from the NICU.

    <description>Primary outcome is neonatal acquisition of S. aureus strain that is concordant to parental S. aureus strain as determined by periodic surveillance cultures or a culture collected during routine clinical care that grows S. aureus. Survival analysis techniques will be used to compare the hazard of concordant colonization comparing Treatment and Control Groups. Planned secondary analysis will include a comparison of the proportion of neonates acquiring concordant S. aureus by 4 and 8 weeks into their NICU stay across the two groups.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonate has never had a clinical or surveillance culture grow S. aureus

          -  Neonate was transferred from another hospital or admitted from home and had admission
             screening cultures for S. aureus colonization that were negative (if admission
             cultures were not performed, they will be performed as part of the pre-randomization
             screening process)

          -  Parent(s) is(are) able to visit the child at the bedside

          -  Parent(s) test positive for S. aureus at screening

          -  Neonate has anticipated stay longer than 5 days in the NICU (if estimated stay is
             unclear, parents can be screened for S. aureus colonization and decision to randomize
             can be delayed until hospital day 3 or 4 after reassessment of anticipated stay).
