  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With better medical care, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening disease, are
      enjoying longer lives. As the CF life expectancy increases, conditions such as CF-related
      diabetes (CFRD) become more prevalent. Nutrition plays a major role in maintaining optimal
      health in cystic fibrosis (CF). This project is designed to investigate nutrition-related
      factors, such as vitamin D status, on oxidative stress and fat oxidation which may influence
      long-term survival in CF and CFRD. Based on preliminary clinical and metabolomics research
      findings, the working hypotheses of this project are: 1) oxidative stress in CF contributes
      to impaired fat oxidation, and 2) vitamin D supplementation normalizes oxidative stress and,
      subsequently, fat oxidation. This study will combine state of the art methods with
      traditional clinical methods to assess fat oxidation, oxidative stress, and nutritional
      status in adults with cystic fibrosis. Research methods include blood draws for plasma
      markers of oxidative stress and metabolomics (the measurement of thousands of small chemicals
      in the blood), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, to assess energy capacity and thigh fat),
      dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, to assess total and regional body fat and muscle),
      and indirect calorimetry (to assess resting energy expenditure and whole body fat oxidation).
      Clinically-relevant data, such as lung function, CF genotype, and diabetes status will be
      obtained from the electronic medical record and the CF Registry. This study consists of two
      sub-studies. The first is a cross-sectional study in 66 clinically-stable adults with CF and
      44 healthy control participants. Testing in clinically-stable adults will occur in the Emory
      University Hospital (EUH) Clinical Research Network (CRN) outpatient unit (blood draws,
      indirect calorimetry, DEXA) and in the Emory University Biomedical Imaging Technology Center
      (BITC) for MRI imaging. The second study will be an ancillary longitudinal study to the
      ongoing, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized high-dose vitamin D trial (DISC Study,
      IRB00052829, PI: Tangpricha) in patients with CF who are hospitalized for pulmonary
      exacerbation. Blood draws and indirect calorimetry will be performed in patients within 72
      hrs of hospital admission (before vitamin D dosing), and during 3 and 6 month outpatient
      follow-up visits. The data generated from this study will be used to inform future nutrition
      intervention studies in adults with CF and CFRD.
