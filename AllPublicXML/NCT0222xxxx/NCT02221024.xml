  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children admitted in a ward often require a peripheral intravenous catheter to provide access
      for administration of medications, nutrients, fluids, blood products. Vascular access in
      children is a frequent and stressful procedure that should be performed as infrequently as
      possible in order to reduce the child's pain experience and the child's and family's level of
      distress. The maintenance of patency of indwelling catheters is therefore relevant to
      minimize need for replacement and children discomfort.

      Recent studies investigated the most effective and safe method of maintaining peripheral
      intravenous lock (peripheral IVL) in children. Most of these studies focused primary on the
      use of heparin versus saline flushes, showing similar efficacy of the two approaches.

      To the best of the investigators knowledge no study addressed the issue of the optimal
      flushing frequency of normal saline . The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
      normal saline flushes, at 12 and 24 hours intervals.
