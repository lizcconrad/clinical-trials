  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is associated with a high risk of relapse and hospitalisation and many
      patients do not recover to their previous psychosocial function. Major reasons for poor
      outcomes are delayed intervention for prodromal depressive and manic symptoms as well as
      decreased adherence with treatment.

      Recently, in the MONARCA I trial (NCT01446406), the investigators developed and deployed a
      smartphone based self-monitoring system (the MONARCA I system) in a randomized controlled
      trial, to test the effect of daily reporting of subjective self-monitoring of depressive and
      manic symptoms as well as a bi-directional feedback loop on depressive and manic symptoms.

      In the MONARCA II trial the investigators will develop and deploy a new version of the
      smartphone based monitoring system. The investigators will in a randomized controlled single
      blind trial investigate whether daily electronic monitoring of subjective and objective
      measures of illness activity using a smartphone based self-monitoring system including
      feedback on subjective as well as automatically generated objective data (e.g.social
      activity, physical activity etc.) (the MONARCA II system) reduces the severity of depressive
      and manic symptoms and improves functioning more than a control group receiving a smartphone.
      All patients will be followed for 9 months with outcome assessments at baseline, after 4
      weeks, after 3 months, after 6 months and after 9 months.
