      Purpose and aims This as a pilot study that aims to investigate which inflammatory biomarkers
      can be found in saliva in children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).

      The hypothesis is that children with JIA will show a different pattern of inflammatory
      biomarkers in saliva than healthy Children.

      The null hypothesis is that there are no differences.

    <textblock>
      This is a comparison between 100 children with JIA and 100 healthy children. Saliva will be
      collected and analyzed with respect to biomarkers.

      One-hundred consecutive patients with active JIA, as diagnosed by the Department of Pediatric
      Rheumatology, Astrid Lindgrens Barnsjukhus, Karolinska University Hospital will be included.

      Inclusion criteria are:

        -  age between 7 and 14 years

        -  a diagnosis of JIA according to the International League of Associations for
           rheumatology

      Exclusion criteria are:

        -  current malignancies

        -  TMJ surgery or trauma within two years

        -  recent intra-articular glucocorticoid injection in TMJ (within 1 month)

        -  other conditions or diseases than JIA that may cause orofacial pain. The parents of the
           patients and/or the patients will give their verbal and written informed consent to
           participate in the study according to the permission from the regional ethical committee
           2011/2:1.

      The control group of 100 age and sex matched healthy children will be included at
      Folktandvården Stockholms Län AB.
