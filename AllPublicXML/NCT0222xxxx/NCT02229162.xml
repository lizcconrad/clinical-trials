    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of delayed cord clamping (DCC) at progressively longer intervals (90 to
      120 seconds) during elective cesarean deliveries of term infants. The investigators
      hypothesize that the pilot trial of DCC in cesarean sections will demonstrate safety of this
      procedure for mothers and babies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite expert recommendations to delay clamping the cord for at least 2 minutes, early cord
      clamping remains a common obstetrical practice. The World Health Organization has noted that
      data on cesarean deliveries are more limited, particularly with respect to long-term effects
      in infants. Recently, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology also noted in a
      committee statement that &quot; the ideal time for clamping of the umbilical cord in cesarean
      section vs. vaginal birth is a particularly important area for future research&quot;.

      The objective of this study is to conduct a pilot trial of delayed cord clamping during
      cesarean deliveries to determine if progressively longer intervals of cord clamping are
      feasible and not related to poorer maternal and neonatal outcomes as compared to outcomes
      from historical controls. We will offer study entry for women planning elective cesarean
      delivery to collect prospective data on progressively longer intervals, analyzing outcomes
      for each time interval to ensure they are clinically acceptable, prior to extending the
      interval another 30 s. We anticipate approximately 20 women at each interval (90 and 120 sec)
      and will perform hemoglobin analysis on the infants specifically for this study. If
      intraoperative blood loss is clinically deemed excessive, or mother or baby are unstable, the
      cord will be clamped.
