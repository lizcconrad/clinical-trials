  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
      prostate cancer disparities. In previous work the investigators have identified a set of
      differentially deregulated genes in African American versus Caucasian American prostate
      cancer. Based on these findings, they hypothesize that they will be able to validate these
      targets, originally identified in the previous work conducted at The George Washington
      University Medical Center, in an independent Duke University Medical Center cohort of
      prostate cancer specimens. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that they will be able
      to discover novel targets in the Duke University Medical Center cohort of prostate cancer
      specimens because of regional differences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individual patient African American and Caucasian American prostate biopsy cores or surgical
      specimens will be obtained from the following procedures: transrectal ultrasound biopsy of
      the prostate (TRUSBxP), MR fusion biopsy, intra-operatively (IO) at the time of
      prostatectomy. Using cellular DNA and RNA, isolated from prostate cancer and patient-matched
      normal prostate biopsy cores or surgical specimens, the investigators will perform ancestral
      genotyping, exon arrays, targeted RNA sequencing, and epigenetic analyses. As controls, blood
      will also be collected. Genomic data from blood and tumor tissue will be compared.

    <description>Total RNA will be interrogated for mRNA expression patterns with the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST GeneChip. Microarray data will be normalized by quantile normalization with background correction. Targeted RNA sequencing of the previously identified genetic factors specific to African American prostate cancer will confirm altered expression and alternative splicing in these deregulated genes. The Agilent Technologies SureSelect RNA Custom Capture Kit will capture and sequence transcripts. Epigenetic analyses of the genetic factors specific to African American prostate cancer will identify DNA methylation and histone modification patterns in these deregulated genes. The Sequenom EpiTYPER will screen for differential methylation and methylation differences will be quantified using pyrosequencing. Differential histone modification patterns will be explored. Analysis will be performed on 33 prostate cancer biopsy specimens from each of 6 groups stratified by race and Gleason grade.</description>
