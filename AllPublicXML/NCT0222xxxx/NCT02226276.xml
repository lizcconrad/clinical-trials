    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well copper Cu 64-tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic
      acid (DOTA)-trastuzumab positron emission tomography (PET) works in predicting response to
      treatment with ado-trastuzumab emtansine in patients with human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Copper
      Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab is a chemotherapy drug (trastuzumab) attached to a radioactive
      substance. Diagnostic procedures using PET may allow scanners to take pictures of where the
      drug travels in the body and may help doctors identify which patients may benefit from
      treatment with ado-trastuzumab emtansine.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab (copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab) PET by
      individual tumors with subsequent tumor response to ado-trastuzumab emtansine as assessed by
      serial 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) (fludeoxyglucose F 18)/PET-computed tomography (CT).

      II. Compare tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET between patients who do and patients
      who do not respond to ado-trastuzumab emtansine.

      III. Obtain tumor tissue for subsequent assessment of the presence of putative molecular
      mechanisms of resistance (MMRs) to ado-trastuzumab emtansine. When funding becomes available,
      those samples will be used to explore the correlation between the presence of MMRs as
      assessed by histopathology and tumor response to ado-trastuzumab emtansine both in univariate
      analysis and in combination with tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab as measured with
      PET/CT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo whole body fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT. Patients then receive trastuzumab
      intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes immediately before receiving copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab
      IV and then undergo PET scans at 24 and 48 hours. Patients then receive ado-trastuzumab
      emtansine IV every 3 weeks until complete response or disease progression at the discretion
      of the treating oncologist. Patients undergo restaging by whole body fludeoxyglucose F 18
      PET/CT every 6 weeks for 1 year after initiation of treatment until disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
