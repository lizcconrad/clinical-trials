  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this short-term, pilot randomized trial comparing 2.50 diopters (D)
      overminus lens treatment vs. non-overminus (spectacles without overminus or no spectacles) in
      children with intermittent exotropia (IXT) 3 to &lt;7 years of age is to determine whether to
      proceed to a full-scale, longer-term randomized trial.

      The objective of this short-term, pilot randomized trial comparing 2.50D overminus lens
      treatment vs. non-overminus (spectacles without overminus or no spectacles) is to determine
      whether to proceed to a full-scale, longer-term randomized trial. This decision will be based
      primarily on assessing the initial (8-week) response to overminus by comparing treatment
      groups on the following outcomes:

        -  Mean distance IXT control score (each patient's score is the mean of 3 control scores)
           (primary outcome)

        -  The proportion of subjects with treatment response, defined as 1 or more points
           improvement in mean of 3 distance IXT control scores (secondary outcome)

        -  Adverse effects, near visual acuity outcomes, and spectacle wear compliance

    <measure>Mean Distance Exotropia Control Score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit, control of the exodeviation was measured at distance (6 meters) and at near (1/3 meters) using the Office Control Score* which ranges from 0 (phoria, best control) to 5 (constant exotropia, worst control). Due to the variability of single measures of control, we used a &quot;triple control score,&quot; which is a mean of 3 measures obtained at specific time-points during a 20- to 40-minute office examination. The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat treatment group comparison of mean 8-week distance control using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model which adjusted for baseline distance control.

    <measure>Symptom Survey Response to Question: Has Child Looked Over His/Her Spectacles Since Enrollment?</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A brief survey of symptoms that may be associated with overminus such as headaches, eye strain, and problems with spectacle wear will be administered to the parents of the subjects. Parents are asked to respond to the survey questions based on their observations of their child in the past 2 weeks.

Survey items were derived based on expert opinion of pediatric ophthalmologists and optometrists on the study planning committee. The response options were a 5-point Likert-type scale based on frequency of observations: never = score of 0, almost never = 1, sometimes = 2, often = 3, and always = 4.</description>

        <title>Mean Distance Exotropia Control Score</title>
        <description>At each visit, control of the exodeviation was measured at distance (6 meters) and at near (1/3 meters) using the Office Control Score* which ranges from 0 (phoria, best control) to 5 (constant exotropia, worst control). Due to the variability of single measures of control, we used a “triple control score,” which is a mean of 3 measures obtained at specific time-points during a 20- to 40-minute office examination. The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat treatment group comparison of mean 8-week distance control using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model which adjusted for baseline distance control.

        <title>Symptom Survey Response to Question: Has Child Looked Over His/Her Spectacles Since Enrollment?</title>
        <description>A brief survey of symptoms that may be associated with overminus such as headaches, eye strain, and problems with spectacle wear will be administered to the parents of the subjects. Parents are asked to respond to the survey questions based on their observations of their child in the past 2 weeks. Response options are based on frequency of observations; never, rarely, sometimes, often, always, and not applicable. Survey items were derived based on expert opinion of pediatric ophthalmologists and optometrists on the study planning committee. The response options were a 5-point Likert-type scale based on frequency of observations: never = score of 0, almost never = 1, sometimes = 2, often = 3, and always = 4.</description>

        <title>Symptom Survey Response to Question: Since Enrollment Has Your Child Avoided Reading or Doing Things up Close?</title>
        <description>A brief survey of symptoms that may be associated with overminus such as headaches, eye strain, and problems with spectacle wear will be administered to the parents of the subjects. Parents are asked to respond to the survey questions based on their observations of their child in the past 2 weeks. Response options are based on frequency of observations; never, rarely, sometimes, often, always, and not applicable. Survey items were derived based on expert opinion of pediatric ophthalmologists and optometrists on the study planning committee. The response options were a 5-point Likert-type scale based on frequency of observations: never = score of 0, almost never = 1, sometimes = 2, often = 3, and always = 4.</description>
        <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Spectacle-related questions at follow up apply only to observation participants prescribed correction (N=10 (32%) and to all overminus group participants N=27 (100%)).</population>
