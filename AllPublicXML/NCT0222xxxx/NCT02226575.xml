      A randomized controlled design with pre- and 12 month posttest including persons living with
      atrial fibrillation and their relatives.

      The distress management program (cognitive behavioral therapy) delivered in groups by a
      specialistnurse, a pedagogue and a cardiologist all trained in the distress management
      program. The program delivered to participants into three group- sessions extensive two hours
      each during a five weeks period 2011-2013.

      Eligible participants were all consecutive identified when discharge after hospital care due
      to atrial fibrillation. The random process were managed by an open-label computer as block -
      randomization. Participants were enrolled and randomized during 2011-2013 into two arms;
      either to an experiment group to the distress management program or the control group. The
      trial, run alongside the standard care all of the participants received at a cardiology unit
      in a county hospital. The standard care was required to following actual guidelines.
