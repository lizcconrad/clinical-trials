  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intervention studies support a protective effect of flavonoid-rich foods such as chocolate
      and tea on cardiovascular disease risk. In a previous study we found that pure epicatechin
      improves markers of vascular function and insulin resistance although the results were less
      pronounced than the majority of chocolate intervention studies.

      The food matrix of chocolate or other compounds present in chocolate could play a role in the
      bioavailability of flavonoids, resulting in these heightened improvements in vascular
      function.

      In this study we aim to compare the acute effects of pure epicatechin and high-flavonoid
      chocolate on markers of vascular function.

      Twenty male participants between the ages of 40 and 80 will visit the university on three
      days, separated by a 2-week washout. During each visit the participants will, in random
      order, be allocated to one of the three interventions:

        1. High flavan-3-ol chocolate (70g) plus placebo capsule;

        2. White chocolate (70g) plus 100mg of epicatechin in capsule form;

        3. White chocolate (70g) plus placebo capsule; Measurements of vascular function will be
           taken before, and 2 hours after consumption of the supplements. In order to determine
           flavonoid bioavailability, 24-hour urine samples will be collected and 7 blood samples
           will be taken over a period of 8 hours.

      The primary study parameter is the percentage change in Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) as a
      result of a high-flavonoid cocoa or epicatechin challenge. Additional study parameters
      include plasma flavonoid and nitric oxide concentrations as well as pulse wave analysis
      parameters.
