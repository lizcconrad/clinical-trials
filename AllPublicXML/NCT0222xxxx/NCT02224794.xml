      The primary objectives of the LIFE Study are to demonstrate the clinical and cost benefits
      associated with using the Ovation® Abdominal Stent Graft Platform under the least invasive
      conditions defined in the Fast-Track EVAR protocol. The key elements of the Fast-Track EVAR
      protocol include: appropriate patient selection, bilateral percutaneous access, no general
      anesthesia, no ICU admission post procedure, and next day discharge.

      The LIFE Study is a prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center
      post-market registry to evaluate the ultra low profile (14F) Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft
      Platform when using in the Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (P-EVAR) treatment of
      patients with AAA using a Fast-Track EVAR protocol.

      250 study patients will be enrolled at up to 40 institutions. Follow-up period is one month.
