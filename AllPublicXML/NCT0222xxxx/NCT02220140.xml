    <textblock>
      In this project we invite 8.000 young persons (age 18-27) in Denmark and to participate in a
      randomized controlled intervention study where we aim to test the effectiveness of a web
      based knowledge and inspiration program about resilience for children, adolescents and adults
      (called myresilience.org). The complete CONSORT trial protocol is available at
      http://myresilience.org/ at the subsite 'about us'.

    <measure>Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up will be on the average 1 year after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Symptom Checklist is an instrument consisting of the eighteen Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criteria (DSM-IV). Six of the eighteen questions were found to be the most predictive of symptoms consistent with ADHD. These six questions are the basis for the ASRS v1.1. The measure is a number score.
The ASRS-v1.1 will be administered to all participants before and 1 year after the intervention.</description>

    <description>The GHQ-12 is a widely used standard Health Questionnaire. The GHQ-12 will be administered to all participants before and 1 year after the intervention.
