    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the HM3 LVAS by
      demonstrating non-inferiority to the HMII LVAS (HMII) when used for the treatment of
      advanced, refractory, left ventricular heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HM3 LVAS is intended to provide hemodynamic support in patients with advanced, refractory
      left ventricular heart failure; either for short term support, such as a bridge to cardiac
      transplantation (BTT) or myocardial recovery, or as long term support, such as destination
      therapy (DT). The HM3 is intended for use inside or outside the hospital.
