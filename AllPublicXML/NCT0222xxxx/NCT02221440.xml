  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplementary oxygen is routinely administered to patients, even those with adequate oxygen
      saturations, in the belief that it increases oxygen delivery. However, oxygen delivery
      depends not just on arterial oxygen content but also on perfusion.

      Maternal oxygen administration has been used in an attempt to lessen fetal distress by
      increasing the available oxygen from the mother. However, the effect of supplemental maternal
      oxygen therapy on fetal acid base status has been debated for more than seven decades.

      Hypothesis: Prophylactic maternal low flow nasal oxygen administration during the second
      stage of labor can relieve fetal distress.

      A report from the cochran library (Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Dec 12;12:CD000136.):

      Too little evidence to show whether oxygen administration to the woman during labour is
      beneficial to the baby.

      Some babies show signs of distress, such as unusual heart rates or the passing of a bowel
      motion (meconium) during their mother's labour. This may be caused by a lack of oxygen
      passing from the woman to the baby through the placenta. Sometimes, women may be encouraged
      to breathe extra oxygen through a facemask (oxygen administration) to increase the oxygen
      available to the unborn baby. A review of two trials found too little evidence to show
      whether oxygen administration to the woman during the second stage of labour is beneficial to
      the baby. No trials of oxygen administration when the baby is showing signs of distress were
      found. Further research is needed.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apgar score less than 7</measure>
    <time_frame>at one and five minutes after birth</time_frame>
    <description>The Apgar scale is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from 0 to 2, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from 0 to 10. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration). The infant is given a score of 0, 1 or 2. The scores are added up and the total sum is their Apgar score.
The test is generally done at one and five minutes after birth, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 7 and above are generally normal, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low.</description>
