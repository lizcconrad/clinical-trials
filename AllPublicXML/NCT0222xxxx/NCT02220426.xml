  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of detecting Brown Adipose
      Tissue (BAT) in healthy subjects by using hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI.

      In this pilot study, MRI of BAT of healthy adult volunteers will be performed at 3 Tesla to
      assess image quality using a prototype surface coil and pulse sequence following inhalation
      of hyperpolarized 129Xe (xenon) gas at thermoneutrality and under mild cold condition.

      The investigators are testing the abilities of xenon MRI to see brown adipose tissue and
      detect its thermogenic activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the fight against obesity, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is considered to be the newest
      target. The hypothesis is that this tissue is partially responsible for the imbalance between
      energy intake and energy expenditure that keeps lean people lean and obese people obese.

      As the detection of this tissue in adult humans is difficult, this study aim to evaluate the
      use of hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI for the detection of this tissue.

      Hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI is currently used for lung ventilation studies. For this study
      subjects will undergo an MRI scan for which they will also inhaled hyperpolarized xenon.
      Scans will be done before and during stimulation of thermogenic activity by cold exposure,
      while MR images and spectra will be acquired from the supraclavicular area. We expect that
      the inhaled gas will diffuse into blood and eventually reach BAT in a manner proportional to
      the metabolic activity of this tissue.

      Objectives of this studies are:

        -  To detect BAT volume using hyperpolarized xenon MRI

        -  To detect BAT thermogenic activity by hyperpolarized xenon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
           (NMR) spectroscopy
