  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a multifactorial disorder which affects about 1% of all
      couples and challenges both patients and clinicians technically and emotionally. IVF clinics
      see higher prevalence of RPL, since many RPL patients are seeking for assist reproduction
      treatment with or without other infertile factors. Guidelines for evaluation and treatment of
      RPL patients include screening for uterine abnormalities, parental chromosomes, autoimmune
      antibodies and cure gynecological infections, but there are still half of RPL patients remain
      unexplained.

      The documented high incidence of chromosomal errors in first-trimester miscarriages and an
      increased rate of aneuploidy in patients with RPL has led to the theory that screening
      embryos before implantation for aneuploidy may decrease the risk of a subsequent loss and
      serve as a possible treatment. The technology, indications of use, and even terminology for
      genetic testing of embryos have greatly changed since the first PGD(pre-implantation genetic
      diagnosis) baby was born in 1990. The current best evidence shows blastocyst biopsy followed
      by new rapid comprehensive chromosome screening(termed pre-implantation chromosomal screening
      or comprehensive chromosome screening, PCS or CCS, or the investigators generally termed PGS)
      based on array-comprehensive genome hybridization(aCGH), single nucleotide polymorphism
      array(SNP-array) or next generation sequencing(NGS), to be the most powerful technology.
      However, for whom this PGS technique is most suitable to achieve improved clinical outcome
      have not yet been identified by well defined, ITT based research with carefully selected
      control and adequate sample size.

      The investigators research is to determine whether in vitro fertilization (IVF)/
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) combined with SNP-array based pre-implantation
      comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS) will improve the clinical outcome of infertile
      female patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion history.
