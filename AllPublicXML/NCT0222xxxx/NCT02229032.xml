  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is tremendous curiosity about medical marijuana and the treatment of epilepsy. In a
      specific genetic epilepsy known as Dravet Syndrome, a mutation occurs affecting the SCN1A
      gene. A specific strain of marijuana known as Charlotte's Web, available in Colorado, may
      have activity in this catastrophic epilepsy syndrome. Anecdotal reports suggest both success
      and lack of response with this therapy. Genetic analysis of the differences between Dravet
      responders and non-responders may prove useful for identifying patients likely to be helped
      by this therapy, as well as shed light on the putative mechanisms by which marijuana may
      exert any antiepileptic effect.
