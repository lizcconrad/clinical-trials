  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes who develop low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) in the hospital are at
      risk for losing the ability to develop symptoms that warn them that they are having a low
      blood sugar. There is almost no available information investigating how the inability to feel
      symptoms of a low blood sugar contributes to the risk of this happening when people with
      diabetes are hospitalized. The purpose of this study is to develop a symptom score model that
      will help to identify patients at risk for low blood sugars in the hospital and to examine
      what happens to patients who do experience a low blood sugar in the hospital.

      Patients who develop recurrent hypoglycemia are predisposed to developing
      hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF, impaired awareness). There is almost no
      information investigating the contribution of HAAF as a risk factor for hypoglycemia in
      hospitalized patients. Our central aim is to develop a validated inpatient hypoglycemic
      symptom score model to examine HAAF and its correlation with cognitive dysfunction,
      re-hospitalization rates, inpatient morbidity and mortality.

      This will be a prospective non-blinded study performed in a tertiary care center that will
      include non-critically insulin treated patients with Type 1 and 2 Diabetes. We will identify
      patients who have experienced moderate hypoglycemia (40-70 mg/dl) or severe hypoglycemia (&lt;
      40 mg/dl) within the prior 24 hours by daily generated computerized reports. Participants
      will be asked to complete a Hypoglycemia Symptom Scores Questionnaire and cognitive testing
      within 24-36 hours post event. Participants will be contacted at 6 and 12 months following
      the index hospitalization to obtain information regarding recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia,
      need for re-hospitalization, and occurrence of any new diabetes related complications.
