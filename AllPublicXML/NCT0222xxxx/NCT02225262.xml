  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of CyberKnife radiosurgery in patients
      with early stage prostate cancer.

      The investigators hypothesize that hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy via the
      CyberKnife® can deliver tumor ablating doses of radiation to prostate tumors safely and
      effectively while sparing the adjacent tissues (rectum, bladder, ureters, urethra, penile
      bulb, and bowel) from receiving damaging doses of radiation.

      The CyberKnife system is a type of radiation machine that uses a special system to precisely
      focus large doses of x-rays (radiation) on the tumor. The device is designed to concentrate
      large doses of radiation onto the tumor so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal
      tissue will be minimal.
