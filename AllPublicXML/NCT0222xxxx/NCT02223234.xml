  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed study is to test, among Canadian families, the
      comparative effectiveness of 2 different versions (doses) of a family-based obesity
      prevention intervention that is tailored to families' behavioural risk profile.

      To achieve this objective, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of families with
      children aged 18 months- 5 years. Families will be randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: 1)
      Monthly emails with general health information (Attention Control), 2) Tailored weekly emails
      and 2 home visits with a health educator (Email +2), 3) Tailored weekly emails and 4 home
      visits (Email +4). The intervention will last 6 months, with follow-up at 12-months
      post-intervention (18 months from baseline). We will examine the impact of the intervention
      on the children's body composition, weight-related behaviours, and biomarkers of diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease risk.

      We hypothesize that, compared to children in the Attention Control, children in the Email +2
      and Email +4 conditions will achieve:

        1. a smaller increase in adiposity (primary outcome), age- and gender-specific body mass
           index (BMI),over a 6-month intervention period.

        2. higher frequency of family meals, child's sleep duration, physical activity, and fruit
           and vegetable intake and lower child's sugar-sweetened beverage intake, and sedentary
           behaviour over a 6-month intervention period. (secondary outcomes)

        3. lower diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, fasting
           insulin, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein,
           trans and saturated fats, and higher High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol over a
           6-month intervention period.

      We further hypothesize that there will be no significant difference in these outcomes between
      children in the conditions with 2 (Email +2) or 4 (Email +4) home visits.
