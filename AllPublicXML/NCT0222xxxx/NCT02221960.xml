      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and
      antitumor activity of MEDI6383 alone and in combination with MEDI4736 in adult subjects with
      recurrent or metastatic solid tumors.
