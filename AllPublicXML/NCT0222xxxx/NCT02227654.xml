  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present investigation will prospectively evaluate whether serial transvaginal
      ultrasonography with Morphology Index (MI) can further reduce false positive results by more
      accurately distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors. If there is no change in the
      detection of true positive cases, the result will be an increase in the positive predictive
      value of ovarian cancer screening.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine if a treatment algorithm using serial transvaginal ultrasound with a tumor
      morphology index can improve the positive predictive value (PPV) of ovarian cancer screening
      compared to a historical control from 15% to 25%.

      Secondary Objective To measure the compliance for study participants enrolled on the
      treatment algorithm using serial transvaginal ultrasound with a tumor morphology index.

      Exploratory Objective To determine the effectiveness of a treatment algorithm that combines
      serum biomarkers aloneor in combination with transvaginal ultrasound to reduce the false
      positive rate of ovarian cancer screening in the subset of women agreeing to biomarker
      collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women must be enrolled in the University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening Program
             Eligibility criteria for the OCSP are: 50 years of age or older, or be postmenopausal
             and have not had a prior salpingo-oophorectomy or have a family history of ovarian
             cancer in a primary relative or have a self-history of breast cancer.

          -  Patients have a documented ovarian abnormality on ultrasound

          -  Patients having undergone prior hysterectomy will be eligible provided that they meet
             the other requirements for entry into this study.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not enrolled in the University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening
             Program .

          -  Patients who cannot tolerate the vaginal ultrasound procedure.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients who are referred with pelvic symptoms, a known pelvic mass, or a history of
             prior radiation, will be excluded from this investigation.

          -  History of ovarian cancer.

          -  Prior bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

          -  Prisoners.

          -  Women who are currently pregnant.
