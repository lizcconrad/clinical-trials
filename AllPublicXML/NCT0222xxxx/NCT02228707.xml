    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple
      doses of BIIB061 administered to healthy adults. The secondary objective is to determine the
      multiple-dose PK profile of BIIB061 in this study population.

             hepatitis C virus antibody, or hepatitis B virus (defined as positive for hepatitis B
             surface antigen [HBsAg] or hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]).

          -  Presence of a metal device (e.g., any type of electronic, mechanical, or magnetic
             implant; cardiac pacemaker; aneurysm clips; implanted cardiac defibrillator) or
