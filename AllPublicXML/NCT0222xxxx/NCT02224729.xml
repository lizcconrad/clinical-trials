    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies side effects and how well bendamustine hydrochloride, bortezomib,
      and dexamethasone work in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride and dexamethasone, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving bendamustine hydrochloride
      with bortezomib and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the response rate of induction therapy following 4 cycles of the combination
      regimen bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride), bortezomib and dexamethasone (BBd) in
      patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      II. Describe the tolerability and toxicities of this regimen. III. Provide one-year
      progression-free survival and one-year overall survival data following this therapeutic
      strategy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      2; bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; and dexamethasone orally (PO) on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving less than a very good
      partial response (VGPR) or with more than 10% bone marrow plasmacytosis may receive 2
      additional courses.

      NOTE: Patients requiring immediate reduction in paraprotein during course 1 only receive
      bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2; bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8,
      and 11; and dexamethasone PO on days 1-4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

             as above and the resolution of the monoclonal protein by immunofixation in the serum
             and urine.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Failure to sign informed consent
