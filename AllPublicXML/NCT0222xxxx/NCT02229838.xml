      Safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, 6.0, and 10 mg BIBB 1464
      p.o once daily in a rising dose group-comparison (placebo controlled, double blind,
      randomized per dose level).

      comparison), preliminary assessment of food effects (interindividual comparison)

      Two-stage Trial Design With Randomised Double Blind Placebo Controlled Rising Dose Phase and
      Subsequent Randomised, Open Parallel Group Phase).

      MS (Tablet) in Healthy Male Subjects, Combined With Preliminary Evaluation of Relative
      Bioavailability and Effect of Food of the Dose of 0.75 mg or 2 mg or 6 mg (Two-stage Trial
