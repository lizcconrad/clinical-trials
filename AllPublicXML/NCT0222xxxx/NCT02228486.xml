  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapse is a major risk in substance abuse disorders, which is closely related to craving for
      a substance, describing a strong urge for consumption. Cue-exposure therapy is an
      intervention aiming at the reduction of perceived craving by repeated confrontation. It is
      based on the assumption that craving drops after repeated exposure without the reinforcing
      experience elicited by consumption. In the present study, patients with alcohol dependency
      take part in nine cue-exposure training sessions. Each session consists of mood induction
      reflecting a high risk situation with subsequent in vivo confrontation with one's preferred
      alcoholic beverage followed by the training of coping strategies. During the cue-exposure,
      patients focus on perceiving automatic responses to alcohol-related cues. We hypothesize that
      especially patients exhibiting initially high reactions to such cues should profit from this
      intervention the most. The reactions are measured on a subjective (craving) and physiological
      level (hemodynamics of the prefrontal cortex, heart rate variability, electrodermal
      activity). Furthermore, we want to strengthen the expected training effects during the
      cue-exposure by an activating transcranial direct current stimulation of the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex, which has been shown to be hypoactive in substance abuse disorders. We
      investigate how the cue-exposure training affects the processing of alcoholic cues
      (cue-reactivity) and its relation to clinical symptoms of alcohol dependency.

    <description>During alcohol cue exposure, an active tDCS with a duration of 15 minutes and 2 mA is applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3, anode) and a reference electrode placed over Fp2 (electrode positions determined by the international 10-20 system). The electrodes are rectangular (35cm2).</description>

    <description>During alcohol cue exposure, a placebo tDCS is used with electrodes placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3, anode) and a reference electrode placed over Fp2 (electrode positions determined by the international 10-20 system). The electrodes are rectangular (35cm2). There is a 20 second ramp going up until 2 mA and back to 0 again at the beginning and the end of the placebo stimulation with no active stimulation during the cue exposure.</description>
