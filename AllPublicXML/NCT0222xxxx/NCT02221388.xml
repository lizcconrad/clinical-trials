  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the oral bioavailability and rate of absorption of two different formulations of
      BI 671800 HEA (choline salt) tablets 200 mg, one with enteric coating (EC) and one without
      EC, versus 2 x 100 mg BI 671800 ED (ethylenediamine salt) capsules. Both BI 671800 HEA
      formulations were further investigated concerning food effect and one of the two BI 671800
      HEA formulations identified by interim pharmacokinetic analysis was further investigated
      concerning dose proportionality with 50 mg.
