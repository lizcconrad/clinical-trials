  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (sub-study 1) administered via Respimat® Soft MistTM Inhaler B
      (SMI B); to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple rising doses of BI
      54903 XX administered via Respimat® SMI B (main study), and to compare systemic exposure of
      single dose BI 54903 XX administered via Respimat® SMI B (sub-study 2) with single dose
      Alvesco® (ciclesonide) administered via HFA-134a propellant metered dose inhaler (MDI).
