  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether MIS416 administered once weekly over 12
      months is safe, tolerable, and improves a range of signs and symptoms associated with
      secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.

      The primary objectives of the study are to:

        1. Determine the efficacy of MIS416, relative to placebo, when administered repeatedly via
           weekly intravenous (IV) administration to subjects with Secondary Progressive Multiple
           Sclerosis, as assessed by its effect on measures of neuromuscular function.

        2. Determine the safety and tolerability of a weekly regimen of MIS416.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to:

        1. Determine the effect of MIS416 on disease activity and neurodegeneration by assessing
           changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) markers including lesions, whole brain
           atrophy (WBA) and Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR).

        2. Determine the effect of MIS416 on Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) related to disability
           and health status.

        3. Assess, in a subset of subjects, the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of MIS416, including
           effects on serum, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC), and Cerebral Spinal Fluid
           (CSF) cytokine/chemokine levels and expression patterns.
