      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the MicroPort's
      Valve and delivery system for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in severe aortic
      stenosis who are considered unsuitable for Surgical Valve Replacement.

      1. Evaluate the performance, safety and clinical benefit of MicroPort's aortic valve
           prosthesis and delivery system in intervention by peripheral artery.

        2. The study Continuous observe 12 months of safety and efficacy. Approximately 89 patients
           are recruited in the study with native aortic valve stenosis which are considered
           unsuitable for Surgical Valve Replacement.
