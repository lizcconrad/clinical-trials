      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a structured package (bundle) in
      reducing the use of antimicrobials and hospital stay of patients with community-acquired
      pneumonia (CAP), and no increase in mortality of these patients in different hospitals.

        Pre-intervention period

        All patients admitted with a diagnosis of CAP will be included in the participating centers
        during the 12 months prior to the intervention. Case detection is done through the
        electronic record of the basic minimum data set (MDS) (2, 36). Diagnosed patients will be
        selected at discharge: &quot;simple acute bronchitis and pneumonia excluding asthma major
        criteria&quot; (by diagnosis related group, DRG 541) and &quot;simple and pleuritis in over 17
        Pneumonia&quot; (DRG 089).

        Post-intervention period

        All patients admitted with a diagnosis of CAP in the participating centers, which measures
        the bundle will apply prospectively included. Case detection was performed by daily review
        of patients admitted to target units and will be coordinated by the IP address of each
        center.
