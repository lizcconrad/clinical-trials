    <textblock>
      Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)is a disease can not be cured. Medicine for DOR includes
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), hormone replacement therapy (HRT), immunosuppressive agents
      and alternative therapy, etc. Electroacupuncture (EA) can help patients regain regular
      menses, increase the estradiol (E2) level and decrease the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
      and decrease FSH/luteotropic (LH) ratio. In this cohort study, we aim to observe the effect
      of EA versus other therapies for DOR.

    <description>Patients choose this group will receive EA as a combination. Beside of EA, participants could receive oral medicine as the same as that of the drug group. The EA regimen has two point formulae, i.e. A (BL33) and B (ST25, EX-CA1 and RN4). The two formulae will be used alternatively. One session will last for 20 minutes, 5 sessions per week for the first 4 weeks and 3 sessions per week later (44 sessions in all).</description>

    <description>For BL33, insert the needle to the third posterior sacral foramina to a depth of 80-100mm. For ST25, EX-CA1 and RN4, the needle will be inserted vertically and quickly through the skin, and then slowly and vertically penetrate through the layer of fatty tissue, up into the muscles of the abdominal wall (until the moment of resistance is sensed on the tip of the needle and the participant feels a sting). The electric stimulator will be put on the BL33 and EX-CA1 with a continuous wave, 20 Hz, 1.0-4.0 mA.</description>
