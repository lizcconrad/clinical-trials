  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thickening of the heart muscle (left ventricle) known medically as Left Ventricular
      Hypertrophy (LVH) is very common in patients with heart disease. This increases risk of
      cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.

      LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however
      LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin resistance
      are present.

      Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to
      utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin
      resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate
      the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel
      way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants will
      be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to either
      metformin or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. At the
      beginning of the study, the thickness of the heart muscle will be measured by ultrasound scan
      and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). We will also perform non-invasive tests to
      measure blood vessel function. These tests will be repeated after one year. At the end of the
      study, we will investigate the difference between placebo treatment and metformin treatment.

      This study is funded by the British Heart Foundation.

    <textblock>
      This is a single centre trial designed to investigate the benefit, if any, of 12 month
      metformin XL 2000mg/day treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 64 nondiabetic
      participants with Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and insulin resistance (IR).

      Participants will be seen on seven occasions: screening, baseline/randomisation, 2 weeks post
      randomisation, month 1, month 4, month 8 and final month 12, during which vital signs and
      safety bloods will be performed. There will also be three telephone visits at: month 2, month
      6 and month 10.

      At a screening visit an initial history will be performed following informed consent.
      Participants will then undergo an echocardiogram (a painless ultrasound scan of the heart) in
      the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. Blood pressure will be
      recorded and blood tests to determine fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI) and routine
      safety, prior to metformin administration, will be performed.

      Participants who meet all inclusion criteria will return for the randomisation visit within 4
      weeks of screening where a Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI) scan will be performed
      followed by randomisation to either Metformin XL or placebo in a double blind, randomised
      fashion. Also, at this visit endothelial function tests will be performed to assess
      peripheral blood vessels in the forearm, central obesity will be quantified using waist
      circumference and waist to hip ratio (WHR) and study specific blood sampling performed (with
      participant consent).

      At the final visit or early withdrawal the following will be performed: vital signs, safety
      bloods, study specific bloods (with participant consent), echocardiography, endothelial
      function tests and cMRI.

      In the active arm, therapy will be metformin XL in an initial dose of 1000mg/day (metformin
      XL 500mg x2/day). Participants will continue on Metformin XL 500mg x2/day for two weeks,
      following safety blood checks this dose will be increased to 2000 mg/day. If the higher dose
      cannot be tolerated it will be reduced to 1000mg/day (or stopped if not tolerated).

      The target dose of metformin XL at 2000mg/day was chosen based on a previous study of
      metformin in nondiabetic heart failure patients with IR, this study demonstrated a beneficial
      effect of metformin on insulin resistance, weight reduction and an improvement in submaximal
      exercise. The study used the immediate release form of metformin (target of 1000 mg x2/day)
      which was associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects resulting in 13%
      withdrawal of study medication. For this reason we have selected metformin XR due to improved
      gastrointestinal tolerability.
