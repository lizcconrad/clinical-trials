  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of traditional treatment for spasticity is barely satisfactory. The shock wave has
      been used to treat the spasticity with expressively response and the effect could persist for
      1-3 months in different studies. However most sutdies lack the sham or control group. The
      purpose of this study was to assess the effect of shock wave for spasticity in wrist and
      hand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with spasticity for at least 6 months were randomized for 3 groups. Group I:
      patients receive one session of shock wave per week for 3 weeks; Group II: patients receive
      only one session of shock wave; Group III: patients receive the sham shock wave per week for
      3 weeks. The outcome measurements include Modified Asthow scale, passive range of motion,
      Disability Assessment Scale and Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (hand function and wrist
      control).

    <description>Shock waves are defined a sequence of acoustic pulse characterized by a high peak pressure (100 MPa), fast pressure rise (&lt; 10 ns) and short duration (10 μs) is conveyed by an appropriate generator to a specific target area with an energy density in the range of 0.003-0.890 mJ/mm2.
Different studies and clinical experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of shock waves in the treatment of musculoskeletal system such as chronic tendinopathies, calcific tendinitis of the shoulder, lateral epicondylitis, plantar fasciitis, and several tendon diseases.</description>
