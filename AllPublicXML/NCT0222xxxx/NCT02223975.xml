  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Can vibrational spectroscopy be used to accurately assess vulval skin conditions? Vulval skin
      disorders are common and the diagnosis of these conditions can be difficult. Reliable
      discrimination between benign vulval skin conditions, precancerous conditions or vulval
      cancer often requires tissue biopsies. In addition the monitoring of patients with vulval
      disease at risk cancerous change is currently limited to visual assessment often supplemented
      by multiple invasive tissue biopsies. There are currently no established non invasive tests
      available for the diagnosis of vulval skin diseases.

      The vibrational spectroscopic techniques of Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy are non invasive diagnostic tools that use the interaction of light within
      tissues to identify the chemical composition of different tissues. The use of these tools may
      reduce the need for invasive biopsies to diagnose and monitor women with vulval skin disease.

      The aim of this project is to explore the use of vibrational spectroscopic techniques in the
      diagnosis of vulval skin disease. This will be achieved by performing vibrational
      spectroscopy on samples of tissue previously taken from women with vulval skin disease
      treated at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The results of the spectroscopy
      will be compared with the routine tests and the accuracy of spectroscopy determined.

      Design Ex vivo vibrational spectroscopic analysis of existing stored vulval and lymph node
      tissue samples collected from patients who have undergone treatment for vulval disease.
      Vibrational spectra are to be correlated with consensus histopathology and multivariate
      analysis to be used to evaluate the classification accuracy of vibrational spectroscopy ex
      vivo.

      Aims

        1. To establish vibrational spectral signal characteristics across a range of known vulval
           skin conditions.

        2. To evaluate the ability of vibrational spectroscopic techniques to differentiate
           different vulval skin conditions.

        3. To evaluate the ability of vibrational spectroscopy to detect diseased lymph nodes in
           women who have undergone surgery for vulval cancer.

        4. To further the understanding of biochemical changes in a range of known vulval skin
           conditions.
