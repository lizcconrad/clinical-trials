  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasingly patients with critical illness requiring life support in an intensive care unit
      are surviving their hospital admission. Currently the investigators do not know what effect
      the ICU admission, and the life support, has on their long-term quality of life and whether
      they can return to their pre-illness level of function following ICU.

      The investigators aim to test telephone follow-up of ICU survivors in assessing function and
      quality of life six months after ICU admission. Additionally, the investigators will identify
      if there are factors that lead to poor recovery. The investigators hope this can influence
      and change current ICU practice to improve recovery and long-term outcomes for patients.

      The investigators aim to select a total of 300 patients from ICU, 75 patients from each of
      the four ICUs. If they survive to hospital discharge, patients and their relatives will
      receive a telephone questionnaire at 6 months after the ICU admission that aims to assess
      their long-term outcomes, including physical, cognitive and emotional function, quality of
      life, and whether they have been able to return to work following ICU.

      The ICU Recovery program will measure psychological, functional and cognitive function and
      quality of life with health economic outcomes in critically ill patients 6 months after ICU
      admission. The initial pilot study will determine feasibility of the patient outcomes and
      measurement methods used. The study will consist of patients from three (3) Monash Partners
      ICUs (2 public and 1 private) as well as The Austin Hospital ICU. 10,000 ICU patients are
      managed by Monash Partners Academic Health Science Centre (MPAHSC) public and private
      hospitals each year, of which in the region of 8,500 patients survive. These patients add to
      the community burden and also influence community and rehabilitation costs. Ultimately, our
      goal is to establish a national National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (NHMRC) -funded
      interventional study, led by Monash Partners. Our aim is to improve long-term patient
      outcomes through: improving sedation practices, delirium prevention, neurocognitive
      stimulation, early mobilisation, post-ICU follow-up, and functional and psychological
      rehabilitation. This study is required for the evaluation of hospital and post-ICU
      rehabilitation practice as there is insufficient evidence to alter current clinical practice.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Aim:

      To determine the feasibility of the multi-centre ICU Recovery study using telephone follow-up
      to assess quality of life, global, psychological, cognitive and physical outcomes at six
      months following ICU admission.

      Secondary Aims

        1. To determine the recovery of ICU patients ventilated &gt;24 hours at 6 months after ICU
           admission

        2. To identify risk factors for poor recovery in ICU patients

      Tertiary Aims

        1. To establish the likely recruitment rate for future studies of long-term outcomes

        2. To establish the resource requirements for long term follow-up (including staff,
           equipment and time taken for survey completion)
