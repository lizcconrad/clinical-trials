  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study was to obtain information about the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of BIIR 561 CL after continuous intravenous administration of two
      increasing doses in healthy elderly volunteers, following the infusion schema of a loading
      dose (1 hour) and a maintenance dose (5 hours)
