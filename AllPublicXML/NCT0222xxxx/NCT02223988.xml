  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious complication and carries increased risks
      of morbidity and mortality for patients who require mechanical ventilation.

      VAP is associated with the contamination and colonization of bacteria in the lower airway.
      These bacteria may be present in the lower airway by the aspiration of oropharyngeal
      secretions. Therefore limiting the amount of secretions that pass the glottis and enter the
      airway is paramount.

      Patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation may have a tracheostomy tube placed to
      manage breathing. These tubes may have a distal cuff which sits within the trachea. When the
      cuff is inflated, oropharyngeal secretions will pool above the cuff of the tracheostomy tube
      thereby limiting the amount of secretions entering the lower airway. These secretions may
      leak around the cuff and cause tracheobronchial colonization. It has been shown that removal
      of secretions that pool above the cuff via dorsal lumen suction leads to a decreased
      incidence of VAP.

      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of suction above the cuff tracheostomy
      tubes related to VAP incidence

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure for at least 72 hours.

          -  A score of 35 to 65 on the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II).

          -  Does not have a pulmonary infection estimated by a Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score
             (CPIS).

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years.

          -  have no exclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of esophageal, tracheal or pulmonary cancer or an existing malignancy within
             the trachea at the tracheostomy site.

          -  Previous surgery at the tracheostomy site (e.g. thyroidectomy).

          -  Bleeding diathesis (e.g. due to anticoagulation therapy).

          -  Emergency surgical airway management.

          -  Morbid obesity and/or neck edema (skin to trachea distance may render tracheostomy
             tube too short).

          -  Pre-existing infection at the tracheostomy site.

          -  Uncertainty in identifying the anatomical landmarks.

          -  Patients with a do not resuscitate order.

          -  Immunosuppressed and/or immunodepressed patients (Immunodepression being defined by
             the following conditions: 1-Leukocytes &lt; 1000/µl, 2-Neutrophils &lt; 500/µl. 3-AIDS
             Long-term steroid treatment (daily dose &gt; 0.5 mg/kg) for more than 30 days)

          -  Patients already enrolled in other trials
