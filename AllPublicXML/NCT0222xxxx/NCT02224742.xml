    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers are the source of considerable suffering and cost and there are
      currently no wound care products available that have been demonstrated to improve healing, or
      that are cost effective. There have however been a small number of studies which have
      examined the use of platelets or fluid derived from platelets, either from the patient's own
      blood or from blood bank products. These have suggested some promise, but have suffered from
      technical difficulties in making a suitable wound care product or the volume of blood
      required to derive the product. It is thought that the reason why they may work is that
      growth factors released by the platelets may stimulate the wound to heal.

      This study will be a formal, randomised controlled trial to assess a new device for creating
      a wound care product which is a plug or patch comprising fibrin, white cells and platelets
      derived from 18 mls of the patients own blood. The application of this fibrin/white
      cell/platelet patch to the patients wound on a weekly basis will be compared with usual best
      care in patients with hard to heal Diabetic Foot Ulcers in a secondary care setting in 25
      centres in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden.

    <description>LeucoPatch® is prepared by centrifuging one or more 18mL aliquots of the participant's venous blood in the LeucoPatch device and bench-top centrifuge. The centrifugation yields a tough layer of fibrin, with viable white cells and platelets, and this is applied directly to the wound surface using sterile forceps. The wound is then covered with an inert primary dressing, secondary protective dressing and the ulcerated area protected with appropriate off-loading. The patch is prepared and applied each week for up to 20 weeks or until the wound is judged healed.</description>

    <description>Usual wound care provided in a multidisciplinary foot care clinic , in accordance with international guidelines.
Components of usual wound care include:
Formal assessment of ulcer and surrounding skin
Provision of any necessary off-loading
Debridement (i) sharp, (ii) other as appropriate (but excluding the use of larvae)
Appropriate dressing products
Appropriate antibiotic therapy
Nutrition and self care
Optimal glycaemic control
Revascularisation if deemed clinically necessary
Continued close observation</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  People aged 18 years and over who have diabetes complicated by one or more ulcers on a
             foot or both feet below the level of the malleoli, excluding ulcers confined to the
             interdigital cleft.

          -  Those with more than one eligible ulcer will have one - usually the largest or more
             clinically significant - selected at screening as the index ulcer.

          -  Eligible ulcers will be hard-to-heal, meaning that the cross-sectional area will
             decrease by less than 50 % during a four week run-in period.

          -  The cross-sectional area of the index ulcer will be ≥50 and ≤1000 mm2 at the end of
             the 4 week run-in period.

          -  At randomisation, the index ulcer will be clinically non-infected according to IDSA
             criteria

          -  Either the ankle-brachial index (ABPI) in the affected limb will be between 0.50 and
             1.40 or the dorsalis pedis pulse and/or tibialis posterior pulse will be palpable.

          -  HbA1c ≤108 mmol/mol at screening

          -  Participants will have the capacity to understand study procedures, and will be able

          -  Dialysis or an estimated GFR (based on cystatine C or serum creatinine) &lt;20
             ml/min/1.73m2

          -  Increase in cross-sectional area of the index ulcer by ≥25% during the 4 week run-in
             period, or is either smaller than 50 mm2 or larger than 1000 mm2 at the end of that
             time.

          -  Clinical signs of infection of the index ulcer or reason to suspect that infection is
             present at randomisation.

          -  Revascularisation procedure in the affected limb planned, or undertaken within the
             preceding 4 weeks.

             within the preceding 8 weeks

          -  The need for continued use of negative pressure wound therapy

          -  Likely inability to comply with the need for weekly visits because of planned
