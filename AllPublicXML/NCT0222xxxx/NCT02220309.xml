  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is aimed at understanding behaviors and brain circuits that relate to
      anxiety and depression. Our goal is to learn which circuits of the brain are involved in
      anxiety and how these circuits might affect daily functioning.

      This study has recently added an additional treatment component: participants undergo a 12
      week course of either Pramipexole medication or rTMS therapy (explained below). The ultimate
      goal of the study is to offer participants experiencing anxiety and depression a treatment
      that is alternative to ones that have failed them in the past, and to apply the knowledge we
      gain from investigating the brain circuits involved in anxiety and depression to help
      personalize treatments.

      We invite anyone who has recently experienced any symptoms of anxiety and/or depression to
      participate (no diagnosis is required to participate).

      If you are eligible and choose to participate, we'll ask you to come in for a visit during
      which you would complete some game-like tasks on the computer, undergo a non-invasive brain
      scan, and answer some questions about your emotional health. The entire visit takes place
      during one day at Stanford and lasts about 4-5 hours. We'll also ask you to do a follow-up 12
      weeks later, from home, during which we'll again ask you some questions on your emotional
      health.

      To inquire more about participation, you can either sign up online or contact us.

        We expect to enroll 160 individuals spanning the spectrum of anxiety and associated mood
        symptoms. These individuals include patients of the Gronowski Center, a community clinical
        psychology center in Palo Alto. We will also recruit from the community through various
        advertisements. Further, participants will include healthy people recruited by
        advertisement.
