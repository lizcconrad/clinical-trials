      Prospective, multicenter study following for 2 years, 250 children who presented during the
      first trimester of pregnancy an isolated nuchal translucency over the 95th percentile of
      Nicolaïdes Curves on ultrasound and comparing them to a control group of 250 children whose
      pregnancy was normal. Evaluating morbidity, mortality, growth and the neurodevelopment of
      each group by a Brunet Lezine scale. Evaluating anxiety and depression in parents of those
      children using a scale.
