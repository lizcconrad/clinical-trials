        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male in-patient

          -  Age 18 - 80 years

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke causing a measurable neurological deficit
             defined as impairment of language, motor function, cognition, gaze, vision and/or
             neglect. Ischemic stroke is defined as an event characterized by sudden onset of acute
             focal neurological deficit, presumed to be caused by cerebral ischemia, after CT scan
             exclusion of hemorrhage

          -  Onset of symptoms within 3 hours prior to initiation of thrombolysis treatment

          -  Stroke symptoms present for at least 30 minutes that had not significantly improved
             before treatment. Symptoms must be distinguishable from an episode of generalized
             ischemia (i.e. syncope), seizure, or migraine disorder

          -  Patients are willing to receive thrombolysis treatment and to give informed consent
             with regard to retrieval of data and follow up procedures, according to the
             regulations in participating countries

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on the CT-scan

          -  Symptoms of ischemic attack began more than 3 hours prior to infusion start or when
             time of symptom onset is unknown

          -  Minor neurological deficit or symptoms rapidly improving before start of infusion

          -  Severe stroke as assessed clinically and/or by appropriate imaging techniques

          -  Seizure at onset of stroke

          -  Symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if the CT-scan is normal

          -  Administration of heparin within the previous 48 hours and a thromboplastin time
             exceeding the upper limit of normal for laboratory

          -  Patients with any history of prior stroke and concomitant diabetes

          -  Prior stroke within the last 3 months

          -  Platelet count of below 100,000/mm³

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt;185 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg, or aggressive
             management (IV medication) necessary to reduce BP to these limits

          -  Blood glucose &lt;50 or &gt; 400 mg/dl

          -  Known hemorrhagic diathesis

          -  Patients receiving oral anticoagulants, e.g. warfarin sodium

          -  Manifest or recent severe or dangerous bleeding

          -  Known history of or suspected intracranial hemorrhage

          -  Suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage or condition after subarachnoid hemorrhage from
             aneurysm

          -  Any history of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or
             spinal surgery)

          -  Hemorrhagic retinopathy, e.g. in diabetes (vision disturbances may indicate
             hemorrhagic retinopathy)

          -  Recent (less than 10 days) traumatic external heart massage, obstetrical delivery,
             recent puncture of a non-compressible blood-vessel (e.g. subclavian or jugular vein
             puncture

          -  Bacterial endocarditis, pericarditis

          -  Acute pancreatitis

          -  Documented ulcerative gastrointestinal disease during the last 3 months, oesophageal
             varices, arterial- aneurysm, arterial/venous malformation

          -  Neoplasm with increased bleeding risk

          -  Severe liver disease, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension
             oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis

          -  Major surgery or significant trauma in past 3 months
