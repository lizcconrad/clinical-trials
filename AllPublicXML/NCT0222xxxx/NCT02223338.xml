    <textblock>
      1. Background: Over 1 million intravitreal injections are performed annually in the United
           States. The most devastating complication related to these injections is
           endophthalmitis, with an incidence of 0.02 - 0.1% per injection. Techniques aimed at
           prevention of this complication have been studied, though emergence rates of antibiotic
           resistant bacteria in a single clinic population comparing antiseptic technique with
           iodine vs. use of post-injection second generation fluoroquinolones has not been
           reported in the literature.

        2. Objectives: The purpose of the study is to help determine the best way to prevent
           infection and limit antibiotic resistance in patients receiving eye injections.

        3. Procedures Involved (Research Interventions): After the patient is chosen based on
           inclusion criteria and agrees to participate in the study, exclusion criteria will be
           reviewed, cognizance will be determined, informed consent and HIPAA compliance forms
           will be signed. At this point and prior to the instillation of ophthalmic medications, a
           Rayon swab will be passed along the inferior fornix of the study eye while the patient
           looks up and the examiner lowers the lower eyelid. The swab will then be used to
           inoculate chocolate agar and a blood agar culture plates and a glass slide. These will
           be brought to the FMO microbiology department for culture and Gram stain. All
           Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus species identified will be
           subjected to sensitivity testing using the Gram Positive antibiotic panel available at
           Loma Linda, with the addition of ciprofloxacin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that bacteria in the eye may become resistant to
      antibiotics used after injections when compared to the bacteria found in untreated eyes.
      However, no study published to date compares resistance rates in eyes where an iodine-based
      preparation is used, which is standard of care, to those in which an antibiotic is also given
      after the injection in a single practice setting. This is an important issue, because
      resistant bacteria can cause infections that are more damaging and difficult to treat than
      non-resistant bacteria. Moreover, previous studies have focused on the emergence of
      resistance to fourth generation fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin,
      though use of second generation fluoroquinolones is still practiced in the United States by
      some retina specialists, including at the investigators institution. Currently in the United
      States, 81% of retina specialists give antibiotics after eye injections, although the results
      of several large studies suggest that this practice does not reduce rates of endophthalmitis
      compared with use of iodine alone.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Resistance of Ocular Flora to Commonly Used Post-injection Prophylactic Antibiotics</measure>
    <time_frame>Cultured organisms will be subjected to resistance panels once they have grown and been identified. Cultures will be followed for 7 days total, and if no growth is recorded at that time they will be considered sterile.</time_frame>
    <description>Resistance of all coagulase negative staph and staph aureus species to a panel of commonly used antibiotics will be determined and compared between groups. Resistance will be measured using minimum inhibitory concentrations which will be tested on the Siemens MicroScan instrument by doubling broth dilutions. Antibiotic susceptibility interpretations using the categories &quot;S&quot; for susceptible, &quot;I&quot; for Intermediate and &quot;R&quot; for Resistance based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
Ciprofloxacin will be tested using the Biomerieux &quot;E test&quot; strip. The test directly quantifies antimicrobial susceptibility in terms of discrete MIC values on a continuous gradient strip. The MIC values are also based on the CLSI guidelines giving interpretations of &quot;S&quot;, &quot;I&quot; or &quot;R&quot;.

        <description>Resistance of all coagulase negative staph and staph aureus species to a panel of commonly used antibiotics will be determined and compared between groups. Resistance will be measured using minimum inhibitory concentrations which will be tested on the Siemens MicroScan instrument by doubling broth dilutions. Antibiotic susceptibility interpretations using the categories &quot;S&quot; for susceptible, &quot;I&quot; for Intermediate and &quot;R&quot; for Resistance based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
Ciprofloxacin will be tested using the Biomerieux &quot;E test&quot; strip. The test directly quantifies antimicrobial susceptibility in terms of discrete MIC values on a continuous gradient strip. The MIC values are also based on the CLSI guidelines giving interpretations of &quot;S&quot;, &quot;I&quot; or &quot;R&quot;.
For information on other antibiotics to be tested, please contact the investigator or provide more characters for input.</description>
        <time_frame>Cultured organisms will be subjected to resistance panels once they have grown and been identified. Cultures will be followed for 7 days total, and if no growth is recorded at that time they will be considered sterile.</time_frame>

Ciprofloxacin: Use of topical ciprofloxacin 4x daily for 3 days after intravitreal injection using standard aseptic techniques with Povidone-Iodine is a common practice intervention in the United States, and is thought by some to reduce the risk of post-injection endophthalmitis.</description>
