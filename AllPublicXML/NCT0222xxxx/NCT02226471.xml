  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is closely correlated with obesity and cardiovascular disease. Adipokines
      may play important roles in the pathogenesis of obesity, which are a link between obesity and
      obesity-related disorders.C1q/TNF-related protein-3 (CTRP3) and retinol-binding protein 4
      (RBP4) are novel adipokine that modulates the action of insulin in various diseases. This
      study addressed the relationship between CTRP3, RBP4 and IR in newly diagnosed obesity and
      essential hypertension.

      Serum CTRP3 and RBP4, anthropometric and metabolic parameters were determined in 480 newly
      diagnosed obesity and essential hypertensive patients not taking anti-obese and
      antihypertensive medications and 66 normal weight (NW) and normotensive subjects. All
      subjects were divided into two groups depending on body mass index (BMI), including NW group
      and obesity group, and then four subgroups were divided according to obesity and
      hypertension, including NW-normal blood pressure subgroup (NW-NBP), NW-hypertension subgroup
      (NW-HTN), obese-normal blood pressure subgroup (OB-NBP), obese-hypertension subgroup
      (OB-HTN).

    <description>531 subjects were required to fast overnight before the physical examination.Blood pressure was measured three times, each 2 min apart on the upper arm using a mercury sphygmomanometer in a seated, resting position after 10 minutes of rest; the mean of the three measurements was used for the statistical analysis.Weight, height and hip and waist circumference (WC), were measured. BMI was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height (m2). WHR was calculated as the waist to hip circumference.
Overnight fasting blood samples were collected in tubes containing liquid EDTA; the samples were centrifuged at -4°C and maintained at -80°C until assayed. FBG was assayed using the glucose oxidase method. UA, TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations were determined enzymatically.</description>
