  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PULSE-ECCho will focus on trying to detect cardiotoxicity in cancer patients receiving
      chemotherapy early on in order to avoid irreversible damage. In addition to that, we will
      test if the PhysioFlow is non-inferior to the conventional MUGA scan.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to compare the PhysioFlow to the MUGA scan and see if the results are
      statistically the same using both techniques. This is what is known as a non-inferior study.
      The advantage of PhysioFlow is that it is non-invasive, fast and it is done at the bedside or
      while the patient is receiving his or her chemotherapy.

      The patient will be tested with the MUGA scan, as per the standard of care, before
      chemotherapy is initiated and at every 3 months. The patient will also be tested with the
      PhysioFlow at the same dates of the MUGA scan. In addition to that, the patients will be
      tested at each chemotherapy cycle with the PhysioFlow.

      Should the PhysioFlow indicate the patient has a cardiac toxicity as the patient is receiving
      chemotherapy, the results will be confirmed with the MUGA scan.

    <description>At the end of physioflow and or MUGA scan, a questionnaire to assess acceptance was proposed to all patients. The following aspects were evaluated: preparation and information before the imaging examination, degree of preceding concern, comfort, helplessness during the examination, pain experienced, degree of overall satisfaction. Evaluation was performed with a five-point qualitative Likert scale: very low, low, moderate, high, very high</description>
