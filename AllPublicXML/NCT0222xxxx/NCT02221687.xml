  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that a synbiotic formula, fed for the
      duration of the first year of life (infant and follow-on formula) reduces the incidence rate
      of episodes of infectious diarrhea in infants during the first year of life compared to a
      standard infant formula.

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between formula groups are evaluated via incidence rate based on number of subjects.
In formula-fed infants, diarrhea is defined as three or more loose or watery stools in 24 hours with or without fever or vomiting (according to WHO and ESPGHAN definition). For breast-fed infants, a change in stool consistency versus previous stool consistency is more indicative of diarrhea than stool number.
Diarrhea episode is considered as ended as soon as 2 consecutive non-watery stools are observed or no stools are observed in 24 hours.</description>
