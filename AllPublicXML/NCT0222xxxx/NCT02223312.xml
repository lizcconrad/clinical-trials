  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Tumor Associated
      Peptide Antigen (TAPA) pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines in the treatment of progressive
      and/or refractory hematologic malignancies (HM). We hypothesize that treatment of patients
      with relapsed and/or refractory HM, without available potentially curative treatment options,
      and whose neoplastic cells express at least one (1) TAPA of a defined panel of TAPAs, using
      low-dose cyclophosphamide (CYP) followed by an autologous, monocyte-derived, TAPA-pulsed DC
      vaccine and low-dose granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), will result
      in TAPA-specific T-cell responses without significant toxicities. We also hypothesize CD4+
      T-cell and CD8+ T-cell responses generated against specific TAPAs may translate into clinical
      antitumor activity.

    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with progressive and/or refractory hematologic malignancies, who have
      failed conventional therapy and have no potentially curative therapeutic options available,
      will be candidates for this Phase I/II study. Following confirmation of disease progression
      and/or refractoriness, eligible patients who agree to participate and sign a consent form
      will have their neoplastic cells and/or blood analyzed for the expression of a specific panel
      of Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens (TAPAs), including SP17, Ropporin, AKAP4, PTTG1 and
      Span-xb. Patients whose tumors express one (1) or more of these TAPAs will receive three (3)
      days of subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) to increase
      bone marrow production of monocytes and dendritic cell (DC) precursors, and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells will be obtained by phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis for generation of
      autologous DCs. Patient's DCs will be generated at Kiromic's Cell Processing GMP facility,
      according to established Standard Operating Procedures, and activated by pulsing/loading them
      with the TAPA(s) relevant for each particular patient. Patients will receive five (5) days of
      low-dose cyclophosphamide prior to each vaccination with TAPA-pulsed DCs to decrease Treg
      activity. TAPA-pulsed DCs will be administered at a fixed dose of up to 1 x 107 DCs at least
      two (2) days following cyclophosphamide administration. DC vaccination schedule will be once
      every fourteen (14) days via subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) injections for a total of
      6 vaccinations. Low dose GM-CSF will also be administered SC for five (5) consecutive days,
      starting three (3) to six (6) hours after each TAPA-pulsed DC treatment, to optimize immune
      response and DC viability in vivo. Patients will be followed on a weekly basis (or more
      frequently if required) to evaluate treatment-related toxicity. Immune responses and
      anti-tumor responses will be evaluated per protocol specifications. Continuation and stopping
      rules for the study will be defined based on toxicity/tolerability (Phase I) and/or immune
      efficacy (Phase II).
