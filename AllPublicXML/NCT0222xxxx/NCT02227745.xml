    <textblock>
      Photocoagulation is the standard treatment in the focal EMCS, disrupts vascular leakage and
      allows the pigment epithelium remove the intraretinal fluid is effective in reducing the
      incidence of visual loss but can reduce contrast sensitivity and retinal sensitivity, the
      characteristics of the function can be reduced such as setting (location and stability) are
      relevant to the quality of the patient's vision parameters, reading comprehension, especially
      the ability, duration of diabetic macular edema, could have a significant impact on survival
      and / or the functional reserve of the macular cells subjected to mechanical and toxic
      stress-induced edema. It seems that in the treatment of patients with EMCS, photoreceptor
      damage occurs as a recent phenomenon, and can precede neurodegeneration retinal photoreceptor
      loss, whereby visual function can be decreased. An adjunctive treatment as Dorzolamide
      facilitating effect helping resorption of intraretinal fluid through EPR and reduce adverse
      events that is the loss of contrast sensitivity and retinal sensitivity, response time of
      photocoagulation treatment could be reduced to the patient, because the rate of resorption of
      intraretinal fluid is facilitated and thus the duration of the response, also could reduce
      damage to vision caused by the inadequacies of the photoreceptors during the evolution of
      macular edema avoiding moderate visual loss, there by increasing the quality of life in terms
      of improving the quality of vision in diabetic patients. In addition to obtaining a specific
      adjuvant treatment with photocoagulation is helpful for focal edema in diabetic and a new
      level using dorzolamide in retina Dorzolamide as adjunctive therapy after focal
      photocoagulation is more effective than placebo in improving visual function in patients with
      diabetic macular edema

    <textblock>
      Patients referred to ophthalmology for developing type 2 diabetes subspecialist
      ophthalmologist evaluate the macula them by biomicroscopy, pupillary dilation, to detect
      clinically significant macular edema. EMCS diagnosis is made according to ETDRS criteria, and
      patients who were requested to submit fluorescein angiography.

      Patients presenting with focal leakage on angiography were scheduled focal photocoagulation;
      day focal photocoagulation is measured before the procedure Measurement of visual acuity,
      visual acuity, refraction Measuring contrast sensitivity Measurement of retinal sensitivity
      Measurement of Optical Coherence Tomography ophthalmoscopic review

      Subsequently photocoagulation treatment was applied according to the guidelines of the ETDRS
      (1-50 number of shots, shot diameter of 100 microns and 120-180 mW power) and the patient was
      re-evaluated at 4 weeks, which will repeat the testing day photocoagulation.

      The patient what the research project will be discussed, will be invited to participate, will
      be read and informed consent was explained, questions and concerns will be clarified during
      the study, and patients who agree to enter the study will be assigned so random treatment.

      Patient 1 drop of topical drug in the treaty provided every 8 hours for 4 weeks eye is
      placed, the drug provided will be needed for 4 weeks, plus a control sheet dose delivery will
      be provided and shall be referenced again in April weeks later for evaluation:

      After 4 weeks of topical treatment, evaluation from 8:00 to 11 pm will be the same from the
      first date
