  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of moxetumomab pasudotox monotherapy in pediatric participants with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell ALL or B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Participants will be enrolled at
      sites in North America, Europe, and Australia. This is an approximate 35 month study.

    <measure>Best Overall Response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to Cycle 1, and prior to every cycle, at the end of treatment, at post-treatment follow-up visits, and at the end of the study, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response was calculated, based upon the disease assessments recorded during the study visits, and summarized with the number and percentage of participants for the following categories: CRc, PR, HA, SD, PD, and not evaluable. Overall best response is the best response observed for a participant during the study based on International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for malignant lymphoma. Complete response (CR) as per IWG is complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. PR is a minimum of 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses and no increase in the size of other nodes and in size of liver or spleen. Stable disease (SD) is when a participant fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for PD.</description>

          <description>The ORR, defined as the percentage of participants with CRc or partial response (PR), was estimated; the Clopper Pearson (Exact) 95% CI was calculated. The CRc is defined as complete response (CR), or complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi). Complete response (CR) as per International Working Group (IWG) is complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. Morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) is defined as the above CR criteria without specified blood counts.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Response (BOR)</title>
        <description>The best overall response was calculated, based upon the disease assessments recorded during the study visits, and summarized with the number and percentage of participants for the following categories: CRc, PR, HA, SD, PD, and not evaluable. Overall best response is the best response observed for a participant during the study based on International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for malignant lymphoma. Complete response (CR) as per IWG is complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. PR is a minimum of 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses and no increase in the size of other nodes and in size of liver or spleen. Stable disease (SD) is when a participant fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for PD.</description>

        <description>The time to SCT was defined as the duration from the start of treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox until the date when the subject became eligible for SCT. The time to SCT was to be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method, and was only to be evaluated for the subgroup of subjects who became eligible for SCT after treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox.</description>
        <time_frame>Prior to Cycle 1, and prior to every cycle, at the end of treatment, at post-treatment follow-up visits, and at the end of the study, up to 1 year</time_frame>
        <population>Efficacy population included participants who received moxetumomab pasudotox, completed a baseline disease assessment and had at least one post-baseline assessment. Since study was terminated prematurely, no participant received SCT after treatment with moxetumomab pasudotox, hence data were not collected for this Outcome measure.</population>

        <description>Immunogenicity assessment included determination of antidrug (moxetumomab pasudotox) antibodies and neutralizing antidrug antibodies in serum samples. Titers and specificity were determined for NAb-positive participants. Specificity were observed in participants who had ADAs directed to the PE38 domain of moxetumomab pasudotox and increase in titers were observed in participants who tested ADA-positive at baseline. Moxetumomab pasudotox ADA-titer is a validated immunoassay, which determines titers or levels of ADAs present in ADA-positive samples.</description>

        <title>Terminal Phase Elimination Half Life (t1/2) After the First Dose of Cycle 1</title>
        <description>Terminal phase elimination half-life is the time measured for the serum/plasma concentration to decrease by one half, calculated as natural logarithmic (log)-transformed (ln) value of 2 divided by elimination rate constant (lambda); that is [ln(2)/lambda]. Elimination rate constant (lambda) was estimated via linear regression of the time versus log concentration.</description>
