    <textblock>
      The project aims at developing the tailored intervention strategy of childhood obesity based
      on monitoring physical activities with accelerometer and dietary behaviors using diary. It
      probably raise the passion of obese children to control weight, form healthy life style, be
      effective in sustaining weight loss and early prevent adulthood diseases.

      The overweight and obese primary school students from 1-5 grades will be recruited according
      to &quot;Body Mass Index Reference for Screening Overweight and Obesity in Chinese School-age
      Children&quot;. The participants with will be allocated with schools as the unit to four groups:
      tailored intervention based on monitoring physical activity and dietary behaviors, exercise
      intervention group based on the Happy 10 program, nutrition education intervention group. The
      three intervention groups received the designed interventions for the duration of 1 year.
      Before and after the intervention, we will carry out a questionnaire survey, a physical
      measurement, a fitness test, and a metabolic markers detection

    <description>For the monitoring session, physical activity was assessed by accelerometer and dietary was assessed by diary. Based on the monitoring information, the individual tailored prescription, including the normative feedback and process feedback, were formed and delivered to children and parents. Children were encouraged to modify the behaviors according to the prescription.
Then, next monitoring circle was followed. In total, 7 monitoring round were completed.</description>
