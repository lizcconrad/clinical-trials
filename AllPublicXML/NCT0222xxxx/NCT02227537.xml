      A multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm observational study evaluating the
      Providence nighttime bracing system in patients diagnosed with adolescence idiopathic
      scoliosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, single arm
      observational study. A temperature probe and data logger will be attached to the Providence
      brace to monitor patient compliance wear time. Subjects will be blinded to temperature sensor
      readings to maximize objectivity of brace wear.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Curve progression</measure>
    <time_frame>subjects will be followed up for a period of 24 months from their first visit after receiving the Providence nighttime bracing system</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients who have ≤5o curve progression and the percentage of patients who have ≥6 o progression at maturity;
The percentage of patients with curves exceeding 45o at maturity and the percentage who have had surgery recommended/undergone;
2 year follow-up beyond maturity to determine the percentage of patients who subsequently undergo surgery.
Routine follow-up visits will be scheduled 6 months apart (1st visit after brace fitting, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months) up to 24 months. At each of these visits, the patient will undergo a history &amp; physical, PA radiographs, Cobb Angle assessment, Adams Forward Bending test, Neurological examination, outcome questionnaire's, concomitant medications, and adverse event recordings.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>subjects will be followed up for a period of 24 months from their first visit after receiving the Providence nighttime bracing system</time_frame>
    <description>A temperature data logger will record and monitor patient compliance of brace wear. To not create undue awareness to these recordings patients will be informed the temperature readings are being monitored for patient comfort and ease of brace wear. Reconciliation of data logger recordings will be conducted every 3 months.</description>

        up to 100 adolescent male/female will be enrolled at up to 4 sites in the US. Patients must
        be at least 10 years of age. Participants who receive treatment must have been diagnosed
        with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis without other significant spinal pathology.
        Appropriate participant selection will be accomplished through the integration of clinical
        and radiological parameters while ruling out other confounding sources of back pain or
        curvature. Subjects will be included who demonstrate a Cobb angle between 25-40 degrees.
        Participants must have radiographic evidence of a Risser grade of 0, 1, or 2. All chronic
        disease process and other possible sources for spinal curvature will be excluded by
        thorough history and physical examination.
