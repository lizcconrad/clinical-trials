  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung injury in patients undergoing oesophagectomy may occur during surgery (peri-operatively)
      as a result of One Lung Ventilation (OLV) and/or during the immediate post-operative period
      when patients receive intensive care. This is reinforced by the observation that
      physiological markers of lung injury are most elevated immediately after completion of
      surgery, and the development of clinical Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)occurs
      immediately post-operatively (within 72 hours of surgery), with the majority of cases
      reported 24-48 hours after completion of surgery. This study is designed to investigate the
      impact of pre-operative administration of GSK2862277 on biological and physiological markers
      of lung injury in patients undergoing surgical resection of oesophageal cancer in order to
      achieve optimal exposure at the site of injury following OLV and lung deflation. This study
      is a randomized placebo controlled, double-blind, multi-centre, single dose parallel group,
      design. There will be two treatment groups comprising one active and one placebo arm with
      approximately 40 patients per group. Patients enrolled in the study will be scheduled to
      undergo planned/elective trans-thoracic surgery for oesophagectomy. The primary endpoint for
      this study is the change in pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) from pre-surgical
      levels to the end of surgery. GSK2862277 will be administered as an orally inhaled aerosol
      (single nebulized dose) over approximately 3 to 5 minutes (min) 1-3 hours prior to surgery.
      Subject will be monitored daily until discharge and followed up till day 28.

             informed consent.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milli-International Units per milliliter and estradiol
             &lt; 40 picograms per milliliter (&lt;147 picomoles per liter) is confirmatory]. Females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

             Milligrams per day (mg/day) prednisolone (or equivalent) within 14 days prior to
             dosing, or anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) or anti-IL1 within 60 days prior to
             dosing.
