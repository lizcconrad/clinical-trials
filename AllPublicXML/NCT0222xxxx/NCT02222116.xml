  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to demonstrate that the Flow Area within a blocked coronary vessel as
      assessed by OCT is greater with the MGuard Prime stent compared to non-mesh control stent
      (BMS/DES) in subjects undergoing primary PCI for ST-segment elevation MI. The study
      hypothesis is that end of procedure flow area is greater with the MGuard Prime compared with
      stenting with a non-mesh DES or BMS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is &gt;18 years of age.

          -  Subject is experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with acute myocardial infarction
             (AMI) of &gt;30 minutes and ≤12 hours in duration.

          -  ST-segment elevation ≥1 mm per lead in ≥2 contiguous leads is present in at least one
             ECG prior to consent.

          -  Subject agrees to all required follow-up procedures and visits.

          -  Subject provides written, informed consent.

          -  The target lesion is a single de novo lesion in a native coronary artery.

          -  Based on coronary anatomy, PCI is indicated for the culprit lesion with anticipated
             use of stenting.

          -  TIMI flow of 0/1 is present at baseline and TIMI flow of 2/3 is present prior to
             randomization.

          -  The reference vessel diameter (RVD) of the infarct lesion is 2.75-4.0 mm by visual
             assessment, assessed after TIMI 2/3 flow is restored.

          -  The entire lesion length requiring treatment is ≤33 mm by visual assessment, assessed
             after TIMI 2/3 flow is restored.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that has not
             reached the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study
             endpoints.

          -  A previous coronary interventional procedure of any kind within 30 days - - - Female
             patients of childbearing potential.

          -  Subject undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (patients in whom cardiopulmonary
             resuscitation was successfully performed and in whom normal mental status was
             achieved, may be enrolled).

          -  Cardiogenic shock (SBP &lt;80 mmHg for &gt;30 minutes, or requiring IV pressors or
             intra-aortic balloon bump (IABP) or other hemodynamic support device for hypotension).

          -  Prior administration of thrombolytic therapy for the current admission

          -  Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.

          -  History of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the last 6
             months, or any permanent neurologic deficit

          -  Prior intracranial bleed at any time, or known intracranial pathology (e.g. tumor,
             arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm).

          -  Active or recent major bleeding within 6 months.

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or inability to accept blood
             transfusions.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to i) aspirin; or ii) heparin and
             bivalirudin; or iii) clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor; or iv) cobalt or nickel;
             or v) contrast media, which cannot be adequately pre-medicated (prior anaphylaxis,
             however, is an absolute contraindication to enrollment).

          -  Known calculated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min, hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL or platelet
             count &lt;150,000 for the present admission or within 7 days prior to index procedure, if
             available. NOTE: Baseline labs do not have to be available to consent patient. If
             laboratory results become available only after randomization, and do not meet
             inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient will not be de-registered from the
             study.

          -  Surgery planned or any other reason necessitating discontinuation of dual
             anti-platelet therapy (aspirin and an ADP antagonist) within 6 months.

          -  Rheolytic thrombectomy, a PTCA balloon with diameter &gt;2.0 mm, or any other device
             (other than guide wire or simple manual aspiration) is required to restore TIMI 2/3
             flow in the infarct vessel.

          -  Unprotected left main stenosis ≥50% or planned left main intervention.

          -  Any non-study lesion in the infarct artery with visually estimated diameter stenosis
             ≥50% and reference vessel diameter ≥2.0 mm or that will require treatment during the
             index procedure.

          -  Multi-vessel or multi-lesion intervention required during the index procedure.

          -  Excessive tortuosity, calcification or diffuse distal disease is present either
             proximal to, at or distal to the target lesion making it unlikely that the OCT
             catheter or stent will be able to reach or can be deployed across the target lesion
             with full expansion.

          -  Target lesion is a bifurcation with a side branch ≥2.0 mm in diameter.

          -  Target lesion is at the site of or within a vessel with a previously implanted stent.

          -  Target lesion is within a bypass graft conduit, or can only be reached by passing the
             study stent through a bypass graft conduit.

          -  Aortic dissection or mechanical complication of STEMI (papillary muscle rupture,
             ventricular septal defect or free wall rupture with or without pseudoaneurysm)
             identified by left ventriculography or any other modality (such as echocardiography,
             MRI, CT, physical exam).
