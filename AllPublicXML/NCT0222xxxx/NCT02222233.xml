             pioglitazone and repaglinide or CYP2C9 such as warfarin, tolbutamide, phenytoin,
             losartan, acenocoumarol within 1 month or six half lives (whichever is greater)

         22. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a
             QTc interval &gt;450 ms)
