    <measure>Bone Hole Condition</measure>
    <time_frame>over 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate Bone Hole Condition with score based on CT images. CT images are evaluated and scored by three evaluators who are MDs and independent of this study director.
Definitions of the score are described as below.
Type 1: Opened or enlarged
Type 2: Slightly closed (&lt;50%)
Type 3: Almost closed (&gt;=50%)
Type 4: Completely closed</description>

    <description>To evaluate Ossification with score based on CT images. CT images are evaluated and scored by three evaluators who are MDs and independent of this study director.
Definitions of the score are described as below.
Type 1: Little or no ossification
Type 2: Ossification fills some of the anchor site that is discontinuous or with a wide lucent rim
Type 3: Ossification fills most of the anchor site with a thin lucent rim. This area's density is consistent with cancellous bone
Type 4: Ossification fills the anchor site completely with an indistinct border between the anchor site and the adjacent cancellous bone</description>

    <time_frame>over 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the Japan Shoulder Society Shoulder Instability Score (JSS-SIS) and Rowe Score at 12 weeks after surgery
JSS-SIS Score (subscales are summed, higher values represent a better outcome):
Pain (0 to 20)
Function (0 to 20)
Range of Motion (0 to 20)
Evaluation of X-ray findings (0 to 10)
Stability (0 to 30)
Rowe Score (subscales are summed, higher values represent a better outcome):
Stability (0 to 50)
Motion (0 to 20)
Function (0 to 30)</description>
