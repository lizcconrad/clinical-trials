  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 was a randomized control trial that used a test-retest model to evaluate the impact
      of iLook Out for Child Abuse, an online, interactive learning module about reporting
      suspected child abuse. Delivered via a learning management system to early childhood
      professionals who work with infants and young children, this study assessed iLookOut's effect
      on 1) knowledge about reporting suspected child abuse; 2) attitudes toward reporting
      suspected child abuse; and 3) preparedness to protect children at risk.

      Findings from Phase 1 were that iLookOut will improved knowledge, changed attitudes, and
      increase self-reported preparedness of early childhood providers to report suspected child
      abuse.

      Phase 2 of this trial is an open-enrollment study that records pre-/post- data on the same
      measurements as Phase 1, and is available for use (free of charge) for all childcare
      providers in Pennsylvania at https://www.ilookoutforchildabuse.com.

      early childhood professionals' (ECPs') knowledge of, and attitudes towards, reporting of
      child abuse/neglect. This study:

        1. Evaluates the effectiveness of the online learning module, iLook Out for Child Abuse,
           created to train and inform early childhood providers about reporting suspected child
           abuse;

        2. Identifies early childhood providers' current knowledge regarding Pennsylvania law on
           mandated reporting of suspected child abuse;

        3. Explores the factors influencing early childhood providers' current knowledge and
           attitudes;

        4. Evaluates the impact of an online educational program on early childhood providers'
           knowledge, attitudes, and patterns of decision-making regarding mandated reporting of
           suspected child abuse;

        5. To explores the factors influencing the impact of an online educational program on early
           childhood providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding mandated reporting of suspected
           child abuse
