      Investigation of the mechanism of dipyridamole action in platelets in an in-vivo study with
      healthy volunteers treated Aggrenox in comparison with volunteers treated with Persantin
      Retard or Acetylsalicylic Acid using platelet Vasodilator-Stimulated-Phosphoprotein
      (VASP)-phosphorylation as indication for an action and measurements of dipyridamole plasma
      levels
