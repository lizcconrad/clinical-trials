      This is a proposal for a nested case‐control study within an ongoing rotavirus vaccine
      immunogenicity clinical trial Karachi, Pakistan. The primary study aim is to compare the
      fecal microbiota composition and diversity of infants who do (control) and do not (case)
      demonstrate immune seroconversion to rotavirus vaccination. The infants will be matched for
      vaccination dose, age and breast‐feeding practices.

        The study will be nested within an existing rotavirus immunogenicity study being conducted
        in Karachi, Pakistan (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01199874) . The physical setting is a
        peri‐urban slum outside of Karachi, primarily populated by fishermen. Parents and legal
        guardians of infants participating in NCT01199874 will provide new informed consent for
        inclusion in this study.
