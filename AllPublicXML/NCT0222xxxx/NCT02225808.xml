    <textblock>
      This is an open, pilot study of neural mechanisms of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety
      in children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition to the core
      symptoms, approximately forty percent of children with ASD exhibit clinically significant
      levels of anxiety. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment for anxiety in
      children with high-functioning ASD, but the neural mechanisms of this treatment have not been
      studied. CBT teaches emotion regulation skills such as cognitive reappraisal, followed by
      behavioral exposure to anxiety-provoking situations. The investigators propose to investigate
      the neural mechanisms of CBT for anxiety by evaluating fMRI indices of socioemotional
      functioning before and after treatment in children, ages 8 to 14, with high-functioning ASD.
      Dysfunction of the amygdala and its connectivity with prefrontal cortex has been implicated
      in co-occurring ASD and anxiety. In the investigators research, compared to typically
      developing controls, children with ASD have shown lower activation in several regions of
      prefrontal cortex and a lack of down-regulation in the amygdala during a task of emotion
      regulation. Based on these observations, the investigators propose that a positive response
      to CBT for anxiety in children with ASD will be associated with increased activation of
      several regions in the prefrontal cortex as well as increased functional connectivity between
      prefrontal regions the amygdala during the task of emotion regulation. The primary aim of
      this pilot study is to examine the effects of CBT on the neural basis of anxiety in ASD by
      collecting fMRI data during emotion regulation, face perception, and rest before and after
      treatment. The investigators hypothesize that CBT will increase prefrontal activity, decrease
      amygdala reactivity, and enhance amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity during emotion
      regulation. The investigators also hypothesize that CBT will decrease amygdala reactivity
      during perception of emotional faces. Additional analyses will be conducted to explore change
      in resting-state functional connectivity before and after CBT for anxiety in children with
      ASD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females, ages 8 to 14 inclusive.

          2. DSM-V diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

          3. DSM-V diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or
             social phobia.

          4. Score &gt; 19 on the 20 Item Anxiety scale of the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory.

          5. Full Scale IQ and Verbal IQ &gt; 70.

          6. Unmedicated or on stable medication for irritability, ADHD, anxiety, or depression for
             at least 6 weeks, with no planned changes for duration of study.

        7. Subjects will be free of metal medical implants, and will have a body weight of less
        than 250 lbs. and no claustrophobia. [These are necessitated by the safety requirements of
        the fMRI.]

        8. Child is an English speaker.

        9. Child is able to meet fMRI data quality requirements at baseline [to enable pre- to
        post-treatment comparison.]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a known serious medical condition in the child (based on medical history
             or parent report) that would interfere with child and parent's ability to participate
             in the study.

          2. Presence of a current psychiatric diagnosis in the child that would require
             alternative treatment (based on assessment by experienced study clinician).

          3. Previous treatment with four or more sessions of CBT for anxiety. -
