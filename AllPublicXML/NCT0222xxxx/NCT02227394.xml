  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a randomized, double blind, double dummy two-period crossover
      study in stable asthma patients treated in accordance with the Global Initiative for Asthma
      (GINA) guidelines, will be included.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the products under
      investigation on Functional respiratory imaging parameters and evaluate the particle
      deposition with Computational fluid dynamics (CFD).The secondary objectives of this study are
      to assess the effect of Z7200 and Symbicort® on lung function (spirometry and body
      plethysmography), on exercise capacity (6MWT)and on dyspnea (Borg CR10 Scale and VAS
      dyspnea). Furthermore the safety of the 2 products under investigation will be evaluated
      through monitoring of adverse events throughout the study.
