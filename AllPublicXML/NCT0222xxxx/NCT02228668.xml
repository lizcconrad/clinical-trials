  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the S-AVANT study is to collect additional data at 8 and 10 years median follow up
      of patients previously included in the AVANT trial from December 2004 to June 2007.

      Clinical data of the AVANT trial will be updated. Neither additional examination nor
      administration of any treatment will be performed on the patients.

      330 centers in 34 countries participated to the AVANT trial (Australia, Austria , Belgium,
      Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China/Hong-Kong, Czeck Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
      Hungary, Israël, Italy, Japan, Korean Republic, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
      Panama, Poland, Portugal, Russia Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
      Switzerland, Taïwan, Thaïland, United Kingdom, U.S.A).

      The AVANT study aiming at demonstrating superiority of bevacizumab in combination with
      FOLFOX-4 or XELOX compared to FOLFOX-4, did not show prolongation of DFS at 3 year when
      adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy in resected stage III colon cancer.

      Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of bevacizumab. However, more
      relapses and deaths due to disease progression have been observed in both bevacizumab arms.

      A more prolonged follow-up is necessary to assess overall survival and to evaluate long-term
      results and safety.

      Collection of additional follow-up data will start Q3 2014. Clinical data are to be collected
      at 8-year median follow-up (expected to be reached around Q2 2014) and at 10-year median
      follow-up (expected to be reached around Q2 2016).

      All analyses will be performed on an exploratory purpose only. An analysis at 8 years median
      follow-up and a final analysis at 10 years median follow-up will be performed in the main
      population (all randomized patients in the AVANT trial including patients lost to follow up
      or died).
