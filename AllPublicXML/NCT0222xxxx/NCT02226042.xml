    <textblock>
      This research will investigate the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying the eight-week
      Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) programme.

      Participants in remission from depression will be seen pre- and post-MBCT to assess the
      underlying neuropsychological mechanisms. All will be followed-up over 12 months to assess
      the relationship of these neuropsychological changes with relapse risk.

      The research will focus primarily on changes in self-compassion, rumination, attention and
      structural brain changes, with secondary focus on other mechanisms of emotional processing
      and memory.

      There will be three groups in total.

        -  The first group will take 36 participants in remission from major depression (rMDD)
           through the 8 week MBCT program.

        -  A control group of 36 rMDD participants will not receive the intervention.

        -  A group of never depressed healthy control participants will also be recruited.

      Research visits for participants not undergoing MBCT will be separated by an 8 week gap.

      All participants will be seen before and after the 8 weeks for completion of
      neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires.

      rMDD participants will be followed up over the following 12 months to identify any predictors
      of relapse.

    <description>MBCT: Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy is an 8 week group-based programme consisting of approximately 12 participants per group. There is also a full one day of practice around week 6. MBCT was initially designed for individuals in remission from depression and at risk of relapsing. The intervention is a mix of mindfulness meditation, cognitive behavioural therapy exercises and psychoeducation. MBCT has been shown to be effective in reducing relapse risk over 12 months.</description>
