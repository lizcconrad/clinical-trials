    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Viaskin Milk after 12
      months of epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) treatment, for desensitizing IgE-mediated cow's
      milk allergic children and to assess the long-term safety and treatment efffect of up to 48
      months of treatment with Viaskin Milk
