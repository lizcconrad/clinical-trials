      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of implementing a randomized
      controlled study of the intervention (Geriatric Assessment followed by an integrated care
      plan carried out by the multidisciplinary geriatric oncology team) designed to
      maintain/improve quality of life and functional status in older adults with advanced
      gastrointestinal, genitourinary or breast cancer referred for first line chemotherapy.

      Secondarily, the study will investigate the impact of the Geriatric Assessment on the cancer
      treatment decision of the cancer specialist.

      Introduction: A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can identify functional and
      psychosocial issues in older cancer patients, which in turn can inform interventions to
      prevent/postpone adverse outcomes and maintain/improve the functional status and well-being
      of this population. However, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been completed
      showing the evidence.

      OBJECTIVE - To explore the feasibility and impact of a CGA followed by an integrated care
      plan on quality of life and functional status for older adults with advanced breast,
      gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancer METHODS -

      A two-group parallel single-blind phase II RCT is enrolling 60 patients aged 70 or above,
      diagnosed with cancer, and starting first line chemotherapy at Princess Margaret Cancer
      Centre in Toronto. The randomization using sealed opaque envelopes is stratified by treatment
      intent (adjuvant versus palliative). The intervention entails a comprehensive CGA by a
      multidisciplinary geriatric oncology team followed by an integrated care plan to address any
      issues identified. Participants in the intervention group are seen at baseline for the CGA
      and for initiation of the integrated care plan, and again at 3 and 6 months to assess
      intervention fidelity and measure outcomes. The co-primary outcomes are: 1)
      maintaining/improvement in quality of life; 2) refining of cancer treatment plan. The
      secondary outcomes include: 1) Functional status; 2) feasibility of the study by tumor site.

      Recruitment has been completed November 2015

    <description>The treating oncologist will be asked to indicate the cancer treatment plan prior to receiving the geriatric assessment results using a survey previously used in the study of Dr. Alibhai et al (Am J Clin Oncol. 2012 Aug;35(4):322-8.).
After the GA the results will be send to the treating oncologist and after the physician will be asked to indicate whether or not and if yes how he/she modified the treatment plan based on the GA results</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of a Geriatric Assessment conducted by a multidisciplinary geriatric oncology team followed by an integrated care plan developed and implemented by the team for those issues identified in the assessment. The study intervention includes contact with the intervention team at 4 points in time during the study: at baseline (to conduct the assessment and develop the integrated care plan), 2-3 weeks by telephone after the clinic visit to evaluate if the plan needs adjustments, at 3 and 6 months (to evaluate the outcomes of the integrated care plan; i.e., did the patient follow all recommendations of the integrated care plan and did the plan lead to the desired outcomes for the problems identified?</description>
