  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of lenalidomide and
      obinutuzumab can help to control chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma
      (CLL/ SLL). The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and myelodysplastic
      syndromes (MDS). Lenalidomide is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) outside of controlled clinical trials.
      Obinutuzumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      It is investigational to give lenalidomide and obinutuzumab together to treat CLL or SLL. The
      study doctor can explain how the study drug(s) are designed to work.

      Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive obinutuzumab by
      vein over about 3-4 hours on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, and then on Day 1 of Cycles
      2-6.

      Starting on Day 9 of Cycle 1, you will take lenalidomide capsules by mouth 1 time each day.
      You should swallow your dose of lenalidomide whole with a glass (about 8 ounces) of water, at
      about the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. If you miss a dose of
      lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day only. Do not make up any doses
      of lenalidomide on the next day.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have to take lenalidomide more or less often and
      the dose you are taking may change. Your doctor will discuss this with you.

      Study Visits:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      Each week during Cycle 1 and during the first week of Cycle 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will
      be drawn for routine tests. After Cycle 2, this blood draw will happen every 14 or 28 days,
      depending on what the doctor thinks is needed.

      If you are able to become pregnant, at the beginning of each week of Cycle 1, blood (about 1
      teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. After Cycle 1, you will have this
      pregnancy test every 14 or 28 days, depending on what the doctor thinks is needed.

      On Day 1 (+/-10 days) of Cycles 2-6:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and to check
           your immune system.

      After Cycle 3, 6, 12, and every 6 cycles after that (Cycles 18, 24, 30, and so on), (+/-14
      days from Day 1 of subsequent cycle):

        -  You will have a physical exam

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and to check
           your immune system.

        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease, to
           check your immune system, for cytogenic testing, biomarker testing (including genetic
           biomarkers), and flow cytometry testing.

      At any time during the study, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have radiographic
      testing to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking lenalidomide for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You may receive up to 6 cycles of obinutuzumab. You will no longer be able to take
      the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.
