  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present trial is to demonstrate Magnetic stimulation as an useful
      complementary treatment in order to improve patients' evolution without the need of extensive
      surgical lesion.

      Patients with refractory post stroke upper right limb spasticity will operated by Median
      nerve or Median/ Cubital selective neurotomy depending upon more affected territories.

      Some of them could be also also operated with posterioris tibialis neurotomy to treat
      equine's foot whenever also clinically present. Preoperative motor blocks might be possitive
      in all cases.

      A week later, they will be treated by magnetic stimulation on selected antagonistic muscles,
      related to pre - operative affected ones, mostly deltoids, triceps and finger extensors with
      an equipment Dipol Zeta D5 (Russian Federation), with 1.5 tesla of intensity.

      Trials will be repeated twice a week in sessions of 30 minutes during 6 months with
      simultaneous intensive classic rehabilitation.

      Patients will be monthly evaluated by the mean score of Modified Ashworth Scale, related to
      fingers, wrist, elbow and shoulder and also with Barthel Scale.

    <description>- Surgery:
Selective Peripheral Neurotomy is surgical a method of section on suplying peripheral nerves of motor fascicles to relieve harmful spasticity. An intraoperative stimulation of motor fascicles is done, and those which abnormal spreading on far placed myotomes are more evident are chosen to be sectioned.</description>
