      Purpose: This aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with the modified FOLFOX6(mFOLFOX6) regimen and its impact on survival on a
      series in local advanced gastric cancer patients.

      Patients and methods: The study is a prospective non-randomized study. Patients with
      histopathologically confirmed and locally advanced gastric cancer(T2-T4 or N+) are enrolled
      in the study. Patients are given mFOLFOX6 scheme for 3 cycles.A radical gastrectomy and a D2
      lymphadenectomy was will be scheduled 3-6 weeks after the completion of the preoperative
      chemotherapy. Down-staging is assessed comparing pretreatment clinical staging with
      postoperative pathologic staging on patients who underwent radical surgery. Tumor
      down-staging and the grade of pathologic response are included in a statistical correlation
      between tumor regression induced by mFOLFOX6 neoadjuvant chemotherapy and survival.The
      primary endpoint is 3-year overall survival, secondary endpoints are disease-free survival,
      R0 resection rate, toxicity and prediction of response.
