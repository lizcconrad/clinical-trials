  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study conducted in the laboratory revealed the existence of a &quot;window&quot; during which
      patients with renal failure appreciate the protein-rich foods. This period, located
      immediately after the dialysis, is likely related to the purification of plasma products
      resulting from protein catabolism. It therefore appears necessary to understand the
      mechanisms that may explain these changes by measurements of ghrelin (orexigenic hormone),
      leptin (anorectic hormone) and plasma amino acids.

      In 24 patients with renal failure treated by hemodialysis, it is evaluated (at 8:00 am and at
      11:00 am), a day without hemodialysis and another day after the hemodialysis:

        -  Hunger sensation,

        -  Olfactory liking assessed separately for 6 foods (2 carbohydrate-, 2 fat- and 2
           protein-rich foods) and 2 non-alimentary products,

        -  Food wanting evaluated by the sequential presentation of 18 images of food (6 fat-, 6
           carbohydrate- and 6 protein-rich foods),

        -  Two blood samples for the assays of leptin, ghrelin, creatinine, albumin and pre-albumin
           as well as plasma amino acids.

           24 healthy subjects are also evaluated in order to compare the results from patients to
           those of control subjects.

    <description>The wanting is determined after the successive presentation (for ten seconds) of 18 pictures of food. For each food the question is &quot;at the present time, do you want to eat this food? &quot;. For each photo, subjects place a vertical line on a 10 cm horizontal line bounded at its ends by &quot;no desire&quot; and &quot;extremely envy&quot; (visual analog scale).The wanting for proteins is the mean score for the desire to eat protein-rich foods.</description>
