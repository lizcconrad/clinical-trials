             or during the trial

          -  Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial &lt;= 10 days prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug &lt;= 2 months days prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking during the period of the study
