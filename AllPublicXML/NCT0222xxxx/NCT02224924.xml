  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two methods that are currently used at the end of a
      CT guided lung biopsy to close the hole on the surface of the lung in order to minimize the
      chance of air leaking out of the hole. The two techniques consist of either injecting a very
      small amount of your the blood called a blood patch into the biopsy hole or injecting a
      gel-based FDA approved artificial plug called BioSentry that will eventually get absorbed
      into the body.

      This study will determine the rate of all pneumothoraces and those pneumothoraces requiring
      treatment following percutaneous lung biopsy in patients who have received ABPI or BioSentry
      at the end of the biopsy procedure. The data collected will be used to determine if there is
      equal effectiveness in the reduction of pneumothorax rates from both interventions.

    <description>If the patient was assigned to the ABPI group, a blood patch will be administered using the clotted blood in the syringe obtained at the beginning of the procedure. The guiding needle will be retracted up to 1.5-2 cm from the pleural surface, and the blood will be injected steadily and gently as the needle is pulled back out of the pleura. Injection will stop when the operator feels the needle is in subcutaneous tissues.</description>

    <description>If the patient is assigned to BioSentry group, using the manufacturer's deployment device the introducer needle is positioned so that the tip is at least 1.5 cm deep to the visceral pleura. The coaxial introducer needle hub will be prehydrated with a drop of saline, the BioSentry plug housing will be mated and locked to the hub and the plug will be deployed.</description>
