  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total joint patients have poor outcomes with infection since they are having permanent
      hardware implanted. Infection prevention in this group is therefore critical and a major
      source of discussion in both the orthopedic and anesthesia literature.

      Hypothermia has been shown to increase the risk of infection and blood loss. However, studies
      have not examined when in the operation or how fast patients temperatures drop. This study
      will observe how patients' temperatures change during total joint arthroplasty. By
      identifying when body temperature changes occur, prevention strategies may be developed and
      implemented.
