    <textblock>
      A lead-in cohort of ~20 patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis previously treated
      with 1 or more Janus kinase inhibitors enrolled to single-agent glasdegib to evaluate safety
      and tolerability. Following the lead-in, a phase 2, double blind, 2-arm study, randomized 2:1
      to oral single-agent glasdegib versus placebo in 201 patients resistant or intolerant to
      ruxolitinib.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving SVR ≥35% as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Computed Tomography Scan at Week 24 in the Lead-in Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>MRI (CT scan may have been permitted if MRI was contraindicated) of the spleen and the liver was performed at baseline, then every 12 weeks while the participant was on treatment. The same method of assessment used at baseline was used for the duration of the trial to ensure consistency. Spleen volume was assessed by a central, independent blinded reader.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving ≥50% Reduction From Baseline in Total Symptom Score (TSS) as Measured by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm-Symptom Assessment Diary (MPN-SAD) at Week 24 in the Lead-in Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MPN-SAD assessed the impact of 9 myelofibrosis symptoms, at their worst, over the past 7 days and over the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The 9 symptoms are early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, night sweats, pruritus, bone pain, pain below the ribs on the left-hand side, fatigue and shortness of breath. The TSS is the sum of the individual scores, excluding inactivity and shortness of breath. The TSS at Week 24 is the average of the daily total scores from the last 28 days of symptom scores immediately prior to Week 24. A higher score indicates worse symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Anemia Response (Transfusion Dependent Versus Independent) in the Lead-in Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Anemia response was defined as transfusion-independent participants with a ≥20 gram per liter (g/L) increase in hemoglobin (Hb) level where baseline Hb level was &lt;100 g/L, or baseline transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion-independent post-baseline. Transfusion dependency before the start of study treatment was defined as transfusions of ≥6 units of packed red blood cells in the 12 weeks prior to start of study treatment, for a final pre-treatment Hb of &lt;85 g/L. In addition, the most recent transfusion episode must have occurred in the 28 days prior to study enrollment. Response in transfusion-dependent patients required absence of any packed red blood cell transfusions during any consecutive rolling 12-week interval during the treatment phase, capped by a Hb level of ≥85 g/L.</description>

    <time_frame>Cycle 1, Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax was the highest plasma concentration of glasdegib observed directly from the plasma concentration data. Cmin was the lowest plasma concentration of glasdegib observed directly from the plasma concentration data. Cavg was the average concentration at steady state estimated using non-compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.</description>

    <description>AUCtau was the area under the glasdegib plasma concentration-time profile from time zero to the end of the dosing interval (24 hours) estimated by non-compartmental PK analysis using the linear/log trapezoidal method.</description>

    <measure>Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) in the Lead-in Cohort</measure>

        <description>The MPN-SAD assessed the impact of 9 myelofibrosis symptoms, at their worst, over the past 7 days and over the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The 9 symptoms are early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, night sweats, pruritus, bone pain, pain below the ribs on the left-hand side, fatigue and shortness of breath. The TSS is the sum of the individual scores, excluding inactivity and shortness of breath. The TSS at Week 24 is the average of the daily total scores from the last 28 days of symptom scores immediately prior to Week 24. A higher score indicates worse symptoms.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Anemia Response (Transfusion Dependent Versus Independent) in the Lead-in Cohort</title>
        <description>Anemia response was defined as transfusion-independent participants with a ≥20 gram per liter (g/L) increase in hemoglobin (Hb) level where baseline Hb level was &lt;100 g/L, or baseline transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion-independent post-baseline. Transfusion dependency before the start of study treatment was defined as transfusions of ≥6 units of packed red blood cells in the 12 weeks prior to start of study treatment, for a final pre-treatment Hb of &lt;85 g/L. In addition, the most recent transfusion episode must have occurred in the 28 days prior to study enrollment. Response in transfusion-dependent patients required absence of any packed red blood cell transfusions during any consecutive rolling 12-week interval during the treatment phase, capped by a Hb level of ≥85 g/L.</description>
