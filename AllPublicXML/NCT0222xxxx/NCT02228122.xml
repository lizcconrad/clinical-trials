      The purpose of the research is to assess the effects of Aquacel Ag+ Extra dressing on chronic
      wound bacterial biofilms

      Background: Chronic wounds and wound infections can be costly, resulting in prolonged
      hospital stays and an increased risk of secondary infection and septicaemia. In the UK the
      management of chronic venous leg ulcers is estimated to cost £1 billion/year, with surgical
      site infections requiring approximately 6.5 days additional hospital stay. Chronic wounds
      typically harbour a wide variety of bacteria; heavy bacterial colonisation and subsequent
      biofilm formation has been cited as a factor which induces a chronic inflammatory state and
      delays healing times.

      AQUACEL®Ag+ Extra is a soft conformable flat sheet nonwoven fabric dressing, which forms a
      gel when it becomes wet. Its physical characteristics have the potential to increase the
      speed of antimicrobial action of silver and its effectiveness against any recalcitrant wound
      bioburden. Removing these potential barriers to healing may help towards wound progression.

      Aim: This is a pilot study to investigate the effects of Aquacel Ag+ Extra dressing on
      chronic wound bacterial biofilms. Wound debridement tissue will be assessed for the
      presence/absence of in situ biofilms which will be monitored over 4 weeks and compared to the
      baseline (non-treatment) sample. Additionally, we will evaluate reductions in wound volume
      over the treatment period.
