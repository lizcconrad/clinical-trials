      The purpose of this study is to determine if two different dosing strategies for evacetrapib
      will have essentially the same effect on the body. The study will also explore the effect of
      a low fat meal on how the body absorbs evacetrapib. This study will last at least 15 weeks,
      not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the date of first
      dosing.
