      Study to establish the relative bioavailability of the TPV oral solution formulation (500 mg
      coadministered with RTV oral solution 200 mg) to the TPV capsule formulation (500 mg
      coadministered with RTV capsules 200 mg), with both treatments at steady-state under fasted
      and fed conditions in healthy male and female volunteers.

         11. Subjects who have taken (within 7 days prior to Day 0) any over-the-counter or
             prescription medication that, in the opinion of the investigator in consultation with

         14. Known elevated liver enzymes in past trials with any compound

         15. Known allergy to nuts or nut products (A spoonful of peanut or hazelnut butter was
