    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare two community-level strategies: either selective,
      early administration of 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol to women for secondary prevention of
      postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) or universal use of 600 mcg oral misoprostol at the time of
      delivery for prophylaxis of PPH. The significance of this cluster randomized non-inferiority
      trial is its potential to inform service delivery programs on clinical outcomes, program
      feasibility, cost, and acceptability of two different community models of PPH care using
      misoprostol.1. The study hypothesizes that a service delivery model that administers
      misoprostol for secondary prevention is non-inferior to a model that administers misoprostol
      for universal prophylaxis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean drop in pre- to post-delivery hemoglobin level</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-delivery hemoglobin will be measured during a third trimester antenatal care visit or during early labor. Post-delivery hemoglbin will be measured 2 to 4 days after delivery of the baby.</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin will be measured by primary health unit staff using a portable handheld Hemocue machine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women transferred to higher level care</measure>
    <time_frame>Following delivery to postpartum visit (2 to 4 days after delivery)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of women transferred to higher level care will be assessed. Includes the condition of woman at time of transfer and arrival at transfer facility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women diagnosed with PPH</measure>
    <time_frame>After delivery of the baby up to 24 hours postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>PPH will be diagnosed using the standard practices of PHU staff</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women receiving additional interventions for PPH</measure>
    <time_frame>Following delivery to postpartum visit (2 to 4 days after delivery)</time_frame>
    <description>An additional intervention could include: uterotonics, manual removal of placental fragments. bimanual compression, IV fluids given to control active bleeding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women who experience side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of delivery to 2 hours postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Women experiencing known side effects of misoprostol, including shivering/chills and pyrexia; severity, duration, and any additional care provided will be assessed</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women who find the intervention acceptable</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at postpartum visit (2 to 4 days after delivery)</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be assessed in an exit interview with women - women will be asked if they are willing to take misoprostol in future deliveries and about the preferences what method they would prefer (primary or secondary prevention) in future deliveries.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women who receive intervention per protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 hours of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>To assess feasibility, we will document the proportion of women for whom the intervention arm protocol is correctly followed (including correct timing of drug administration, when necessary).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of women experiencing a serious adverse event</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 to 4 days after delivery</time_frame>
