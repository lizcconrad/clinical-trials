    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the potential effect of the moderate CYP3A inducer
      modafinil and the weak CYP3A inducer pioglitazone on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time [AUC (0 - 8)]</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <measure>Plasma Palbociclib Decay Half-Life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) of Palbociclib</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of Palbociclib</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
