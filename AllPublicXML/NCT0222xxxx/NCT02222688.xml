  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety of the investigational agent,
      cirmtuzumab. Cirmtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody drug designed to attach to a protein,
      called ROR1, on the surface of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to block cell growth
      and survival. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells so the idea is to preferentially get
      rid of the cancer cells. Although there is evidence in laboratory animals that cirmtuzumab
      can decrease the number of CLL cells, the investigators do not know if this will work in
      humans. This drug will be given to humans for the first time in this study. Therefore, the
      goal of this study is to see if cirmtuzumab is safe and tolerated in study participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, open-label single institution, Phase I dose escalation study of in
      patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Treatment cycle (14 days) will consist of UC-961
      administered intravenously on a bi-weekly (every two weeks) schedule for a total of 4 doses.
      Eight dose cohorts (of 3 to 6 patients in size) plus an expansion cohort of 6 patients are
      planned. In the first 3 dose cohorts, there is intra-patient dose escalation to monitor for
      acute toxicities, such as tumor lysis syndrome.

      A cycle may be repeated every 14 days if the patient has at least stable disease by clinical
      examination (or interim response assessment) and has again met hematologic, renal, and
      hepatic laboratory parameters as defined in the eligibility section, and is without ongoing
      Grade 3 non-hematologic or Grade 4 hematologic toxicities attributable to UC-961. The total
      duration of study drug administration is 4 cycles. Each cycle consists of clinical and
      laboratory evaluation on Day 1 and safety assessments on Days 3 and 8.

             population with immunophenotype consistent with CLL

          -  Relapsed or refractory disease, defined by failure to achieve a partial response
             within 6 months of initiation of therapy, or a 50% increase of baseline disease
             measurements after achieving a clinical response.

          -  Prior Therapy: Must have progressed after purine-analog or alkylator based therapy, or
