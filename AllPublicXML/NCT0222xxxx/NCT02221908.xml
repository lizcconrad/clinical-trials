    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess decision making skills of emergency physicians when
      dealing with hypotensive patients. The hypothesis is that decisions made based on physical
      exam and vital signs regarding fluid resuscitation by emergency physicians are not
      statistically equivalent to those that would be made based on the use of a non-invasive CVP
      measurement

    <textblock>
      If physicians can make appropriate decisions about the need for fluid resuscitation without
      CVP measurement, then this skill is worth being passed to physicians in training. Previously
      it was not possible gather enough information about the response of patients' because of the
      risk of using indwelling CVP sensors. But now because there is a low risk tool (Venus 1000
      System), this study is now practical and safe.
