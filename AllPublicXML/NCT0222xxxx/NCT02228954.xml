    <textblock>
      Rationale. In part of the patients with good and intermediate risk metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma (mRCC) the disease course is indolent and immediate start of systemic therapy is
      not necessary. By now, the investigators are not able to identify those patients with
      indolent disease and the minor group of patients with rapidly progressive disease. In
      patients with indolent disease, a watchful waiting period is preferred, since their quality
      of life will not be unnecessary hampered by adverse events and therapy resistance is not
      induced. This study aims to identify those patients for whom a watchful waiting period is
      possible by molecular imaging. Furthermore several types of systemic therapy are possible
      once the progression is proven. These systemic treatments are comparable in terms of
      efficacy, but not in terms of toxicity and their impact on quality of life. As a secondary
      objective, the usefulness of a decision aid guiding the choice of the patients is studied.

      Objectives.

      To assess in patients with good or intermediate prognosis mRCC who are eligible for watchful
      waiting, the added value beyond clinical work-up of:

        1. FDG-PET and 89Zr-girentuximab-PET results measured at presentation to predict rapid
           progression (≤ 2 months after the baseline scan) under watchful waiting.

        2. FDG-PET and 89Zr-girentuximab-PET results measured at presentation to predict prolonged
           indolent (≥12 months after the baseline scan) disease under watchful waiting.

      To assess the value of a therapy choice decision aid for patients with progressive disease.

      Study design. This is a multicenter non-blinded prospective observational study in 80 good
      and intermediate prognosis mRCC patients.

      Study population. Patients with good or intermediate prognosis mRCC according to the Heng
      criteria, ≥18 years, without contra-indications for a watchful waiting period, able to
      provide informed consent.

      Intervention. At baseline an FDG-PET-CT and 89Zr-girentuximab-PET will be made. During the
      watchful waiting period, disease evaluation by CT according to the RECIST criteria will be
      made frequently, until established progressive disease. At that moment, a second FDG-PET-CT
      and, in case of a positive 89Zr-girentuximab-PET-scan at baseline, a second
      89Zr-girentuximab-PET will be performed and the decision aid is used to help the patient to
      choose their best treatment out of four options; pazopanib, sunitinib, combined interferon-α
      with bevacizumab and (only in case of a positive 89Zr-girentuximab-PET) radioimmunotherapy
      (RIT) with 177lutetium labelled girentuximab. Participation in the RIT trial is part of a
      separate phase II study.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness.

      At baseline, a 18F-FDG-PET-CT and 89Zr-Girentuximab-PET will be performed. During the
      watchful waiting period CT's will be made. During therapy, follow-up will include standard
      laboratory analysis, and CT-scans on regular visits to the outpatient clinic. Side effects of
      the medication and adverse events as a consequence of the tumor biopsies may occur. The
      radiation exposure of both PET investigations is acceptable and requires no shielding after
      injection of 89Zr-labelled girentuximab. Patients may benefit from disease regression or
      stabilization. All three treatment choices has proven clinical benefit in this patient
      population. The risks of participation into the RIT trial are described in the phase II trial
      protocol, which already has been judged by the Medical Ethics Review Committee.
