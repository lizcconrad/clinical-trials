    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema refers to swelling (fluid accumulation) in the center of the retina.
      The retina is like the film of a camera and is located in the back of the eye. This condition
      can develop in diabetics where swelling results from leaking of fluid from the blood vessels
      of the eye, into the center of the retina, the macula. If left untreated, this can affect
      central vision. The current standard treatment for diabetic macular edema includes
      medications injected directly into the eye (intravitreal injections) and laser eye treatment.
      The drugs that are injected directly into the eye are known as anti-Vascular Endothelial
      Growth Factor (anti-VEGF) agents which help to reduce the leaking. This includes bevacizumab
      (Avastin®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®).

      However, some patients do not respond well to these anti-VEGF treatments will be given the
      option of switching to an another class of medications, called steroids. Triamcinolone
      acetonide is one of these steroids and is also injected directly into the eye. These steroids
      will help reduce inflammation and possibly as a consequence, reduce swelling in the eye.

      The purpose of this study is to determine what cellular factors affect a patient's treatment
      response (amount of swelling reduction) following triamcinolone acetonide intravitreal
      injections for diabetic macular edema.
