  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with prostate cancer and a history of cardiovascular disease treated with degarelix
      for their prostate cancer, will be followed for a period of one year. In this real-life,
      non-interventional trial, any cardiovascular events occurring during degarelix therapy will
      be documented.
