    <textblock>
      LOP628 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of an anti-cKit humanized IgG1/Îº
      antibody conjugated to a maytansine payload via a non-cleavable linker.

      LOP628 provides an opportunity to target cKit overexpressing tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For patients with solid tumors:

          -  documented cKit-positive neoplasms

          -  Patient must have progressive disease as defined by any of the following:

          -  SCLC: patient has progressed after at least 1 prior therapy

          -  GIST : patient has relapsed or has refractory disease, and no further approved
             effective therapeutic option exists

          -  Patients with other cKit-positive solid tumors: patient has progressed after at least
             one prior line of therapy and no further approved effective therapeutic option exists

          -  Patient has measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 criteria

        For patients with AML:

          -  documented cKit-positive acute myelogenous leukemia

          -  Consent to newly obtained bone marrow aspirate

          -  Patient must have progressive disease defined as relapsed or refractory non-PML AML
             following standard therapy or for whom no effective therapy exists.

          -  Blast count &lt; 50,000/mm3

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For patients with solid tumors:

          -  Patient has central nervous system (CNS) metastatic involvement unless the CNS
             metastases have been previously treated and the patient is clinically stable and on a
             stable dose of corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patient has the presence of other clinically significant hematologic, cardiac,
             respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or neurological conditions.

          -  Patient has a history of serious allergic reactions, which in the opinion of the
             investigator may pose an increased risk of serious infusion reactions

          -  Patient has been previously treated with cKit directed antibodies

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

        For patients with AML:

          -  Patient has received prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT).

          -  Patient has the presence of other clinically significant cardiac, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or neurological disease

          -  Patient has a history of serious allergic reactions, which in the opinion of the
             investigator may pose an increased risk of serious infusion reactions

          -  Patient has been previously treated with cKit directed antibodies

          -  Pregnant or nursing women
