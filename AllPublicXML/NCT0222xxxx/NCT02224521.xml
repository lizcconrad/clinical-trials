    <textblock>
      GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that reduces
      inflammation in cells.

      This study will evaluate three capsule and two tablet formulations to select the optimal
      formulation for further development. Safety will be assessed through clinical laboratory
      testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs and Adverse Event/ Serious Adverse
      Event (AE/ SAE) recording.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that
      attenuates the production of leukotrienes, through the blockage of the first committed step
      in the leukotriene pathway, 5 lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation. Leukotrienes are potent
      inflammatory molecules produced mainly by mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophage and
      neutrophils in response to allergic or inflammatory stimuli.

      Clinical studies conducted to date with GSK2190915 have utilised an aqueous formulation of
      the compound. However, to progress the compound further in clinical development, a solid dose
      formulation is necessary. This study will evaluate the optimal capsule formulation from a
      selection of three available capsule formulations, and a dose, that can be taken forward for
      future clinical development. Since it is expected that the compound will be developed for
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the study will also include a repeat-dose
      cohort with elderly subjects (smokers and non-smokers over 65 years of age) in order to
      evaluate the repeat-dose derived pharmacokinetic parameters of the selected capsule
      formulation in this population.

      This is a multi-cohort study and upto 6 cohorts will be performed.

      In cohort 1, the bioavailability of single doses of 50 milligrammes (50 mg) of three capsule
      formulations (capsule formulations A, B and C) in the fasted state will be assessed.
      Depending on the bioavailability data obtained from cohort 1, one, two or three capsule
      formulations may be taken forward into cohort 2.

      If only one formulation is deemed to be suitable for progression, cohort 2 will be a
      single-dose, 4-way complete crossover study to investigate both food-effect and dose
      proportionality in 10 healthy adult subjects. The decision to progress this formulation to
      the final (repeat-dose) cohort (cohort 4) will be made based on favourable food interaction
      and proportionality in bioavailability between high and low doses in cohort 2.

      If more than one capsule formulation fulfils the bioavailability criteria following cohort 1,
      cohort 2 will be a food-effect study with a 100mg single dose of two or three selected
      capsule formulations in healthy adult subjects. Progression to Cohort 3 will be dependent on
      the formulation/s meeting predetermined pharmacokinetic (PK) criteria. Cohort 3 will be a
      complete crossover study with single doses of 20mg and 200mg of each of upto two capsule
      formulations taken forward from cohort 2 in 10 healthy adult subjects in the fasted state.
      The aim of performing this cohort is to explore the dose proportionality between low and high
      doses of the two selected capsule formulations.

      Cohort 4 is a 12-day repeat-dose, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 12 healthy
      elderly subjects (&gt;65 years) in the fed or fasted state with once-daily dosing of the highest
      dose (200mg) of the capsule formulation (A, B or C) taken forward from the previous cohorts.
      The aim of this cohort is to investigate the accumulation of the selected formulation during
      repeat dosing.

      Cohort 5 will be a 4-way complete crossover study with single doses of 100mg of two tablet
      formulations (milled and micronised) administered to healthy volunteers in the fed and fasted
      states. The aim of performing this cohort is to explore the single-dose pharmacokinetics of
      the two tablet formulations with a view to assessing their suitability for use in subsequent
      late- phase studies.

      Cohort 6 will be a 4-way complete crossover study with single doses of 100mg of two modified
      tablet formulations (different from Cohort 5 formulations) administered to healthy volunteers
      in the fed and fasted states. The aim of performing this cohort is to explore the single-dose
      pharmacokinetics of the two modified tablet formulations with a view to assessing their
      suitability for use in subsequent late- phase studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR COHORTS 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of this study only if
        all of the following criteria apply:

          1. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and
             bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times Upper Limit of Normal, ULN (isolated
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             less than 35 percent).

          2. Healthy as determined by the Investigator, based on a medical evaluation including
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and Electrocardiogram (ECG). A
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and
             the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study objectives.

          3. Male or female (of non child-bearing potential) between 18 and 65 years of age
             inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

             A female subject is eligible to participate only if she is of:

             •Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation (in which case the male partner should use an acceptable form of
             contraception as specified in section 8.1) or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined
             as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with
             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 million international units,
             MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 picogrammes per millilitre (less than 140 picomoles
             per litre) is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods
             in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.]

          4. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 5 terminal half-lives post-last dose.

          5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        6.12 lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormality as judged by the Investigator,
        and QTc intervals corrected for Bazett ror Fredericia (QTcB and QTcF) less than450
        milliseconds (msec)

        7.Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kilogrammes (kg) (110 pounds, lbs) for men and
        greater than or equal to 45 kg (99 lbs) for women and Body Mass Index, BMI within the range
        18-30 kilogrammes per squared metre (kg/m2) inclusive.

        8.Non-smokers only- Negative urine cotinine test at screening, no history of smoking within
        6 months of the start of the study, and with a total pack year history of less than or
        equal to 1 pack years.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR COHORT 4

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in cohort 4 of this study only if all of the
        following criteria apply:

          1. Healthy as determined by the Investigator, based on a medical evaluation including
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, ECG and Holter assessment at
             screening. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study objectives. A
             subject with a well controlled or mild medical condition (eg controlled hypertension,
             hypothyroidism adequately treated with replacement therapy, mild chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring short acting bronchodilators only) may be included
             only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the condition is
             unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             objectives.

          2. Male or female (of non child-bearing potential) over 65 years of age inclusive, at the
             time of signing the informed consent.

          2. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          3. Significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, gastrointestinal or other conditions
             that in the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK medical monitor, places the subject

          5. A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          6. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of greater than 21 units for males or less than14 units for
             females. One unit is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1
             glass (125 ml) of wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits.

          7. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 3 months or 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          8. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          9. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

         10. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

         11. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

         12. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine human Chorionic
             Gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing.

             pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices from 7 days prior
             to the first dose of study medication.

         17. For non-smokers only - urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or
             regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to
             screening.

         18. Blood pressure persistently greater than 150 over 90 (150/90) millimetres of mercury
             (mmHg) at screening.
