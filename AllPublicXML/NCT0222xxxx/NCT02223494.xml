        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who

          -  completed the preceding primary pulmonary hypertension, double-blinded clinical trial
             of terbogrel (protocol 528.19)

          -  provide informed consent to participate in this trial

          -  are in a stable or improving medical condition, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  enter the study immediately upon their completion of the preceding double-blind Trial
             528.19, or enter the study within one month of completing the preceding trial as long
             as their medical condition has remained stable or continues to improve in the interim

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Development of an unstable medical condition during or following completion of the
             preceding clinical trial which, in the investigator's opinion, may be worsened by
             treatment with terbogrel

          -  Premature discontinuation of the preceding terbogrel clinical trial due to an adverse
             event or for any other reason

          -  Pregnant or nursing women, or women of childbearing potential (less than one year
             postmenopausal or not surgically sterilized) who are not using adequate methods of
