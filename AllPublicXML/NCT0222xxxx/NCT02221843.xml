  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sunbit is a new wearable UV dosimeter to measure solar radiation in real time. The purpose of
      this study is to track sun behavior of patients at high risk for skin cancer, to investigate
      the feasibility of this prototype in daily life and to investigate the technical accuracy of
      the Sunbit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 20 patients will be included to wear the Sunbit system during the time of 4 weeks.
      After this 4 weeks Sunbit will be recollected and data in the form of UV Indices will be
      extracted and analyzed.

      Patients will be recruited in the Department of Dermatology of the University Hospital
      Zürich. The target population comprises patients with a high risk of melanoma and
      non-melanoma skin cancer, thus especially patients with an immunosuppressive therapy due to
      organ transplantation.
