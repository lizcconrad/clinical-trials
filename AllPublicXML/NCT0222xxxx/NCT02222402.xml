  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PEDAL study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a 9-month intradialytic exercise
      training intervention designed to improve quality of life (QOL) and alleviate functional
      limitations in patients with stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) who are on haemodialysis.
      Exercise rehabilitation will be compared against established treatment options available
      within UK NHS haemodialysis (HD) units. A qualitative substudy will also investigate the
      experience and acceptability of the intervention for both participants and members of the
      renal care team. In addition, we want to examine whether this type of additional exercise
      treatment is cost effective within the health service setting.

      PEDAL is designed as a multi centre randomised clinical trial (RCT) and will recruit 380
      adult patients who have been on HD for at least 3 months, from 10 HD sites located in
      Scotland, England and Wales. The type of exercise programming will consist of cycling
      exercise performed during each dialysis session plus a muscle conditioning programme
      performed twice per week. All exercise sessions will be supervised by a physiotherapy
      assistant. The exercise prescription will be individualised for all patients on the basis of
      their fitness and clinical status.

      The main objective is to examine the impact of exercise rehabilitation on quality of life and
      well being of patients. We hypothesise that the exercise training delivered during
      haemodialysis treatment will significantly improve the functional limitations/abilities of
      the patients leading to the detection of clinically beneficial improvement in quality of life
      outcome, as measured by the KDQOL-36 physical composite score (PCS) at the primary end point.

    <description>Using a modified cycle ergometer, aerobic exercise will be performed in a semi-recumbent position, 3 times per week during the first two hours of haemodialysis. The initial prescription will be set in the moderate intensity range of 40-60% of peak aerobic capacity, progressing to 75% level by the end of the intervention.
Twice per week patients will also complete lower extremity muscular conditioning exercise, using ankle weights, after the aerobic cycling exercise.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prevalent Stage 5 CKD patients (GFR &lt;15 mL/min) receiving maintenance haemodialysis
             therapy for more than 3 months

          2. Male or female

          3. Aged &gt;18 years

          4. Able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients unlikely to be on HD for &gt; 6 months - (this includes cachectic patients,
             those with severe heart failure, patients in whom dialysis withdrawal is being
             considered, and patients likely to receive a live-donor transplant or transfer to PD
             in that period of time);

          2. Less than 3 months after the initiation of haemodialysis (patients in this time-frame
             are generally less clinically stable, many having vascular access procedures
             performed, and rates of inter-current events, including death and hospitalisation, are
             very much higher in the first 3 months after commencement of chronic haemodialysis);

          3. Deemed to be clinically unstable by treating physician;

          4. Dementia or severe cognitive impairment (as will be unable to give consent and/or
             complete questionnaire assessments);

          5. Severe psychiatric disorders - except treated stable
