  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe to give nintedanib in
      combination with cisplatin and docetaxel before surgery to patients with NSCLC. Researchers
      also want to learn if the drug combination can help to control NSCLC before surgery.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 2 groups of up to 6 participants will be
      enrolled in the Run-In Phase of the study, and up to 33 participants will be enrolled in the
      Expansion Phase.

      If you are enrolled in the Run-In Phase, the dose of nintedanib you receive will depend on
      when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive a dose level of
      nintedanib. If no intolerable side effects are seen, a second group will be enrolled at a
      higher dose level. If intolerable side effects are seen, a group will be enrolled at a lower
      dose level.

      If you are enrolled in the Expansion Phase, you will receive nintedanib at the highest dose
      that was tolerated in the Run-In Phase.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of cisplatin and docetaxel.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Run-In Phase:

      You will receive cisplatin over 2 hours and docetaxel over 1 hour by vein on Day 1 of each
      21-day study cycle. You will take nintedanib by mouth every day from Day 2 of Cycle 1 through
      Day 7 of Cycle 3, except for the days that you receive cisplatin and docetaxel.

      Expansion Phase:

      You will take capsules of nintedanib by mouth every day for a 28 day priming cycle (Cycle 0).
      You will then receive cisplatin over 2 hours and docetaxel over 1 hour by vein on Day 1 of
      each 21-day study cycle. You will take nintedanib by mouth every day from Day 2 of Cycle 1
      through Day 7 of Cycle 3, except for the days that you receive cisplatin and docetaxel.

      All Patients:

      You should take capsules of nintedanib with about a cup (8 ounces) of water. Swallow the
      capsules whole and do not chew them. If you take nintedanib 2 times daily, you should take
      the drug about 12 hours apart each time.

      If you miss a dose, wait and take the next scheduled dose when it is due.

      You will then have surgery at least 21 days after the last dose of nintedanib, unless the
      study doctor thinks it is not in your best interest.

      Study Visits:

      If you are in the Expansion Phase, on Day 28 of Cycle 0:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and for biomarker testing.

        -  You will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      Within 7 days before Cycles 2 and 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and for biomarker testing.

      About 14 days after your last cycle of chemotherapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and for biomarker testing.

        -  You will have a PET/CT and CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      Some blood draws and/or imaging scans may need to be performed more frequently if certain
      side effects (such as those affecting the liver) occur.

      Surgery:

      Between 3 and 5 weeks after you stop taking the study drugs, you will have surgery to remove
      the disease. You will sign a separate consent form that explains the procedure, as well as
      its risks and benefits.

      During surgery, tissue samples that are removed will be collected and stored in a research
      tissue bank at MD Anderson for use in future biomarker research and other research related to
      cancer.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the study drugs for up to 3 cycles, followed by surgery. You will no longer
      be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur,
      or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your active participation on the study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 8 weeks after you have surgery, the following tests and procedures will be performed,
      you will have a physical exam and blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker
      testing.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After the end-of-treatment visit, your medical record will be reviewed or you will be called,
      contacted in writing, or e-mailed to check on your health status. If you are called, these
      calls should last about 5 minutes. You may also be asked these questions during regularly
      scheduled clinic visits. The follow-up period will last for as long as the study doctor
      thinks the information is needed.

      This is an investigational study. Docetaxel and cisplatin are FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of NSCLC. Nintedanib is commercially available and FDA approved
      for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (a type of lung disease). Its use in this
      study is investigational.

      Up to 45 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>Major pathologic response defined as less than or equal to 10% viable tumor cells in the resected specimen using the methods described by Pataer. At least 1 section per cm of tumor greatest diameter evaluated, with a minimum of 5 slides. Percentage of residual tumor determined by comparing estimated cross sectional area of viable tumor foci to estimated cross sectional areas of necrosis, fibrosis and inflammation on each slide.

    <description>A Bayesian method used to monitor toxicity in the perioperative phase. Unacceptable toxicity defined as: death during neoadjuvant treatment or within 30 days after surgery; development of broncho-pleural fistula; wound healing delays that require management with a major surgical procedure; wound infections that require intravenous antibiotic use for more than 14 days; re-operation for bleeding or infection; empyema; stroke or myocardial infarction within 30 days after surgery; any surgical complication that is considered major by treating physician and possibly, probably or definitely related to Cisplatin, Docetaxel and/or Nintedanib.
