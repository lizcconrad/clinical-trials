      The aim of the present registry is to characterize and follow patients prospectively and
      retrospectively with renal impairment who have been prescribed apixaban for the prevention of
      stroke in atrial fibrillation, with a comparison to the characteristics and outcomes
      associated with warfarin therapy in this population.

    <textblock>
      Current guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) recommend the
      use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with non-valvular AF .Renal dysfunction
      has been shown to be an independent predictor of stroke or systemic emboli, but the risk of
      bleeding with conventional warfarin therapy is also significantly increased.Prevalence of
      renal dysfunction in patients with atrial fibrillation is high, with approximately 60% of
      patients having an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of â‰¤ 60 ml/min/BSA [6].NOACs
      undergoing significant renal secretion such as dabigatran are not recommended for patients
      with severe renal impairment, and dose adjustment are indicated for patients with milder
      degrees of renal dysfunction.However, real-world information regarding the usage and outcomes
      associated with NOAC therapy in patients with renal dysfunction are limited. The
      investigators plan to prospectively and retrospectively collect data regarding the clinical
      settings, characteristics, and outcomes of patients with renal dysfunction who have been
      prescribed apixaban in Israel, using a multicenter secure web-based registry.
