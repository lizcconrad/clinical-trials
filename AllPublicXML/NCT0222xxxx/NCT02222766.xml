  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic has spared no age group, including our youngest children. My and others'
      formative research shows that ethnically-diverse, low-income parents of young children are
      enthusiastic about learning general parenting skills, such as discipline strategies, but less
      interested in nutrition and physical activity. To capitalize on this enthusiasm, I will
      create and test an intervention that embeds strategies to improve child weight-related
      behaviors within a general skills parenting program.

      The overall goal of this study is to assess Parents and Tots Together (PTT), a family-based
      intervention to prevent obesity among children age 2 through 5 years. To achieve this goal,
      my colleagues and I will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among ethnically
      diverse, primarily low-income families. Our specific aims are to:

        1. Determine the extent to which the intervention, compared with a control condition,
           results in a smaller age-associated increase in body mass index (BMI) among children
           after a 3- month intervention and a 9-month follow-up period (primary outcome).

        2. Determine the extent to which the intervention, compared with a control condition,
           results in:

             1. Improved parent general parenting behaviors, i.e., increased use of positive
                discipline strategies.

             2. Improved parent feeding practices, i.e., increased responsiveness to child satiety
                cues.

             3. Improved child weight-related behaviors, i.e., increased sleep duration and
                physical activity, and reduced sugar-sweetened beverage intake and television/video
                viewing.
