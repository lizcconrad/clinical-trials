    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome were confirmed based on the diagnostic
      criteria for Guillain-Barré syndrome. Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and do not
      conflict with the exclusion criteria will receive NPB-01 (intravenous immunoglobulin)
      400mg/kg/day for five consecutive days.

      Patients evaluate the Functional Grade（FG） and Arm Grade（AG） et al.

      As a safety endpoint, the safety of NPB-01 will be investigated the occurrence of adverse
      events by the start of the study treatment.
