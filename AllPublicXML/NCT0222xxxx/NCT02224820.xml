      IdeS is an immunoglobulin g (IgG) cleaving enzyme. It will given to patients with donor
      specific antibodies to reduce the antibody load and thus enable kidney transplantation. IdeS
      antibody reducing efficacy and its safety will be studied.

      Study 13-HMedIdeS-02 (EudraCT no. 2013-005417-13) is a single centre, single arm, dose
      finding, Phase II study in sensitized CKD patients assessing safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of HMED-IdeS without intent to transplantation. However,
      patients are not removed from the transplant waitlist during the study. Included patients has
      a panel reactive antibody [PRA] &gt;70% (n=7).

    <description>Efficacy was defined as the IdeS dosing scheme in the majority of the patients resulting in human leucocyte antigen (HLA) antibody levels which are acceptable for transplantation, measured as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of less than 1100, within 24 hours from dosing. MFI was determined by single antigen bead (SAB) assay and detection of complement fixating ability (CIq Screen) in serum.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and in dialysis with identified antibodies
             against at least two HLA antigens of which at least one is 3000 MFI or more as
             measured by SAB assay on at least two occasions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior malignancy within 2 years excluding adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ and prostate cancer Gleason &lt;6 and
             prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &lt;10 ng/mL.

          -  History of any other clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may either put the patient at increased risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the patient's ability to

          -  Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) or has participated in any other clinical study that included
             drug treatment within 4 months of the first administration of investigational product
             in this study. Patients consented and screened but not dosed in previous studies are

      <recruitment_details>The study was performed at a medical clinic, the Department of Transplantat Surgery, Uppsala, SE between 10 Jun 2014 and 13 Feb 2015. The patients had chronic kidney disease, were in dialysis and on the waiting list for transplantation. (Transplantation was not part of the protocol).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In total, 10 patients were assessed for eligibility. One patient declined to participate and one patient was not available for recieving information about the study. Eight patients were enrolled and started treatment.</pre_assignment_details>
