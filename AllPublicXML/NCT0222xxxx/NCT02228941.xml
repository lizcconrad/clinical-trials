  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) is a rare and complex primary immunodeficiency that affects
      multiple systems. It is characterized by elevated Immunoglobulin E(IgE), recurrent skin and
      pulmonary infections and eczematoid dermatitis.Somatic manifestations include scoliosis,
      joint hyperextensibility, impaired shedding of deciduous teeth and facial dysmorphism.

      The reason of extremely high level of serum IgE in the patients with HIES is unknown. Signal
      transducers and activators of transcription 3(STAT3) gene mutations can cause the STAT3/Janus
      kinase(STAT3/JAK) signal transduction pathway disorder, then can affect the B cell
      development.

      It is reported that levels of extracellular signal cytokine and the prolonged half-life of
      IgE are not the causes of dramatically increased IgE levels in STAT3-HIES patients. According
      to our preliminary work, we found that the slight increase of IgE-secreting plasma cells
      could not explain the tremendously increased IgE level and that the key class switch
      recombination enzyme (AID) was up-regulated in STAT3-HIES patients. Intriguingly, we found
      that deregulation of immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) in IgE secreting plasma
      cells in STAT3-HIES patients might play a key role in dramatically increased IgE levels.

      Nuclear factor IL-3 regulated (NFIL3) is a newly discovered transcriptional factor. During
      STAT3-HIES IgE-secreting plasma cells differentiating, NFIL3 was significantly upregulated.
      The CSR of IgE was down-regulated in STAT3-deficiency mice as well as NFIL3-deficiency mice,
      however Interleukin-4（IL-4）, a STAT3-independent cytokine, promotes NFIL3 expression by
      Signal transducers and activators of transcription 6(STAT6) dependent manner. Thus, we
      hypothesize that NFIL3 may play a key role in dramatically increased IgE levels in STAT3-HIES
      patients.

      In-depth insight of the pathogenic role of NFIL3 within human STAT3-HIES has great
      significance in clarifying the pathogenesis of HIES and exploiting effective targeting
      interventions to improve clinical outcomes. Also, it can provide valuable clues for the
      clinical treatment of IgE-related diseases, such as parasite infection and malignant
      diseases.

        We divided the patients with HIES into two groups, namely Autosomal-dominant Hyper-IgE
        Syndrome(AD-HIES) group and Autosomal-recessive Hyper-IgE Syndrome(AR-HIES) group.
        According to the different group, we need to do a variety of detection index, for example,
        gene mutations, B-lymphocyte subsets, protein expression et al.In addition, healthy control
        group is needed in the experiment.
