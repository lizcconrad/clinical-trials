  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if health-related text messages sent from
      healthcare providers to overweight and obese adolescents enrolled at a pediatric lipid clinic
      will result in increased adherence to their nutrition and physical activity goals and improve
      their weight loss. The study will also assess if the volume of texts per week impacts
      outcomes.

      Phase 1: We will recruit 5 participants the from the UF Pediatric Lipid and Obesity clinic
      for pre-intervention cognitive interviewing to assess acceptability of the intervention and
      request their input on a representative sample of text messages. Then, 20 participants will
      be recruited from the same clinic for the intervention (10 controls, 10 intervention
      participants). Controls will receive current standard care - clinic visits every three months
      anthropometric assessments and counseling on physical activity and nutrition goals by a
      healthcare provider, typically with no patient-provider communication between visits. The
      intervention group will receive the typical clinic visits plus daily text messages in between
      visits with fitness and nutrition messages to support their health goals. All participants
      will have anthropometric measurements at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Each participant will
      complete a Schwartz Diet and Activity History at 0, 3 and 6 month visits, and a post
      intervention survey will be completed at the 3 month time point.

      Phase 2: The second phase will be a larger scale study to assess for statistically
      significant effects of the text messaging intervention. One hundred participants will be
      recruited from the UF Pediatric Lipid and Obesity Clinic, one hundred from the UF Pediatric
      Headache Clinic and one hundred from the Congenital Heart Center for a total of three hundred
      (n=300) participants at three clinic locations. Participants will be randomized at each
      clinic location to one of two groups, Group A (immediate intervention, n=50) or Group B
      (control group, delayed intervention, n=50).

      Participants randomized to Group A will receive the typical clinic visits (which includes
      anthropometric measures every three months, counselling on physical activity and nutrition
      goals by a healthcare provider and for those prescribed medication for a chronic condition,
      medication counseling by a healthcare provide) plus daily text messages in between visits for
      3 months to support their health goals. Group B will initially act as the control and will
      receive the typical clinic visits (which includes anthropometric measures every three months,
      counseling on physical activity and nutrition goals by a healthcare provider, and for those
      prescribed medication for a chronic condition, medication counseling by a healthcare
      provider) with typically with no patient-provider communication between visits. After a
      6-month delay, Group B will then receive the intervention which includes the typical clinic
      visits as stated previously plus daily text messages in between visits for 3 months to
      support their health goals. Participants will be seen in clinic at standard intervals for
      routine follow up (typically every 3 months). Three months after participants finish
      receiving the text messages, the same anthropometric and medication measures (for those
      prescribed chronic medication) that were collected at baseline as part of routine care will
      be repeated. Each participant will complete a Block Food Screener and Block Physical Activity
      Screener at 0, 3, and 6 months. Participants who are prescribed a chronic medication will
      also complete the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 at 0, 3 and 6 months. A
      post-intervention survey will be completed after the participants have stopped receiving text
      messages.

    <description>This will involve a pre-study interview with a small group of subjects to assess for their opinions on the text messages and study concept. Following this, we will perform a small scale trial of the program, involving 20 participants with 10 subjects in the intervention group and 10 controls. The number of participants will most likely not be adequate to reach statistical significance in detecting differences in healthy food choices, physical activity and BMI z-score between control and experimental groups. However, this study will help guide us in establishing if this healthcare texting system functions well. In addition, it may help determine if there are any trends in improvement of the target variables that would support the need for a future, larger study.</description>

    <description>Phase 1: We aim to have our adolescent subjects fill out a Schwartz Diet and Activity History at time points 0, 3 and 6 months. We will assess their baseline food choices and then assess for changes in food habits over time, with a prediction that this text message communication will help to decrease the &quot;negative&quot; food choices (sugars/syrups, non whole grain starches, processed foods, sugar sweetened beverages) and increase the &quot;positive&quot; food (fruits/vegetables, low fat dairy, water) choices by 10% (based on screener scores pre and post intervention).
Phase 2: Each participant will complete a Block Food Screener and Block Physical Activity Screener, instead of the Schwartz Diet and Activity History, to assess the proportion of healthy food choices versus unhealthy choices.</description>
