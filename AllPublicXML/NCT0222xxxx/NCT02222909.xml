      Project CONNECT (&quot;Community-based Organizations Neighborhood Network: Enhancing Capacity
      Together&quot;) is a randomized controlled trial that involves 22 community-based organizations
      (CBOs) located in Baltimore, MD. Half of these organizations were randomly assigned to the
      intervention group using a constrained cluster randomization process. The remaining 11 are a
      part of the control intervention group. The intervention is a co-developed set of IT tools
      hypothesized to improve the connections among intervention CBOs, Johns Hopkins health care
      facilities and CBO clients.
