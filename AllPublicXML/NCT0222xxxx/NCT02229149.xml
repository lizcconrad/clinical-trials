      This randomized phase 2 study will seek to determine the effectiveness of chemotherapy
      (physician's choice of vinorelbine, taxane [paclitaxel, docetaxel or nab paclitaxel] or
      capecitabine) plus trastuzumab vs chemotherapy (physician's choice) plus trastuzumab plus
      pertuzumab in women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast (MBC) that has been previously
      treated with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in the metastatic setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current preferred first-line therapy for patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic
      breast cancer (MBC) is a taxane plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, based on results from the
      CLEOPATRA trial. For patients with disease that has progressed on trastuzumab and a taxane,
      ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was recently approved based on results from the EMILIA
      trial showing superiority in this setting compared with capecitabine plus lapatinib. However,
      the standard for first-line therapy may change again in the near future, when results become
      available from the MARIANNE trial, which is evaluating T-DM1 alone or in combination with
      pertuzumab as upfront therapy. Two important questions that may be raised by the findings of
      this study are whether pertuzumab is effective as second- or later-line therapy following
      single-agent T-DM1, and whether pertuzumab administered beyond progression on prior
      pertuzumab therapy is of clinical benefit as trastuzumab has been proven to be.

      The study will seek to determine the efficacy of chemotherapy (physician's choice of
      vinorelbine, taxane [paclitaxel, docetaxel or nab paclitaxel] or capecitabine) plus
      trastuzumab vs chemotherapy (physician's choice) plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in women
      with HER2-overexpressing MBC that has been previously treated with T-DM1 in the metastatic
      setting.

      We hypothesize that the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy will improve
      median progression-free survival (PFS), compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy alone, as
      second- or later-line therapy in patients who have received prior T-DM1. Patients will be
      stratified according to whether they have received prior pertuzumab versus not. We will also
      explore whether continuing treatment with pertuzumab in patients who have been previously
      treated with pertuzumab improves PFS.
