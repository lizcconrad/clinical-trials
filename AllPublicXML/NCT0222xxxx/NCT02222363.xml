      This Phase I, open label dose escalation study of VLX600 in patients with refractory advanced
      solid tumors will determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VLX600
      when administered by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment
      cycle. Dose escalation will proceed according to the standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design using doubling
      doses. The doses are: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 210 mg VLX600.

Tumor response will be determined by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

    <description>Patients will receive a dose of VLX600 by 4-hr intravenous infusion using a central venous catheter on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle. There are the following dose cohorts: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 210 mg VLX600. It is anticipated that patients will receive 6 treatment cycles. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression, patients have the option of continuing treatment beyond 6 cycles, if the investigator determines that the patient may benefit further from it.</description>
