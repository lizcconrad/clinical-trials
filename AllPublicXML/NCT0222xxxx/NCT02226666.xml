    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the physiologic response of patients
      who receive either intravenous gadoxetic acid (Eovist) or intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine
      (MultiHance).

    <textblock>
      Contrast-enhanced hepatic MRI is an accepted method for detecting and characterizing liver
      lesions. Liver lesion characterization is fundamental for patient management, because lesions
      that meet specific imaging criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are assumed to be HCC
      without tissue confirmation. There are a variety of gadolinium-based contrast agents that are
      used for this purpose. Two of the more commonly utilized are gadoxetic acid (an hepatobiliary
      contrast agent that permits 20 minute hepatobiliary phase imaging) and gadobenate dimeglumine
      (a weak hepatobiliary contrast agent that functions generally as an extracellular contrast
      agent). A recent study by our group has shown that patients who receive intravenous gadoxetic
      acid are much more likely to experience transient dyspnea after contrast injection that
      causes them to breathe rapidly through the arterial phase of imaging, degrading image
      quality. In that study, subjective complaints of dyspnea and respiratory motion artifact on
      imaging were scored. The investigators did not assess patient physiologic response. The goal
      of the proposed work is to build on our prior data and to determine whether there are
      non-invasively measurable physiologic parameters that can support our original study.
      Specifically, the investigators want to determine whether there are predictable changes in
      SpO2, pulse, respiratory periodicity, and respiratory regularity that correlate with arterial
      phase image degradation and patients complains of dyspnea. Both contrast agents to be
      assessed in this study are FDA approved with at least 4 years of post-marketing experience
      documenting safety and efficacy. The investigators will not be changing or altering our
      clinical approach in any way as a part of this study.

    <description>Subjects having a clinically ordered MRI with Eovist. Patients consenting for the study will be monitored before and after getting MRI contrast. For the study oxygen saturation (amount of oxygen level in the blood) and breathing will be monitored during the can. Breathing will be measured with a non-invasive respiratory monitoring device attached to the MR scanner. Each patient will answer survey questions after the scan about their experiences concerning MRI contrast.</description>

        One-hundred patients receiving gadoxetic acid for hepatobiliary indications and 100
        patients receiving gadobenate dimeglumine for hepatobiliary indications will be studied
        prospectively. All patients will be scheduled to undergo MRI for clinical purposes by their
        primary care physicians. The patients will not be randomized.
