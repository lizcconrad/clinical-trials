    <textblock>
      Neuroglobin has been described as a marker of traumatic brain injury. Nogo-A plays an
      important role in mediating neuroanatomical plasticity and functional recovery following
      traumatic brain injury. The investigators sought to examine the changes in serum neuroglobin
      and Nogo-A concentrations in patients with traumatic brain injury during the initial 96-h
      posttraumatic period and assessed the relation of neuroglobin and Nogo-A to Glasgow Coma
      Score and prognosis of such patients with traumatic brain injury.

        The patient group comprised 21 male and 13 female. Their age ranged from 19 to 68 years,
        with mean age of 45.1 years. The mechanisms of trauma included motor vehicle collisions,
        falls, heavy strikes (patients who were hit by heavy objects such as bricks, sticks, or
        falling objects) and assaults. Types of lesions, as evidenced by radiologic and neurologic
        symptoms or signs, included cerebral contusions/lacerations, intracranial hematomas, brain
        stem injury and diffuse axonal injury.
