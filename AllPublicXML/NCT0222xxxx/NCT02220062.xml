  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer related pain can be difficult to control, even with high doses of
      narcotics, whose adverse effects may further impair quality of life. So EUS-CPN(endoscopic
      ultrasound guided celiac plexus neurolysis) is well established as an effective technique for
      controlling pain and reducing narcotic requirements in patients with pancreatic cancer.
      Recently, celiac ganglia can be visualized and accessed by endoscopic ultrasound. So it
      allows for direct injection into individual celiac ganglia to perform celiac ganglia
      neurolysis. This more precise delivery of therapeutic drug will offers the potential for
      enhanced efficacy and safety. To evaluate this hypothesis, this randomized controlled trial
      aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of EUS-CGN(Endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac
      ganglia neurolysis) vs. Bilateral EUS-CPN(Endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus
      neurolysis) in providing relief from pancreas cancer-related pain.
