      The objective of this confirmatory study is to demonstrate that the LAAx, Inc. TigerPaw® II
      System can be safely and effectively used to exclude the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) during
      cardiac surgery utilizing thoracoscopic camera and light source and thus remove, from the
      cleared indication for use, the direct vision limitation.
