      The primary purpose of this study is to identify the optimal dose of voriconazole, an
      anti-fungal drug often used in people undergoing stem cell transplant. An optimal dose level
      is one level that provides a good blood level (concentration) of voriconazole without too
      much toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (either 1st
             or subsequent)

          -  Age ≤ 21 years

          -  Adequate organ function within 14 days of enrollment, i.e. Creatinine: &lt; 1.5 x ULN and
             Hepatic: ALT, AST and total bilirubin &lt; 3 x ULN

          -  Requires voriconazole to prevent or treat invasive fungal infection after undergoing
             stem cell transplantation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received voriconazole within 5 days prior to starting study therapy

          -  History of hypersensitivity or severe intolerance to azoles

          -  History, or current evidence, of cardiac arrhythmias defined as QTc ≥ 480 mm/sec

          -  Receiving the following drugs and cannot be discontinued at least 24 hours before
             starting therapy: pimozide, quinidine, astemizole, ergot alkaloids.

          -  Received one or more of the following drugs within 14 days prior to starting study, as
             they are potent inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes: rifampin, rifabutin,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, nevirapine, long-acting barbiturates.

          -  Received sirolimus within the 14 days prior to starting study as voriconazole is a
             potent inhibitor of sirolimus metabolism

          -  Receiving or anticipated need for methadone as co-administration with voriconazole
             potentially increases methadone exposure
