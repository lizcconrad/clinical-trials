      The purpose of this study is to test whether a mouthwash made with a drug called doxepin can
      reduce the pain caused by mouth sores resulting from radiation therapy. A number of mouth
      rinse preparations exist for patients with treatment-related oral mucositis pain such as the
      DLA rinse, an over-the-counter medication. This study will evaluate the effects of doxepin
      compared to DLA (diphenhydramine, lidocaine and antacids) and placebo.Doxepin is approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of depression, anxiety, long-term
      pain management, as well as management of rash.

    <textblock>
      Patients are stratified according to sex (male vs. female), concurrent use of chemotherapy
      (no vs. yes), patient age at registration (&lt; 60 years old vs. ≥ 60 years old and RTOG acute
      radiation morbidity criteria (1 vs. 2 vs 3 or more). Protocol therapy will consist of 2
      cycles. Patients are randomized to one of three treatment regimens, which include doxepin,
      DLA and placebo. Cycle One will consist of one day. The care provider or nurse will confirm
      that the oral pain is at least 4 out of 10 severity level at the time of the rinse on the
      first day of the study. Patient will be asked to complete the baseline evaluation in the Oral
      Symptoms booklet. If the pain score is less than 4 then administration will be delayed until
      the pain is at least 4. Cycle Two will consist of an optional continuation phase lasting up
      to 7 days. Initiation of the Cycle 2/Continuation Phase may be delayed up to one week after
      Cycle 1/Day 1.

      Primary Objective:

      1. Determine whether the doxepin rinse or DLA rinse is more effective than placebo in
      reducing OM-related pain in patients undergoing RT to the oral cavity, as measured by a
      patient-reported questionnaire at baseline, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2
      hours, and 4 hours.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Assess the adverse event profile of the doxepin rinse, the DLA rinse agent, and the
           placebo using a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1
           hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours for domains of unpleasant taste, burning or stinging
           discomfort, and drowsiness.

        2. Compare the incidence of using additional analgesics between 1 and 4 hours after the
           initial mouthwash, between the doxepin oral rinse, the DLA rinse agent, and the placebo
           arms.

        3. Compare the length of time that each study product is used by patients in the one-week
           continuation phase.

        4. Compare the daily pain scores in the one-week continuation phase for the three study
           arms.

        5. Compare the 24-hour morphine equivalent dose used in the continuation phase for the
           three study arms.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Total pain reduction (mouth and throat) was measured by the numerical analogue scale of mouth pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain in the questionnaires taken at baseline, and 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes after assigned treatment for doxepin or DLA vs. placebo. The total pain reduction was calculated by the (average of mouth and throat) area under the curve (AUC) adjusting for baseline, with time scale (baseline, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes post treatment) replaced by a numerical scale of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The AUC was prorated when there are terminal missing data. If the missing data were intermittent, simple imputation by trapezoidal rules were applied to calculate the AUC. If a patient cancelled, was missing baseline data, or only provided baseline data, he/she was excluded from the statistical analysis.</description>

             stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT] is not allowed).

          2. Physical exam demonstrating evidence of radiotherapy-related mucositis in the visible

          3. At least 4 (out of 10) patient-reported oral pain related to oral mucositis secondary
             to RT for which the patient seeks relief, as measured on the Oral Pain Assessment.

             Note: The pain score must be at least 4 at the time that the patient starts the first
             dose of study medication. The patient may be enrolled to the study if s/he, at times,
             has a pain score of at least 4, so long as initiation of study treatment begins when
             the pain score is at least 4.

          4. Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance.

          5. No known allergy to diphenhydramine, lidocaine, antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium
             hydroxide, and simethicone), doxepin, tricyclic antidepressants, or any known
             component of the drug formulation in the testing arms.

          6. No use of any anti-arrhythmic medication (except for beta-blockers) including
             lidocaine, linezolid, ipratropium, or medications with high anti-cholinergic potency

         11. No cryotherapy for prophylactic mucosal protection within 6 weeks prior to
             registration.

         12. Not pregnant, because patients eligible for this study will be receiving radiotherapy,
             which has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects. Therefore, for women of

        <title>Mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Total Pain Reduction</title>
        <description>Total pain reduction (mouth and throat) was measured by the numerical analogue scale of mouth pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain in the questionnaires taken at baseline, and 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes after assigned treatment for doxepin or DLA vs. placebo. The total pain reduction was calculated by the (average of mouth and throat) area under the curve (AUC) adjusting for baseline, with time scale (baseline, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes post treatment) replaced by a numerical scale of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The AUC was prorated when there are terminal missing data. If the missing data were intermittent, simple imputation by trapezoidal rules were applied to calculate the AUC. If a patient cancelled, was missing baseline data, or only provided baseline data, he/she was excluded from the statistical analysis.</description>
