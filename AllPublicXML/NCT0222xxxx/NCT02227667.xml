  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, MEDI4736 has on the
      patient and cancer.

      MEDI4736 is a type of medication called an antibody. Antibodies are normal proteins in the
      body that help fight infections and possibly cancer. MEDI4736 is a special type of an
      antibody produced in a laboratory. MEDI4736 works by blocking a specific protein called the
      Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PDL-1), located on tumor cells.

    <description>This will be a Simon two-stage design, single arm, phase II study. All subjects will receive MEDI4736 via IV infusion. Subjects will continue treatment for 12 months, or until progression of disease, initiation of alternative cancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons to discontinue treatment occur. Following the 12-month treatment period, subjects without evidence for progressive disease or other reason to discontinue treatment will be monitored without further treatment. Upon evidence of PD (with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1) during the monitoring period, administration of MEDI4736 may resume at the Q2W schedule, for up to another 12 months. The same treatment guidelines followed during the initial 12-month treatment period will be followed during the retreatment period, including the same dose and frequency of treatments and the same schedule of assessments.</description>
