    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new
      primary care intervention &quot;Back on Track&quot; as compared to usual primary care in patients with
      non-specific chronic low back pain in which disability levels are moderate and the role of
      psychosocial factors to this disability is at maximum low (classified as WPN2).

    <measure>Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in self-efficacy between pre-treatment (baseline) and post-treatment (with an expected average of 8 weeks), 3 months follow-up and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
