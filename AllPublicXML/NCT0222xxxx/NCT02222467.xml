             diameter of the wound must not exceed 10 cm;

          -  Wound area has not changed by more than +/- 30% between Screening visit and Week
             1/Visit 1 (before treatment).

          -  Adequate arterial blood perfusion (ABI (ankle brachial index) between 0.7 and 1.3,
             inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Venous leg ulcer present for more than 12 months;

          -  The ulcer to be treated is planned for operative debridement;

             mg/dL), or hypoproteinemia (proteinemia &lt; 55g/L);

          -  Patient with moderate to severe anemia (Hb &lt; 90g/L);

          -  Patient with prior diagnosis of active malignant disease who is less than 1 year
             disease-free;

          -  Patient with a known osteomyelitis or active cellulitis;

          -  Patients on Warfarin or IV Heparin;

          -  The subject has any physical or psychiatric condition that in the Investigator's
             opinion would warrant exclusion from the study or prevent the subject from completing
             the study (e.g., severe morbid obesity, recent hip fracture, suspected non-compliance,
             etc.);

          -  Patients with ulcers from burns (from exposure to high heat), pressure ulcers or
