  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of AclarusDx™, an investigational
      blood test detecting gene expression information, and intended to help physicians in making
      an Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis in patients having memory complaint and/or cognitive
      impairments.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to apply AclarusDx™ signature in 600 patients newly referred
      in french memory centers. Only AclarusDx™ will be added to the panel of tests usually
      performed at the centers to establish diagnosis. AclarusDx™ will be used for investigational
      use only, not for diagnostic purpose. The ultimate goal is to define the clinical utility of
      AclarusDx™ to provide physicians with a tool that will help them in making the diagnosis of
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

      The primary objective is to estimate the prevalence of positive AclarusDx™ in patients
      diagnosed AD in the population of primary consultants. This population of primary consultants
      consists of patients with cognitive impairment and / or a memory complaint requiring
      specialized exploration using AclarusDx™ blood test and which may be potentially related to
      multiple and different etiologies.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Assess the prevalence of positive AclarusDx™ in relation to other diagnoses (MCI,
           vascular dementia ...) established by the physician investigator at the end of
           specialized assessment.

        -  Identify the demographic factors anamnestic, clinical, biological and imaging associated
           with positivity of AclarusDx™

        -  Identify the demographic factors anamnestic, clinical, biological and imaging associated
           with the diagnosis of AD and other diagnoses.

        -  Determine the contribution of AclarusDx™ in the usual battery of tests performed for
           diagnostic approach to Alzheimer's disease and to identify a possible association of
           interest with one or more endpoints (clinical, neuropsychological, brain, biological
           imaging).

        -  Assess: diagnostic status at 6 and 12 months, and the MMSE and IADL at 6 and 12 months.

        -  assess the predictive value of AclarusDx™ achieved during the initial visit to the
           diagnosis of AD is 12 months.

        -  Evaluate AclarusDx™ predictive value to 12 months
