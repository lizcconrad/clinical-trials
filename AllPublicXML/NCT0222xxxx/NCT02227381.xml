    <textblock>
      Learning disability affects 3% of the population. Severe types of learning disability are
      more likely to have an underlying genetic cause but diagnosis is difficult because many
      different genetic abnormalities may be involved. Obtaining a diagnosis is important so that
      patients can be managed appropriately and their families can be given accurate information.

      We aim to use new types of genetic testing which will make it possible to screen for several
      different genetic abnormalities which cause learning disability at the same time, so
      improving the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in the group of patients with severe learning
      disability. We will focus particularly on patients where seizures and behavioural problems
      are also present.This will enable more patients to be diagnosed accurately, reduce the number
      of hospital appointments needed and ultimately be more cost- effective.

        We will approach a cohort of patients with severe LD/seizures/behaviour problems who have
        presented to us in our genetic clinic for diagnosis over the past few years, but where the
        cause of their problems remains unknown. This will be our study population. In virtually
        all cases we will have performed routine diagnostic testing and will have stored DNA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with severe learning disability associated with either seizures, movement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with SLD where the cause is already known
