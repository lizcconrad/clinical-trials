      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Deep TMS (DTMS)
      treatment in subjects with OCD. The device technology is based on the application of deep
      brain TMS by means of repetitive pulse trains at a predetermined frequency. The Brainsway
      DTMS study is a randomized, 10 week, double blind, multi-center trial comparing active DTMS
      treatment to sham treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OCD study will compare one group of OCD subjects receiving DTMS treatment (HAC-coil) to a
      second group of OCD subjects receiving sham treatment (sham coil). The treatment group will
      receive 5 weeks of daily DTMS treatments followed by 4 treatments in week 6, for a total of
      29 treatment sessions. The control group will receive the same treatments with a sham coil.
      Subjects may continue to take SSRI medications (if prescribed) and any other antidepressant
      medications will be tapered down prior to the first treatment. SSRI medications approved for
      OCD include Fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Symbyax), Fluvoxamine (Luvox, Luvox CR), Paroxetine
      (Paxil, Paxil CR, Pexeva) and Sertraline (Zoloft). Efficacy will be assessed using the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score (YBOCS), as well as other efficacy scales. Safety
      will be assessed by monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, physical and neurological
      examination and using certain safety questionnaires.

    <description>Active DTMS Treatment constitutes the Deep Transcranial Magnetci Stimulation (DTMS) which is a new form of TMS which allows direct stimulation of deeper neruonal pathways than the standard TMS. The DTMS coil is designed to allow deeper brain stimulation without significant increase of electric fields included in superficial cortical regions.</description>
