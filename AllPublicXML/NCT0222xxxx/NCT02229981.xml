      This is a sequential Phase I and IIa study to identify the maximum tolerated dose and to
      evaluate safety, tolerability, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the oral
      sphingosine kinase inhibitor ABC294640 specifically in patients with diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL), including virus-associated (e.g., KSHV- or EBV-associated) DLBCL or Kaposi
      Sarcoma (KS) after failure of or intolerance to initial standard therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sphingosine Kinase (SK) is an innovative target for anti-cancer therapy due to its critical
      role in lipid metabolism which drives cancer cell growth. We have found that the SK inhibitor
      ABC294640 (which is formulated for clinical use as an oral agent) significantly inhibits and
      reverses progression of virus-associated DLBCL in pre-clinical animal models [Qin et a.,
      2014]. In addition, we have found that ABC294640 selectively induces death for virus-infected
      endothelial cells in a laboratory model relevant to KS, with selective sparing of uninfected
      cells [Dai et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2015]. Both DLBCL and KS disproportionately impact
      patients with immune-deficiencies, including HIV infection, for whom standard
      chemotherapeutic approaches are less effective and incur greater side effects. Therefore,
      this trial which utilizes a well-tolerated, oral agent to inhibit SK for DLBCL and KS
      patients may provide a unique approach to treatment.

             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          3. Patients with active, life-threatening bacterial or fungal infections.

             treatment with ABC294640 and either replaced with another appropriate medication or
             not given for the duration of the clinical study. Patients on HAART will be restricted
             to preferred, potent agents with no demonstrated interactions with CYP450 isoforms for
             which significant interactions are predicted with ABC294640 (1A2, 2C9, or 2C19 for

             toxicities of previous antineoplastic therapy.

         11. Patients who are currently participating in any other clinical trial of an
             investigational product.
