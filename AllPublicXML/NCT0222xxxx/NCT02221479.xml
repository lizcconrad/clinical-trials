      Primary Objective:

      To determine if Multi Myeloma (MM) patients mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) plus plerixafor 240 μg/kg are more likely to achieve a target number of
      greater than or equal to 6 x 10^6 cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ cells/kg in 2 or fewer
      days of apheresis than MM patients mobilized with G-CSF alone.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety of G-CSF plus plerixafor arm compared to G-CSF arm in MM
           patients.

        -  To compare the 2 treatment arms with respect to the number of participants who achieved
           a minimum of 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer days of apheresis.

        -  To compare the 2 treatment arms with respect to the number of days of apheresis required
           to reach the target of greater than or equal to 6 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg.
