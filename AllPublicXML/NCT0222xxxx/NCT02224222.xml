  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of frailty as a multidimensional risk
      factor on the outcomes of adult cardiac and vascular surgery. For the purpose of defining
      patient frailty a multimodal questionnaire has been developed including measurement of
      psychological, socioeconomical, neurological and behavioral aspects. This study also features
      an investigation of the possible relationship between sudden regional weather changes,
      individual meteorological susceptibility of the patients and the outcomes of adult cardiac
      and vascular surgery.
