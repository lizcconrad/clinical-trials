          -  Willingness to return for all study visits;

          -  Willing and able to adhere to an off-loading protocol. Patient must adhere to wearing

             bone) or II-A (non-infected, non-ischemic wound penetrating to tendon or capsule but
             not in the bone or joint). A patient with more than one diabetic foot ulcer may be
             included in the trial but only one ulcer will be selected for the investigational
             treatment, based on investigator's judgment;

          -  Ulcer present for more than 4 weeks prior to study entry (Screening/Visit 1);

          -  Ulcer area between 1 and 16 cm2 inclusive. The maximum diameter of the wound must not
             exceed 8 cm;

          -  Diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) with an A1C &lt; 12% at Screening;

          -  Diagnosis of neuropathic foot ulcer (10 grams pressure using Semmes-Weinstein 5.07
             monofilament in the peri-ulcer area and/or biothesiometry or tuning fork 128 Hz);

          -  Wound area has not changed by more than +/- 30% between Screening visit and Week
             1/Visit 1 (before treatment).

          -  Adequate arterial blood perfusion (ABI (ankle brachial index) between 0.7 and 1.3,
             inclusive, or toe pressure &gt; 50 mmHg, or tcPO2 &gt; 40 mmHg).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetic foot ulcer present for more than 12 months;

             off-loading based on investigator's opinion;

          -  Patient cannot tolerate off-loading method;

          -  The ulcer to be treated is planned for operative debridement;

          -  The ulcer has significant necrotic tissue (e.g., more than 20% of the ulcer area);

          -  Patient with history of radiation therapy to the wound region;

          -  Patient with prior diagnosis of active malignant disease who is less than 1 year
             disease-free;

          -  Patient with a known osteomyelitis or active cellulitis;

          -  Patients that are immunosuppressed or on high dose chronic steroid use;

             etc.);

             as porphyria;

          -  Patient has received biological-based therapy in any wound within 3 months of
             Screening;

          -  Concurrent participation in another clinical trial that involves an investigational
             drug or device that wound interfere with this study;
