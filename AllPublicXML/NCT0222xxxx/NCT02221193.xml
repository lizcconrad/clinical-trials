      Objectives: To determine whether site-specific mouth rinsing with oral disinfectants can
      improve oral odor beyond the traditional panoral mouth disinfection with mouth rinses by
      targeting specifically oral malodor implicate anaerobic bacteria.

      Methods: Twenty healthy fasting subjects volunteered for a blinded prospective, descriptive
      correlational crossover cross-section clinical trial conduct during the month of Ramadan in
      the lunar Hajri year 1434 AH (10 July 2013-8 August 2013) in Albaha province in Saudi Arabia
      involving the application of Listerine速 Cool Mint速 mouth rinse by either the traditional
      panoral rinsing method or a site-specific disinfection method targeting the subgingival and
      supragingival plaque and the posterior third of the tongue dorsum while avoiding the
      remaining locations within the oral cavity. The viable anaerobic and aerobic bacterial
      counts, volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) levels, organoleptic assessment of oral odor and the
      tongue-coating index were compared at baseline, 1, 5 and 9 hours after the treatment.
