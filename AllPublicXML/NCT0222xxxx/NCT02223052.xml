    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, randomized, 2-stage crossover study consisting of
      2 phases:

      Stage I - Pharmacokinetics (Bioequivalence), with an Extension Stage II - Pharmacokinetics
      (Food Effect) with an Extension

      This study will enroll approximately 60 subjects in stage I and 60 subjects in stage II with
      hematologic or solid tumor malignancies, excluding gastrointestinal tumors and tumors that
      have originated or metastasized to the liver for which no standard treatment exists or have
      progressed or recurred following prior therapy. Subjects must not be eligible for therapy of
      higher curative potential where an alternative treatment has been shown to prolong survival
      in an analogous population. Approximately 23 sites in the US and 2 in Canada will participate
      in this study.

      Stage I - Pharmacokinetics (Bioequivalence)

      Subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 300 mg orally on each of the two
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study days based on the dosing sequences they are randomized to:

      Dosing Sequence 1: 2x150 mg tablets followed by 1x30 mg tablet. Dosing Sequence 2: 1x300 mg
      tablet followed by 2x150 mg tablets. Each dose will be administered in the clinic at least 48
      hours apart between PK dosing day 1 and PK dosing day 2 over a period no longer than 10 days
      under fasted conditions.

      Stage II - Pharmacokinetics (Food Effect)

      Subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 300 mg orally on each of the two PK study days
      based on the dosing sequences they are randomized to:

      Dosing Sequence 1: 1x300 mg tablet under fasted condition followed by 1x300 mg tablet under
      fed condition.

      Dosing Sequence 2: 1x300 mg tablet under fed condition followed by 1x300 mg tablet under
      fasted condition.

      Each dose will be administered in the clinic at least 48 hours apart between PK dosing day 1
      and PK dosing day 2 over a period no longer than 10 days. The sponsor will generate the
      randomization scheme and assign subjects upon enrollment to the appropriate sequence for
      dosing:

      Fasted condition: following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will ingest oral
      Azacitidine with 240 mL of room temperature water. Subjects must fast for a minimum of 4
      hours following oral Azacitidine administration. Subjects may drink water as desired, except
      for 1 hour before and 1 hour after oral Azacitidine administration.

      Fed condition: following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours and following the performance
      of all required pre-dose assessments, subjects randomized to receive test medication in a fed
      state will begin ingesting a breakfast meal 30 (±5) minutes prior to the planned
      administration of oral Azacitidine. They will continue the entire meal within 20 to 25
      minutes (no less than 20 minutes) from the time the meal is served. Subjects will then ingest
      oral Azacitidine with 240 mL of room temperature water. Subjects must fast a minimum of 4
      hours following oral Azacitidine administration. Subjects may drink water as desired, except
      for 1 hour before and 1 hour after administration of oral Azacitidine.

      Extension Phase (for subjects who have completed PK Stage I or Stage II) Subjects continuing
      beyond the pharmacokinetics phase (Stage I or Stage II) will enter the extension phase of the
      study at the discretion of the investigator to receive &lt; 6 (four-week) cycles of Vidaza 75
      mg/m2 IV or SC daily for 7 days in the clinic and repeat every 4 weeks per prescribed label
      at the discretion of the investigator for ≤ 6 (four-week) cycles.

                    4. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limits of Normal (ULN)

                  screening, as determined by the investigator

              10. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) may participate, providing the subject
                  meets the following conditions:

                    -  Agree to use at least two effective contraceptive methods (oral, injectable,
                       or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device;
                       barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner) or agree to
                       practice true abstinence throughout the study, and for 3 months following
                       the last dose of IP; and

                    -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening (sensitivity of at least 25
                       mIU/mL); (Note that the screening serum pregnancy test can be used as the
                       test prior to starting IP in the pharmacokinetics phase if it is performed
                       within the 72-hour timeframe), and

                    -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test (investigator's discretion;
                       sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 72 hours prior to starting IP in
                       the extension phase. (Note: subjects must have negative serum or urine
                       pregnancy test prior to dosing on Day 1 of each treatment cycle in the
                       extension phase.)

              11. Male subjects must:

                  a. Practice true abstinence* or agree to the use of at least two
                  physician-approved contraceptive methods throughout the course of the study and
                  should avoid fathering a child during the course of the study for at least 3
                  months following the last dose of IP.

                  * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the patient. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception].

              12. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant or nursing (lactating).

          2. Gastrointestinal tumors, tumors that have originated or metastasized to the liver, or
             other tumors known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or
             excretion of drugs.

          3. Had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the first day of
             Investigational Product (IP) administration.

          4. Have been treated with an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to the first day
             of IP administration.

          5. Have ongoing clinically significant adverse event(s) due to prior treatments
             administered as determined by the investigator.

          6. Significant active cardiac disease within the previous 6 months, including:

               -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV congestive heart failure

               -  Significant cardiac arrhythmia or unstable angina or angina requiring surgical or
                  medical intervention; and/or

               -  Myocardial infarction

          7. Have known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine or any other ingredient used
             in the manufacturing of Azacitidine.

          8. Uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, or viral infection (defined as ongoing
             signs/symptoms related to the infection without improvement despite appropriate
             antibiotics, antiviral therapy, and/or other treatment)

          9. History of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis),
             celiac disease, prior gastrectomy, gastric bypass, upper bowel removal, or any other
             gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with the absorption of the
             study drug and/or predispose the subject to an increased risk of gastrointestinal
             toxicity.

         10. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

         11. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study

         12. Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study

         13. Impaired ability to swallow oral medication

         14. Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study
