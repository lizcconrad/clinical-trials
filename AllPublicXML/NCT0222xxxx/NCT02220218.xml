  <brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Metformin Component of Canagliflozin and Metformin Fixed Dose Combination Immediate Release (IR) Tablet Comparing With Metformin IR Tablet Co-administered With Canagliflozin Tablet in Healthy Fed and Fasted Participants</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Single-Dose, Open-Label, Randomized, 4-Way Crossover Pivotal Study to Assess the Bioequivalence of the Metformin Component of the Fixed Dose Combination Tablet of Canagliflozin and Metformin Immediate Release (IR) 1 x (50 mg/500 mg) With Respect to the Metformin IR Tablet (Locally Sourced From Canada [Glucophage, 1 x 500 mg]) Coadministered With Canagliflozin (1 x 50 mg) in Healthy Fed and Fasted Subjects</official_title>

      The purpose of this study to evaluate the bioequivalence (is the amount same in both the
      pills) of metformin component of the canagliflozin and metformin immediate release (IR) fixed
      dose combination (FDC) tablet compared with the metformin IR tablet co-administered with
      canagliflozin tablet in healthy fed and fasted participants.

      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label
      (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff), single-center,
      single-dose, 4-treatment, 4-way crossover (method used to switch participants from one study
      group to another in a clinical trial, like the flip of a coin) study in healthy adult
      participants. The study will have 3 phases: Screening Phase (approximately 3 weeks, Day -22
      to Day -2), Open-Label Treatment Phase (consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods of 3
      days each [Day -1 to Day 2], each separated by a washout period of 7 days) and Follow-up
      Phase (5 to 7 days after last study-related procedure on Day 2 of treatment period 4). All
      eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequences and will
      receive 2 treatments under fasting and 2 treatments under fed conditions. Blood samples will
      be collected at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment, for understanding the
      pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how
      it is removed from the body over time). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
