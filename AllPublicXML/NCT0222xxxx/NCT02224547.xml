    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform prospective data analysis on tumor response in terms
      of local tumor control after 2 years, potential acute and late toxicity and survival in
      patients with non-metastatic, non-small-cell lung cancer treated by radiotherapy that are
      medically inoperable due to coexisting comorbidities or that refuse surgery. SBRT regimens
      used will be 4 fractions of 12 Gy or 3 fractions of 17 Gy depending on tumor location in a
      risk-adapted approach.
