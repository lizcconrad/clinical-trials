  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the two different
      basal insulins commonly used for basal blood sugar control in the treatment of type 2
      diabetes mellitus in patients who are hospitalized and require low doses of insulin: neutral
      protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin and glargine (Lantus®) insulin. Previous research has shown
      that both NPH insulin and glargine (Lantus®) insulin is safe and effective for the control of
      blood sugar in a type 2 diabetic patient. This research is being done because the costs of
      medications for diabetic patients are very expensive. Our goal with this research is to show
      that a less expensive insulin (NPH) is as safe and effective as a more expensive insulin
      [glargine (Lantus®)] in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are in the hospital.

      This is a randomized, open label trial comparing effectiveness of insulin glargine and
      insulin NPH in a basal plus correctional regimen. Patients will be randomized to either an
      intervention (NPH) or a control group (glargine) upon admission. The following data will be
      collected: age, sex, weight, preadmission diabetes medications, admission diagnosis, HbA1C,
      blood glucose (BG), chemistry, hematology, urine analysis, pregnancy test, duration of
      hospitalization, insulin dose, and discharge status. Data will be recorded and maintained
      confidentially.
