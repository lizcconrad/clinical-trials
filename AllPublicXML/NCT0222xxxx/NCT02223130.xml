  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test a group program aimed at improving the quality
      of life of HIV+ Black men who have sex with men. The group will address ways to cope with
      discrimination and will help men examine mistrust that they may have about healthcare,
      including doctors and other healthcare providers and HIV medications. The aim is to provide a
      supportive community for HIV+ Black men.

      The aim of the study is to examine whether the pilot intervention can reduce mistrust and
      improve coping responses to discrimination among HIV positive Black men who have sex with men
      (MSM). We will conduct a small randomized pilot trial to test the feasibility of evaluation
      methods. All participants will attend a baseline, a first follow-up visit, and a final
      follow-up visit (each 3 months apart) at which they will take computer assessments.
      Participants who are assigned to the intervention will attend 9 weekly intervention sessions
      after baseline and before the first follow-up. Using a wait-list control design, control
      group participants from the first two cohorts will be offered the intervention after they
      complete the final follow-up visit. Control group participants from the third cohort will be
      offered the intervention after they complete the first final-up visit and before they
      complete their final follow-up due to timing and budgetary restraints. We will hold three
      consecutive groups for our small randomized control trial. This means that we will be
      recruiting continuously; once we finish recruiting for the first group, we will start
      recruiting for the second group, and so on. Each group has about 12 or 13 intervention and
      7-11 control participants.

    <description>Participants will attend the baseline, first follow-up, and final follow-up study visits, at which they take computer surveys. After their baseline interview and before their first follow-up interview, participants attend the Intervention Group, which consist of 9 weekly group sessions. Each of the weekly sessions is led by a mental health professional and a peer facilitator who uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques to work with participants in tracking their cognitions, emotions, and behaviors in response to stressful/discrimination experiences.</description>

    <description>Participants are not given the Intervention Group while they are enrolled in the study. Instead, they only attend the baseline, first follow-up, and final follow-up study visits, at which they take computer surveys.
After they have completed the study, participants from the first two cohorts are offered the option of attending an intervention group that is identical in content to the intervention group being studied.The third cohort is offered the intervention group after they have completed the first follow-up but before they complete the final follow-up due to timing and budgetary restraints. No data is collected and no incentives are given during these intervention groups.</description>
