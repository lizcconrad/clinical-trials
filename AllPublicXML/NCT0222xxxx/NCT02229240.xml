    <textblock>
      This Phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter,
      treat-to-target study of 26 weeks treatment duration will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      once-weekly albiglutide versus placebo as add-on to intensified basal-bolus insulin therapy
      (with or without metformin) in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Approximately
      450 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: albiglutide
      + intensified basal-bolus insulin therapy (with or without metformin) or placebo +
      intensified basal-bolus insulin therapy (with or without metformin. The total duration of a
      subject's participation will be approximately 32 weeks.
