  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center study using induced blood stage malaria infection to characterize
      the activity of ACT-451840 against early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to characterize the activity of ACT-451840
      administered orally on clearance of Plasmodium falciparum blood stage parasites from the
      blood in healthy subjects .The inoculum used for blood stage Plasmodium falciparum challenge
      (BSPC) contained an estimated 1,800 viable parasite-infected erythrocytes diluted into 2 mL
      of normal saline for injection. Blood was collected for malaria parasitemia assessment by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Parasitemia ≥ 1,000 parasites/mL indicated that the subjects
      should be treated with ACT-451840 . If PCR counts were &gt; 5,000 parasites/mL and symptomatic
      they were dosed within 24 hours. Subsequent PCR blood sampling were performed prior to
      ACT-451840 dosing and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 120, 144 hours
      post-dosing and then approximately times per week until 2 consecutive negative samples, until
      Riamet® rescue treatment and at the final visit.

    <description>All the participants were infected with Plasmodium falciparum parasites (malaria) using malaria-infected human erythrocytes. When the parasitemia reached 1000 counts/mL, all the participants received 500 mg of ACT-451840 as a single oral dose. Compulsory commencement of treatment with Riamet® (artemether-lumefantrine) to ensure complete clearance of any gametocytes, occurred 16 days after ACT-451840 administration (or earlier if required) for all participants. Primaquine was to be administered as a single dose only in participants for whom gametocytes were still identified after administration of Riamet® rescue medication</description>
