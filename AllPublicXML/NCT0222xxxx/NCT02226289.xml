  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF), combined with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is now the standard first and
      second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. The efficacy of bevacizumab with
      cytotoxic agents in the third-line treatment of patients with mCRC is still unknown.

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase II, open-labelled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of bevacizumab combined with cytotoxic agents in the treatment of patients with mCRC
      progressing under all available cytotoxic chemotherapy
