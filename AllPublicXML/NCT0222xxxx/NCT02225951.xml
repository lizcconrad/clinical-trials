  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is initiated to investigate the effect of a nutritional product on the 3-hr
      postprandial glucose response compared to a control standard breakfast at baseline and after
      4 weeks of intervention.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of study product on the
      3-hour postprandial glucose response compared to a controlled standard breakfast at baseline
      and after 4 weeks of intervention. Secondary objectives include investigation on the effect
      of the product compared to a control standard breakfast to the 3-hr postprandial insulin
      response, postprandial peak and delta peak concentration of glucose and insulin, fasting
      concentration of glucose and insulin, and insulin resistance as calculated by the HOMA index.
      The study also aims to measure compliance, study product intake and appreciation, safety and
      tolerance to study product, as well as satiety, daily energy and nutrient intake.
