  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic, gastric, and colorectal cancers have all been shown to overexpress the gastrin
      gene and to be sensitive to the trophic effects of the gastrin in animal models. The
      hypothesis of this study is that G17DT will elicit specific and high-affinity antibodies that
      will bind gastrin-17, thus preventing the trophic activity of cancer cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma for whom no other
             anti-cancer treatment was anticipated during the three month period of study.

          -  Patients taking a proton pump inhibitor at a fixed daily dose which had remained
             unchanged for at least six weeks preceding screening and was not anticipated to change
             during the study.

          -  Proton pump inhibitor compliance of ~70% (to be measured between screening and
             baseline (week 0)).

          -  Male or female patients from 18 to 65 years of age.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of over three months.

          -  World Health Organisation (WHO) Performance Status of 0 to 1.

          -  Written informed consent given.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in receipt of histamine H2-receptor (H2 receptor) antagonists or any other
             antacid therapy, other than a proton pump inhibitor at a stable dose.

          -  Patients with any other factor likely to alter intra-gastric acidity e.g. previous
             gastric surgery, including vagotomy or anatomically abnormal upper gastrointestinal
             tract.

          -  History of other malignant disease within the previous five years, except non-
             melanomatous skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

          -  Previous use within the last four weeks, concomitant use or anticipated use in the
             period of the study of radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

          -  Concomitant use of immunosuppressants, including systemic (i .e. oral or injected)
             corticosteroids.

          -  Females who were pregnant, planning to become pregnant or lactating. Women, who in the
             opinion of the investigator were of child bearing potential, were to have a negative
             pregnancy test before study drug administration.

          -  Patients taking part in another study involving an investigational or licensed drug or
             device in the three months preceding enrolment or during the study.

          -  Previous G 17DT treatment.

          -  Haematological indicators:

        Haemoglobin &lt;10.0 g/dL White blood cell count &lt;4.0 x 109/L Platelets &lt; 100 x 1 09/L
