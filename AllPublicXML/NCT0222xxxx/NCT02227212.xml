      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the ease of use of the U300 pen injector in pen-naïve and insulin-naïve type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in a 4-week once-daily dosing regimen with HOE901-U300.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess in a 4-week once-daily dosing regimen with HOE901-U300 in pen-naïve and
      insulin-naïve T2DM patients.

      The safety and usability of the U300 pen injector. The glycemic control with the U300 pen
      injector. The safety of HOE901-U300.
