    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the impact of different nicotine levels
      in cigarettes among non-daily smokers. This research may help inform the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) on how best to regulate tobacco products in the future, with the goal of
      improving public health.

      The overall goal of the study is to assess the effects of switching to
      Very-Low-Nicotine-Content cigarettes (VLNCCs) among non-daily, or intermittent smokers (ITS).
      This is a two-arm randomized study with an own-cigarette baseline control. After a 2-week
      baseline period smoking their own cigarettes, 455 ITS will be randomized (double-blind) for
      10 weeks to smoke experimental cigarettes, either: (a) normal nicotine content cigarettes
      (NNCCs; 0.8 mg) or (b) VLNCCs (0.07 mg), each matched to menthol status of subjects'
      preferred brand. ITS are more likely to be African-American (AA) smokers; thus AA smokers
      will be oversampled (to one third of the total sample). Change in cigarette consumption is
      the primary end-point, and biomarkers of smoke exposure and measures of smoking intensity are
      also assessed.
