        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained prior to any study-related procedures

          2. Age ≥18 years and male.

          3. ECOG performance status ≤ 2.

          4. Histologically/cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and without
             neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology.

          5. Metastatic disease as confirmed by Computed tomography (CT)/ Magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) or bone scan.

          6. 6. Patients must have documented Progressive disease (PD) either by radiographic or
             PSA criteria as defined in a) and b) below:

               1. For the Radiographic PD assessment, 2 sets of scans using the same imaging
                  modality (ie CT/MRI or bone scan) and taken at separate time points are required
                  to document radiographic disease progression during or following the patient's
                  most recent anti-neoplastic therapy, (note: the 1st bone scan can be from before
                  most recent therapy but the 2nd scan must show disease progression during or
                  after the most recent therapy).

                  For patients with bone disease, progression will be assessed following
                  recommendations by the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2, see Appendix FC):
                  appearance of 2 or more new lesions on bone scan, confirmed, if necessary, by
                  other imaging modalities (such as CT scan or MRI), if results of the bone scans
                  are ambiguous).

                  For patients with soft tissue lesions progression will be assessed using RECIST
                  1.1 criteria, (see Appendix GD). Patients may have measurable or non-measurable
                  disease according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 (see Appendix GD)

               2. PSA progression is defined as an increase in PSA, as determined by 2 separate
                  measurements taken at least 1 week apart and confirmed by a third. If the third
                  measurement is not greater than the second measurement, then a fourth measurement
                  must be taken and must be greater than the second measurement for the patient to
                  be eligible for the study. Furthermore, the confirmatory PSA measurement (i.e.
                  the third or, if applicable, fourth PSA measurement) must be defined. If a
                  patient has received prior anti-androgen therapy (e.g. bicalutamide), PSA
                  progression must be evident and documented after discontinuation of anti-androgen
                  therapy, (note: The 1st PSA reading taken to document disease progression when
                  the patient presents can be while the patient is on Casodex or other ADT).

          7. Prior surgical castration or concurrent use of an agent for medical castration with
             testosterone at screening less than 50ng/dL.

          8. Screening PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL.

          9. Patients, even if surgically sterilized who (i.e. status post-vasectomy):

               -  will abstain from intercourse

               -  or must agree to use barrier contraception during and for 6 months after
                  discontinuation of study treatment.

               -  If the patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing
                  potential, a condom and another form of birth control must be used during and for
                  6 months after treatment.

         10. Stable medical condition

         11. Life expectancy of 12 months or more based on general health and prostate cancer
             disease status as judged by the investigator.

         12. Documented presence of osseous metastases with or without visceral involvement / lymph
             nodes.

         13. Able to swallow study drug as whole tablet.

         14. Adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function.

         15. Continuous daily use of oral prednisone, oral dexamethasone, or other systemic
             corticosteroids is allowed prior to study entry but must be discontinued a minimum of
             2 weeks prior to start of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients should not be receiving any other investigational agents (within 30 days
             prior to registration)

          2. Patients with Gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease resulting in an inability to take
             oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior

             Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis).

          3. Have current active hepatic or biliary disease

          4. Prior therapy with orteronel, ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, abiraterone or
             enzalutamide

          5. All anti-androgen therapy (including bicalutamide) is excluded within 6 weeks prior to
             first dose of study drug. Any other therapies for prostate cancer, other than GnRH
             analogue therapy, such as progesterone, medroxyprogesterone, progestins (megesterol),
             or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride or dutasteride), must be discontinued
             2 weeks before the first dose of study drug. [Bisphosphonates and Denosumab are
             allowed concomitant medications].

          6. Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer with the exception of:

               -  neoadjuvant/ adjuvant therapy as part of initial primary treatment for local
                  disease that was completed 2 or more years prior to screening.

               -  Patients who received prior docetaxol for castrate sensitive metastatic prostate
                  cancer commencing with 120 days of ADT initation where total dose received did

             of study drug. In patients with untreated imminent or established spinal cord
             compression, treatment with standard of care, as clinically indicated, should be
             completed before starting treatment with Ra-223 dichloride (Xofigo®).

          9. Diagnosis of or treatment for another systemic malignancy within 2 years before the
             first dose of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any

             life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer, or any ongoing serious medical or
             psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere
             with participation in this study. Patients will be tested for hepatitis B or C or HIV
             infection during screening if they are considered by the investigator to be at higher
             risk for these infections and have not been previously tested, or if testing is
             required by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board.

         14. Prohibited medications, including drugs that may affect exposure to enzalutamide i.e.
