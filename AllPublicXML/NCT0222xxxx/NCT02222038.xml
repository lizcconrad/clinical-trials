      The purpose of this study is to investigate the genetic architecture of Linear Localized
      Scleroderma (LLS) (linear morphea) by whole exome sequencing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present the etiology of LLS is unknown, but a genetic background is suspected. Although
      LLS clearly classifies as a mosaic disorder, its genetics and protein machinery remain to be
      understood.

      We are going to use a tailored approach to identify the genetic factors of LLS. In the first
      phase of the study we will investigate the genetic architecture in LLS. WES will analyze
      whole protein coding DNA in skin samples of 50 consenting LLS patient. The aim is to identify
      the key genes associated with LLS. In the second phase of the study subsequent functional
      experiments will be performed. Based on the identified candidate genes, knockdown and
      overexpression models will be created with relevant cell lines (fibroblasts) to identify the
      biological consequences and confirm the functional relevance of the identified genetic
      mutations in LLS. Further the protein network active in LLS will be investigated (proteomic
      analysis).

      The described basic genetic studies combined with functional experiments will lay the
      groundwork for treatment trials to provide possibly novel treatment options.
