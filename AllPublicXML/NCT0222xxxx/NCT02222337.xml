    <textblock>
      Latina breast cancer survivors report lower quality of life (QOL) than non-Latina survivors.
      Lower QOL can lead to poorer functional and cancer-related survival outcomes. The friends and
      family of Latina cancer patients are also impacted by a loved one's diagnosis of breast
      cancer. Through strong community-academic partnerships, the investigators seek to improve the
      QOL of Latina survivors and their caregivers with a culturally-relevant intervention. In this
      project, the investigators plan to further develop and refine the intervention and then test
      it through a randomized controlled trial. First, the investigators will conduct in-depth
      qualitative interviews with 10 survivor-caregiver dyads (pairs) to see if the intervention
      fits for survivors and caregivers in different parts of the country. Then, the investigators
      will revise the intervention. Finally, the investigators will test the intervention in a
      randomized controlled trial. The investigators will invite 125 survivor-caregiver dyads to be
      a part of our study. Half will be asked to complete the intervention and half will be offered
      the usual services, such as support groups. The information learned from this study could
      help improve the quality of life in Latina breast cancer survivors and their caregivers.
      Physicians, survivors, and community groups can also benefit from this study because they
      will have more information about the needs of Latina breast cancer survivors. The
      investigators hope to use the information to help other types of survivors and caregivers in
      the future.

      What is the Nueva Vida Intervention? The &quot;Nueva Vida Intervention: Improving Quality of Life
      in Latina Breast Cancer Survivors and Their Caregivers&quot; is a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) that was co-developed by a Latina breast cancer survivor who is trained as a mental
      health professional. The program was developed for Nueva Vida, a community-based organization
      (CBO) in the Washington, DC metropolitan area that serves Latina breast cancer survivors and
      their families. We are comparing the intervention to the usual services provided at our four
      partner community-based organizations.

      How is the Nueva Vida Intervention Structured? The 8-session psycho-educational quality of
      life intervention includes group-based skill-building workshops in which Latina survivors and
      their caregivers are part of concurrently-held but separate groups (survivors in one room;
      caregivers in another). This separation meets the needs of Latino participants by encouraging
      them to freely share their experiences and feelings without worrying about upsetting the
      other person. Five of the eight sessions address core topics: Introduction and The Impact of
      Cancer on the Family, Stress Management, Improving Communication: Family, Friends, and
      Providers, Spirituality and Cancer, and Balancing Physical and Emotional Needs.

      The remaining three sessions are selected by the intervention participants based on their own
      needs and interests from the following options: Anger Management, Intimacy after Cancer:
      Emotional and Sexual, Trauma and Cancer, Role Changes, Understanding Distress and Depression,
      Myths and Cancer, Including Others in Helping Caregivers, and Putting Our Lives in Order. At
      the end of the intervention everyone participates in a graduation ceremony.

      How does the Nueva Vida Intervention Reflect Latino Values? The Nueva Vida intervention
      reflects Latino values, including personalismo (warm, personal relationships), familismo
      (emphasizing the family unit in managing a cancer diagnosis) and framing the sessions as
      workshops to avoid stigma associated with mental health care.

      Where will the Nueva Vida Intervention Study take place? We will evaluate the Nueva Vida
      Intervention within a multi-site RCT at four community-based organizations in Washington, DC
      (Nueva Vida), New York, New York (SHARE, Gilda's Club New York City), and San Jose,
      California (Latinas Contra Cancer).

      What is Involved in Study Participation? Latina survivors and their caregivers will be
      assigned by chance (randomized) to either the Nueva Vida Intervention or to usual care.
      Survivors and caregivers assigned to usual care can take part in any and all of the services
      provided at one of the four community-based organizations who are study partners. Both
      survivors and caregivers will complete informed consent forms and telephone surveys at the
      beginning of the study, about 4 months later, and again 6 months later. Survivors and
      caregivers receive gift cards in appreciation of their time for completing the surveys.

    <description>The psycho-educational format of the Nueva Vida Intervention is led by trained interventionists who have the survivors and caregivers go into different rooms to discuss the same topic. This format will allows them each to express their thoughts and feelings without inhibitions or concerns over how their survivor or their caregiver might respond. The specific topics for each wave of the intervention participants will be determined from a larger list of possible topics, with each group including the following core topics: Impact of Cancer on the Family, Spirituality and Cancer, Stress Management, Balancing Physical and Emotional Needs and Improving Communication.</description>
