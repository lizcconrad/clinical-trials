  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Over one million patients in the US are estimated to undergo mechanical
      ventilation every year, and approximately 300,000 of them fail attempts at weaning. The
      morbidity and mortality of these patients is greater than in patients who are successfully
      weaned. It follows that treatments aimed at reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation
      have the potential to benefit society both in terms of human suffering and cost.

      Patients who fail attempts at weaning assist their inspiratory muscles during inhalation by
      recruiting their expiratory muscles during exhalation. Unfortunately, this recruitment occurs
      relatively late during a weaning trial. The knowledge that (a) expiratory muscle recruitment
      can assist inspiration, (b) the recruitment of the expiratory muscles is delayed during
      weaning, and (c) that the respiratory muscles in patients requiring mechanical ventilation
      are in a catabolic state raises the possibility that strategies designed to produce an early
      recruitment, and improve the strength, of the expiratory muscles could improve weaning
      outcomes in difficult to wean patients.

      The current investigation, which will be conducted in healthy subjects and in ambulatory
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at Edward Hines Jr. VAH (Aims 1
      and 2), and in patients who are difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation at RML
      Specialty Hospital, Hinsdale, IL (Aim 3), has been designed to develop and assess a novel
      triggering algorithm (VentFree), that controls the delivery of non-invasive neuro muscular
      electrical stimulation (NMES) to the abdominal-wall muscles during exhalation, and to study
      the physiological (respiratory) responses to such stimulation in assisting respiration in
      healthy subjects, in ambulatory patients with COPD and in patients requiring pronged
      mechanical ventilation.

        Aim 1 and Aim 2:Healthy Subjects and Ambulatory COPD Patients Studied at Hines VAH

        Healthy subjects (Hines VAH), Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  No history of acute or chronic respiratory disease, cardiac or neuromuscular disease.

        Ambulatory COPD patients (Hines VAH), Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Chronic airway obstruction defined as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of
             70% predicted or less, ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital
             capacity (FEV1/FVC) of 0.7 or less

          -  Stable clinical condition without an exacerbation during the preceding four weeks

        Aim 3: Patients being weaned from prolonged mechanical ventilation (RML Specialty
        Hospital), Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  History of neuromuscular disease

          -  Body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m2

          -  Patients who have received mechanical ventilation for at least 14 days and the primary
             physician judges the patient is ready to start weaning

          -  Able to breathe spontaneously for more than 5 minutes and less than 12 hours

          -  Clinically stable: oxygen saturation &gt; 90% with a fractional inspired oxygen ≤ 0.40,
             external PEEP ≤ 5 cm H2O, temperature ranging from 35.5 to 38.5Co, no intravenous
             administration of vasoactive agents.

        Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria for all potential participants

          -  Subjects with implanted electronic devices - such as cardiac pacemakers,
             defibrillators and intrathecal pumps - will be excluded because NMES could cause
             malfunction of those devices.

          -  Only subjects with intact abdominal-wall skin will be enrolled because NMES can cause
             discomfort when applied over skin that is irritated or on open wounds.

          -  Pregnancy will be a contraindication to participate in the study because it is unknown
             whether the application of NMES to the abdominal or lumbar area during pregnancy may
             produce adverse effects.
