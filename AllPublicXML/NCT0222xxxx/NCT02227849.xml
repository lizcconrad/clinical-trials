      This is an open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Canagliflozin
      (TA-7284) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are receiving treatment
      with GLP-1 analogue on diet and exercise and have inadequate glycemic control. The patients
      will receive TA-7284 100mg orally for 52 weeks.
