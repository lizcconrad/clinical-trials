    <textblock>
      Recruitment of 28 subjects that will be randomized to consume fruit or nuts as snacks between
      regular meals for two months. Laboratory tests for cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic
      rate, liver steatosis and physical activity are investigated ahead of start of the study and
      at the end of the trial period och two months. Participants will be allowed to buy fruits or
      nuts on their own but to keep track (diaries) of the amount consumed. They will be reimbursed
      for the costs of the snacks.
