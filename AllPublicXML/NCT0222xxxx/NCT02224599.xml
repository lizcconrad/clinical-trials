  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with progressive and/or refractory solid malignancies (SM), who have
      failed conventional therapy, and have no available, potentially curative therapeutic options,
      will be candidates for this Phase I/II study. Following confirmation of disease progression
      and/or refractoriness, eligible patients who agree to participate and sign a consent form
      will have their tumor cells/tissues and/or blood analyzed for the expression of a specific
      panel of Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens (TAPAs), including Sp17, ropporin, AKAP-4, PTTG1,
      Span-xb, Her-2/neu, HM1.24, NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-1.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients whose tumors express one (1) or more of these TAPAs will receive three (3) days of
      subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) to increase bone
      marrow production of monocytes and dendritic cell (DC) precursors, and whole blood will be
      obtained by phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis performed for generation of autologous DCs.
      Patient's DCs will be generated in Kiromic's Cell Processing GMP facility, according to
      established Standard Operating Procedures, and activated by pulsing/loading them with the
      TAPA(s) relevant for each particular patient. Patients will receive five (5) days of low-dose
      cyclophosphamide prior to each vaccination with TAPA-pulsed DCs to decrease Treg activity.
      TAPA-pulsed DCs will be administered at a fixed dose of up to 1 X 107 DCs at least two (2)
      days following cyclophosphamide administration. DC vaccination schedule will be once every
      fourteen (14) days via subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) injections for a total of 6
      vaccinations. Low dose GM-CSF will also be administered SC for five (5) consecutive days,
      starting three (3) to six (6) hours after each TAPA-pulsed DC treatment, to optimize immune
      responses. Patients will be followed on a weekly basis (or more frequently if required) to
      evaluate treatment-related toxicity. Immune efficacy and anti-tumor responses will be
      evaluated per protocol specifications. Continuation and stopping rules for the study will be
      defined based on toxicity/tolerability (Phase I) and immune efficacy (Phase II).
