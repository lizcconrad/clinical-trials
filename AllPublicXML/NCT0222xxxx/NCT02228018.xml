      his is a study with no investigational product. CALSA will be compared with FRI and the
      repeatability of the FRI parameters will be tested in a group of healthy volunteers and
      asthma patients.

      Electronic auscultation of respiratory sounds will be performed, lung function tests (at
      maximal dilatation) will be executed and computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax will be
      taken. The scans will be taken at two different breathing levels, more specifically at total
      lung capacity (TLC) and functional residual capacity (FRC) level. The scans will be taken
      while the patient/ volunteer lies down on the movable table of the CT-scan. After the scan is
      taken it will be asked to the patient/ volunteer to sit upright on the scanning table and to
      lie down again. When the patient/ volunteer lies down a second CT-scan (TLC and FRC) will be
      taken.

      The objective of this study is to compare CALSA with FRI and to assess the repeatability of
      FRI biomarkers

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare CALSA with FRI. The respiratory sounds recordings are performed with a digital stethoscope and connected to the sound card of a laptop with commercial software, suitable for data acquisition. The respiratory sounds recordings are conducted in accordance with the Computerized Respiratory Sound Analysis guidelines (CORSA) for short-term acquisition. Subjects are asked to breathe through the mouth in a sitting position (tidal breathing) during the recordings. Three sets of recordings are made for 7 - 10 respiratory cycles with a maximum duration of 25 seconds.</description>
