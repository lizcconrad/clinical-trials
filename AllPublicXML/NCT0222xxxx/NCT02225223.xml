      The purpose of this study is to evaluate treating painful metastatic lesions in vertebral
      bodies with pathologic fractures with targeted radiofrequency ablation (t-RFA) and vertebral
      augmentation (VA) prior to or following radiation therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient is ≥ 18 years old,

          2. One to two painful vertebrae (T1-L5) with evidence of osteolytic or mixed lytic and
             blastic metastatic lesion by cross sectional imaging and pathologic fracture (presence
             of non-painful vertebrae with metastatic lesions in addition to the painful index
             vertebrae are allowed)

          3. Never received radiation therapy at index level(s) (following consult with radiation
             oncologist re: conventional treatment options) OR Received radiation therapy without
             adequate relief from metastatic bone pain as determined by the patient and treating
             physician, their treating physician would not prescribe additional radiation
             treatments, or refuse additional radiation therapy,

          4. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) worst pain score of ≥ 4 (irrespective of medication),

          5. Woman of potential childbearing age agrees to a medically effective birth control
             method,

          6. Life expectancy of ≥ 2 months,

          7. Sufficient mental capacity to comply with the protocol requirements,

          8. Understands the potential risks and benefits of study participation and is willing to
             provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary tumors of the bone (e.g., osteosarcoma) at site of index vertebra(e),

          2. Benign tumors of the bone (e.g. osteoid osteoma) at site of index vertebra (e),

          3. Lesions due to hematologic malignancy (e.g. multiple myeloma at site of the index
             vertebra (e),

          4. Compromise in the posterior column of the vertebral body or walls of pedicles.

          5. Extra-osseous extension of metastatic lesion is &gt;10mm,

          6. Nonreversible or uncorrectable coagulopathy. INR should not be &gt;1.5,

          7. Platelet count of &lt; 50,000 ,

          8. Radiation therapy was completed on the index vertebra(e) ≤ 28 days before enrollment,

          9. Change in chemotherapy agent is planned 7 days before or after enrollment (change in
             dose(s) permitted),

         10. Index vertebra(e) had previous spine surgery including vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty,

         11. Additional non-kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty surgical treatment is required for the index
             vertebra(e),

         12. Spinal cord compression or canal compromise requiring decompression,

         13. Major surgery of the spine in same region as the index vertebra(e) was performed
             within 3 months before enrollment,

         14. Major elective surgery to the spine in same region as the index vertebra(e) is planned
             within 1 month following the ablation and cement procedure,

         15. Requires upper and lower limb surgery that will affect functional outcomes,

         16. Significant clinical morbidities (aside from the index vertebra(e) and recurrent
             cancer) that may interfere with data collection that affects pain and functional
             results,

         17. Medical/surgical conditions contrary to the kyphoplasty procedure (e.g., presence of
             active or incompletely treated local infection, severe pulmonary insufficiency),

         18. Bedridden due to paralysis or neurological decline,

         19. Currently pregnant or nursing, or planning pregnancy (in the period up to 6 months)
             following the index procedure(s),

         20. Known allergy to bone cement,

         21. Has a heart pacemaker or other electronic device implants

         22. Concurrent participation or participation within the last 30 days prior to enrollment
             in any clinical trial with an investigational medicinal drug/chemotherapeutic or
             biologic or medical product.
