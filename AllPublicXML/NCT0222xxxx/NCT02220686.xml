      The purpose of the study is to see if vascular physicians (your provider) using a combination
      of proven smoking cessation tools in an organized way can help vascular patients quit smoking
      better than usual.

      The doctors where you are being treated have been chosen to either provide:

      the combination therapy of giving you advice, considering prescribing medications to help you
      quit smoking, and referring you to a phone quitline, or to continue their usual smoking
      cessation practices (which may include all, some, or none of the treatments above).

    <description>To assess the efficacy of the &quot;Offer and Report&quot; protocol (standardized (1) &quot;very brief advice,&quot; (2) referral to telephone-based smoking cessation counseling, and (3) consideration of prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)) as compared to usual smoking cessation care by vascular physicians in biochemically-validated 3 month smoking cessation rates. A questionnaire will be completed by the patient at the Baseline visit and another questionnaire will be completed at the 3 month visit to assess the change in smoking status.</description>
