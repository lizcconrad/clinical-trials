  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the use of a new drug targeting the DNA repair pathway AZD6738,
      an ATR inhibitor). Many tumours have lost important DNA repair functions and rely more
      heavily on a few remaining repair pathways to survive. Preclinical studies indicate that, in
      these tumours, preventing the function of the remaining pathways will lead to tumour cell
      death, while sparing normal cells. This study aims to investigate the safety and tolerability
      of the new drug in patients with advanced cancer, as well as in combination with palliative
      radiotherapy, where the drug may increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy by preventing
      repair of the radiationinduced DNA damage. As the drug has only been given to a small number
      of patients, the study will focus on safety and finding the correct dose to proceed to
      further studies, although preliminary signs of drug activity will also be examined.

      The initial part of the study will administer increasing doses of the drug to groups of
      patients with advanced cancer who have no standard anticancer treatment options available.
      Testing will establish whether the drug levels in the body and tumour are adequate for the
      drug to have an effect, and any toxicity will be assessed. After the recommended dose is
      established, the recommended dose schedule will be stablished by trialing different
      schedules. Participants will be tested to see if their tumours lack the main DNA repair
      pathway (those who are predicted to have a better response to this drug). Finally, the drug
      will be given to patients with advanced cancer who require a course of radiotherapy for
      symptom control - the drug will be tested at different doses and with different doses of
      radiotherapy.

      Side effects will be monitored and tests will establish whether the drug is enhancing the
      radiotherapy effect in the tumours or normal tissues.
