  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess habituation of behavioral responding for food as risk factors
      for increases in Standardized Body Mass Index (zBMI) over three years in non-overweight
      children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cross sectional data have shown slower habituation is related to greater energy intake, and
      habituation is slower for overweight/obese compared to leaner youth, but it is not known
      whether this is a result of being overweight, or whether slower habituation is a risk factor
      for weight gain. The goal of this application is to study individual differences in
      behavioral (responding for food) habituation as risk factors for alterations in zBMI and body
      fat over a two year period in 200, 8 to 12 year-old non-overweight children. This project
      will provide the first test of the hypothesis that slow habituation to food is a risk factor
      for increases in zBMI in non-overweight youth.

    <description>To assess the rate of habituation of behavioral responding to savory, sweet and salty foods as independent or interactive risk factors for zBMI trajectories, with the hypothesis that the rate of habituation of behavioral responding for food predicts zBMI trajectories over time, controlling for child gender, parental education, parental BMI, physical activity, ethnicity, the reinforcing value of food and eating in the absence of hunger.</description>

        Two hundred and thirty healthy non-overweight children between the ages of 8-12 will be
        studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  8-12 years of age

          -  Participants will include children who are at the 50th BMI percentile and less than
             the 85th BMI percentile (BMI = kg/m2) at baseline. We will also include children who
             are below the 50th percentile, but have at least one biological parent with a current
             BMI â‰¥ 25 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Food allergies or special diets: Youth should have no dietary restrictions that could
             interfere with these experiments, including food allergies or religious or ethnic
             practices that limit food choice or medical conditions which alter nutritional status
             or intestinal absorption (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease).

          -  Activity restrictions: Children who have activity restrictions due to medical or
             physical problems, such as uncontrolled exercise induced asthma or a disability
             requiring wheelchair use will not participate.

          -  Psychopathology, medications or sickness: Children should have no psychopathology
             (e.g. childhood schizophrenia) or developmental disabilities that would limit
             participation. Children will also be excluded if they are taking medications that
             could affect their level of activity or appetite (e.g. methylphenidate).

          -  Moderate or greater liking of study foods. Children must report at least a moderate
             liking ( 3 or greater on a 5-point Likert-type scale) of the foods used in these
             studies and be willing to consume them.
