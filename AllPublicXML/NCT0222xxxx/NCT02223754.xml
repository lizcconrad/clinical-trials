    <measure>Overall Quality of Vision Using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) TM Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 -12 days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>CLUE Overall Quality of Vision is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)TM questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3XSD).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>8 - 12 Days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining is evaluated using Sodium Fluorescein strips. The Fluorescien strip was lightly placed on the subject's inferior palpebral conjunctiva. The corneal Staining was graded using the scale Grade 0: No Staining, Grade 1: Trace(Minimal superficial staining or stippling), Grade 2: Mild (Regional or diffuse punctate staining), Grade 3:Moderate(Significant dense coalesced staining, corneal abrasion or foreign body tracks.), Grade 4 Severe(Severe abrasions greater than 2 mm in diameter, ulcerations, epithelial loss, or full thickness abrasion.). The data was dichotomized into two group subjects with grade 3 or higher staining, and those subjects with less than Grade 3. Below the percentage of subject eyes with grade 3 or higher is reported for each lens.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bulbar Conjunctival Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>8- 12 Days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>The bulbar is the scelra. Bulbar Conjunctival Injection was assessed using an Efron Grading scale by 1 unit increments. Grade 0: Normal, Grade 1: Trace, Grade 2: Mild, Grade 3: Moderate, Grade 4:Severe. The data was dichotomized into two group subjects with grade 3 or higher Conjunctival injection, and those subjects with less than Grade 3. Below the percentage of subject eyes with grade 3 or higher is reported for each lens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Limbal Conjunctival Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>8- 12 Days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>The Limbus is the 1 to 2mm wide zone of conjunctiva and underlying tissue adjacent to where the cornea joins the sclera. Limbal Conjunctival Injection was assesed using the Efron grading scale in 1 unit increments. Grade 0: Normal, Grade 1: Trace, Grade 2: Mild, Grade 3: Moderate, Grade 4:Severe. The data was dichotomized into two group subjects with grade 3 or higher Conjunctival injection, and those subjects with less than Grade 3. Below the percentage of subject eyes with grade 3 or higher is reported for each lens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contact Lens Fitting</measure>
    <time_frame>8- 12 Days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>Contact Lens fitting is reported as a binary response. Yes- acceptable lens fit, No- unacceptable lens fit. The percentage of subject eyes with acceptable fit is reported.</description>

        <title>Overall Quality of Vision Using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) TM Questionnaire</title>
        <description>CLUE Overall Quality of Vision is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)TM questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3XSD).</description>

The data was dichotomized into two group subjects with grade 3 or higher staining, and those subjects with less than Grade 3.
