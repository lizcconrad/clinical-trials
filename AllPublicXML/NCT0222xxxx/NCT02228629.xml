    <textblock>
      Foot complications are a common and costly problem for subjects with diabetes. Although
      Medicare provides a pair of diabetic shoes yearly for subjects with diabetes, many do not
      wear their diabetic shoes in and around their house. Instead, subjects may wear shoes, such
      as flip flops or slippers, that provide little to no protection against injuries. While
      proper house shoe is important in the prevention of diabetic foot complications, this area
      has not received much attention. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess if CrocsRx
      Medical silver cloud clogs - a lightweight clog with protective toe box, cushioning soles,
      and easy to don and doff - offer reduced dynamic plantar pressure magnitude, as compared to
      conventional house shoes, for subjects with diabetes. A Repeated Measures ANOVA study design
      will be used to assess dynamic plantar pressure in 2 shod conditions for each subject with
      the order of shoes randomized.
