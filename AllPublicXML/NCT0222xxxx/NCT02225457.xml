  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity results from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, and are
      strongly associated with metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Obesity is
      defined as an excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health, a risk that is
      highly dependent upon the type of adipose tissue accumulation, whether visceral or
      sub-cutaneous, but also upon the characteristics of the fat tissue, especially inflammatory
      cells accumulation. Because of the well known sexual difference in fat accretion, this
      obesity-associated risk may also be very different for men and for women. In addition, recent
      data indicate that various factors such as the intestinal microbiota, but also the dietary
      intake of protective nutrients might be important determinants of the metabolic complications
      of obesity.

      Here we propose to: 1) study the metabolic adaptations and the mechanisms of adipose tissue
      accumulation during a period of controlled caloric over-nutrition, both in men and in women;
      2) evaluate the potential protective effects of a supplementation with polyphenols on insulin
      resistance and other metabolic adaptations.

      To achieve these goals, healthy male and female volunteers will be enrolled into a one month
      longitudinal, prospective study on the influence of hypercaloric overfeeding (+50% of daily
      caloric needs) on different tissues (adipose tissue, muscle and blood).

      They will be separated into two different groups: hypercaloric nutrition and placebo, and
      hypercaloric nutrition and polyphenols (2g/day), where polyphenols administration will be
      randomized and administered in a double blind fashion. Whole body and hepatic insulin
      sensitivity, total energy expenditure, glucose hepatic production, protein and gene
      expression in muscle, adipose tissue and blood as well as intestinal microbiota will be
      assessed at base line, and after one month of overfeeding.
