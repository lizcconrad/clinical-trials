  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase one of this study is a prospective, randomized (2:1), pilot study that will evaluate
      COBRA PzF vascular healing patterns and thrombus formation with Optical Coherence Tomography
      (OCT) at 3 months after stent implantation in comparison with Resolute Integrity drug eluting
      stent (DES). Patients in the COBRA PzF (Group 1) will receive dual anti platelets for one
      week followed by aspirin, while patients implanted with ZES (Group 2), will receive Dual
      anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) for at least 6 months followed by aspirin.

      After the completion of Phase 1, Phase 2 will enroll 10 patients in the COBRA PzF (Group 3).
      Patients in Group 3 will receive aspirin alone and have OCT at one month after the stent
      procedure to evaluate COBRA PzF vascular healing patterns and thrombus formation at one month
      follow up.
