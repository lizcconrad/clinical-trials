      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of topical
      Alprostadil on digital perfusion by laser Doppler capillary velocimetry and digital
      temperature recovery with thermography following standardized cold challenge and to assess
      the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of Alprostadil topical cream and placebo cream in
      adult subjects with a diagnosis of Raynaud's Phenomenon secondary to Systemic Sclerosis
      (SSc).
