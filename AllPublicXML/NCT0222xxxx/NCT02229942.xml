  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that a subgroup of patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ Myalgic
      Encephalopathy (CFS/ME) have a chronically activated immune system and may benefit from
      B-lymphocyte treatment using the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab with induction and
      maintenance treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have published a case series of pilot patient observations with B-cell depletion in
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ Myalgic Encephalopathy (CFS/ME) (Fluge and Mella, BMC Neurol,
      2009). Subsequently, we published a small randomized and double-blind phase II study using
      rituximab induction two infusions two weeks apart (Fluge et al, Plos One, 2011).

      We have completed an open label phase II study with 29 patients using rituximab induction and
      maintenance treatment (six rituximab infusions over 15 months, with follow-up for three
      years, unpublished).

      We hypothesize that a subgroup of patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ Myalgic
      Encephalopathy (CFS/ME) have a chronically activated immune system involving B-lymphocytes,
      possibly a variant of an autoimmune disease, and that patients may benefit from B-cell
      depletion therapy.

      Three substudies will be performed:

      Endothelial function: assessment of Flow-Mediated Dilation and skin microcirculation at
      baseline and repeated during the time interval 17-21 months.

      Cardiopulmonary exercise test for two following days: assessment at baseline and repeated
      during the time interval 17-21 months.

      Gastrointestinal function: assessment at baseline and repeated during the time interval 17-21
      months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue score, selfreported.</measure>
    <time_frame>Course of Fatigue score during 24 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Selfreported Fatigue score is registered every second week, as the mean score for the four symptoms: &quot;Post-exertional malaise&quot;, &quot;Fatigue&quot;, &quot;Need for rest&quot;, &quot;Daily functioning&quot; (scale 0-6). Mean Fatigue scores for the time intervals 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-20, 20-24 months are recorded for each patient. These data are used for statistical analysis. The difference in course of Fatigue score during 24 months follow-up, between the rituximab and placebo groups, will constitute the primary endpoint.
Overall response is recorded as the effect on CFS/ME symptoms during 24 months follow-up. The overall response is not predefined to a specific time interval, but is defined as mean Fatigue score at least 4.5 for at least 8 consecutive weeks for moderate response, and mean Fatigue score at least 5.0 for at least 8 consecutive weeks for major response. Single response periods and the sum of response periods during 24 months follow-up will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in SF-36 scores during 24 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 (ver 1.2) are selfreported by patients at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months follow-up. Changes in Physical health summary score, Physical function, and &quot;Mean of five subdimensions&quot; (Physical function, Bodily pain, Vitality, Social function, General health) are recorded. The difference in course during 24 months follow-up, between the rituximab and placebo groups, will constitute secondary endpoints.
Also, the difference between rituximab and placebo groups, in changes from baseline to recording at 18 months, for Physical health summary score, Physical function, and &quot;mean of five SF-36 subdimensions&quot;, constitute secondary endpoints.</description>

    <measure>Physical activity (Sensewear armband)</measure>
    <time_frame>Analyzed at baseline and at interval 17-21 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients' physical activity level, in a home setting for 7 consecutive days, is recorded using Sensewear armbands, with registration at baseline and repeated in the time interval 17-21 months follow-up. Changes from baseline to analysis during the time interval 17-21 months, for mean number of steps per 24h, maximum number of steps per 24h, mean duration per 24h with activity level at least 3.5 METs, max duration per 24h with activity level at least 3.5 METs, are recorded. The difference between rituximab and placebo groups will constitute secondary endpoints.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-recorded &quot;Function level&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Course during 24 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-recorded &quot;Function level&quot; (scale 0-100, compared to healthy state, according to a set of examples) are registered every second week. Mean &quot;Function level&quot; for the time intervals 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-20, 20-24 months are calculated. The difference in course of &quot;Function level&quot;, between the rituximab and placebo groups, constitute a secondary endpoint.
Also, the differences between the rituximab and placebo groups, for changes in selfreported &quot;Fatigue score&quot; and in selfreported &quot;Function level&quot;, calculated from baseline to the mean value during the time interval 16-20 months, constitute secondary endpoints.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is self-recorded at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24 months. The difference between the rituximab and placebo groups, in changes in FSS from baseline to 18 months follow-up, constitutes a secondary endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical response duration</measure>
    <time_frame>During 24 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response periods, defined as consecutive self-recorded Fatigue score at least 4.5 (scale 0-6) for a minimum of 8 weeks, during 24 months follow-up, are recorded.
The difference in the longest consecutive clinical response period, between rituximab and placebo groups, constitutes a secondary endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained clinical response at 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment at 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The difference between rituximab and placebo groups, in fraction of patients with sustained clinical response (defined as Fatigue score of at least 4.5) at 24 months, constitute a secondary endpoint.</description>
