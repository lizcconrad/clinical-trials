  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This thorough QT (TQT) study will take place in healthy subjects administered single doses of
      study drug. It will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled, 4-treatment
      crossover study. Subjects will be randomized in an equal ratio to one of 12 possible
      treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence will comprise all 4 treatments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization
      Phase will have 2 periods: Screening (up to 27 days) and Baseline Period 1 (1 day).
      Eligibility will be determined during the Screening Period. The Randomization Phase will
      consist of 8 periods: Treatment Period 1, Baseline Period 2, Treatment Period 2, Baseline
      Period 3, Treatment Period 3, Baseline Period 4, Treatment Period 4, and a Follow-Up Period.
      Each Baseline Period will last 1 day, followed by the corresponding treatment period. On the
      first day of each treatment period, subjects will receive a single dose of the assigned study
      drug. During each treatment period, subjects will be required to stay in the clinical unit
      from the baseline period to 24 hours postdose. Subjects will then be released from the clinic
      and will undergo a washout interval of at least 13 days, during which time they will return
      for additional PK sampling.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:

          1. Healthy, non-smoking, male or female subjects ages greater than or equal to 18 years
             to less than or equal to 55 years old at the time of informed consent

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 18 to less than or equal to 30 kg/m2
             at Screening

          3. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a
             negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG]). A separate baseline assessment is
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before
             the first dose of study drug.

          4. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse
             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception (eg, total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method
             [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], or have a vasectomized partner with
             confirmed azoospermia, but not oral contraceptive or contraceptive implant) throughout
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as described above if
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Hormonal contraceptives (oral or implant) are not permitted forms of
             contraception in this study. All females will be considered to be of childbearing
             potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive
             months, in the appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause) or
             have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least one month before dosing).

          5. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential
             or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the study
             period and for 90 days after study drug discontinuation.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          1. Clinically significant illness that requires medical treatment within 8 weeks or a
             clinically significant infection that requires medical treatment within 4 weeks before
             dosing

          2. Evidence of disease that may influence the outcome of the study within 4 weeks before
             dosing (eg, psychiatric disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver,
             kidney, respiratory system, endocrine system, hematological system, neurological
             system, or cardiovascular system, or subjects who have a congenital abnormality in
             metabolism)

          3. Any history of gastrointestinal surgery that may affect PK profiles of study drugs
             (eg, hepatectomy, nephrectomy, or digestive organ resection)

          4. Any clinically abnormal symptom or organ impairment found by medical history, physical
             examinations, vital signs, ECG finding, or laboratory test results that requires
             medical treatment at Screening or Baseline Periods

          5. History of any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             interfere with study procedures or compromise subject safety

          6. A prolonged QT/corrected QT interval (QTc) interval (QTc greater than 450 msec) as
             demonstrated by the mean of triplicate ECGs at Screening or Baseline Periods

          7. History of risk factors for torsade de pointes or the use of concomitant medications

         12. History of myocardial infarction or active ischemic heart disease

         13. History of clinically significant arrhythmia or uncontrolled arrhythmia

         14. Any other clinically significant ECG abnormalities at Screening or Baseline Periods

         15. Known history of clinically significant drug allergy (including to study drugs or any
             of their excipients) at Screening or Baseline

         16. Known history of food allergies or presently experiencing significant seasonal or
             perennial allergy at Screening or Baseline Periods

         17. Active viral hepatitis (B or C) as demonstrated by positive serology at Screening

         18. History of drug or alcohol dependency or abuse within the 2 years before Screening, or
             who have a positive urine drug or alcohol test at Screening or Baseline Periods

         19. Use of recreational drugs

         20. Intake of caffeinated beverages or food within 72 hours before dosing

         21. Intake of nutritional supplements, juice, and herbal preparations or other foods or
             beverages that may affect the various drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (eg,
             alcohol, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruit-containing beverages, apple or
             orange juice, vegetables from the mustard green family [eg, kale, broccoli,
             watercress, collard greens, kohlrabi, brussel sprouts, mustard], and charbroiled
             meats) within 1 week before dosing
