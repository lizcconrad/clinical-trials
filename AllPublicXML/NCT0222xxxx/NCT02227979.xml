  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to investigate whether the PURPLE Crying program attains
      efficacy by optimizing the neural response in the anterior insula, and augmenting activity in
      regions of the brain known to be important for emotion regulation.

      The aim is to determine the effects of the PURPLE Cry Intervention by investigating the
      following:

        -  independent variables that may affect a father's neural response to infant cries

        -  effects of the PURPLE cry intervention, compared to a control intervention, on fathers'
           reported aversiveness and empathy in response to cry stimuli

        -  effects of the PURPLE cry intervention, compared to a control intervention, on fathers'
           neural response to unknown infant cries compared to a tone control

        -  effects of the PURPLE cry intervention, compared to a control intervention, on fathers'
           neural responses to own infant cries compared to unknown infant cries

      The investigators hypothesize:

        -  prior to the PURPLE material, fathers' neural responses to infant cry stimuli will be
           modulated by the following variables: subjective self-reported emotional reaction to cry
           stimuli, hormone levels, sleep quality and quantity, sex of the infant, infant
           temperament, life stressors, parental expectations, personality (neuroticism), and
           father's own childhood experience

        -  fathers who receive the PURPLE material compared to those that receive the control
           intervention will report a larger decrease in aversiveness and a larger increase in
           empathy in response to cry stimuli

        -  fathers who receive the PURPLE material compared to those that receive the control
           intervention will show a larger decrease in activity in the anterior insula and amygdala
           in response to cry stimuli

        -  fathers who receive the PURPLE material compared to those that receive the control
           intervention will show a larger increase in activity in regions of the brain important
           for emotion regulation, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
           orbitofrontal PFC

        -  fathers' neural activity in the amygdala in response to their own infant's cry stimuli
           will be positively correlated with both their own and infant testosterone levels

      40 biological fathers of children age 2 months or younger who are currently cohabitating with
      the child's mother will be scanned on two separate occasions. The optional second visit will
      occur after 2 months have passed since the first scan. In the first visit, fathers will
      receive two MRI scans, one before and one after completing one of the two interventions.
      Prior to the MRI scan, a blood sample will be collected for measurement of hormone levels.
      Fathers will be positioned in the MRI scanner where they will receive structural and
      functional MRI scans of their brain while they listen to auditory stimuli: unknown cries, own
      cries, and tone controls. Blood sample collection and intervention will not be conducted
      during the second visit.
