    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to compare the level of effectiveness of two massage
      treatment schedules for chronic CIPN in people treated with Oxaliplatin or taxanes
      (docetaxel, paclitaxel) for their cancer (breast and gastrointestinal) . Researchers also
      want to study how participants may respond to massage treatments, and how the treatments may
      affect quality of life and physical performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common chemotherapy side effects affecting the
      nerves. Each year, thousands of patients receive oxaliplatin-based and taxane-based
      chemotherapy and more than 50% of these patients will have Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral
      Neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN can cause painful or abnormal skin sensation (such as pins and
      needles), numbness, and/or nerve damage that may affect movement.

      Baseline Visit:

      Participant has already had certain tests as part of participant's routine care that helped
      show that participant was eligible to take part in this study. If participant agrees to take
      part in this study, the following tests and procedures will be performed at participant's
      first study visit:

        -  Participant's vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate)
           will be measured.

        -  Participant's medical history will be recorded.

        -  Participant will be asked about any drugs participant may be taking and any side effects
           participant may be having.

        -  Participant will complete a pre-study questionnaire. This questionnaire will ask how
           participant feels about massage to treat CIPN. This questionnaire should take about 5
           minutes to complete.

        -  Participant will be asked basic demographic information. This questionnaire should take
           about 5 minutes to complete.

        -  Participant will complete 5 questionnaires about any symptoms participant may have. The
           questionnaires should take about 20-30 minutes to complete in total.

        -  Participant will perform leg function and balance tests. For these tests, participant
           will complete tasks such as walking and standing on 1 leg. These tests should take about
           20 minutes to complete. Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative urine
           pregnancy test. To take part in this study, the pregnancy test must be negative. The
           pregnancy test is free of charge to participant.

        -  If participant has not had a blood draw recently, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be
           drawn for routine tests.

      The study doctor will discuss the screening test results with participant. If the screening
      tests show that participant is not eligible to take part in the study, participant will not
      be enrolled. Other options will be discussed with participant.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      randomly assigned (as in the roll of a dice) to 1 of 4 groups. The location of the massage
      and the massage schedule will vary by group. Participant will either have massages 3 times a
      week for 4 weeks or 2 times a week for 6 weeks.

      Massage Treatments (All Participants):

      Participant's massage treatments will be given on an outpatient basis in private rooms. For
      participant's massage, participant will either lie on a table or sit in a reclined chair. The
      total time will be about 30 minutes, which includes positioning participant on the chair or
      table.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) time every week:

        -  Participant's vital signs will be measured.

        -  Participant will be asked about any drugs participant may be taking and any side effects
           participant may be having.

      At Weeks 3, 6, and 10 (for Groups 2 &amp; 4) and Weeks 2, 4, and 10 (for Groups 1 &amp; 3):

        -  Participant will complete the same 5 questionnaires.

        -  Participant will perform leg function and balance tests.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue participation on this study for up to 10 weeks, as long as the study
      doctor thinks it is participant's best interest. Participant's active participation in this
      study will be over after participant has completed the follow-up visit.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      After participant completes participant's final massage treatment, the following tests and/or
      procedures will be performed:

        -  Participant's vital signs will be measured.

        -  Participant's medical history will be recorded.

        -  Participant will be asked about any drugs participant may be taking and any side effects
           participant may be having.

        -  Participant will complete the same 5 questionnaires.

        -  Participant will perform leg function and balance tests.

        -  Participant will complete a brief exit interview that will ask about questions such as
           if participant thinks participant benefitted from the massage. This interview should
           take about 10 minutes to complete.

        -  If participant has not had a blood draw recently, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be
           drawn for routine tests.

      This is an investigational study. The use of massage treatments for chronic CIPN is
      investigational.

      Up to 90 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
