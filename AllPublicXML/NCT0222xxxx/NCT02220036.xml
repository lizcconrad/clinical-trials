    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial which will start at June 2014 and end on
      June 2015 in Isfahan city. Serum creatinine level is considered as a key variable and the
      sample size calculated 80 persons (40 persons for control group and 40 persons for patient
      group). Patients aged more than 18 years old with diabetic nephropathy having Fasting Blood
      Sugar more than 126 mg/dL and proteinuria 30-300 mg/dL (microalbuminuria) and Glomerular
      Filtration Rate more than 90 mL/min will be chosen. Patient group will receive magnesium
      supplement (250 milligram) and the other group will receive placebo which is similar to the
      magnesium tablets in color, odor and appearance both for 12 weeks. All subjects will complete
      4 physical activity and 4 dietary records. Outcome measurements including metabolic, renal
      and inflammatory profiles will be measured at the beginning and end of the study as well as
      anthropometric measurements.
