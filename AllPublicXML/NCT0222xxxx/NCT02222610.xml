      RRR is a phase II, randomized, multicenter, clinical study to assess the tolerability and
      efficacy of ranibizumab treatment administered in subjects with radiation retinopathy.
      Subjects will be randomized into one of 3 arms; IVT monthly vs. ranibizumab treatment
      administered IVT monthly combined with peripheral targeted photocoagulation vs. ranibizumab
      treatment administered IVT for three months followed by as needed treatment of ranibizumab
      combined with peripheral targeted photocoagulation over 48 weeks. From week 52 to week 101,
      all 3 treatment arms will employ a treat and extend protocol for IVT ranibizumab treatment.

    <description>Subject's will receive monthly treatment of an intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab for 48 weeks.
Starting at week 52, subject's will enter a treat &amp; extend regime, if a subject achieves a &quot;dry&quot; macula. For a macula to be considered &quot;dry&quot; persistent or recurrent fluid must be resolved on SD-OCT. The interval between injections will not exceed 12 weeks. After a subject is extended beyond 4-weeks &amp; develops recurrent disease activity, the eye is treated &amp; the treatment interval for the next visit is reduced by 1 week, compared to the previous treatment interval. The interval between treatments will be reduced by 1-week intervals until a dry macula is again established. Once a dry macula is again achieved, the interval between visits will be extended by 1-week intervals again.</description>

After the first session of TRP, subjects will have a repeat wide field angiogram at 12 weeks &amp; 24 weeks &amp; will receive additional TRP as needed (PRN) to areas of peripheral retinal ischemia.

             within the last 3 years. Radiation retinopathy is defined as any of the following:

             contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction
             with spermicidal gel, an intrauterine device (IUD), or contraceptive hormone implant
             or patch.

             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated.

          -  Participation in any other simultaneous medical investigation or trial

          -  Previous participation in any studies involving investigational drugs within 30 days
             before Day 0 (excluding vitamins and minerals).

             days of Day 0

          -  History of vitrectomy

             investigator, could:

               -  Require medical or surgical intervention during the 12 month study period to
                  prevent or treat visual loss that might result from that condition.

               -  Contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of BCVA over the
                  12-month study period, if allowed to progress untreated.

             subject is seated). If the subject's initial reading exceeds these values, a second
             reading may be taken at least 30 minutes later. If the subject requires
             antihypertensive medication, the subject can become eligible if medication is taken
             continuously for at least 14 days prior to Day 0 and blood pressure is less that
             180/110 mmHg.

          -  New diagnosis of atrial fibrillation not managed by subject's primary care physician
             or cardiologist within 3 months of Day 0.

             giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of
             an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the
             study or renders the subject at high risk for treatment complications.
