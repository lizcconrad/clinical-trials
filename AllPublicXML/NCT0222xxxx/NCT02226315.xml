    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the clinical performance of massively parallel sequencing (MPS)
      using the MaterniT21 PLUS LDT in the detection of fetal aneuploidy in circulating cfDNA
      extracted from a maternal blood sample obtained from women pregnant with a multiple gestation
      who were at increased risk for fetal aneuploidy.
