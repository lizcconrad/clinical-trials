      Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease characterized by
      synovial hyperplasia and joint damage leading to clinically significant functional
      impairment. In RA, for some unknown reason, immune cells infiltrate into synovium of joint
      and produce the 'rheumatoid factor', prostaglandins, cytokines and other mediators. It
      damages joint and cartilage, even other organs. 80% of the RA patients have Rheumatoid factor
      which is caused by high expression ratio of auto-antibodies in blood. Produced immune
      complexes, immune cells and antigen-presenting cells(including macrophages, B cells,
      dendritic cells) activate and release cytokines and then synovial tissue becomes thickened
      and damaged.

      It has been reported that synthetic DMARDs(disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) including
      methotrexate(MTX), sulfasalazine and biological DMARDs such as tumor necrosis factors(TNF)-α
      blockers, abatacept and rituximab, often in combination with MTX, are effective. But they
      still are limited by lack or loss of efficacy in certain patients and serious complications
      such as serious infections and malignancies. So, there is a need to identify new treatment.

      FURESTEM-RA Inj. is composed of allogeneic hUCB-MSC(human Umbilical Cord Blood
      derived-Mesenchymal Stem cell). hUCB-MSCs are mesenchymal stem cells from umbilical cord
      blood. Mesenchymal stem cells are well-known for immunosuppression, anti-inflammatory ability
      and capable of differentiating into a wide range of cell types including osteocytes and
      chondrocytes. Therefore, FURESTEM-RA Inj. has huge possibility as cell therapy products for
      RA patients.
