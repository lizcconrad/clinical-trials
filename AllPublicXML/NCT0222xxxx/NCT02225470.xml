  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as an open-label randomized parallel two-arm multicenter efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics and safety study of intravenously administered eribulin versus intravenously
      administered vinorelbine in Chinese population. Eligible female subjects will have measurable
      disease according to RECIST 1.1 with the modification that chest x-ray cannot be used for
      assessment of disease.

          1. Female subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the
             breast:

          2. Subjects with locally recurrent or metastatic disease who have received at least two,
             and a maximum of five, prior chemotherapeutic regimens for breast cancer, at least two
             of which were administered for treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic disease.
             Prior therapy must be documented by the following criteria prior to entry onto study:

               1. Regimens must have included an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin), and
                  a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel) in any combination or order. Prior
                  treatment with any of these agents is not required if the agents are
                  contraindicated for a prospective subject and documented in her medical history.

               2. Some of these regimens may have been administered as adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant
                  therapy, but at least two must have been given for locally recurrent or
                  metastatic disease.

               3. Subjects must have proven refractory to the most recent chemotherapy as
                  documented by progression on or within 6 months of their last chemotherapy.

               4. Subjects with Her2/neu positive tumors may also have been treated with any
                  Her2/neu targeted agents including antibodies, small compounds or investigational
                  drugs.

               5. Subjects may also have been treated with antihormonal therapy.

          3. Have measurable disease meeting the following criteria:

                  diameter for a lymph node which is serially measurable according to RECIST 1.1
                  using computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI). If there is
                  only one target lesion and it is a non-lymph node, it should have a longest
                  diameter of greater than or equal to 1.5 cm.

                  such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation must show evidence of progressive disease
                  based upon RECIST 1.1 to be used as a target lesion.

             platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L.

          9. Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the
             upper limits of normal (ULN); and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase

             the case of liver metastases less than or equal to 5.0 times ULN).

         10. Subject willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the
             study.

         11. All female subjects will be considered to be of child-bearing potential unless they
             are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrhea, in the appropriate age
             group and without other known or suspected cause), or have been sterilized surgically
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation greater than or equal to 1 menstrual cycle prior to
             randomization, or have undergone a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy).

             Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use two forms of highly
             effective contraception from the last menstrual period prior to randomization (or use
             a double barrier method as described below until they are on two forms of highly
             effective contraception for at least one menstrual cycle), during study treatment, and
             for 3 months after the final dose of study treatment. Female subjects exempt from this
             requirement are subjects who practice total abstinence. If currently abstinent, the
             subject must agree to use a double barrier method of contraception, i.e. condom and
             occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicide or until they are on
             two forms of highly effective contraception for at least one menstrual cycle if they
             become sexually active during study treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of
             study treatment. Highly effective contraception includes:

               1. Placement of intrauterine device or system,

               2. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault cap) with spermicide,

               3. Established hormonal contraceptive methods: oral, injectable or implant. Female
                  subjects who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of
                  the same hormonal contraceptive product from the last menstrual period prior to
                  randomization, and must continue to use the same hormonal contraceptive product
                  during study treatment, and for 3 months after the final dose of study treatment,

               4. Vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia.

         12. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and
             ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol, with the understanding that the
             patient may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice.
