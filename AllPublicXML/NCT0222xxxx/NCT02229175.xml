  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, diabetic macular edema is treated is through injection of a medications such as
      off-label bevacizumab, which decreases the swelling in the retina. These injections are
      sometimes required monthly until the condition is controlled. Recently, there have been some
      new FDA approved treatments using laser that decrease the swelling. These approximately ten
      minute treatments do not require injections and don't cause permanent damage to the eye, and
      they may decrease the number of injections one needs to get to treat diabetic macular edema
      (DME).

      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether subvisible laser in
      combination with intravitreal bevacizumab is non-inferior compared to current standard of
      care (intravitreal bevacizumab alone) in achieving favorable outcomes for visual acuity, mean
      macular thickness, and patient quality of life, and has fewer needed intravitreal bevacizumab
      injections throughout the course of the 12 month study period.

      The patient is randomized into one of two study groups described below.

        -  Group 1: Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) will be administered at the first 3 monthly
           visits and subvisible laser treatment will be administered at the first visit. The the
           patient will undergo monthly visits, as he/she would with standard of care treatment,
           allowing for retreatment with monthly IVB and laser treatment every 3 months if defined
           retreatment criteria are met, as determined by a physician.

        -  Group 2: Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) will be administered at the first 3 monthly
           visits. The patient will then undergo monthly exams, as he or she would with standard of
           care treatment, allowing for retreatment with monthly IVB if defined retreatment
           criteria are met, as determined by a physician. The patient may also undergo sham laser
           treatment (he/she will be placed in front of laser but no laser will be activated) so
           that the patient isn't made aware of which treatment group he/she is a part of.

      Other data that will be collected throughout the study at monthly examinations:

        -  Monthly Snellen Visual acuity test

        -  Monthly spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging using standard
           clinic protocol monthly

        -  Standard clinic diabetic montage Fundus photos at months 0,6,12

        -  Fluorescein angiography at months 0, 6, 12

      The subjects' visit schedules will be the same as for routine standard of care for the IVB
      injection procedure. There are no additional appointments for this study.

      All study procedures will be done at San Francisco General Hospital
