  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of the investigational drug
      DCC-2701 and whether it will work to help people who have advanced solid tumors or cancer
      that has spread to other parts of the body.

      This is a first-in-human study of DCC-2701. The primary purpose of this study is to determine
      what dose of DCC-2701, can be given safely to patients with advanced solid tumors.

      The study will have two phases. The first phase will assess escalating doses of DCC-2701 in
      order to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and the optimal dosing regimen (ODR) of
      DCC-2701. Once the MTD and ODR is established, a dose expansion phase will further evaluate
      the safety of DCC-2701, as well as the activity of DCC-2701 in select solid tumor types.
