  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease and stroke are the most common cause of death in Ireland today.One of the main
      risk factors for heart disease and stroke is high blood pressure or hypertension. Research
      has found that certain specific proteins or peptides found in foods such as dairy, meat, fish
      and eggs may promote heart health reducing blood pressure in adults with hypertension. The
      aim of this study is to investigate the potential beneficial effects egg peptides may have on
      heart health, in particular, effects on blood pressure.

    <textblock>
      Poor dietary habits of Irish adults has been accompanied by epidemics of obesity and
      metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes leading to a substantial predicted increase in
      the prevalence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease.Hypertension is a major
      contributing factor to the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Dietary
      factors play a significant role in the prevention and/or treatment of hypertension and
      therefore the development of foods with antihypertensive properties could prove beneficial.
