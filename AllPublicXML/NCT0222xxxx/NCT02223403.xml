  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrate-rich beetroot juice supplementation has demonstrated reduced oxygen consumption and
      submaximal exercise performance in healthy adults. Investigation for similar effects in
      patients with heart failure has not previously been conducted.

      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Following ingestion of the
      active agent or placebo, subjects with systolic heart failure underwent submaximal steady
      state exercise with gas exchange analysis followed thirty minutes later by a six minute walk
      test. Second testing sessions were performed ten days.

      There were no significant differences in the treatment and placebo arms in average oxygen
      consumption or six minute walk distance.

      In conclusion, in patients with heart failure who have ingested a single dose of nitrate-rich
      beetroot juice concentrate, there is no significant difference with regard to oxygen
      consumption during submaximal steady state exercise or six minute walk testing distance.

      Further study is warranted to determine the true efficacy of nitrate consumption in this
      population with adjustments in acute or chronic dosing, exercise duration, or intensity.
