      An assessor-blinded randomized case control study in an IVF center, England UK will randomise
      women into 'music' (listened to self-selected music during embryo transfer) or 'control' (no
      music) groups. Participants will complete the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory prior
      to, and immediately following a post-treatment observation period. Total scores will be
      compared.
