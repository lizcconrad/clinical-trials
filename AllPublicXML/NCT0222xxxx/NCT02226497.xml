    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies a home telemonitoring device in managing the
      care of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia after they are
      discharged from the hospital following chemotherapy. After treatment and hospital discharge,
      patients typically need extensive care to deal with the side effects of chemotherapy, keep up
      with medications, and obtain medical assistance. A home telemonitoring device would allow
      patients to monitor vital signs, symptoms, and use of medications, communicate with
      healthcare providers, and access educational material. A telemonitoring device may allow
      patients to be managed more effectively than standard outpatient care after being discharged
      from the hospital.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of home telemonitoring for adult patients following intensive
      induction, re-induction/salvage, or consolidation chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) or non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the impact of the telemonitoring intervention on mortality, duration of
      hospital stay, use of emergency services, visits to primary care physicians and to
      specialists, home visits, and telephone calls (health care resource utilization).

      II. To evaluate the telemonitoring procedure in economic terms compared to usual care through
      a cost-effectiveness analysis.

      III. To estimate the impact on the quality of life of study participating.

      IV. To assess the degree of satisfaction of the patients/caregivers and health care
      professionals with the telemonitoring intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (CONTROL): Patients receive standard outpatient supportive care after completion of
      chemotherapy.

      ARM II (INTERVENTION): Patients receive standard outpatient supportive care as in Arm I and
      use the home telemonitoring device for the duration of chemotherapy-induced cytopenia (up to
      3-4 weeks).
