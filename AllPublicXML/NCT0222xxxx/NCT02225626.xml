        Inclusion criteria:

          -  healthy male according to the investigatorÂ´s assessment, based on a complete medical
             history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure (BP), pulse rate
             (PR)), 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg or diastolic
             blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Repeated measurement of pulse rate &lt; 50 bpm and &gt; 90 bpm at screening

          -  Serum creatinine laboratory value outside the normal range

          -  estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to CKD-EPI-Creatinine Formula &lt;
             90 ml/ min

          -  Current or history of relevant kidney, urinary tract diseases or abnormalities (i.e.
             nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, acute or chronic nephritis, renal injury, renal
             failure, infections)

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator Repeated measurement of pulse rate &lt; 50 bpm and &gt; 90 bpm at screening

          -  Serum creatinine laboratory value outside the normal range

          -  estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to CKD-EPI-Creatinine Formula &lt;
             90 ml/ min
