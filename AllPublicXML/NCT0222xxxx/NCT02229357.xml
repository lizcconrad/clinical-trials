      This study aim to compare immunogenicity of the inactivated H5 influenza vaccine single dose
      between subjects previously vaccinated with LAIV H5N2 and naïve subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a non-randomized, open label study to evaluate a licensed OrniFlu® inactivated vaccine
      (produced by Microgen Russia) which will be given to healthy adult volunteers who
      participated in a double blind placebo-controlled study Protocol No.: GPO AVIAN FLU
      Vaccine-V02-2 at Vaccine Trial Centre and Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty
      of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University in February to May 2013.

      A total of 60 subjects, of whom 40 received two doses of LAIV H5N2 (prime-boost group), and
      20 received placebo (control group) in the previous study will be asked to return to the
      clinic to receive a single dose of an inactivated H5 influenza vaccine.

      Total foloww up is 90 days.
