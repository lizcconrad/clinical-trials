    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind comparative study examining the effectiveness of the rTMS
      treatment on Freezing of Gait (FOG) phenomenon in patients with Parkinson's disease. We
      hypothesize that treatment using rTMS stimulation on frontal lobe areas will improve gait
      quality and decrease the frequency of FOG in patients with Parkinson's disease.

      A course of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered over
      the supplementary motor area (SMA) improves motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's
      disease (PD).

      The present study is a comparative study that examines the effectiveness of rTMS treatment
      technique Freezing of Gait (FOG) phenomenon in Parkinson's disease patients. We hypothesize
      that treatment using rTMS stimulation on frontal areas will decreasing frequency of FOGs in
      patients with Parkinson's disease and improve gait quality and quality of life.

    <description>Participants will receive treatment at a frequency of 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks (12 sessions). In each session patient will receive repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation using a stimulation frequency of 10 Hz for half an hour.
The treatment is done by attaching an electromagnetic coil to the scalp using a special hat. Each patient has a personal hat which serves him throughout the entire process. The treatment is performed without anesthesia and patient fully conscious. During the treatment he sits comfortably on a chair, meanwhile the magnetic field passes through the skull into the brain.</description>
