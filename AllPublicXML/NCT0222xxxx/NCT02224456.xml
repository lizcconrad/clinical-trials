  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Hepatitis B infection (CHB) is known as the most frequently identified cause of liver
      disease that predisposes patients to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is the key driver of liver injury and disease
      progression. Majority of Chinese patients are infected with genotype B and C HBV, which is
      different from Caucasian counterparts. This prospective multi-center cohort open-label study
      is designed to investigate the long-term effect of TDF on prevention of HCC and disease
      progression as well as to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term TDF in Chinese CHB
      subjects with advanced liver diseases. The study will enrol 240 subjects.

    <description>Histological improvement is defined as a reduction of two or more points in the Knodell necroinflammatory score with no increase in fibrosis. Knodell necroinflammatory score consists of 4 categories: piecemeal necrosis (scores from 0 to 4), confluent necrosis (scores from 0 to 6), Focal (spotty) lytic necrosis, apoptosis and focal inflammation (scores from 0 to 4) and Portal inflammation (scores from 0 to 4).

    <time_frame>Week 216</time_frame>
    <description>Reversal of cirrhosis is defined as a reduction of one or more points in the Ishak score and no evidence of cirrhosis. The Ishak fibrosis score is a scoring system (ranging from 0 to 6) that measures the degree of fibrosis (scarring) of the liver, which is caused by chronic necroinflammation (an inflammatory process in the liver including or leading to death of liver cells). A score of 0 represents no fibrosis, and a score of 6 represents definite cirrhosis</description>

Adverse events will be summarised by treatment group, and by body system and event within each body system. Laboratory assessments include hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis</description>
