  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of 100 patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with the left Heart failure
      scheduled for elective pulmonary arterial denervation (PADN) are randomized 1:1 to either
      PADN or control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure patients must have completed the right heart catheterization. All the patients
      accepted the optimal medical therapies,including diuretics, Nitrate esters, β-blockers, ACE
      inhibitors or receptor blocker aldosterone antagonists and/or digoxin).The patients of
      pulmonary hypertension are defined into two groups: &quot;passive&quot; pulmonary hypertension(mPAP≥25
      mmHg, PCWP&gt;15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance&lt;2.5 woods unit) increase due to backward
      transmission of increased left ventricular filling pressure, &quot;reactive&quot; pulmonary
      hypertension (mPAP≥25 mmHg, PCWP&gt;15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance &gt;2.5 woods unit)
      increase in resistance due to either pulmonary vasoconstriction or structural changes in the
      pulmonary vasculature.

      All the &quot;reactive&quot; pulmonary hypertension patients are eligible for the randomized study in
      PADN group or control group according to the computer generated random table.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of pulmonary embolism</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The safety endpoint is the accuracy of pulmonary embolism (PE). Suspected PE with one of the following:
new intra-luminal filling defect on CT scan, MRI scan, or pulmonary angiogram;
new perfusion defect of at least 75% on V/Q lung scan;
inconclusive spiral CT, pulmonary angiography or lung scan with demonstration of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities by venography
Fatal PE is:
PE based on objective diagnostic testing or autopsy or
death not attributed to a documented cause and for which deep vein thrombosis/PE cannot be ruled out.</description>

    <description>Contrast pulmonary artery （PA) angiography was performed to localize the pulmonary artery bifurcation level and calculate the PA diameter.Once the anatomy was deemed acceptable, the radiofrequency ablation catheter was introduced into ostium of the left PA, ostium of the right PA , and the distal bifurcation area of the main PA.This was then maneuvered within the PA to allow energy delivery in a circumferential manner to ensure that the electrodes were tightly in contact with the endovascular surface. About four to eight ablations at 10 W for 60 seconds each were performed in ostium of the left PA, ostium of the right PA , and the distal bifurcation area of the main PA.</description>
