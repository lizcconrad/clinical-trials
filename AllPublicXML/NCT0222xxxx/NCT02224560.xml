      with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 1:1:1 randomized, double-blind, 14-week comparison of two Dose Levels of
      GWP42003-P versus placebo. The treatment period will consist of a two-week titration period
      followed by a 12-week maintenance period. The study will aim to determine the efficacy,
      safety and tolerability GWP42003-P compared with placebo. The High Dose Level will be as
      recommended by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) after assessment of safety and
      pharmacokinetic data from Part A of study GWEP1332. The Low Dose Level will be defined as 50%
      of the High Dose Level. The first subject will not enroll into this study until the DSMC has
      reviewed the safety data from Part A of study GWEP1332.

      Following study completion, all subjects will be invited to continue to receive GWP42003-P in
      an open label extension (OLE) study (under a separate protocol).

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be male or female aged between two and 55 years (inclusive).

          -  Subject must have a documented history of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This includes
             written documentation of having met electroencephalogram (EEG) diagnostic criteria
             during the patient's history and evidence of at least one type of generalized seizure,
             including drop seizures (atonic, tonic, tonic-clonic or myoclonic) for at least six
             months.

          -  Subjects who have a history of slow (&lt;2.5 Hz) spike-and-wave pattern in an EEG prior
             to the enrollment into the baseline period.

          -  Subjects should be refractory; that is having documented failures on more than one
             antiepileptic drug (AED).

          -  Subject must be taking one or more AEDs at a dose which has been stable for at least
             four weeks prior to screening.

          -  All medications or interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet and vagus
             nerve stimulation [VNS]) must have been stable for four weeks prior to screening and
             patient is willing to maintain a stable regimen throughout the study. The ketogenic
             diet and VNS treatments are not accounted as an AED.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Etiology of subject's seizures is a progressive neurologic disease. Subjects with
             tuberous sclerosis will not be excluded from study participation, unless there is a
             progressive tumor.

          -  Subject has had an anoxic episode requiring resuscitation within six months of
             screening.

          -  Subject has clinically significant unstable medical conditions other than epilepsy.

          -  Subject has had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically significant illness in
             the four weeks prior to screening or randomization, other than epilepsy.

          -  Subject is currently using or has in the past used recreational or medicinal cannabis,
             or synthetic cannabinoid based medications (including Sativex®) within the three
             months prior to study entry and is unwilling to abstain for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the
             excipients of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), such as sesame oil.

          -  Subject has been part of a clinical trial involving another IMP in the previous six
             months.

          -  Subject has significantly impaired hepatic function at screening (Visit 1) or
             randomization (Visit 2) (Alanine aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;5 x upper limit of normal
             [ULN] or total bilirubin [TBL] &gt;2 x ULN) OR the ALT or Aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST) &gt;3 x ULN and (TBL &gt;2 x ULN or international normalized ratio &gt;1.5). This
             criterion can only be confirmed once the laboratory results are available; subjects
             randomized into the study who are later found not to meet this criterion should be
             withdrawn from the study.

          -  Any history of suicidal behavior or any suicidal ideation of type four or five on the
             Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale in the last month or at screening.

          -  Subject is taking more than four concurrent AEDs.

          -  Subject has taken corticotropins in the six months prior to screening.

          -  Subject is currently taking long-term systemic steroids (excluding inhaled medication
             for asthma treatment) or any other daily medication known to exacerbate epilepsy. An
             exception will be made of prophylactic medication, for example, idiopathic nephrotic
             syndrome or asthma.

          -  Subject is taking felbamate, and they have been taking it for less than one year prior
             to screening.
