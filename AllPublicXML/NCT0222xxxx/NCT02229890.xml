        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male inpatients

          -  Age 18 - 80 years

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke causing a measurable neurological deficit
             defined as impairment of language, motor function, cognition, gaze, vision and/or
             neglect. Ischemic stroke is defined as an event characterized by sudden onset of acute
             focal neurological deficit, presumed to be caused by cerebral ischemia, after CT scan
             exclusion of hemorrhage

          -  Onset of symptoms within 3 hours prior to initiation of thrombolysis treatment

          -  Stroke symptoms present for at least 30 minutes and not significantly improved before
             treatment. Symptoms must be distinguishable from an episode of generalized ischemia
             (i.e. syncope), seizure, or migraine disorder

          -  Patients are willing to receive thrombolysis treatment and to give informed consent
             with regard to retrieval and storage of data and follow up procedures, according to
             the regulations in participating countries

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with the observational study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on the CT-scan.

          -  Symptoms of ischemic attack began more than 3 hours prior to infusion start or when
             time of symptom onset is unknown

          -  Symptoms of acute ischemic stroke that were either rapidly improving or only minor
             before start of infusion

          -  Severe stroke as assessed clinically and/or by appropriate imaging techniques

          -  Seizure at onset of stroke

          -  History of previous stroke or serious head-trauma within three months

          -  Administration of heparin within the previous 48 hours preceding the onset of stroke
             with an elevated activated thromboplastin time (aPTT) at presentation

          -  A combination of previous stroke and concomitant diabetes

          -  Platelet count of below 100,000/mm³

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt;185 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg, or aggressive
             management (repeated IV medication) necessary to reduce BP to these limits.

          -  Blood glucose &lt;50 or &gt; 400 mg/dl

          -  Significant bleeding disorder at present or within the past 6 months, known
             hemorrhagic diathesis

          -  Patients receiving oral anticoagulants, e.g. warfarin sodium (INR&gt;1.3)

          -  History or evidence or suspicion of intracranial hemorrhage including sub-arachnoid
             hemorrhage

          -  Severe uncontrolled arterial hypertension

          -  Any history of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or
             spinal surgery)

          -  Hemorrhagic retinopathy, e.g. in diabetes (vision disturbances may indicate
             hemorrhagic retinopathy) or other hemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions

          -  Bacterial endocarditis, pericarditis

          -  Prolonged or traumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&gt;2 minutes), obstetrical
             delivery within the past 10 days, recent puncture of a non-compressible blood-vessel
             (e.g. subclavian or jugular vein puncture)

          -  Acute pancreatitis

          -  Documented ulcerative gastrointestinal disease during the last 3 months

          -  Arterial aneurysm, arterial/venous malformation

          -  Neoplasm with increased bleeding risk

          -  Severe hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension
             (oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis

          -  Major surgery or significant trauma in past 10 days (this includes any trauma
             associated with current acute myocardial infarction), recent trauma to head or cranium

          -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance alteplase or to any of the excipients
