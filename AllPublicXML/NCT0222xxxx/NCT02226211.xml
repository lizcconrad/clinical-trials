  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic airway devices (SGA) become a routine part of the daily anesthesia practice.
      they can be used as primary airway devices or as conduits for endoracheal intubation and they
      become an integral part in the recent guidelines for managing difficult airway.

      Air-Q ILA has been used successfully as 1ry airway and also as a conduits for endotracheal
      intubation.

      The Ambu® Aura-i TM laryngeal mask is a new disposable SGA claimed to have special advantage
      over the competitors but not will studied as a conduit for endoracheal intubation.

      This study is designed to compare the performance of Ambu®Aura-i™ laryngeal mask with the
      air-Q ILA as conduits for fiberoptic-guided tracheal intubation in adult population.

    <description>The size selection of the air-Q ILA will follow the manufacture guideline to be size 3.5 for females and size 4.5 for males After induction of general anesthesia, the devices will be inserted by using midline insertion technique, then cuff will be inflated according to manufacture recommendations.
After successful insertion of the air-Q, the appropriate endoracheal tube (ETT) will be loaded over the fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and the connector will be removed too. The bronchoscope will be introduced and advanced throughout the airway tube to just proximal to ventilating orifice, a video image of the fiberoptic view will be recorded and saved on CD to be graded later by an independent observe. The fiberoptic then will be advanced and once the carina is seen, the ETT is will be slided into the trachea.
After successful intubation, the device will be removed according to the manufactures guides using removal stylet .</description>

    <description>The size selection of the device will follow the manufacture guideline according to the patient weight, size 4 for (50-70kg), size 5 (70-100) and size 6 (&gt; 100kg).
After induction of general anesthesia, the devices will be inserted by using midline insertion technique, then cuff will be inflated according to manufacture recommendations.
After successful insertion of the aura-i, the appropriate endoracheal tube (ETT) will be loaded over the fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and the connector will be removed too. The bronchoscope will be introduced and advanced throughout the airway tube to just proximal to ventilating orifice, a video image of the fiberoptic view will be recorded and saved on CD to be graded later by an independent observe. The fiberoptic then will be advanced and once the carina is seen, the ETT is will be slided into the trachea.
After successful intubation, the device will be removed according to the manufactures guides using another ETT.</description>
