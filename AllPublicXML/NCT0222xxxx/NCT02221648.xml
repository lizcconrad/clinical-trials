      The scientific aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of abobotulinumtoxinA
      (Dysport - Ipsen Pharmaceuticals) in chronic low back pain.

      The investigators hypothesis is that injection of Dysport brand of botulinum toxin type A
      into erector spinae muscles (extensors of the spine) can relieve low back pain through
      anti-spasm and analgesic effect of botulinum toxin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. A
      total of 90 patients will be enrolled in the study. The study will be conducted over 4
      months. It includes 4 visits and 4 telephone calls. Patients with chronic low back pain (&gt;3
      months) who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and wish to participate in the study may be
      enrolled. Those who become enrolled will be scheduled for a baseline visit (Week 0). During
      the baseline visit, subjects will be given the official approved consent form to read and ask
      questions. Participants to this study will also receive a copy of the Dysport Risk Evaluation
      and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) statement. After obtaining informed consent signed by the
      subject, the subjects will be randomization into the Dysport or placebo group. The
      randomizing will be performed by a nurse and the information will be kept in a pass-worded
      computer. Blinding means that neither the participant nor the clinical rater will know which
      group the participant has been initially been assigned.

      Each subject will have a neurological examination and fill a demographic form and complete
      four rating questionnaires (appendix II-V). These include a visual analogue scale for pain (0
      to 10) and three quality of life questionnaires which depict quality of life (the American
      Chronic Pain Association's Quality of Life Scale), how pain affects ability to manage
      everyday life (Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire), and overall physical and
      emotional health (Short Form-36). Patients will then receive an injection of either
      abobotulinumA (Dysport) or normal saline. Dysport or saline will be administered into the
      paraspinal muscles (extensors or erector spinae) at five levels (L1-L5), regardless of pain
      location. In the case of unilateral pain, this would amount to 500 units total, and in the
      case of bilateral pain, to 1000 units total, of Dysport per session.

      The primary outcome of the study is number of patients with VAS &lt; 4 ( no or subtle pain) at
      week 6 after placebo or Dysport injection.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants With Mild or no Pain on Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure in this protocol is the proportion of subjects that have VAS &lt;4 (patients with no or mild pain) at week 6. The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a line 10 centimeters in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. For pain intensity, the scale is anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 10).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Improved Pain Using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's pain has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as:
No change (or condition has gotten worse) (1) Almost the same, hardly any change at all (2) A little better, but no noticeable change (3) Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference (4) Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change (5) Better and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference (6) A great deal better and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference (7)
This outcome is number of patients who chose a 6 or above on the PGIC 6 weeks after treatment</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Showing Improvement on Quality of Life Scale for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Scale: A Measure of Function for People With Pain was developed by the American Chronic Pain Association (ACPA). The patient is asked to rank their quality of life on a scale of zero (non-functioning) to 10 (normal quality of life). Improvement was defined as 2 or more grades of improvement on the scale.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With Mild or no Pain on Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure in this protocol is the proportion of subjects that have VAS &lt;4 (patients with no or mild pain) at week 6. The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a line 10 centimeters in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. For pain intensity, the scale is anchored by “no pain” (score of 0) and “worst imaginable pain” (score of 10).</description>

No change (or condition has gotten worse) (1) Almost the same, hardly any change at all (2) A little better, but no noticeable change (3) Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference (4) Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change (5) Better and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference (6) A great deal better and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference (7)

        <description>The Quality of Life Scale: A Measure of Function for People With Pain was developed by the American Chronic Pain Association (ACPA). The patient is asked to rank their quality of life on a scale of zero (non-functioning) to 10 (normal quality of life). Improvement was defined as 2 or more grades of improvement on the scale.</description>
