      This study is to find out the imaging marker and the changing laws of the marker during the
      course of the disease. The final purpose is to provide scientific evidence for new
      prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

      It is an urgent problem in the field of cognitive neuroscience to tell the conversion
      progression of amnestic mild cognitive impairment(aMCI) patients with
      Apolipoproteinε4(APOEε4) to Alzheimer's Disease(AD). Based on our preliminary work, we will
      study the special group of aMCI patients with APOEε4 with multi-modality magnetic resonance
      imaging (resting-state functional MRI, structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging)
      longitudinally. Besides, we will also detect the APOE genotype of each sample and enlarge the
      sample size. According to situation of the conversion or non-conversion and differences in
      the conversion progression, we will analyze the data between the inter-groups and
      intra-groups, compare the imaging data of baseline and follow-up, find the prediction imaging
      marker of AD and optimize the reliability and validity.
