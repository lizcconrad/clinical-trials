        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Have advanced or metastatic cancer and be an appropriate candidate for experimental
             therapy.

          -  Have adequate organ function.

          -  Prior Treatments:

               -  Systemic treatments: Must have discontinued previous systemic treatments for
                  cancer and recovered from the acute effects of therapy. Participants must have
                  discontinued:

                    -  Cytotoxic therapies or targeted agents that are small molecule inhibitors
                       for 5 half-lives or at least 28 days.

                    -  Mitomycin-C or nitrosourea therapy for at least 42 days and biologic agents
                       for at least 28 days.

               -  Radiation therapy and surgery must be completed 4 weeks prior to therapy, except
                  for limited field radiation therapy, which must be completed 2 weeks before
                  therapy.

          -  If participant is of reproductive potential, must agree to use medically approved

             dose of study drug.

          -  If the participant is a female of childbearing potential, must have had a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days of the first dose of study drug and must
             not be breast feeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Must not have taken an unapproved drug as treatment for any indication within the last
