    <textblock>
      In this study a new means of communication for people with locked-in syndrome will be tested.
      The investigators will record brain signals directly from the surface of the brain by means
      of a completely implantable system. These brain signals are fed wirelessly into an assistive
      technology device and will control this device for communication and environmental control at
      the users home.

    <textblock>
      In this pilot study we will provide locked-in people with a new means of communication which
      has not been possible up to now. For the first time, we will test whether we can record and
      decode neural signals obtained directly from the brain, for control over a computer. The
      target population is people with locked-in syndrome. For these patients there is no technique
      available to allow them to communicate unaided. We have developed a brain-computer interface
      (BCI) system that can read activity directly from the brain, and can convert the activity to
      a digital switch. The system, called the Utrecht Neural Prosthesis (UNP), consists of an
      implantable amplifier for electrical brain signals, a set of electrodes positioned on the
      surface of the brain and a wireless receiver, placed outside of the body. A dedicated
      computer will convert the signals to electrical pulses for standard Assistive Technology
      devices. The UNP can in principle enable the patient to engage in any activity that is
      offered by commercial Assistive Technology companies that can be performed with switch
      signals, for instance operating home apparatus or writing text. Most importantly, we aim to
      achieve unsupervised function of the BCI, meaning that the patient will be able to use it at
      home without the aid of researchers or other experts (but with minimal caregiver assistance).
