  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of dabigatran etexilate
      solution in children aged less than 1 year, to demonstrate comparable PK/PD relationship to
      older children and adults and to confirm dabigatran etexilate dosing algorithm for children
      aged less than 1 year.

    <description>Percentage of patients with Incidence of all bleeding events(major, clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) &amp; minor) during the treatment period (including the residual effect period).Bleeding events were classified as follow:
Major bleeding: 1) Fatal bleeding 2) Clinically overt bleeding associated with decrease in haemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL (20 g/L) in 24-h-period 3) Bleeding that was retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial, or otherwise involved the central nervous system 4) Bleeding that required surgical intervention in an operating suite. CRNM bleeding: 1) Overt bleeding for which a blood product was administered &amp; which was not directly attributable to the patient's underlying medical condition 2) Bleeding that required medical or surgical intervention to restore haemostasis, other than in an operating suite. Minor bleeding defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that did not fulfil the criteria for either major bleeding or CRNM bleeding.</description>

        <title>PK-PD Relationship: Relationship Between Total Dabigatran Plasma Concentration and Coagulation Parameters APTT Values.</title>
        <description>Linear regression models were used for modeling the relationship between total dabigatran plasma concentration and coagulation parameters APTT values. For our simple regression model, R-squared is equal to the square of Pearson’s coefficient of correlation. The R-squared can be between 0 and 1. R-squared =1 means a perfect fit.</description>

CRNM bleeding: 1) Overt bleeding for which a blood product was administered &amp; which was not directly attributable to the patient’s underlying medical condition 2) Bleeding that required medical or surgical intervention to restore haemostasis, other than in an operating suite. Minor bleeding defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that did not fulfil the criteria for either major bleeding or CRNM bleeding.</description>
