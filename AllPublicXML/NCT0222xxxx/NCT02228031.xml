  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the possible effect of intranasally
      administered Oxytocin (OT) on specific mirror neuron areas in human brain. The mirror neuron
      system (MNS) is thought to be involved in action perception and understanding, and may also
      underlie more complex cognitive processes such as imitation. We will use
      electroencephalographic (EEG) investigations to examine brain activity while participants
      complete two different tasks, consisting of the observation and imitation of emotional facial
      expressions (video presented) and the observation and execution of simple grasping actions
      (live presented), respectively. In addition, before the beginning of the EEG recording
      session, subjects will be randomly assigned to two different groups (Oxytocin or Placebo
      group) and will receive a dose of either intranasal Oxytocin or Placebo solution. Oxytocin is
      a polypeptide hormone that plays a critical role in social behavior. We will identify mu and
      beta rhythm from the ongoing EEG and examine suppression as a function of emotion and goal
      directed action perception and imitation/execution.

    <description>The EEG mu rhythm suppression is an index of the human mirror neuron system (alpha and lower beta band activity (8-13 and ~20Hz) recorded over the sensorimotor cortex. EEG will be recorded during the performance of an emotion imitation task (Carr et al., 2003) in which participants will be asked to imitate and internally generate facial emotions seen on a computer screen, or to simply observe, as well as performing a simple grasping action task. Changes in the mu suppression while the performance of these tasks, before and after oxytocin/placebo administration, will be the primary outcome measure.</description>
