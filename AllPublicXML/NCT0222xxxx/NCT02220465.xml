  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary aim is to test the hypothesis that an intervention that integrates low to
      moderate physical activity (walking) with evidence-based smoking cessation counseling (LMPA)
      will result is greater reductions in quit-day reactivity to smoking cues (a behavioral
      predictor of smoking relapse) as compared to standard care smoking cessation counseling
      (control group) in a sample of low-income sedentary male and female smokers. The study will
      also test the hypothesis that the participants randomized to the LMPA intervention will have
      greater quit rates at one-week and one-month post quit day follow ups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use and lack of physical activity (PA) are preventable health behaviors contributing
      to disproportionate rates of morbidity/mortality (MM) among low income underserved adults.
      Comprehensive interventions incorporating treatment of multiple risk behaviors can have
      immense public health impact. The goal of this study is to improve uptake of PA during the
      pre-quit period by promoting low to moderate intensity PA (LMPA/walking) during the pre-quit
      preparatory period to promote smoking cessation among low-income sedentary smokers. Eligible
      participants (sedentary, &gt;5 cigs/day) will be randomized to 8-week LMPA vs. standard of care
      (SCC) intervention. LMPA group intervention focuses on (a) increasing daily steps using a
      tailored algorithm with a goal of reaching 10,000 steps/day by Week 4 (quit day) and (b)
      integrates PA with evidence-based smoking cessation programming by explicitly linking short
      bouts of PA with urge management training during the pre-quit period. The SCC group receives
      standard care smoking cessation counseling. Group differences in quit day reduction
      (extinction) of smoking urge reactivity using an analog cue-exposure paradigm, and smoking
      quit rates at 1-week and 1-month follow-up will be examined.

    <description>smoking cue reactivity is a behavioral predictor of smoking outcomes. We anticipate that the LMPA intervention will experience greater reductions (extinction) during a controlled, massed cue exposure procedure on their quit day than the Standard care control (SCC) group.</description>

    <description>This intervention integrates low-to-moderate physical activity (PA) with evidence based smoking cessation programming. Over the 4-week treatment period, the intervention (1 in-person and 3 phone counseling sessions) focuses on (a) gradually increasing routine PA during the pre-quit period and maintaining PA post quit day (b) increasing daily PA (steps/day) using a weekly tailored algorithm with the goal of achieving 10,000 steps by Week 4 (quit day) and (c) training participants to use PA as a primary urge management strategy, thereby embedding PA within evidence-based smoking cessation counseling. Other components include additional smoking urge management skills, increasing motivation to quit, overcoming barriers and maintaining PA for quitting and staying smoke-free .</description>

    <description>The control intervention parallels the format of the LMPA intervention with focus only on behavioral and cognitive urge management strategies (avoiding/escaping high-risk situations, stimulus control) and minimizing the probability that participants in the control group would increase increase/use PA during the intervention period. Participants are provided a pedometer without any instructions or encouragement around increasing walking/steps during the 8-week intervention period.</description>
