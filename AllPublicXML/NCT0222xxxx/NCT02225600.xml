      The study will examine behavioral patterns and underlying neural correlates which distinguish
      patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) from healthy subjects as they participate
      in a two-person trust game and will determine whether administration of intranasal oxytocin
      (OT) will normalize trust game performance and concomitant neural processing in the BPD
      group.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to support submission of a larger-scale federally funded study. The
      study is designed to develop new strategies for treating the severe interpersonal dysfunction
      in borderline personality disorder (BPD) by modeling the interpersonal disturbance in BPD in
      the laboratory, identifying its neural correlates and determining whether the social
      neuropeptide, oxytocin, can ameliorate the interpersonal dysfunction. The study will examine
      behavioral patterns and underlying neural correlates which distinguish patients with
      borderline personality disorder (BPD) from healthy subjects as they participate in a
      two-person trust game and will determine whether administration of intranasal oxytocin (OT)
      will normalize trust game performance and concomitant neural processing in the BPD group.

      The specific aims of the study are: 1) to determine whether BPD patients and healthy controls
      (HC) differ in their pattern of investing in a trustee when the trustee behaves benevolently
      or malevolently towards them or suddenly becomes malevolent after a period of benevolence (or
      vice-versa) in a multi-round economic exchange game (&quot;The Trust Game&quot;), and 2) to determine
      the effect upon behavior of the administration of 40 IU intranasal oxytocin relative to
      placebo in BPD subjects and HC's engaged in the Trust Game.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  BPD subjects meets criteria for DSM-IV Borderline Personality Disorder.

          -  18 to 55 years old

          -  Healthy controls are free of any lifetime DSM-IV Axis I or Axis II diagnosis. However,
             to avoid a group of HC's too highly groomed and unrepresentative of the general
             population subjects meeting criteria for a past Axis I diagnosis of adjustment,
             dysthymic, or depressive NOS disorders, specific phobias, and sleep disorders will not
             be excluded. Subjects will not be excluded for a non-IV substance abuse disorder more
             than 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  All subjects will be free of psychotropic medications for 2 weeks (6 weeks for
             fluoxetine).

          -  Subjects may be enrolled in psychotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BPD subjects not meeting DSM-IV criteria for past or present bipolar I disorder,
             schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, substance dependence, head trauma, CNS
             neurological disease, seizure disorder or current major depression. Since depression
             is commonly associated with BPD, too stringent a depression exclusion criterion would
             yield a clinically atypical BPD sample. For this reason, BPD patients with Axis I
             depressive disorders other than major depression and those with a past history of
             major depression will not be excluded.

          -  Substance abuse disorder in the prior 6 months

          -  Significant medical illness

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Metallic foreign-bodies that contraindicate MRI
