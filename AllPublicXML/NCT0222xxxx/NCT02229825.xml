             (V2) visits

          4. Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-Severity) score ≥4 at both screening visit

          2. Lack of response to at least two antidepressant therapies given at adequate doses for
             at least 6 weeks for the current depressive episode

          3. Concurrent presence of symptoms fulfilling criteria for any Axis I disorder other than
             anxiety disorders (with exception of the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)) or Major
