  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if selegiline and tadalafil (generic for Cialis®) results
      in an improvement in Erectile dysfunction (ED) in male patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)
      and moderate ED. Male PD patients who have an incomplete response to tadalafil alone will be
      given both medications to see if the addition of selegiline improves ED symptoms more than
      tadalafil alone. It is common practice for a medical doctor to prescribe these two drugs to a
      patient like you. However, there have been no studies conducted to examine the effects of
      these medications when taken together.

      Selegiline is normally prescribed for PD patients that are taking carbidopa/levodopa who are
      not receiving complete benefit from carbidopa/levodopa.

      Tadalafil is normally prescribed to men who have erectile dysfunction and/or benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH).
