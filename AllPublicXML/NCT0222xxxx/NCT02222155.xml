      The aim of this trial is to test the safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of the
      complement C5a receptor CCX168 in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
      (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).

    <textblock>
      Complement 5a and its receptor C5aR (CD88) is involved in the pathogenesis of anti-neutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the C5aR inhibitor
      CCX168 in subjects with ANCA-associated vasculitis. The aim of this trial is to test the
      safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of the complement C5a receptor CCX168 in patients
      with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).

             treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab would be required

          -  Use of adequate contraception during, and for at least the three months after, any
             administration of study medication is required

          -  Positive indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test for P-ANCA or C-ANCA, or positive
             ELISA test for anti-proteinase-3 (PR3) or anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) at screening

          -  Have at least one &quot;major&quot; item, or at least 3 other items, or at least 2 renal items
             on the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) version 3
