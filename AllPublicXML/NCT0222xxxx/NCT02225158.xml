      Background:

      Tuberculosis (TB) is a severe disease and a major cause of death in many people worldwide. It
      is caused by a bacteria that enters through the lungs and can spread elsewhere in the body.
      People with latent TB have the bacteria that lie dormant but can become active and cause
      disease. These people are offered treatment to prevent development of active TB. Worldwide, a
      lot of people with LTBI also have a parasitic worm called a helminth that can stay in the gut
      or the blood. These parasites can affect the immune system and cause diseases like TB to
      become worse. Researchers want to see how helminth infection makes it harder for people to
      fight TB infection.

      Objectives:

      - To study how the immune system of people with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) acts to
      prevent development of active TB. Also, to study how helminth infection might affect this
      immune response.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults age 18 70 with LTBI as defined by an approved blood test called QuantiFERON TB
           Gold.

        -  No evidence of infections like Hepatitis or HIV

        -  Pregnant subjects and subjects taking medications that suppress the immune system are
           not eligible.

        -  Have not received prior treatment for LTBI. Participants might be still eligible if
           prior treatment for active TB has been received

      Design:

      Screening phase:

      - Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for
      other infections/conditions which might affect the immune system. They will have testing for
      active TB i.e. blood testing as well as testing of their spit, scans and X-rays.

      Baseline phase:

        -  Only eligible participants will be entered into the study.

        -  Participants will have interviews, medical history, and physical exam.

        -  Blood will be drawn from an arm vein for testing.

        -  Participants will collect stool samples at home for 3 days in a row to test for helminth
           infection..

        -  Participants may have apheresis. Blood cells are removed by needle. They pass through a
           separator machine which returns everything but the cells back to the participant.

        -  Participants may have procedures at the start and end of the study that let researchers
           look into the lungs and collect cells.

      Study phase, about 2 years:

        -  All participants will be offered treatment for LTBI which lasts 6-9 months.

        -  Participants being treated for LTBI will have about 11 study visits. They will visit
           monthly for 9 months while on treatment, then 6 and 12 months after treatment.

        -  Participants not eligible/refusing treatment for LTBI will be made aware of active TB,
           then have 3 other visits, about 6, 12, and 24 months after the baseline visit.

        -  Participants who have helminth infection will receive appropriate treatment.

        -  All participants will have blood drawn at each visit.

    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains an important cause of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. A problem for eradication efforts is the large reservoir of ~2 billion
      people with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) and poor understanding of factors
      leading to active disease progression. Helminth infections geographically overlap with Mtb
      and induce significant immune-mediated modulation. Although CD4+T cells producing IFN-gamma
      and TNF-alpha have been implicated in protective immunity to TB, a detailed description of
      the evolution of protective and immunomodulatory responses in LTBI is lacking. Additionally,
      there is incomplete understanding of how the immunomodulation caused by helminth co-infection
      affects such responses.

      This protocol will attempt to fill this knowledge gap through comprehensive longitudinal
      immunological analyses of two populations of subjects with LTBI, with or without concurrent
      helminth infection (HEL+ and HEL- respectively). In both groups, venipuncture and possibly
      apheresis will be performed to understand protective and modulatory T cell and
      monocyte/macrophage responses. Subjects will receive treatment for helminth infection and
      treatment for LTBI will be offered according to current standard of care guidelines. Two
      groups of subjects within the LTBI group will be offered bronchoscopy and lavage --- (a)
      those with structural lung damage from prior treated/healed tuberculosis and (b) those with
      recent prolonged exposure (greater than or equal to 3 months) to a household contact with
      active TB.

      The primary objective is to evaluate CD4+ T cell responses and regulatory T cell responses in
      HEL+ and HEL- subjects with LTBI at the time of diagnosis (baseline). HEL+ subjects will then
      receive treatment for parasitic infection and both groups (HEL+ and HEL-) will be offered
      LTBI treatment. Evolution of the baseline TB-specific immune responses on and after LTBI
      treatment will then be studied. Additionally, baseline immune responses to mycobacteria will
      be contrasted in the HEL+ group with all time points post treatment for helminth infection. A
      secondary objective is to evaluate the immune phenotype and functionality of tissue resident
      immune cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage in subjects with LTBI and structural lung
      damage from prior treated/healed pulmonary tuberculosis as well as subjects with recent
      prolonged TB exposure from an active TB case irrespective of helminth infection status.

      An exploratory objective is to evaluate if there are subsets of subjects within the LTBI
      group (irrespective of helminth infection status) who have stable pool of long lasting
      antigen-specific IL-2 only producing CD4+ central memory T cells and changes to this pool
      after receiving LTBI treatment.
