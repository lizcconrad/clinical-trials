  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypo Sense is a non- invasive method for detection of hypoglycemia. The Hypo Sense combines
      an array of non-invasive sensors which monitors the patient's physiological parameters (heart
      &amp; respiration rate, perspiration, skin temperature and arm motion) designed as a wrist watch
      device.

      The Hypo sense is intended for monitoring symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients in
      hospital environment among type 1 and type 2 diabetes adults as an adjunctive device to
      reference methods

      The proposed study will be consisting of two main segments:

      The primary aim of segment 1 of the study is data collection and calibration of the Hypo
      Sense sensor prototype compared to standard invasive reference glucometer.

      The primary aim of segment 2 of the study is to validate the Hypo Sense prototype performance
      in detecting hypoglycemic events.

      During the first segment of the study we intend to collect in parallel measurements of blood
      glucose using reference method (capillary glucometer) and continuous data generated by the
      non- invasive study device during approximately 4 hours, in which a hypoglycemic event will
      be induced.

      The reference and study device data will be analyzed using multivariate regression model to
      formulate a calibration algorithm model. This model will translate the set of the
      physiological recorded parameters into detection of hypoglycemic events.

      During the second segment of the study we intend to evaluate the validity of the Hypo Sense
      sensor ability to detect hypoglycemic events compared to standard invasive reference method
      (capillary glucometer).
