  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a small dose of Dexmedetomidine, when given
      either intravenously or as part of the interscalene nerve block solution, prolongs pain
      relief following shoulder surgery compared to local anesthetic solution alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral shoulder surgical procedures, including acromioplasty, rotator cuff repair and
      Bankart procedure generally allow the patient to go home the same day. However, post-surgical
      pain is often severe and it is common to encounter a delay in discharge from the hospital due
      to difficulty in pain control.

      Single shot interscalene block is used in ambulatory shoulder surgery for its advantages that
      included a significant reduction in acute pain and analgesic requirements, prolonged time to
      first analgesic request, decreased incidence of nausea, as well as earlier hospital
      discharge. Previous studies have attempted to prolong the duration of the analgesia of
      interscalene block by administering additional drugs to the local anesthetics but these
      studies have had varying degrees of success. Dexmedetomidine has recently been considered as
      a potentially useful drug in prolonging nerve block analgesia. Various modes of
      administration of Dexmedetomidine have demonstrated a consistent effect on the duration of
      analgesia. So far, the systemic infusion of Dex has been shown to prolong both neuraxial and
      peripheral nerve blocks. When combined with local anesthetics in intravenous regional
      anesthesia 9IVRA), Dex enhanced the duration of analgesia. Furthermore, data from animal
      studies strongly support the use of Dex as a safe potent adjunct to local anesthetics capable
      of prolonging the duration of analgesia of peripheral nerve blocks.

      The use of Dexmedetomidine as an adjunct in interscalene block has not been studied yet. This
      trial will study the effects of adding Dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to local anesthetics in
      interscalene brachial plexus block.
