  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess 3 different scoring systems to evaluate the adhesive
      quality of placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial]) JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023-G transdermal (through the
      skin) systems during a single system 72-hour application, replicated 3 times, of 2 patch
      sizes (5.5 centimeter^2 [cm^2] and 44 cm^2).

      This study will assess 3 different scoring systems to evaluate the adhesive quality of
      &quot;placebo&quot; patch (an inactive patch that contains no active drug), JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023-G
      transdermal (through the skin) system. In this study, this patch is NOT being compared to a
      patch with a drug, and is NOT being used to test if the patch with the drug has a real effect
      in a clinical trial. The study consists 3 parts: Screening (21 days before study commences on
      Day 1), an adhesion assessment period (4 days), and an end of Study (EOS) assessment
      (recorded at 24 hours +/- 4 hours following patch removal). Total study duration per
      participant will be 26 days (including Screening). JNJ-35685-AAA-G-023 small (5.5 cm^2) and
      large (44 cm^2) patches will be applied on to left or right side of the paraspinal region
      based on randomization schedule. Adhesion assessments will be performed at patch application
      (hour 0, Baseline), and during the time interval of 8 to 10 hours, 24, 48, and 72 hours
      following patch application. Adhesion quality will be assessed by visual grading, United
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scale, digital image analysis and visual grading
      grid system. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 72 hours following patch application</time_frame>
    <description>Visual grading US FDA scale will be used to evaluate adhesion performance of the transdermal system. The score ranges from 0-4: 0 = greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 90 percent (%) adhered (essentially no lift off the skin); 1 = greater than or equal to 75% to less than (&lt;) 90% adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin); 2 = greater than or equal to 50% to &lt;75% adhered (less than half of the patch lifting off the skin); 3 = greater than (&gt;) 0% to &lt;50% adhered but not detached (more than half of the patch lifting off the skin without falling off); and 4 = 0% adhered - patch detached (patch completely off the skin).</description>

    <measure>Adhesion Area Calculated by Digital Image Analysis</measure>

    <measure>Total Adhesion Score Calculated by Visual Grading Grid System</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 72 hours following patch application</time_frame>
    <description>Total adhesion score will be calculated by visual grading grid system (a grid system based on 20 four-sided divisions that are approximately 5% of the total patch area; 44 cm^2 patch will be evaluated by square and rectangular grid elements while 5.5 cm^2 patch will be evaluated by square grid element only) which also contains a scale to allow for proper determination of actual area of the patch not adhering to the skin. Total area of the patch which does not adhere will be calculated. Any area of the patch that does not entirely adhere onto the skin will be scored as 0% adhesion for that area. Subsequently, a total adhesion score for that system will be calculated.</description>
