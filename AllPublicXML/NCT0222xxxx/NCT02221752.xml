  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to a national study in 2002, the prevalence of ID, IDA, and ID+IDA among pregnant
      women in China was 42.6%, 9.1%, and 61.7% respectively. A similar study in Hebei province at
      the same time showed that the prevalence of IDA among pregnant and lactating mothers was
      46.39% and 47.21% respectively. There was a significant difference between urban and rural
      areas. Women living in rural areas had higher chances of having IDA (p&lt;0.01). WHO and UNICEF
      recommend taking iron, folic acid and multiple micronutrients during pregnancy. However, we
      don't know much about their influence on maternal and infant health and their clinical
      effectiveness. Health Department of China recommends taking 400ug folic acid before pregnancy
      and during early pregnancy. But for various reasons, not all expecting mothers take this
      advice. Besides, we don't have a national level technical standard of how to take nutrition
      supplements during pregnancy. Therefore, it's crucial for us to study if iron/folic acid or
      folic acid only can prevent perinatal complications, as well as their influences on infant
      and toddler health.

      The purpose of this study is to test whether taking iron/folic acid and folic acid only from
      early pregnancy until delivery will lower the chances of pregnancy complications, and to see
      how supplements affect gestation results. As well, it will evaluate a) whether taking iron
      supplement during pregnancy can prevent IDA during pregnancy; b) whether taking iron
      supplement can increase mother and fetus iron storage; and c) how mother's iron level affects
      newborn's iron level. We hope to understand nutrition conditions during pregnancy and
      investigate the relations between pregnancy diet and complications during pregnancy, weight
      gain during pregnancy, and newborn birth weight. We will evaluate the influence of taking
      iron and folic acid during pregnancy on the health of infants and toddlers.

      Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common single nutrient disorder, differentially
      affecting pregnant women and infants everywhere. The study was conducted in China, a rapidly
      developing country where ID often occurs among pregnant women and infants in the absence of
      generalized undernutrition. The study was a collaboration between Peking University First
      Hospital and three local hospitals (Sanhe Maternity and Child Health Care Center [MCHC],
      Sanhe General County Hospital, and Sanhe Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine). Eligible
      pregnant women were enrolled from June 2009 through December 2011 and randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive iron and folic acid or folic acid only. The study protocol was approved by
      the institutional review board of Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China. Women
      were recruited (n=2367) at their first prenatal visit at Sanhe MCHC. Those with uncomplicated
      singleton pregnancies and first prenatal visits ≤ 20 weeks gestation were invited to
      participate. Women were randomized and received 2 supplements: iron/placebo and folic acid.
      Project personnel instructed the participants to take two capsules per day (one of each kind
      of supplement) from enrollment to delivery. Participants received a 3-month supply of each
      supplement upon enrollment and at the second study visit (26-30 weeks). The number of doses
      received and consumed or missed was recorded by project personnel. The primary outcomes were
      maternal iron status at follow-up visits (26-30 weeks and 36-40 weeks), cord-blood iron
      status, and infant gestational age and birth weight. Data analysis compares pregnancy iron
      level between two study groups and how it relates to pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy
      and delivery complications, preterm rate, perinatal death rate, and birth rate. Data analysis
      also includes evaluating pregnancy nutrition conditions and analyzing associations with
      weight changes during pregnancy, and rates of pregnancy diabetes, pregnancy high blood
      pressure, fetus growth restriction, low birth weight, and fetal macrosomia. Up to 75% of
      pregnant women worldwide are anemic, with about half due to ID. The public health
      implications of study findings could be profound.
