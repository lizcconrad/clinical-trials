  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Novartis Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine pregnancy registry is
      stablished to meet a post marketing commitment agreed upon with CBER to prospectively collect
      data on pregnancy exposures to Novartis Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine.

      It is an observational study of women inadvertently immunized with the Novartis Meningococcal
      quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine within 28 days prior to conception or at any time
      during pregnancy as part of routine care.

      The objective of the pregnancy registry is to evaluate pregnancy outcomes among women
      immunized with the Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine within 28 days prior
      to conception or at any time during pregnancy. The primary outcomes of interest include major
      congenital malformation, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Other pregnancy outcomes will
      be collected, including spontaneous abortions and stillbirths.

        The study population will include pregnant women within the United States who were
        immunized with the Novartis Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine within 28
        days prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sufficient evidence to confirm that MENVEO exposure occurred within 28 days prior to
             conception or at any time during pregnancy

          -  Sufficient information to determine whether the pregnancy is prospectively or
             retrospectively registered (ie, whether the outcome of pregnancy was known at the time
             of first contact with the registry)

          -  Date the pregnancy exposure is registered

          -  Full reporter (ie, HCP) contact information to allow for follow-up (name, address,
             etc.)
