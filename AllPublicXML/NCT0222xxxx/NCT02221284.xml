    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of
      alogliptin tablets (Nesina Tablets) in type 2 diabetic patients who have had an inadequate
      response to hypoglycemic agents (e.g., insulin preparations or rapid-acting insulin
      secretagogues)* in addition to dietary/exercise therapy in daily medical practice.

      * Patients receiving these hypoglycemic agents (excluding α-glucosidase inhibitors,
      thiazolidines, sulfonylureas, and biguanides) were excluded from existing specified drug-use
      surveys for Nesina Tablets.

      This survey was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of alogliptin
      tablets (Nesina Tablets) in type 2 diabetic patients who have had an inadequate response to
      hypoglycemic agents (e.g., insulin preparations or rapid-acting insulin secretagogues)* in
      addition to dietary/exercise therapy in daily medical practice.

      For adults, 25 mg of alogliptin is usually administered orally once daily.

    <description>Adverse events observed during the observation period will be collected by symptom. For adverse drug reactions, frequencies will be tabulated by type and seriousness. Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with administration of alogliptin whether or not it was considered related to treatment. Among these, events that are considered as having a causal relationship with alogliptin are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Type 2 diabetic patients meeting the following criteria are included in this survey:

        Patients who have had an inadequate response to the following medications/therapies:

        • Use of one hypoglycemic agent such as insulin preparations and rapid-acting insulin
        secretagogues, excluding other types of hypoglycemic agents (e.g., α-glucosidase
        inhibitors, thiazolidines, sulfonylureas, and biguanides)*, in addition to dietary/exercise
        therapy

        * For use of Nesina Tablets in combination with these agents, a specified drug-use survey
        is currently ongoing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -Type 2 diabetic patients who meet any of the following criteria are excluded from this
        survey: Patients with contraindications for Nesina Tablets

          1. Those with severe ketosis, in a state of diabetic coma or precoma, or with type 1
             diabetes mellitus [Quickly rectifying hyperglycemia with administration of intravenous
             fluid or insulin is essential in these patients; therefore, administration of Nesina
             Tablets is not appropriate.]

          2. Those with severe infections, before or after surgery, or with serious trauma
             [Controlling blood glucose with an injection of insulin is desirable for these
             patients; therefore, administration of Nesina Tablets is not appropriate.]

          3. Those with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of Nesina Tablets
