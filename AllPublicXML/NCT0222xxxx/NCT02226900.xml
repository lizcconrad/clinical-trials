             stenosis &gt; 70% by visual analysis in all three territories, requiring myocardial
             revascularization OR triple-vessel disease with proximal or mid LAD disease with
             angiographic diameter stenosis 50-70% by visual analysis in any territory but with
             invasive or non-invasive evidence of flow-limiting stenosis in all three territories,
             requiring myocardial revascularization

          -  Total SYNTAX score &gt; 22

          -  LCx and RCA territories estimated to be equivalently revascularized by either PCI or
             CABG, with at least one major non-LAD vessel to be treated

          -  Clinical and anatomic eligibility for both PCI and CABG as agreed to by both
             interventional and surgical consensus

               -  Interventionalist determines PCI appropriateness and eligibility

               -  Surgeon determines surgical appropriateness and eligibility

          -  Silent ischemia, stable angina, unstable angina or recent MI

               -  If recent MI, cardiac biomarkers must have returned to normal prior to
                  randomization

          -  Ability to sign informed consent and comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior PCI or CABG at any time prior to randomization

          -  Need for any concomitant cardiac surgery other than CABG (e.g. valve surgery, aortic
             repair, etc.), or intent that if the patient randomizes to surgery, any cardiac
             surgical procedure other than isolated CABG will be performed

          -  Patients unable to tolerate, obtain or comply with dual antiplatelet therapy for at
             least one year

          -  Patients requiring additional surgery (cardiac or non cardiac) within one year

          -  The presence of any clinical or anatomical condition(s) which leads the participating
             interventional cardiologist to believe that clinical equipoise is not present (i.e.
             the patient should not be treated by PCI, but rather should be managed with CABG or
             medical therapy - reasons will be documented)

          -  The presence of any clinical or anatomical condition(s) which leads the participating
             cardiac surgeon to believe that clinical equipoise is not present (i.e. the patient
             should not be treated by CABG, but rather should be managed with PCI. or medical
             therapy - reasons will be documented)

          -  Non cardiac co-morbidities with life expectancy less than 1 year

          -  Other investigational drug or device studies that have not reached their primary
             endpoint.
