      The objective of this split-mouth, randomized controlled trial was to compare the clinical
      outcomes of coronally advanced flap (CAF) using two different surgical strategies in the
      treatment of multiple gingival recessions. Recessions were randomly treated according to a
      split-mouth design by means of: CAF with oblique interdental incisions (OBL technique) or CAF
      with horizontal interdental incisions (HOR technique). Marginal gingival recession (REC),
      clinical attachment level (CAL), pocket probing depth (PPD), height of keratinized tissue
      (HKT) and thickness of keratinized tissue (TKT) were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months
      after treatment. Patient-centered outcomes concerning morbidity and improvement in the
      esthetic appearance were recorded using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

    <description>Coronally advanced flap was performed by using horizontal interdental incisions. An initial horizontal incision was made slightly coronal to the CEJ from the distal to the mesial papilla of the teeth with the recessions. A second incision, 1 to 2 mm apart and parallel to the first incision, was made apically. A sulcular incision was made to link the second incisions and the blade was inserted extending beyond the mucogingival junction, to create a uniform split-thickness flap. The tissue between the two incisions was partially removed to obtain a uniform receptor site that permitted primary closure. Approximation sutures to place the edge of the flap at the base of the remaining papilla were performed.</description>

    <description>Coronally advanced flap was performed by using oblique incisions in interdental areas, according to the technique proposed by Zucchelli &amp; De Sanctis (2000). Oblique submarginal interdental incisions were performed and continued with the intrasulcular incisions at the recession defects, resulting in a envelop flap that was raised with a split-full-split approach in the coronal-apical direction. During coronal advancement, each surgical papilla was dislocated with respect to the de-epithelized anatomic papilla by the oblique incisions. Interrupted sutures were performed to stabilize single surgical papilla over the interdental connective tissue bed.</description>

A second incision, 1 to 2 mm apart and parallel to the first incision, was made apically. A sulcular incision was made to link the second incisions and the blade was inserted (2 to 3 mm) extending beyond the mucogingival junction (MGJ), to create a uniform split-thickness flap. The tissue between the two incisions was partially removed to obtain a uniform receptor site that permitted primary closure. Approximation sutures to place the edge of the flap at the base of the remaining papilla were performed. Passive closure of the wound margins without tension was achieved with interrupted coaptation.</description>
