  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A nurse-led care program for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in an outpatient setting
      was formulated. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of this nurse-led care program
      on cancer patients who received neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy in a chemotherapy day
      center in terms of quality of life, symptom experiences, self-efficacy, health care
      utilization, and satisfaction with care. Specifically, the objectives are:

        -  To compare the differences of health care utilization between the two arms.

        -  To compare the differences of cancer patients' satisfaction with care between the two
           arms.

        -  To explore the experiences of cancer patients in the intervention arm.

        -  To understand the experiences of the intervention nurses of the program and their
           opinions on further development.

      Chemotherapy affects cancer patients in many ways. It is common that patients suffer multiple
      side-effects simultaneously. Psychological distress is also a common problem during
      chemotherapy. Distressful experiences in chemotherapy may lead to deterioration in a
      patient's of quality of life (QOL). In addition, cancer patients have particularly high unmet
      needs during treatment, including informational needs, psychosocial needs, needs in the
      activities of daily living, supportive care needs, sexual needs, and communication needs.
      Among them, information is the most frequently reported need in the treatment phase. These
      unmet needs cause uncertainty, anxiety, and distress to cancer patients.

      Outpatient-based chemotherapy is now widely established. Despite its benefits to health care
      institutions and cancer patients, there are attendant challenges. Cancer patients need to
      take care of themselves at home during each interval of chemotherapy. Without adequate
      support from health care providers, cancer patients may not be able to properly manage
      chemotherapy and its effects by themselves. The poor management of side-effects may lead to
      increased health care utilization. Cancer patients need to develop new self-care skills to
      cope with chemotherapy.

      Facing increasing numbers of cancer patients and burgeoning health care needs, health care
      professionals must address the issue of how to improve the quality of care during
      chemotherapy. Nurse-led care is a highly recommended and innovative way of improving quality
      of care. It shows distinct advantages in terms of providing holistic care because it is based
      on the philosophy of the uniqueness of individuals and the multidimensionality of human
      beings. The feasibility and effects of nurse-led care are being explored in an increasing
      number of studies. However, studies of nurse-led care for cancer patients receiving
      outpatient-based chemotherapy are far away adequacy. There is a need to examine the
      feasibility and effects of nurse-led care for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in
      outpatient settings.

    <description>The nurse-led care consisted of a pre-chemotherapy nursing consultation and telephone follow-up sessions during chemotherapy. The nursing consultation was on the day of the first cycle before drug administration. It included: history review, overall status evaluation, need and problem assessment, information provision, psychological support, and referral. The telephone follow-up sessions were delivered within one week after the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th, and 8th cycle. A telephone follow-up session included: (i) The overall status assessment and problem triage; (ii) Care delivery based on problem severity; (iii) Evaluation of the change of the problems on the following telephone call.</description>
