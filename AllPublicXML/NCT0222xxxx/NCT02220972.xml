      This will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to
      evaluate the effects of 2007/Fycompa (perampanel) on sleep, in subjects with well controlled
      partial onset seizures (on an antiepileptic drug [AED] monotherapy) who are experiencing
      sleep onset insomnia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial onset seizures with or without secondary
             generalization, according to the ILAE Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981).
             Diagnosis should have been established by clinical history, with chart confirmation of
             previous EEG that is consistent with localization-related epilepsy; normal interictal
             EEGs will be allowed provided that the subject meets the other diagnosis criterion
             (ie, clinical history).

          2. Subjects will be well controlled (defined as less than 1 seizure every 28 days) for a
             period of at least 3 months on a current AED monotherapy (defined as a single AED
             taken for at least 28 days before Screening), and have no history of AED polytherapy.

          3. Male or female subjects, at least 18 years and no more than 50 years of age at the
             time of informed consent

          5. Meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 criteria for Insomnia Disorder:

               1. Complains of dissatisfaction with nighttime sleep in the form of difficulty
                  getting to sleep or difficulty staying asleep

               2. Frequency of complaint is at least 3 times per week

          6. Confirmed problems with sleep onset insomnia as evidenced by response to &quot;Time to Fall
             Asleep&quot; question on the PSQI at Screening of at least 45 minutes

          7. Confirmed problems with sleep onset insomnia as evidenced by habitual median sSOL of
             at least 45 minutes obtained from sleep diary responses for the last consecutive 7
             days of the Screening/Baseline Period

          8. Confirmed problems with sleep onset insomnia as evidenced by LPS of at least 20
             minutes on the baseline PSG

             [hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG [or
             hCG]). A separate baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy
             test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug.

         12. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically

             surgery at least 1 month before dosing).

         13. Females of childbearing potential must not participate in a conception process (ie,
             active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, in vitro fertilization) and must
             not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and must
             agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, total abstinence, an

             partner with confirmed azoospermia), for at least 4 weeks before dosing, throughout
             the entire study period and for 4 weeks after study drug discontinuation. If currently
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double-barrier method as described above if
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 4 weeks after study drug
             discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a
             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 4
             weeks after study drug discontinuation.
