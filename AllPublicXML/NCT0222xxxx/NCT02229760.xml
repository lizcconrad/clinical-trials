          6. Reasonable probability of completing the study

          7. A medical history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) before entering
             the study

          8. Agreement to abstain from alcohol from Day -2 to Day 24

             included laboratory data, letter, or verbal report from another provider noted in the
             patient's records

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients who had a positive serum pregnancy test during the screening period of
             Day -14 to Day -7 or who plan to breast-feed at time (Day 0 to 30 after TPV/r
             administration)

             of the investigator (in consultation with the BI medical monitor or
             pharmacokineticist), would have interfered with either the absorption, distribution,
             or metabolism of TPV or ritonavir

             drugs (marketed or experimental use as part of clinical research studies)

         11. Sulfonamide allergy, that in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the
             results of the study or pose additional risks in administering TPV/r

             the upper normal limit, respectively)

         13. Based on the compliance diary, the patient had less than 100% documented compliance
             for 7-14 days of background Antiretroviral (ARV) (i.e., ZDV and ABC) medications
