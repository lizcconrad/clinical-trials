  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance type exercise training has been shown to be a potent stimulus to increase skeletal
      muscle mass and strength in healthy men. Furthermore, timed protein intake is also known to
      affect the muscle adaptive response following exercise. Whether timed protein intake could
      augment the increase in muscle fiber size and/or satellite cell content following long-term
      exercise intervention remains to be established.

      We hypothesize that protein supplementation before sleep, on both training and non-training
      days, during a 12 week resistance training program further increases type II muscle fibre
      cross sectional area when compared to the placebo group.
