  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer-Based Cognitive Training for Individuals with Parkinson's Disease&quot; is a 3-arm
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Brain Fitness, InSight, and an active control
      (AC) training program to evaluate the feasibility of empirically supported computer-based
      cognitive training programs (CCTPs) for patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) with
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This pilot study aims to address the need for increased
      interventions to target non-motor symptoms associated with PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients meeting criteria for MCI will be initially randomized to one of the 3 conditions.
      Participants will complete cognitive training exercises on their home or clinic-provided
      computers for 60 minutes per day, 5 days per week. Compliance and performance will be
      monitored on a weekly basis and at completion of the study. Outcome measures will be
      collected one week before initiation of the intervention and within one week completion of
      the intervention. Neuropsychological functioning, including tests of processing speed,
      attention, and executive functioning, will serve as primary outcome measures. Patient
      reported outcomes, including measures of overall QOL and disease-specific QOL, and
      support-person reported outcomes (if applicable), including measures of overall QOL and
      caregiver burden, will be secondary outcome measures. This pilot study promises to evaluate
      computer-based cognitive training in a novel population and expand access to cognitive
      rehabilitation services, and is designed to improve cognitive functioning and QOL among a
      wide range of individuals with PD.

    <description>Percent accuracy of cognitive training quizzes from the cognitive training programs of the RCT will be compared. The quizzes are specific to each cognitive training program. The Brain Fitness quiz is comprised of auditory processing and accuracy tasks. The InSight quiz is comprised of visual processing and working memory tasks. The Active Control quiz is comprised of questions about knowledge, literature, art, and history. Due to the differences between the arms with regards to content, the percent accuracy for each participant will be the outcome measure compared across the three study arms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants eligible for this study must speak English and have a confirmed medical
             diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and meet established criteria for MCI in PD (Litvan
             et al., 2012), defined as individuals with performances of approximately -1 to -2
             standard deviations below the mean on at least two tests within five cognitive domains
             assessed in their clinical neuropsychological evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include diagnosis of PD dementia based on Movement Disorder Society
             Task Force criteria (Emre et al., 2007) and other PD-associated comorbid conditions
             (e.g., severe anxiety, depression, excessive daytime sleepiness, or psychosis) that
