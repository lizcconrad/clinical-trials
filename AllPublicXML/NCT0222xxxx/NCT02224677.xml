  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, longitudinal cohort study of 125 infants with craniofacial
      microsomia (CFM) and 100 infants without craniofacial anomalies. Participants will undergo a
      series of evaluations between 0-3 years of age to comprehensively evaluate the developmental
      status of infants and toddlers with CFM. This research design will also explore specific
      pathways by which CFM may lead to certain outcomes. Specifically, the study explores (1) the
      longitudinal relations between facial asymmetry and emotion-related facial movements and
      socialization; and (2) associations among ear malformations, hearing and speech deficits and
      cognitive outcomes. Results of this research will ultimately lead to future investigations
      that assess new interventions and corresponding changes in current standards of care for
      children with CFM.

        Children with and without craniofacial microsomia will be drawn from outpatient clinics,
        medical centers, and local pediatric practices near performance sites and local pediatric
        practices. Cases will be approached in their first 24 months by either a member of their
        craniofacial team, a member of the CLOCK study team, or one of their treating providers.
        Cases may find out about the study through ClinicalTrials.gov. Controls will initially be
        approached through a treating provider, a member of the CLOCK team, or through an
        announcement about the study.
