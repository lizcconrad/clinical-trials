  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An automated dispensing cabinet (ADC) is a computerized drug storage device or cabinet
      designed for hospitals. ADCs allow medications to be stored and dispensed near the point of
      care while controlling and tracking drug distribution.This study seeks to obtain quantitative
      measurements of the impact of the regulated ADC System installed in select high volume units
      throughout the hospital.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of the regulated ADC Systems on the
      medication administration processes. HackensackUMC is specifically interested in measuring
      the time to first dose administration from scheduled dosing times of the IV antibiotic
      piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, USP. and we are interested in assessing a
      reduction in time from scheduled dosage times of first dose to documented administration
      after the implementation of the regulated ADC system compared to before.

      Timely administration of antibiotics improves morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital
      stay.Early and effective antibiotic therapy is essential in the management of infection in
      critical illness. The loading dose is probably the most important dose and is a function of
      the volume of distribution of the drug and the desired plasma concentration but independent
      of renal function.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Administered in Error</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication error rates for heparin and insulin pre-install of regulated ADC system compared to post installation. For each drug, heparin and insulin, the number of medication errors will be enumerated based on event type of the voluntary reporting event report data. For each drug, medication error rates will be calculated by dividing the number medication errors by the number of medication orders multiplied by 1,000. Comparison of medication error rates pre-install and post-install will be conducted using simple Poisson regression analysis obtained in, results of which will be expressed as incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timeliness of medication administration</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>We are measuring timeliness of medication administration - CMS describes time-critical scheduled medications as those scheduled medications that are identified under the hospital's policies and procedures as time-critical must be administered within thirty minutes before or after their scheduled dosing time, for a total window of 1 hour. First dose IV antibiotics are time-critical. We intend to demonstrate a 10% reduction in time from scheduled dosing times to first dose for the IV piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, USP and for all dose IV antibiotcs post install of the regulated ADC System compared to pre-installation in the medical-surgical, orthopedic, and oncology units.</description>

             includes the use of the medication label printer

          -  Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, USP (United States Pharmacopeia)
