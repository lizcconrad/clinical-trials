  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how effective and how safe the combination of
      radiation therapy and an investigational medication targeting the immune system known as
      Ipilimumab in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The investigators would like to see if this combination of radiation and Ipilimumab can
      stimulate the body's immune system to stop the growth of tumors that are outside the field of
      radiation. The investigators would like see if using this combination of radiation therapy
      with Ipilimumab could help the body reject the patient's own tumor or at least help their
      immune system to maintain the disease stable and/or slow its growth.

      Radiation therapy (RT) is currently a standard procedure for treatment of NSCLC. Ipilimumab
      is considered an investigational medication because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NSCLC. Ipilimumab has been approved by the FDA for
      the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

      Research Hypothesis:

        1. Through a combination of local RT and ipilimumab an anti-tumor immune response is
           elicited at the irradiated site, as an in vivo, individualized immunization that is
           systemically effective, as reflected by objective responses outside the RT field
           (abscopal effect).

        2. The immune response can be prospectively monitored among the treated patients.

      Objective 1: Evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of anti-cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated protein -4 mono clonal Antibody (anti-CTLA-4 mAb) and concurrent
      local RT in NSCLC patients with metastatic disease.

      An open label phase II trial will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the combination of Ipi
      and RT, applied to a single metastatic site. Efficacy is measured with respect to systemic
      tumor responses (abscopal response, outside the field of therapy) defined by immune-related
      Response Criteria (irRC) in all non-irradiated measurable lesions, as a demonstration of an
      effective anti-tumor immune response. Secondary endpoints include local response in the RT
      treated tumor, progression free survival, and overall survival.

      Objective 2: Determine the effects of RT and anti-CTLA-4 mAb on development of anti-tumor
      immunity.

      The investigators hypothesize that RT will convert the irradiated tumor into an in situ
      vaccine and elicit an endogenous tumor-specific cellular and humoral immune response, which
      in the presence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blockade will promote
      immune-mediated destruction of the irradiated and abscopal metastases. Pre- and
      post-treatment tumor biopsies will be examined for changes in immune contexture, and blood
      for evidence of emerging anti-tumor immune responses. Associations with clinical response
      will be explored.

    <measure>The effects of RT and anti-CTLA-4 mAb on development of anti-tumor immunity.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks - 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The study uses a comprehensive approach to analyze immunological changes that reflect both local and systemic responses, and investigate both general immune activation as well as tumor antigen-specific T- and B-cell responses. The activity of anti-CTLA-1 mAb is thought to be mainly dependent on modulating the quantity and quality of T-cells in cancer patients. A highly extensive analysis of the Cluster of differentiation 4 + (CD4+) and cluster of differentiation 8 + (CD8+) T-cell subsets will be characterized by multi-color flow Cytometry. To facilitate these analyses, serial blood samples will be collected for serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at different time points, where, a part of these samples will be used for DNA/RNA extraction. Optional tissue biopsies will be obtained from consenting patients.Tumor tissue will be tested for expression of seven antigens frequently expressed in NSCLC.</description>

    <description>Patients receive ipilimumab (Ipi) 3mg/kg i.v. over 90 minutes, within 24 hours of starting radiotherapy (RT) to the biopsied lesion, 6 Gy x5, later changed to 9.5 Gy x3 (conformally or by intensity modulated RT (IMRT) with image guidance to maximally spare normal tissue). Ipilimumab is repeated on days 22, 43 (for patients who consent to the first biopsy), and 64. Repeat biopsy is performed between day 22-29, and patients are re-imaged between day 81-88 and evaluated for response (defined as an objective response by irRC of the measurable metastatic sites outside the radiation field).</description>
