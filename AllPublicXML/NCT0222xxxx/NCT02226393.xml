  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic events have potentially debilitating long-lasting effects on the child's normal
      development and, therefore, should be effectively treated. Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy
      has been found to be effective in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in adults
      and in adolescents. It has not yet been tested in toddlers.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the treatment efficacy of 2 methods of treatment for
      toddlers with PTSD and their parents. A randomized control trial could examine the efficacy
      of PE versus dyadic play therapy (TP-CT). Exploration of these questions under more rigorous
      conditions would help broaden our knowledge about developmentally sensitive treatment tools
      for this age group.

      Our research hypotheses are:

        1. PE would more effective than TP-CT in reducing post-traumatic symptoms in toddlers.

        2. PE would more effective than TP-CT in reducing post-traumatic symptoms of the toddlers'
           parents.

        3. These results will be preserved in a follow-up of 3-6 months post treatment. Following
           psychiatric assessment, 100 toddlers will be randomly assigned to PE and TP-CT (50
           participants in each group).

      Beyond what was detailed in the previous section of the brief summary, it should be noted
      that the toddlers will be assessed and treated at least 1 month post-trauma and at least 1
      month after discharge from hospital in order to avoid acute reaction either to the traumatic
      event or to the medical procedures during their hospitalization and adjustment problems.

    <description>The Parenting Sense of Competency Scale (PSOC) was developed by Gibaud-Wallston as part of her PhD dissertation and presented at the American Psychological Association by Gibaud-Wallston and Wandersman in 1978. The PSOC is a 17 item scale, with 2 subscales. Each item is rated on a 6 point Likert scale anchored by 1 = &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 6 = &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;.</description>

    <description>The PE treatment includes 12-15 60 minutes' sessions. The 2 main components of the treatment are psychoeducation about common reactions to trauma and in-vivo exposures (gradual exposure to trauma related situations and objects) and repeated recounting of the traumatic memory, Trauma memory recounting and in-vivo exposures are conducted during several successive sessions so the child learns that the exposures themselves pose no real harm to him, indicating that when one confronts what one is afraid of it becomes easier to manage.</description>

    <description>Is consisted of 12-15 weekly 60 minute sessions of parent-child centered therapy it focus on establishing a trusting, empowering, and validating therapeutic relationship. Participants are allowed to choose when, how, and whether or not to address their trauma memory. Therapists provide active listening, empathy,and encouragement to talk about feelings and express belief in the participants ability to cope. In sessions 4 and 8, participants are asked how they feel about their trauma. With this exception, participants direct the sessions.</description>
