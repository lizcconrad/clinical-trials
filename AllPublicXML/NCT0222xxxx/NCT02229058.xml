      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of s-1 plus Albumin
      Bound Paclitaxel as first-line therapy in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      As the first phase II clinical trial of fluoropyrimidines plus Nab-PTX in AGC patientsphase
      II trial, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus Nab-PTX as a
      first-line treatment for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. All patients were orally
      treated with S-1 in doses of 40 mg (BSA&lt;1.25 m2), 50 mg (1.25≤BSA&lt;1.50 m2) and 60 mg
      (BSA≥1.50 m2) b.i.d. on days 1-14 in combination with Nab-PTX (240 mg/m2, divided on days 1
      and 8, intravenously for 30 minutes) of each 21-day cycle. Treatment was planned for 6 cycles
      or until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.
