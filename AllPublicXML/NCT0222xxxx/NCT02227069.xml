  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, controlled, within-subject comparison, multiple dose
      study to determine the irritation potential of M518101 on normal skin under occlusive patch
      condition.

      The study drug will be applied for 21 days under occlusive patch condition. The irritation
      potential of M518101 will be compared with positive, negative control and M518101 vehicle.
      The study duration is 21days and there will be at least 23 visits to study center including
      screening visit.
