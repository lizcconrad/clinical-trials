      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the amount of effective CRT (Cardiac
      Resynchronization Therapy) pacing during AF (atrial fibrillation) when CAFRPlus (Conducted AF
      Response Plus) is applied is not inferior to the amount of effective CRT pacing during AF
      when CAFR (Conducted AF Response) is applied.

      The CRTee study is an IDE, prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, crossover
      clinical study, conducted worldwide and designed to demonstrate that the amount of effective
      CRT pacing during AF (atrial fibrillation) when CAFRPlus (Conducted AF Response Plus) is
      applied is not inferior to the amount of effective CRT pacing during AF when CAFR (Conducted
      AF Response) is applied.

      The study will be conducted at up to 30 centers located in the United States, Europe and
      Middle East and Africa (MEA).

    <description>The CAFRPlus algorithm is part of the CRTee feature set. This feature set has a diagnostic element that tracks the loss of effective CRT pacing that is occurring over time, both during normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and during AF. It also has an interventional element (i.e. CAFRPlus) that uses this evaluation of effective CRT pacing to adjust the pacing rate during AF to decrease loss of effective CRT pacing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing to sign and date the study patient Informed Consent form.

          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age (or older, if required by local law).

          -  Subject is expected to remain available after enrollment to complete follow-up visits
             in both arms of the study

          -  Subject has had a Medtronic Viva or Brava CRT-D device implanted at least 30 days
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject has history of AF burden, of at least 6 days of at least 4 hours of AF over
             any 4 week period within the last 90 days as documented in device diagnostic data OR
             if subject has no atrial lead (therefore no device diagnostic data) but clinical
             evidence of high AF burden.

          -  Subject has demonstrated history of being able to complete Left Ventricular Capture
             Management (LVCM) documented in device data.

          -  Subject has a documented % V pacing during AF of less than or equal to 97% within 90
             days prior to enrollment or within 10 days after enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has undergone AV node ablation for treatment of AF.

          -  Subject has complete or 3rd degree AV block.

          -  Subject has had an MI within 30 days.

          -  Subject has medical conditions that limit study participation (per physician
             discretion).

          -  Subject is enrolled in one or more concurrent studies that could confound the study
             results as determined by Medtronic.

          -  Subject has a limited life expectancy for non-cardiac causes that would not allow
             completion of the study.

          -  Subject is pregnant (in the US, all women of child-bearing potential must undergo a
             pregnancy test within seven days prior to CRTee download).

          -  Subject meets the exclusion criteria required by local law.

Conducted AF Response (CAFR): The CAFR algorithm is currently available in the Medtronic market-released devices and intended to promote delivery of CRT pacing during conducted AT/AF episodes.
Conducted AF Response Plus (CAFRPlus): The CAFRPlus algorithm is part of the CRTee feature set. This feature set has a diagnostic element that tracks the loss of effective CRT pacing that is occurring over time, both during normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and during AF. It also has an interventional element (i.e. CAFRPlus) that uses this evaluation of effective CRT pacing to adjust the pacing rate during AF to decrease loss of effective CRT pacing.</description>
