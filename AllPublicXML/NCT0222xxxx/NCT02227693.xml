    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study using
      avatrombopag for Japanese subjects with thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver
      disease. This study will assess the effect of avatrombopag on platelet counts in Japanese
      subjects. Subjects will be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to the mean platelet count
      measured at Screening and Baseline. Within the lower baseline platelet count cohort (less
      than 40 x 10^9/L), subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:3 ratio to receive placebo, 20 mg
      avatrombopag, 40 mg avatrombopag, or 60 mg avatrombopag for 5 days. Within the higher
      baseline platelet count cohort (from 40 to less than 50 x 10^9/L), subjects will be
      randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive placebo, 20 mg avatrombopag, or 40 mg avatrombopag for
      5 days.

      This study will consist of Prerandomization Phase and Randomization Phase. The
      Prerandomization Phase includes a Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1) and a Baseline Period
      (Day 1). The Randomization Phase includes the Treatment Period and the Follow-up Period. The
      Follow-up Period comprises 3 visits: Visit 4 (5 to 8 days after last dose of study drug
      [Study Day 10 to 13]), Visit 5 (12 to 15 days after last dose of study drug [Study Day 17 to
      20]), and 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug.

             described above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days
             after study drug discontinuation. All females will be considered to be of childbearing
             potential unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrhea in
             the appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been

             positive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] test with a minimum
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before
             the first dose of study drug.

         20. Post liver transplant subjects.

         21. Any subject who has previously received avatrombopag.

             Screening.

         24. White blood cell count less than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L or greater than or equal to
             15.0 x 10^9/L at Screening.

         25. Serum sodium level less than or equal to 130 mEq/L at Screening.

         26. Current malignancy including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (except HCC).

         27. Any history of a medical condition or a concomitant medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator(s), would compromise the subject's ability to safely
             complete the study.

         28. Currently enrolled in another clinical trial or used any investigational drug or
             device within 30 days of Screening.
