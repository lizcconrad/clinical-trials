      The primary purpose of this study is to:

        -  Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of repeated doses IV CR845 over one week
           in patients who are undergoing hemodialysis. (Part A)

        -  This study is also investigating whether repeated doses of IV CR845 over two weeks is
           safe and effective in reducing the intensity of itching in hemodialysis patients with
           uremic pruritus (Part B).

          -  Part B: Patient who reports a Patient B or Patient C profile on the Patient
             Self-categorization of Pruritus Disease Severity questionnaire at Screening;

          -  Part B: At the end of the Run-in Period:

               -  Patient who completed ratings of worst itching intensity [visual analog scale
                  (VAS)] at least 8 times out of 14 VAS assessments;

             attributed to ESRD complications such as hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia,
             anemia, or the dialysis procedure or prescription may be enrolled);

          -  Part B: Has localized itch restricted to the palms of the hands as determined from the
             Brief Itch Inventory diagram, completed during the Screening Period;

          -  Part B: Has used gabapentin, calcineurin inhibitors, opioids; antipsychotics; systemic
             or topical corticosteroids (other than otic or ophthalmic preparations); sedatives;
             hypnotics; anti-anxiety agents selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); or
             tricyclic antidepressants for &lt; 4 weeks prior to the start of the Run-In Period or had
             a dose change within the previous 30 days;

          -  Part B: Is not willing to abstain from use of antihistamines (oral, IV, or topical)

          -  Part B: Not willing to abstain from making changes to topical non-drug treatments
             (e.g., emollients, creams, oils) for pruritus for 3 weeks (from the start of the

          -  Part B: Received ultraviolet B treatment within 30 days prior to the start of the
