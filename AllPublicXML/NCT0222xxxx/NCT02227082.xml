  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of breast cancer patients receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment.
      Radiotherapy improves both locoregional control and overall survival. In most patients with
      breast cancer the locoregional recurrence rate (LRR) is low, however still high LRRs are
      found in certain patient groups, especially in locally advanced, inflammatory and triple
      negative breast cancer. Olaparib is a potent PARP inhibitor developed as an anti-cancer drug
      for homologous recombination (HR) defected tumors and as a dose intensifier for chemo- and
      radiotherapy. The combination of olaparib and radiotherapy is expected to improve
      locoregional control and thereby overall survival in both breast cancer patients with a high
      probability of locoregional recurrence and patients with HR deficient tumors. However, this
      combination treatment has never been tested in humans before. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the safety and tolerability of radiotherapy to the breast and regional lymph nodes
      with concurrent olaparib.
