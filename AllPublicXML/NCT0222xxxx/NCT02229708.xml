  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a technology-base healthy lifestyle program
      is an acceptable and effective way for African-American mothers to improve their eating and
      activity during pregnancy, compared to usual obstetric care. The goal of the program is to
      enhance the health of African-American mothers and their babies.

    <textblock>
      Black women are in particular need for obesity prevention and treatment. The childbearing
      period represents a critical life stage of heightened vulnerability for new or persistent
      obesity, especially among Black women, who retain 2-3 times more weight after pregnancy than
      White women. Pregnancy weight gain is the strongest identified risk factor for retaining a
      substantial amount of weight after pregnancy, yet few published interventions have been
      effective in reducing excessive weight gain in pregnancy, particularly among low-income Black
      mothers.

      The proposed research aims to meets the needs of low-income, Black mothers by developing a
      novel pregnancy intervention that 1) focuses solely on Black women, 2) incorporates Black
      mothers' information needs, values, and social context, and 3) uses technology to facilitate
      participant engagement.

    <description>The Usual Obstetric Care group will receive usual advice about nutrition and activity during pregnancy from their obstetrician along with some additional information about pregnancy and childbirth through readings from The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In addition, participants will receive weekly text messages to maintain contact and ensure follow-up.</description>

    <description>The Healthy Lifestyle Group will take part in an individual, technology-based behavioral intervention program which will include specific information about nutrition and physical activity, and strategies for helping them make changes to their diet, physical activity, and weight-related behaviors during pregnancy. Participants will receive information through print materials, text messages, a private Facebook group, and in-person visits and phone calls from a health coach who is part of our research team.</description>
