        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female between 18 and 75 years

          2. Diagnosis of METAVIR F3-4 hepatic fibrosis determined by liver biopsy done within 12
             months before screening (Cohort 1) or at the pre-dose biopsy within 6 weeks before
             treatment (Cohorts 2 and 3)

          3. Adequate and stable synthetic hepatic function (albumin ≥ 3 g/dL, international
             normalized ratio [INR] ≤ 1.4 x upper limit of normal [ULN] and stable by prior medical
             history).

          4. Adequate and stable hepatic function as measured by alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
             alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma glutamate transferase
             (GGTP), and total bilirubin (ALT/AST ≤ 5 x ULN, ALP ≤ 4 x ULN, GGTP ≤ 4 x ULN,
             bilirubin ≤ 2x ULN and stable by prior medical history).

          5. Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, and white blood cell count (WBC) &gt;
             3000/µL.

          6. No signs of decompensated liver disease (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal
             bleeding).

          7. No clinically significant abnormalities on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

          8. No other intercurrent medical conditions or infections considered clinically
             significant by the Investigator.

          9. Clinical laboratory assessments are within the laboratory limits of normal values or
             not considered clinically significant by the Investigator.

         10. Vitamin A levels at screening must be less than or equal to the upper limit of normal
             (ULN 95 µg/dL or 3.32 µmol/L).

         11. Any male subject, if sexually active, agrees to use barrier contraceptive techniques
             as defined in the protocol. If female, the subject must be of non-childbearing
             potential as defined in the protocol.

         12. Subjects who are active substances abusers may be enrolled at the discretion of the
             Principal Investigator.

         13. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and comply with the study
             procedures and visit schedule, including follow up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any disease or condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might compromise
             the hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic,
             skeletal, or central nervous system; or other conditions that may interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ND L02 s0201, or would place the
             subject at increased risk.

          2. On ongoing therapy for HCV/HBV, or received therapy for HCV/HBV within 12 weeks prior
             to administration of study drug.

          3. On interferon therapy for any disease or received interferon therapy for any disease
             within 12 weeks prior to administration of study drug.

          4. History of bone disease, including osteoporosis and osteomalacia, Paget's disease of
             bone, or a history of unexplained fractures or fractures after minimal trauma.

          5. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 50 ng/mL or signs of abnormality or hepatocellular carcinoma
             on ultrasound survey of the liver.

          6. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels above the ULN.

          7. Laboratory test results include abnormal values considered to be clinically
             significant by the Investigator.

          8. Participated in a concurrent interventional study with the last intervention occurring
             within 12 weeks prior to administration of study drug.

          9. Taken vitamin A or vitamin D supplements or multi-vitamins that contain vitamin A or
             vitamin D between the screening visit and administration of study drug.

         10. History, within the last 2 years, of alcohol abuse, significant mental illness, or
             physical dependence on any opioid.

         11. Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture or IV infusion (eg, veins that are
             difficult to locate, access or puncture; veins with a tendency to rupture during or
             after puncture).

         12. Received recent treatment with alternative therapies, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could potentially confound clinical or laboratory assessments.

         13. Lost more than 500 mL of blood within 56 days prior to administration of study drug.

         14. Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 38 kg/m2.

         15. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency
             syndrome-related illness (AIDS).

         16. History of malignancy within the last 5 years with the exception of basal cell
             carcinoma.

         17. Woman of childbearing potential.

         18. History of hypersensitivity to H2-receptor antagonists.

         19. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor's Medical
             Monitor, makes the subject unsuitable for enrollment.
