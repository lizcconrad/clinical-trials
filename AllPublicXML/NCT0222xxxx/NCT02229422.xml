    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that GA101 - Obinutuzumab in combination with HDMP is well tolerated and will
      induce similar if not higher response rates than the ones observed in Rituximab plus HDMP
      studies (Castro et al., 2009, Castro et al., 2008).

      This is an open label phase Ib/II clinical trial to determine the safety and clinical
      activity of the GA101 - Obinutuzumab in combination with high-dose methylprednisone (HDMP).
      We will evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first month of therapy as part of
      the phase Ib of this study. In the phase II we will determine response rate in an intention
      to treat analysis. In this study we will include CLL patients that have never received
      treatment as well as patients that have failed previous treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of CLL

          2. Indication for treatment as defined by the IWCLL Guidelines (Hallek et al., 2008b).

          3. Males and females 18 years of age and older.

          4. Laboratory parameters as specified below:

               -  Hematologic: Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL (may be post-transfusion); platelet count &gt; 40
                  x103/mm3 (may be post-transfusion). Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.0 109 cells/mm3
                  (Growth factor use is allowed).

               -  Hepatic: Total Bilirubin &lt; 3 x ULN, and ALT and AST &lt; 3 x ULN

               -  Renal: Creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min (Calculated according to institutional
                  standards or using Cockcroft-Gault formula. Subjects with requirement of
                  hemodialysis will be excluded).

          5. ECOG Performance Status &lt; 2, unless the decline of the performance status is
             considered to be related to CLL symptoms.

          6. Anticipated survival of at least 6 months.

          7. Subjects can be enrolled and treated under this protocol regardless of their CLL
             treatment history or number of previous treatments. In addition, subjects with history
             of allogeneic stem cell transplant can be enrolled and treated unless they have active
             manifestations of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) or chronic illness or infections that
