  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational agent, P10s-PADRE, a peptide
      mimotope-based vaccine, in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients
      with clinical stage I, II or III estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.

      This is a single-arm, multi-site Phase I/II study designed with the two goals being (1) to
      evaluate the feasibility of combining vaccination with the P10s-PADRE formulation with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and (2) to determine if the polymerase chain reaction (pCR) rate
      among ER-positive breast-cancer patients treated with the combination is significantly higher
      than the 8% rate observed among ER-positive breast-cancer subjects in a pooled analysis of
      seven randomized clinical trials. P10s-PADRE vaccine with MONTANIDE™ ISA 51 VG as adjuvant
      will be given in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in female patients with clinical
      stage I, II or III ER-positive breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of all races with clinical stage I, II, or III ER-positive breast cancer who
             qualify for standard neoadjuvant treatment

          -  Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL)
             of normal obtained within 2 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase test (AST) ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL) of normal
             obtained within 2 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL) of normal obtained within 2 weeks
             prior to registration.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.8 mg/dl obtained within 2 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Must sign an informed consent approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical
             Sciences (UAMS) Institutional Review Board (IRB).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection requiring treatment with antibiotics.

          -  Diagnosis or evidence of organic brain syndrome that might preclude participation in
             the full protocol.

          -  Diagnosis or evidence of significant impairment of basal cognitive function that might
             preclude participation in the full protocol.

          -  No other current malignancies. Subjects with prior history at any time of any in situ
             cancer, including lobular carcinoma of the breast in situ, cervical cancer in situ,
             atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or Clark I melanoma in situ or basal or squamous skin
             cancer are eligible, provided they are disease-free at the time of registration.
             Subjects with other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease
             free for ≥ 5 years prior to the time of registration.

          -  Autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression. This includes, but is not
             limited to being treated with corticosteroids, including oral steroids (i.e.
             prednisone, dexamethasone [except when used as an antiemetic in standard therapy]),
             continuous use of topical steroid creams or ointments or any steroid-containing
             inhalers. Subjects who discontinue the use of these classes of medication for at least
             6 weeks prior to registration are eligible if, in the judgment of the treating
             physician, the subject is not likely to require these classes of drugs during the
             treatment period. Replacement doses of steroids for subjects with adrenal
             insufficiency are allowed.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding (due to the unknown effects of peptide/mimotope vaccines
             on a fetus or infant). Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study drug and
             must be counseled to use an accepted and effective method of contraception (including
             abstinence) while on treatment and for a period of 18 months after completing or
             discontinuing treatment. Accepted methods of contraception include oral
             contraceptives, barrier methods, Intrauterine Device (IUDs), and abstinence.

          -  Any other significant medical or psychiatric conditions which, in the opinion of the
             enrolling investigator, may interfere with consent or compliance of the treatment
             regimen.
