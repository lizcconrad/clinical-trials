  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the longitudinal efficacy of a potassium nitrate
      mouthwash formulation when used as an adjunct to brushing with a standard fluoride dentifrice
      for the relief of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) compared to brushing with a standard
      fluoride dentifrice alone. This will be a single centre, eight week, randomised, examiner
      blind, two treatment arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff Sensitivity
      Score of the two selected test teeth) study in participants with at least two sensitive teeth
      that meet all the criteria at the Screening and Baseline visit. Participants will be assessed
      at Baseline, and at four and eight weeks to monitor clinical efficacy and safety.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner indicated the participant's response to an evaporaitve air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale scored as follows - 0: Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1: responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score is indicative of an imrpovement in sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the subject whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the subject gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>

    <description>Participants rated the intensity of their response to an evaporative air stimulus using a 10 point VRS scale with 1 indicating 'no pain' and 10 indicating 'Intense pain'. A reduction in the score is indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>

             hypersensitivity lasting more than 6 months but not more than 10 years.

          -  Participants with minimum of 20 natural teeth.

          -  At screening, a minimum of four, non-adjacent teeth.

               1. Teeth showing signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of erosion

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>The examiner indicated the participant's response to an evaporaitve air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale scored as follows - 0: Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1: responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score is indicative of an imrpovement in sensitivity.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold at Week 8</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the subject whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the subject gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>
