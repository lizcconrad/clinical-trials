  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims is to evaluate the effect of introducing paired testing on actual testing
      frequency, glycemic control, psychosocial and behavioural aspects of poorly controlled
      diabetes patients in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in insulin treated type 1 and type 2 diabetics has
      consistently been demonstrated to confer benefits, and is considered an essential part in the
      management of diabetes. In China, utilization of SMBG among diabetes patients is low. Even
      among those who perform SMBG regularly, the daily testing frequency falls short of those
      recommended in international and national clinical guidelines. There is thus a need to create
      the awareness of the benefits of SMBG and at the same time establish a SMBG regimen that is
      deemed practically feasible and cost effective for diabetes patients.

      Paired testing entails the act of measuring glucose level before and after an event that may
      impact the glucose level in a patient, e.g. meals, exercise, medication adjustment, and
      thereafter responding to any abnormal glucose levels/patterns by modifying lifestyle and/or
      medication.

      This study aims is to evaluate the effect of introducing paired testing on actual testing
      frequency, glycemic control, psychosocial and behavioral aspects of poorly controlled
      diabetes patients in China.

    <description>Patients in the paired testing arms will undergo training on paired testing with Accu-Chek® Active blood glucose meters. The paired testing training would include (1) how and when (testing regimen) to perform paired testing, and (2) how to respond to paired testing readings via lifestyle modifications, self-adjustment of insulin dose and additional testing, if applicable. Please refer to Annex A for further details of the training.</description>
