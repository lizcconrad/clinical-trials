      While using the device as a cushion, the passive distribution of pressure over bony skull
      prominences of infants will protect against formation of pressure ulcers.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of the Invictus Cranial Support Device (CSD)
      when worn by medically stable infants within a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), to
      evaluate the form, fit, and ease of use/application of the CSD device (i.e., utility), as
      well as initial impressions of safety, by health care providers (HCPs) after placing the
      current CSD on infants for approximately six (6) hours in a NICU. Specifically, this study
      will:

        -  Collect safety information at specified time points (baseline, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 3
           hours, and 6 hours) utilizing a widely used dermal assessment tool, health assessments
           (temperature, pulse, respiration rate), excessive scalp sweating/moisture accumulation,
           and adverse events, as reflected in the Table 1.0, Time and Events Table.

      Additional safety assessments will be performed following the final removal of the CSD from
      the infants head. Refer to Table 1.0 Time and Events Table and section 6.1.

        -  Assess the HCP's impression of likely safety and effectiveness (Function Assessments) of
           the CSD based on experience working with infants in the NICU, Evaluate/Rate the form and
           fit, and evaluate/rate the ease of application of the product.

        -  Collect additional feedback (if any) on HCP's impressions of device design and usability
           based on experience working as a HCP in the NICU

    <description>Rating scale data will be collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine overall HCP assessments of the products form, fit, likely effectiveness, and safety for internal decision making and for support of an FDA 510K submission to demonstrate form and fit as it relates to a predicate device. No hypothesis testing will be conducted. Only descriptive statistics, frequency counts, and proportions will be used to summarize the data. Descriptive statistics, such as number of observations, means, standard deviations, medians, and maximum and minimum values, will be used to summarize the continuous variables. Frequencies and proportions will be used to summarize categorical variables.</description>

    <description>Following an initial examination of the scalp and head for baseline evidence of skin integrity (intact, without breaks, lacerations, etc.) and appearance (healthy/normal, no erythema/irritation, etc.) the HCP will place the CSD on the patient and secure the attached Velcro strap to hold the device in place
At specific time points (approximately 15 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours and 6 hours) the HCP (through human intervention)will remove the CSD for examination and completion of the Skin Assessment Scale based on the appearance of the patient's scalp and adjacent areas of the head. Additionally, the patient's head will be observed for excessive scalp sweating/moisture accumulation.</description>

The device used in this study is a soft gel based bonnet referred to as a Cranial Support Device (CSD). In this study, after obtaining written informed consent from the patient's parent(s) or guardian(s) and confirming that the patient meets all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, the study HCP will place the CSD on the selected patient.</description>
