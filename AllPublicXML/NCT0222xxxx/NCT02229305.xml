  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focused on youths who were referred to community-based mental healths clinics for
      problems related to disruptive behaviors, depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and any
      combination of these problems. Therapists were randomly assigned to deliver usual treatment
      procedures (usual care, or UC) in their clinics or an evidence-based, modularized treatment
      (Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct
      Problems, or MATCH-ADTC). Assessments were conducted at pre-treatment and post-treatment, and
      every 3 to 6 months for two years. Results will address critical questions about deployment
      of evidence-based youth practices to clinical settings.

      This study focused on youths aged 6 - 15 who were referred to community-based mental healths
      clinics for problems related to disruptive behaviors, depression, anxiety, traumatic stress,
      and any combination of these problems. Using a randomized block design, therapists were
      randomly assigned to deliver usual treatment procedures (usual care, or UC) in their clinics
      or an evidence-based, modularized treatment (Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with
      Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems, or MATCH-ADTC). MATCH-ADTC was supported by
      training and supervision procedures designed to fit providers and their clinic contexts.
      Assessments were carried out at pre-treatment, at post-treatment, and at 3-,6-,9-,12,18-,and
      24-month follow-ups. Assessments carried out at pre-treatment included (a) individual youth
      problems and disorders; (b) individual youth functioning at home and school; and (c) clinic
      staff beliefs and attitudes toward evidence-based treatments. Assessments carried out at
      post-treatment and follow-ups included measures of (1) youth, caregiver, and therapist
      satisfaction with treatment; (b) youth, caregiver, and therapist views on the quality of the
      therapeutic relationship; and (c) treatment costs. Assessments carried out at follow-up only
      included measures of (a) caregiver reports of any mental health service use following project
      treatment; (b) therapist reports on the extent to which the treatment procedures they used in
      the project are continued after project termination. Analyses will address critical questions
      about deployment of evidence-based youth practices to clinical settings.

    <measure>Brief Problem Checklist (BPC, parent and child forms)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 242 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Youth and parents were contacted weekly to report changes in youth functioning. Each person was asked to rate their own or their child's behavior on 12 items (6 internalizing and 6 externalizing behaviors) that were adapted from the Youth Self Report and the Child Behavior Checklist. Children and caregivers completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, every week during treatment, and at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 242days (SD = 121 days) after the pre-treatment assessment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Top Problems Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 735 (24-month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Youths and parents were asked to identify &quot;The three most important problems for which you need [or &quot;your child needs&quot;] help.&quot; at the intake assessment. The six resulting problems (3 from youth, 3 from parent) were then rated on a scale of 0 (&quot;Not serious at all&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Very serious problem&quot;) by youth and parent. Youths and parents completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 242 days (SD = 121 days) after the pre-treatment assessment, and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month follow-up from Day 1. (Used as a measure of clinical outcome.)</description>

    <measure>UCLA PTSD Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 735 (24-month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Index is a 38-item questionnaire that is widely-used to assess post-traumatic stress symptoms in children. Part I is a brief lifetime trauma screen. If a significant trauma is identified, Part II assesses DSM-IV PTSD symptoms related to the trauma. Part III assesses frequency of post-traumatic stress symptoms during the past month. The measure has shown good convergent validity, strong test-retest reliability, and Cronbach's alpha values in the .90s. We will administer it separately to students and their caregivers at pre-treatment, to determine whether post-traumatic stress should be a focus of treatment, and we will re-administer it at post-treatment and follow-up to assess change over time. Youths and parents completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 242 days (SD = 121 days) after the pre-treatment assessment, and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month follow-up from Day 1. (Used as a measure of clinical outcome.)</description>

    <measure>Youth Self Report (YSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 735 (24-month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The YSR assesses problems in children on eight narrow-band scales (Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxious, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Rule-Breaking Behavior, Aggressive Behavior), three broad-band scales (Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total problems), and six DSM-oriented scales. Children completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 242 days (SD = 121 days) after the pre-treatment assessment, and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month follow-up from Day 1.(Used as a measure of clinical outcome.)</description>

    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 735 (24-month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL assesses problems in children on eight narrow-band scales (Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxious, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Rule-Breaking Behavior, Aggression), three broad-band scales (Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total problems), and six DSM-oriented scales. Caregivers completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment, and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month follow-up from Day 1. (Used as a measure of clinical outcome.)</description>

    <measure>Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment (Day 267)</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of youths' working alliance with their therapists was assessed via the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children (TASC, Shirk &amp; Saiz, 1992). The 7-item scale comes in both a youth-report form and a parent-report form (parents reporting on their youth's relationship with the therapist). On average, children and caregivers completed the post-treatment assessment 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment. (Available for supplemental analyses.)</description>

    <measure>Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents: Treatment and Auxiliary Service Use Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over tiem from Day 1 to Day 735 (24-month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The SACA (Horwitz et al., 2001)is a standardized interview for youths and parents that measures use of mental health services across a broad spectrum (including outpatient, inpatient, and school-based). SACA reliability and validity data are well-documented. Caregivers completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment, and at 12- and 24-month follow-up from Day 1.(Available for supplemental analyses.)</description>

    <measure>Brief Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 735 (24-month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The BIS is a 23-item instrument that evaluates three domains of functioning: interpersonal relations, school/work functioning, and self-care/self-fulfillment. Its advantages over other global impairment instruments are that it is respondent based, short in administration time, and multidimensional. Caregivers completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment, and at 12- and 24-month follow-up from Day 1.(Available for supplemental analyses.)</description>

    <measure>Services for Children and Adolescents - Parent Interview (SCAPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 735 (24-month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The SCAPI is a measure that tracks child's use of medication as reported by the parent. Caregivers completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment, and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month follow-up from Day 1.(Available for supplemental analyses.)</description>
