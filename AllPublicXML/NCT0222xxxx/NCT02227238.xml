  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), publicly funded programmes tend
      to follow World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to use a non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs) for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART); however, there is a need for further
      data on the best treatment options for people with HIV-1 who have virological failure with
      this first-line regimen. The number of patients failing on their first-line regimen is
      increasing thereby requiring a switch to second-line treatment to reduce accumulation of
      drug-resistance mutations, disease progression, HIV transmission, and death. WHO guidelines
      recommend second-line antiretroviral therapy for adults consisting of two NRTIs + a
      ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI); atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) or lopinavir
      (LPV)/RTV are the preferred boosted PI options. This study is conducted to demonstrate
      non-inferior antiviral activity at 48 weeks of a dolutegravir (DTG) containing regimen
      compared to a WHO-recommended standard of care regimen for second line treatment, LPV/RTV +
      two NRTIs, in HIV-1 infected patients failing first line therapy. This study comprises of a
      Screening Phase (approximately 28 to 42 days), a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to Week 48 plus a
      4-week treatment extension), and a Continuation Phase. Approximately 612 subjects will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 milligram (mg) once daily or LPV/RTV (800/200 mg once daily
      or 400/100 mg twice daily, in accordance with investigator decision and local label), each
      added to an investigator selected background regimen of two NRTIs at least one of which needs
      to be fully active based on viral resistance testing at Screening. Subjects randomized to
      receive DTG who successfully complete 52 weeks of treatment will continue to have access to
      DTG until it is either locally approved and commercial supplies are available to patients or
      the patient no longer derives clinical benefit, or the patient meets a protocol-defined
      reason for discontinuation.

          -  Subjects must receive at least one fully active agent within the dual-NRTI background
             regimen for second line treatment. Fully active is defined by the Screening genotypic
             resistance report of the central laboratory (or a laboratory contracted by the central
             laboratory) showing no evidence of full or of partial resistance for a given NRTI
             which will be taken on study.

          -  Subject is PI-naïve and Integrase inhibitor (INI)-naïve, defined as no prior or
             current exposure to any PI or INI.

          -  Subject or the subject's legal representative is willing and able to understand and
             provide signed and dated written informed consent prior to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             classification

          -  Unstable liver disease (as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or persistent
             jaundice), cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's
             syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Anticipated need for hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy during the Randomised Phase of
             the study.

          -  History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components
             or drugs of their class.

          -  Ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or
             resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia; other localised malignancies require agreement between the investigator and
             the Study medical monitor for inclusion of the subject.

          -  Subjects who in the investigator's judgment, poses a significant suicidality risk.
             Recent history of suicidal behaviour and/or suicidal ideation may be considered as
             evidence of serious suicide risk.

          -  Treatment with an HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening.

          -  Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Screening: radiation
             therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, systemically administered
             immunomodulators.

          -  Treatment with any agent, other than licensed ART as allowed above with documented
             activity against HIV-1 in vitro/vivo within 28 days of first dose of IP. The exception
             is use of entecavir, in appropriate clinical situations, for treatment of hepatitis B
             [e.g. prior intolerance to Tenofovir (TDF), viral resistance to lamivudine (3TC) /
             Emtricitabine (FTC)] after discussion and agreement between the investigator and the
             medical monitor.

          -  Exposure to an experimental drug or experimental vaccine within either 28 days, 5
             half-lives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             test agent, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of IP.

          -  Any evidence of primary viral resistance to PIs or INIs based on the presence of any
             major resistance-associated mutation.

          -  The subject's virus does not yield results using genotype at Screening (assay data is
             essential for eligibility determination).

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality, with the exception of Grade 4
             triglycerides. A single repeat test is allowed during the Screening period to verify a
             result.

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;=5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT
             &gt;=3xULN and bilirubin &gt;=1.5xULN (with &gt;35% direct bilirubin)
