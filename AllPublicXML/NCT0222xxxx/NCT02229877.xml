  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: determine the effect of stomach pH on the multiple dose
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of gefapixant (AF-219); assess the effect of multiple doses of
      gefapixant on various sensory assessments; and, assess the safety and tolerability of
      gefapixant.

    <description>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed on log normal-transformed Cmax and AUC0-t values to determine the extent of a drug interaction, if any, of omeprazole on the plasma gefapixant PK parameters. These analyses will be conducted for both fed and fasted conditions and the 50 mg and 150 mg treatments.</description>
