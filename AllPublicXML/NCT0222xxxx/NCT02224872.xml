  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is to determine if it is feasible for SAA patients to be transplanted
      using non-myeloablative conditioning and post transplantation cyclophosphamide with partially
      HLA-mismatched donors.

      This research is being done to find out if bone marrow transplantation (BMT) followed by
      chemotherapy will help people with aplastic anemia who have failed other treatments.

      You have a severe, life threatening disease (severe aplastic anemia) in your bone marrow.
      Your disease has come back or not responded after receiving one or more immunosuppressive
      treatments. High dose chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been
      used to treat blood diseases like yours but complications from Graft vs. Host disease (GVHD)
      and graft failure have limited the survival for those people.

      A small study done at Johns Hopkins has shown that in subjects with other diseases (blood
      cancers) some immunosuppressive drugs given after the BMT have decreased how often subjects
      had complications of GVHD and engraftment failure.

      People with aplastic anemia who have refractory disease (not responding to standard
      treatment) may join.

                    -  Platelets &lt; 20,000 per ml

                    -  Absolute retic &lt; 60,000 or corrected retic &lt; 1%

               -  Very severe: as above, but ANC &lt; 200

               -  Disease may be designated as acquired or inherited if previous counts known
                  (these other bone marrow failure disorders that are characterized by aplastic
                  anemia may go by additional names such as dyskeratosis congenita or PNH)

               -  Failed at least one course of immunosuppressive therapy (if presumed acquired
                  disease). Patients with inherited disease will be characterized as refractory and
                  do not require immunosuppressive first.

          -  Age 0- upper age limit as determined by current institutional standards

          -  Good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1; Karnofsky and Lansky 70-100)

          -  Patients and donors must be able to sign consent forms (or if a minor the parent will
             sign). Donors should be willing to donate.

          -  Patients must be geographically accessible and willing to participate in all stages of
             treatment.

          -  Adequate end-organ function as measured by:

               1. Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; or = to 35%, or shortening fraction &gt; 25%
                  (For pediatric patients, a normal ejection fraction is required)

               2. Bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome or hemolysis), and ALT
                  and AST ≤ 5 x ULN

               3. FEV1 and FVC &gt; or = to 40% of predicted; or in pediatric patients, if unable to
                  perform pulmonary function tests due to young age, oxygen saturation &gt;92% on room
                  air

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will not be excluded on the basis of sex, racial or ethnic background.

          -  Prior transfusions from selected donor (as this could have cause recipient
             alloimmunization against the donor)

          -  Women of childbearing potential who currently are pregnant (HCG+) or who are not
             practicing adequate contraception.

          -  Patients who have any debilitating medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude
             their giving informed consent or their receiving optimal treatment and follow up.

          -  Uncontrolled viral, bacterial, or fungal infections (HIV infection permitted if viral
             load undetectable)
