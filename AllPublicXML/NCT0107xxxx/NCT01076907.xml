      Hypotheses

        1. Loading the sigmoid colon with warm water and warm water irrigation for dealing with
           spasm (Study Treatment) will significantly reduce the proportion of patients complaining
           of abdominal discomfort compared with no water loading and waiting for spasms to subside
           (Control Treatment). The median discomfort score reported by the patients will be
           significantly lower in the group receiving the Study Treatment than the group receiving
           Control Treatment. Hypothesis

        2. Exploratory hypothesis: There are differences in secondary outcome variables when
           patients managed by the Study and Control Treatments are compared. Co-variables affect
           the primary and secondary outcome variables.

      The purpose of the study is to conduct a RCT study to determine the effectiveness of loading
      the sigmoid colon with warm water and warm water irrigation for dealing with colonic spasms
      in enhancing patient abdominal comfort during unsedated colonoscopy. The specific aim is to
      compare Study Treatment of warm water loading and irrigation when spasms occur with Control
      Treatment of no water loading and waiting for spasms to subside. The proportion of patients
      complaining of abdominal discomfort and their discomfort score are the primary outcome
      variables. The secondary outcome variables and co-variables described below will be recorded
      in a prospective manner to ensure completeness of data collection. In preliminary clinical
      observation at VA Sepulveda ACC, 25 to 30% of VA patients accept colonoscopy without
      sedation. The goal of this study is to find ways of further reducing discomfort associated
      with unsedated colonoscopy.
