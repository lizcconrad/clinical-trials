  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of multimedia and print tools
      designed to provide patients at safety-net clinics with comprehensible information about
      colorectal cancer screening and motivate them to complete screening.The print and multimedia
      interventions were constructed with parallel content to allow valid comparison of
      format-related effects on knowledge and screening rates.These easy to use tools will provide
      under served patients at community health centers with clear and consistent messages about
      colorectal Cancer(CRC) and CRC screening, delivered immediately before the patients see a
      doctor.

      Specific Aims

        1. To determine if multimedia and print interventions that provide patients with
           information and motivational messages about CRC screening increase screening rates above
           usual care.

        2. Determine whether showing patients a multimedia program achieves higher CRC screening
           rates than does a print booklet with equivalent messages.

             1. Examine if the effects of these multimedia and print interventions on CRC screening
                rates differ with literacy level.

             2. Examine if the effects of these multimedia and print interventions on CRC screening
                differ with race/ethnicity

             3. Examine if these multimedia and print interventions have differential effects on
                knowledge relevant to CRC screening.

      Despite the clear benefits of screening for early detection and prevention of colorectal
      cancer, as many as half of eligible adults remain unscreened. Poor and under served
      populations, particularly African American and Latino/Hispanic adults, are at greatest risk
      for noncompliance with recommended tests. Health education strategies developed to date have
      led to relatively minimal gains, resulting in little translation to routine clinical
      practice. This is especially true in more difficult, resource-strained practice settings,
      such as community health centers.

      The interventions in the proposed study draw on communication science to optimize message
      design, use communication technology to optimize message delivery and include parallel
      content in both print and multimedia versions to allow comparison of format-related effects
      on both knowledge and screening rates.The multimedia and print tools are based on patient
      education programs that we developed with extensive attention to theory as well as community
      member input.
