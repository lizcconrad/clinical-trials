    <textblock>
      Subjects undergoing an elective complete colonoscopy will randomly receive either PicoPrep:
      2-sachets for oral solution in two divided doses given a night before (first dose - sachet)
      and approximately 5 hours prior to procedure (second dose - sachet) or HalfLytely: for oral
      solution and two 5 mg Bisacodyl tablets, given the day before the procedure to evaluate its
      effectiveness, tolerability and safety.

    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Overall colon cleansing was assessed by a blinded gastroenterologist during the colonoscopy using the Aronchick scale. The Aronchick scale is a 4-step rating scale: inadequate, fair, good, and excellent. Excellent is defined as &gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, minimal suctioning needed for adequate visualization. Good is defined as &gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, significant suctioning needed for adequate visualization.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Overall colon cleansing was assessed by a blinded gastroenterologist during the colonoscopy using the Ottawa scale, a 5-step rating scale: inadequate, poor, fair, good, and excellent. Excellent is defined as mucosal detail clearly visible; if fluid is present, it is clear and there is almost no stool residue. Good - some turbid fluid or stool residue but mucosal detail still visible; washing and suctioning is not necessary. Fair - turbid fluid or stool residue obscuring mucosal detail. However, mucosal detail becomes visible with suctioning and washing is not necessary.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Counts of participants who had TEAEs are summarized in a variety of categories. Severity and relatedness to study drug are in the opinion of the investigator. Severity is rated on a 3-point scale: mild (awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity), moderate (event sufficient to affect usual activity), and severe (inability to work or perform usual activities). Only severe TEAEs are summarized. Relatedness is assessed on a 4-point scale: unrelated, unlikely, possibly and probably. Both possibly and probably answers are reported as 'related' to study medication.</description>

    <description>PICOPREP (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide and citric acid) powder for oral solution consisted of 2 pouches of powder administered in a divided dose. Each PICOPREP pouch was reconstituted by mixing the contents in a cup with 5 ounces of cold water. The first pouch was taken between 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM the evening prior to the colonoscopy procedure. Subjects were to consume five (5) 8-ounce glasses of clear liquids over the next few hours. The second pouch was taken approximately 5 hours before but no more than 9 hours prior to the colonoscopy procedure. Subjects were to consume three (3) 8-ounce glasses of clear liquids.</description>

The Aronchick scale is a 4-step rating scale: inadequate, fair, good, and excellent. Excellent is defined as &gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, minimal suctioning needed for adequate visualization. Good is defined as &gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, significant suctioning needed for adequate visualization.</description>

        <description>Overall colon cleansing was assessed by a blinded gastroenterologist during the colonoscopy using the Ottawa scale, a 5-step rating scale: inadequate, poor, fair, good, and excellent. Excellent is defined as mucosal detail clearly visible; if fluid is present, it is clear and there is almost no stool residue. Good - some turbid fluid or stool residue but mucosal detail still visible; washing and suctioning is not necessary. Fair - turbid fluid or stool residue obscuring mucosal detail. However, mucosal detail becomes visible with suctioning and washing is not necessary.</description>

        <description>Counts of participants who had TEAEs are summarized in a variety of categories. Severity and relatedness to study drug are in the opinion of the investigator. Severity is rated on a 3-point scale: mild (awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity), moderate (event sufficient to affect usual activity), and severe (inability to work or perform usual activities). Only severe TEAEs are summarized. Relatedness is assessed on a 4-point scale: unrelated, unlikely, possibly and probably.
