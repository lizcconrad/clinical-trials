    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity of three dose levels (5µg, 15µg and 45µg HA) of the novel A
      (H1N1) influenza VLP vaccine as compared with a placebo in healthy adults (18 to 64 years of
      age).

      The study will be conducted in two parts (A &amp; B) at a single center in Mexico. The purpose of
      Part A is to evaluate the safety of the H1N1 VLP vaccine and to evaluate immunogenicity and
      select a dose for Part B. In Part A, 1,000 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to a
      1:1:1:1 schedule (5µg, 15µg and 45µg doses of H1N1 VLP vaccine or placebo. Subjects will
      receive two intramuscular (IM) injections (0.5mL/dose) of the H1N1 VLP vaccine or placebo 21
      days apart. Blood for HAI assays will be collected at 3 time points (baseline, Day 14 and Day
      36). Subjects will be followed for all adverse events (AEs) from the first day of the study
      through 21 days after the second dose (Day 36). Subjects will be followed for serious AEs and
      significant new medical conditions (SNMCs) to the end of the study 6 months post-dose 2 (Day
      194).

      Once the first 500 subjects are enrolled into Part A, enrollment will be halted until 3 days
      of safety follow-up data are reviewed by the study Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). A
      second data review will occur following Day 14 visit for Part A to select the dose to be
      administered in Part B.

      Part B of the study will be conducted to evaluate safety and accumulate enough safety data to
      potentially move forward with broader use of the vaccine assuming favorable results. In Part
      B, a total of 3,250 - 3,750 subjects will be randomized to receive the selected dose of H1N1
      VLP vaccine or placebo. A total of 3,000 H1N1 VLP vaccine recipients at the selected dose or
      higher, and 1,250 placebo recipients will be enrolled in Parts A and B. Following completion
      of Day 36 in Part A, data may be reviewed to assess 1 injection vs. 2 injections in Part B.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 18-64 years of age at the time of the vaccination.

          2. Informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to beginning any study
             specific procedures indicating that they understand the purpose of this study and are
             willing to adhere to the procedures described in this protocol.

          3. Available by telephone.

          4. Free of obvious health problems or chronic illnesses (e.g., recent exacerbation or
             acute episode of chronic illness in the last 3 months) as established by medical
             history, review of systems, and clinical examination before entering the study. This
             includes any mental condition that would interfere with subject self-assessment.
             Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will be allowed to participate if the
             disease is stable. Stable disease is defined as no new onset of exacerbation of
             pre-existing chronic disease 3 months prior to study vaccine injection.

          5. Female of childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or have used adequate
             contraceptive precautions (e.g., intrauterine contraceptive device; oral
             contraceptives or other equivalent hormonal contraception) for 2 months prior to
             vaccination. Subject must also have a negative pregnancy test at study entry then at
             Day 22 and must agree to continue to use adequate contraceptive precautions for three

          2. Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or
             medication) within 1 month prior to vaccination in this study or expect to receive an
             experimental agent during this study (prior to the Day 201 follow-up call - 180 days
             after the second vaccination).

          3. Have received any live licensed vaccines within 4 weeks or inactivated licensed

             vaccines within 21 days following the second vaccination.

          4. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the study
             vaccine. The use of topical, inhaled and nasal steroids will be permitted.

          5. Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunodeficient condition based on medical
             history and physical examination.

          6. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

             defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever &gt; 38 C.

          8. Acute clinically-significant pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular, hepatic or
             renal functional abnormality as determined by physical examination or laboratory
             screening tests.

          9. Major congenital defects that may increase the risk for complications from influenza.

         10. History of any neurological disorders or seizures (with the exception of febrile
             seizures during childhood) related to an underlying immune disease or disorder, such
             as but not limited to multiple sclerosis, lupus, and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
             Individuals with other neurological disorders that are clinically mild and stable with
             medication, such as mild Parkinson's disease, will not be excluded.
