    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend endocrine treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in
      post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Musculoskeletal symptoms
      are commonly reported with AI treatment,however, we do not have consistent methods to measure
      these symptoms prospectively. This gap in our knowledge inhibits the ability to test and
      develop treatments for AI-associated musculoskeletal symptoms. This pilot study will evaluate
      functional tests and standardized instruments for their ability to prospectively assess
      musculoskeletal symptoms in women being treated with AIs for breast cancer.

      Specific Aims: 1) identify a core set of instruments for measuring musculoskeletal symptoms,
      2) model the time course and predictors of change in musculoskeletal symptoms, 3) explore the
      effect of musculoskeletal symptoms on adherence to AIs in women during the first 6 months of
      AI treatment.

      Methods: We will prospectively assess musculoskeletal symptoms due to treatment with
      aromatase inhibitors. Post-menopausal women beginning AI treatment for hormone responsive
      breast cancer will be invited to join this study.
