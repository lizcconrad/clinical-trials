  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of a new oral liquid
      moxifloxacin formulation and the influence of concommitant food intake on the
      pharmacokinetics in healthy adults compared to the marketed oral tablet. Pharmacokinetics is
      to see how the body absorbs, distributes and gets rid of the study drug. The absorption of
      the drug administered in a different dosage form may be altered due to the influence of
      different excipients used. The safety of moxifloxacin when administered as an oral liquid
      formulation will also be looked at. Results from this study will be used to guide dosing
      strategies of the larger clinical trial planned for children.
