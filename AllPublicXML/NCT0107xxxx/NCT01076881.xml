  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial with participants recruited from one dialysis unit of a Brazilian
      university hospital. Hemodialysis patients were assigned to receive the resistance exercise
      combined with an aerobic training or the resistance training alone for a period of 10 weeks.
      The functional performance of patients was assessed before and after the intervention through
      the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The difference over time of the 6MWT was compared between
      the groups through multivariate linear regression.

      Thirteen patients were allocated for each group of intervention. The difference in distance
      walked before and after intervention in the combined training group was of +39.7 (61.4)
      meters, and this difference in the resistance training group was of -19.2 (53.9) meters,
      p=0.01. In multivariate analysis with adjustment for age, skin color, gender, hematocrit,
      time since starting dialysis, Kt/V and baseline values of 6MWT, the type of training remained
      significantly associated with the amount of increase in walked distance.

      Although the best protocol of exercise for patients on dialysis is not yet clear, in the
      investigators sample of hemodialysis patients the combination of aerobic and resistance
      training was more effective to improve functional performance.
