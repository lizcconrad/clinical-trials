      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the long term reliability of the Medtronic
      Adapta®/Sensia™/Versa™ platform of devices. This study is required by FDA as a condition of
      approval of nEw3 devices. Patients will be followed for 5 years after implant. This study
      utilizes data collected from the System Longevity Study (SLS).
