  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on the aerobic capacity, the
      daily functioning, post-stroke fatigue , depression and cardiovascular risk factors in stroke
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with neurologic impairments after stroke often show decreased aerobic exercise
      capacity. The etiologies of which are assigned to physiologic changes in paretic muscle, gait
      deficits and disability-related deconditioning. This declares that stroke patients live an
      inactive lifestyle and therefore stay cardiovascular risk patients.

      The usefulness of aerobic training on aerobic capacity is recently been proved in clinical
      stroke research. However, no study can shown the long-term effect of aerobic exercises. Also
      the effect of aerobic exercises on daily functioning, fatigue and depression in stroke needs
      to be established.

    <description>The patients continues their regular therapy in the rehabilitation center. They participate in a 12-week programme of aerobic training 30 minutes/session, using a leg cycle bike. Patients will be trained three times a week. The heart rate will vary from 50 tot 75% of their predicted heart rate. Each patient will be provided with an progressive exercise prescription based on 50-75% of their predicted maximum heartrate. Throughout the training sessions the heart rate will be monitored continuously with a polar pulse rate. Within these 12 week training programme 4 information sessions will be offered to patients and relatives about risk factors of stroke, usefulness of an active lifestyle and healthy eating.</description>
