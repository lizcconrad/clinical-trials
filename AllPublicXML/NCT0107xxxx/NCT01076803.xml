    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Lanreotide 120 mg for the
      relief of clinical symptoms due to malignant bowel obstruction in inoperable patients. This
      effect will be evaluated by the percentage of responder patients 7 and 14 days after one
      administration of lanreotide 120 mg.

      (A responder patient will be defined either as a patient experiencing &lt; or= 1 vomiting
      episode per day during at least three consecutive days or as a patient in whom NGT has been
      removed without any vomiting recurrence during at least three consecutive days)

      The total number of visits will depend on the clinical situation, 5 visits are obligatory:
      Day(D)-3/-0,Day 1,Day 7,Day 14,Day 28

      Inclusion visit (D-3/-0): eligibility, PIC, obstruction history, clinical exam, vital signs,
      diary cards, VAS scale, cc medication, blood sample

      Visit D1: injection Visit D7/D14/28: clinical exam, nutrition procedure, result of
      biochemical analyse, adverse events, cc medication

      In between the visits, the patient will keep and fill out his diary and VAS scale
