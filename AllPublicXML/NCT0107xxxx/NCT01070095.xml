  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common and potentially fatal chronic disease. An asthma action plan (AAP) is a
      written plan produced by a physician for a patient with asthma, to provide education and
      guidelines for self-management of worsening asthma symptoms. Studies have shown that AAPs
      effectively improve asthma control, but physicians fail to provide AAPs due to lack of time
      and adequate skills. Physicians also often fail to determine if their patients have good
      asthma control, and to adjust medications in response to patients' control level. The
      investigators propose to develop and test a computerized tool that will help physicians to
      determine if their patients' asthma is well controlled, advise them on medication changes
      required according to the current level of control, and automatically generate an electronic
      version of the AAP, all based on patient responses to a questionnaire. The investigators hope
      that this system will eliminate the barriers that physicians face in determining asthma
      control, adjusting medications, and delivering an AAP, and will increase the frequency with
      which physicians are able to achieve these goals in patients with asthma. The objectives of
      the study are to determine the impact of this system on asthma action plan delivery by
      primary care physicians, the frequency of checking control level, and the frequency and
      appropriateness of asthma medication changes (in accordance with control). We will also
      attempt to determine the impact of the system on hospitalisations, emergency room (ER)
      visits, unscheduled visits to the doctor, total visits to the doctor, days off work or
      school, nocturnal asthma symptoms, daytime asthma symptoms, daytime rescue puffer use, and
      quality of life, and to measure physicians' perceptions of and satisfaction with the system.

    <description>The electronic asthma action plan system consists of a tablet device in the physician waiting room which participants use to complete a simple questionnaire, a computerized clinical decision support system which then processes these data to produce a set of asthma care recommendations for the clinician, and finally, a printable asthma action plan that is given to patients, along with the URL for an asthma education website.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible physicians will include all primary care physicians at the 4 sites.

        Eligible patients will include:

          -  patients with asthma, as determined by a validated electronic chart record search
             algorithm for asthma;

          -  patients &gt;/= 16 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received an AAP within the last 6 months (from their primary care
             physician, a respirologist, or any other source).

          -  Pregnant patients will be excluded given that conventional AAP recommendations may not
             be appropriate in this population.
