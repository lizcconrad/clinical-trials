      To evaluate the efficacy of two different concentrations of a tubule occlusion agent -
      calcium sodium phosphosilicate in treatment of dentine hypersensitivity
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dentine hypersensitivity is characterized by short, sharp pain arising from exposed dentine
      typically in response to chemical, thermal, tactile or osmotic stimuli. Dentine
      hypersensitivity may be treated by either making the nerve in the tooth less sensitive or by
      occluding the tubules to limit exposure of the nerve to external stimuli. Bioactive and
      biocompatible glasses react with oral fluid to deposit a mineral that is chemically analogous
      to that found in both enamel and dentine thus preventing exposure of the nerve to external
      stimuli.

      A number of controlled clinical trials have been reported indicating that a calcium sodium
      phosphosilicate bioactive glass, when incorporated into a toothpaste formulation,
      significantly reduce pain from dentine hypersensitivity. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of two currently marketed toothpastes, containing 5% calcium sodium
      phosphosilicate and the other containing 7.5% calcium sodium phosphosilicate in the treatment
      of dentine hypersensitivity compared to a matched placebo control.

    <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to a hypersensitive tooth was evaluated using a 100 millimeter (mm) VAS pain response scale.

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Evaporative Air Sensitivity Pain Response on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Day 15</title>
        <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to a hypersensitive tooth was evaluated using a 100 millimeter (mm) VAS pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for stimulated tooth ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (intense pain). Change from baseline in pain response was calculated using VAS score and a change of greater than 25 mm in VAS indicates potential relevant clinical significance of treatment.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Cold Water Sensitivity Pain Response on a VAS at Day 15</title>
          <description>Response of exposed dentine surface to application of 1 ml freshly melted ice cold water was evaluated using a 100 mm VAS pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for stimulated tooth ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (intense pain). Change from baseline in pain response was calculated using VAS score and a change of greater than 25 mm in VAS indicates potential relevant clinical significance of treatment.</description>

        <description>Response of exposed dentine surface to application of 1 ml freshly melted ice cold water was evaluated using a 100 mm VAS pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for stimulated tooth ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (intense pain). Change from baseline in pain response was calculated using VAS score and a change of greater than 25 mm in VAS indicates potential relevant clinical significance of treatment.</description>
