      Background:

      According to the WHO, major depressive disorder is the second largest healthcare problem
      worldwide in terms of disability caused by illness. It afflicts an estimated 17% of
      individuals during their lifetimes at tremendous costs. A number of depressive patients are
      treated with antidepressant medication. The efficacy of antidepressant medication has been
      studied in a number of systematic reviews, and in recent years some of these reviews have
      shown that the efficacy is questionable for many patients. So are there other effective
      treatments for this serious illness?

      Cognitive- and psychodynamic therapies are probably both significantly more effective for
      depression than no treatment, but only limited comparisons have been made between the two
      interventions. A Cochrane review shows that cognitive therapy has a preventive effect against
      recurrent depression, and that this effect may surpass the preventive effect of
      antidepressant medication. Mindfulness training may be an effective technique in preventing
      relapse in patients who have had at least 3 previous depressive episodes. But efficacy in
      treating currently depressed patients has not been studied.

      Objective To perform a randomised clinical trial with blinded assessment of efficacy
      variables in order to study the effects of mindfulness based behavioral therapy (cognitive
      therapy and mindfulness) versus psychodynamic therapy in depressive patients.

      Methods

      A randomised clinical trial of 84 consecutive patients diagnosed with major depressive
      disorder, referred to the day clinic, Roskilde psychiatric services. The patients will be
      randomised to one of two interventions:

        1. MIBT (mindfulness-based behavioural therapy)

        2. PT (psychodynamic therapy)

    <description>The MIBT treatment consists of weekly individual MIBT therapy (45-50 min.), together with weekly mindfulness-skills training group (1.5 hours).
The treatment is based on the cognitive model of depression, but will, based on concrete problems, draw from alternative cognitive techniques in order to treat personality-related problems and will use elements from mindfulness.</description>

    <description>The PT treatment consists of weekly individual PT therapy (45-50 min.), together with weekly PT group therapy (1.5 hours).
The main elements of PT are the free-flowing, non-therapist guided dialogue, based on classic psychoanalytical free association. Basically, the role of the therapist is to set ground rules and organise the time, place and duration, to maintain a proper tone, and ultimately to ensure that a therapeutic process takes place using relevant interventions.</description>
