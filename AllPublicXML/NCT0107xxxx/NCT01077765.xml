    <textblock>
      Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with facial lipoatrophy, which is
      potentially stigmatizing for HIV-positive patients. Eutrophill is a 2.5% polyacrylamide
      hydrogel obtained by polymerization of acrylamide monomers with an official half-life of 5
      years.

      Preliminary encouraging results with the use of polyacrylamide hydrogel for reconstruction of
      facial lipoatrophy in HIV-infected patients have been previously reported.

      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of
      subcutaneous facial injections of Eutrophill in HIV-infected patients with severe facial
      lipoatrophy as assessed by facial ultrasonography at screening , after 6, 12 and 24 months

      Combined antiretroviral therapy is associated with facial lipoatrophy, which is potentially
      stigmatizing for HIV-infected patients.

      To date, polylactic acid implants (PLA) have been approved for the correction of facial
      lipoatrophy. The mechanism of action is the increase in new collagen synthesis as a reaction
      to the presence of the implant in the dermal area. But PLA may be associated
      with:subcutaneous micronodules and indurations and mid term relapse of lipoatrophy with the
      need to proceed to new PLA injections EUTROPHILL is a 2.5% polyacrylamide hydrogel with a
      claimed half-life of 5 years.The gel is relatively viscous and is injected subcutaneously.
      Following injection, the gel encapsulates. The mechanism of action is the increase in the
      volume of subcutaneous area by the inert implant

      The aim of this multicentric, open-label, single-arm, pilot study was to evaluate the
      long-term efficacy and safety of intra-dermal facial injections of polyacrylamide hydrogel
      (EUTROPHILL) in HIV-infected patients with severe facial lipoatrophy. Patients received
      between 2 and 6 injections every 4 weeks, according to the aesthetic results.

      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of subcutaneous
      facial injections of EUTROPHILL in HIV-infected patients with severe facial lipoatrophy as
      assessed by facial ultrasonography at screening , after 6, 12 and 24 months

      The secondary objectives of the study were:

      to evaluate the clinical efficacy by facial photography at screening, after 6, 12 and 24
      months; to evaluate Overall Treatment Satisfaction according to patients , close relatives
      and physicians ; to evaluate changes in quality of life (ABCD questionnaire) ABCD
      questionnaire is a specific questionnaire validated for HIV-infected patients suffering from
      lipodystrophy; to evaluate changes in patient's anxiety and depression (HADS questionnaire);
      to evaluate the safety of the infiltration techniques;
