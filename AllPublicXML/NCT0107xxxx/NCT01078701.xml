  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase IIa trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity of a single dose of
      GHB11L1 administered by liquid nasal spray for vaccination against influenza A (H1N1) virus.

      This study is also performed to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (shedding)
      of a single dose of GHB11L1 administered by liquid nasal spray.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GHB11L1 intends to provide a novel vaccination for influenza virus infection. 48 healthy
      volunteers will be included in this phase IIa study investigating three dose levels. 16
      subjects will be randomised at a ratio of 3:1 for GHB11L1 or placebo.

      Healthy male volunteers, 18-50 years of age and seronegative with respect to the applied
      virus antigens (antibody titers &lt;1:10 detected) will be randomised.

      GHB11L1 will be administered once on day 1. Follow-up visits will be performed on days 2, 8
      and 29.
