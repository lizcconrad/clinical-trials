      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors
      predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in blood samples from patients with
      invasive cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To develop a serum proteomic profile for cervical cancer using banked pre-treatment
           serum specimens from patients with invasive cervical cancer and to determine if this
           serum proteomic profile has possible utility in cervical cancer prognosis.

      Secondary

        -  To develop a serum proteomic profile for cervical cancer using banked post-treatment
           serum specimens from these patients and to determine if this serum proteomic profile has
           possible utility in cervical cancer prognosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Banked serum specimens are used to generate proteomic profiles.
