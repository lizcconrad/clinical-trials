    <textblock>
      Cardiac transplantation is the ultimate treatment option for patients with end stage heart
      failure.

      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after
      transplantation.

      Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are used in less than one half of transplant
      recipients. Preliminary data suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors retard the
      atherosclerotic plaque development that is the hallmark of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
      Moreover, this class of drug appears to increase circulating endothelial progenitor cell
      number and has anti-inflammatory properties, both of which improve endothelial dysfunction,
      the key precursor to the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

      The objective of this project is to investigate the role of an angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor, ramipril, in preventing the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. During
      the first month after cardiac transplantation subjects will undergo coronary angiography with
      intravascular ultrasound measurements of plaque volume in the left anterior descending
      coronary artery. Using a coronary pressure wire, epicardial artery and microvascular
      physiology will be assessed. Finally, endothelial function and mediators of endothelial
      function, including circulating endothelial progenitor cells, will be measured. Subjects will
      then be randomized in a double blind fashion to either ramipril or placebo. After 1 year, the
      above assessment will be repeated. The primary endpoint will be the development of cardiac
      allograft vasculopathy based on intravascular ultrasound-derived parameters. The second aim
      will be to assess the effect of ramipril on endothelial dysfunction early after
      transplantation. The final aim is to determine the impact of ramipril on coronary physiology
      early after transplantation.

      During the first 4 years of this study, we plan to recruit patients within the first month
      after OHT. As has become routine at Stanford, study subjects will undergo baseline coronary
      angiography and IVUS assessment of their left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary
      endothelial function will be assessed as well transmyocardial levels of ADMA and other
      mediators of endothelial function. Blood samples will be obtained for analyzing circulating
      EPC number and function. Epicardial and microvascular coronary physiology in the left
      anterior descending coronary artery will be determined by measuring FFR and IMR with a
      coronary pressure wire(in the adults only). Subjects will then be randomized to either the
      ACE I(Ramipril), or to placebo, in addition to their usual medications. During years 2
      through 5 of this project, study subjects will undergo the above routine invasive assessments
      at 1 year after OHT. During the 5th year of this project, data analysis and manuscript
      preparation will occur.

      of baseline)Weeks Baseline blood sampling for circulating EPC studies 4-6 Weeks Randomization

      blood sampling for circulating EPC studies The primary endpoint of the study will be change
      in plaque volume as determined by IVUS analysis at baseline and 1 year later, between those
      treated with ramipril compared to those treated with placebo.

      Secondary endpoints will include change in circulating EPC number and function, change in
      ADMA levels,change in coronary endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and change in coronary
      physiology (FFR and IMR)from baseline to 1 year. Although there are multiple potential
      mechanisms by which ACE I might reduce CAV, evaluating each of these is beyond the scope of
      this project. For this reason, we will focus on the likely common final pathway of
      endothelial dysfunction mediated by dysregulation of ADMA and NOS, as well as changes in
      EPCs. If this study shows a benefit to ACE I therapy in this population, the goal of future
      studies will be to determine the exact mechanism by which this occurs and to perform a large,
      multicenter study comparing ACE I to placebo with hard clinical endpoints. Study visits
      include two major time points 1) baseline angiogram and IVUS which include recording of
      angiographic data, lab data, clinical data. 2)assessment at the usual follow up periods post
      transplant, and these data points will also be collected for research purposes. after base
      line which usually occurs one month post transplant plus or minus 2 weeks. F/u = q 2 weeks
      until two months out from tx, then once per month until six months out from TX, then every
      two months until the patient is 12 months out from TX. Each routine f/u visit includes a
      physical exam,vital signs, echocardiogram, chest x-ray, a complete metabolic panel ( contains
      a Creatinine), Complete blood count, immunosuppressant drug blood levels, and a heart biopsy
      (at the same intervals described above).
