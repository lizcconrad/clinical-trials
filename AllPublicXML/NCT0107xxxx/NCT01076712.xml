  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease is an incurable and progressive disease. Treatment includes medication
      and non-pharmacological intervention such as physiotherapy. Physiotherapy is a main component
      of non-pharmacological interventions. It includes exercise to strengthen the muscles;
      improves balance and walking, and adopts the use of visual cue training. Treatment has been
      found to be effective in patients with mild impairment up to 6 months post-treatment. The
      present study will investigate the effectiveness of treatment for patients with mild to
      moderate impairment for short term (3-month) and long term (1 year). The hypothesis is that
      compared to patient education alone, physiotherapy intervention for patients with Parkinson's
      disease leads to improve function and quality of life.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable and progressive disease (Rubenis 2007). Current
      management include medical, neuro-surgical and non-pharmacological intervention.
      Physiotherapy is a major component in non-pharmacological interventions. Effective
      interventions including visual or auditory cues improves gait (Nieuwboer et al. 2007),
      exercise is effective in improving balance (Hirsch et al 2003); intense treadmill training
      improves motor control, quality of life and walking speed so as to sustain improvement in
      gait speed and motor control post 4 weeks of treatment (Herman et al 2007). Patient with PD
      attending physiotherapy twice weekly, one and half hour for 12 weeks showed improvement in
      walking speed and Activities of Daily Living (Ellis et al 2005). However, the majority of
      focus on patients in the Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2 to 3 and long term effect is lacking
      (Kwakkel et al 2007). A knowledge gap is present in the effectiveness of physiotherapy
      training of patients with Parkinson's disease in the more advanced stage of disease and long
      term effect is lacking. The aim of the study is to investigate the immediate, short-term &amp;
      long-term clinical effects of physiotherapy training of patients with Parkinson's disease.
      The hypothesis is that compared to patient education alone, physiotherapy intervention for
      patients with Parkinson's disease leads to improve function and quality of life.
