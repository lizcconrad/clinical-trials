    <textblock>
      The implications of sleep as it relates to the physiology and pathogenesis of a number of
      diseases has until recently been ignored. With the evolution of sleep laboratories, there is
      an emerging recognition of the relationship between sleep and various gastrointestinal
      diseases- in particular gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).( 1-5) It seems intuitive that
      waking/daytime activities or events may affect sleep and that any consequent sleep
      dysfunction may reciprocally further affect daytime function

      The implications of sleep as it relates to the physiology and pathogenesis of a number of
      diseases has until recently been ignored. With the evolution of sleep laboratories, there is
      an emerging recognition of the relationship between sleep and various gastrointestinal
      diseases in particular gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Twenty five (25) patients
      meeting entry criteria will be compared with 25 matching historical control patients who do
      not have GERD symptoms or sleep disturbance. Patients will record heartburn symptoms and
      GERD-associated sleep disturbances on a diary card. These patients will be evaluated for
      baseline functionality GERD symptom scores, PSQI, driving simulator, bed partner
      questionnaire (optional) and receive 40 mg daily of Nexium® for 4 weeks. Primary outcome
      variable driving simulator performance will be the relief of nighttime heartburn during the
      last 7 days of the trial as recorded by the patient on a diary card. Secondary outcome
      variables include change from baseline to week 4 in the PSQI score, percentage of patients
      with complete resolution of sleep disturbances, relief of sleep disturbances, and percentage
      of days without GERD-associated sleep disturbances. Assessment of patients with complete
      resolution of daytime, night times, and 24-hour heartburn symptoms, and the percentage of
      patients with relief of daytime and 24-hour heartburn symptoms. The driving simulator
      performance will be compared at baseline and after 4 weeks of therapy with Nexium®. Also,
      where available, the bed partner PSQI will be compared at baseline and following treatment of
      the primary patient with Nexium® for 4 weeks.
