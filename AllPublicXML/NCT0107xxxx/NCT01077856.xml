  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of GARDASIL™ human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in the
      general female population by utilizing nationwide registry databases in the participating
      Nordic countries.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Time perspective: The study will be conducted using data collected both
      retrospectively/concurrently from registries and prospectively by questionnaire survey.

      Baseline survey data were collected during a prior study from 2004-2005.

      Safety Monitoring: An expert panel on teratology consisting of one teratologist from each of
      the participating countries will review all available medical records related to any
      congenital anomalies to search for any emerging patterns that may be indicative of an
      association between GARDASIL™ exposure in the mother and the subsequent congenital anomalies
      in the babies.

        <title>Incidence of Histologically-confirmed Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) for Participants of All Ages in Denmark</title>
        <description>All Nordic countries participating in this study have national cervical cancer screening programs and registry systems that routinely collect information on cervical cytology, histology, and/or definitive therapy results. The collection of such data in these registries is mandated by law and compliance is generally very high. The number of new cases of high-grade (2/3) CIN registered during the assessment periods in Denmark was recorded. Incidence rates are for all age groups and were age-adjusted using the European Standard Population. The incidence before Gardasil licensure is an average over the 3-year period.</description>
        <time_frame>Three years before Gardasil licensure (2004 to 2006 combined) and annually after Gardasil licensure (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population was the entire population of qualifying women in Denmark and thus changed throughout the analysis. The number of participants analyzed given below is an estimate calculated from the number of reported cases and the incidence data.</population>

          <description>All Nordic countries participating in this study have national cervical cancer screening programs and registry systems that routinely collect information on cervical cytology, histology, and/or definitive therapy results. The collection of such data in these registries is mandated by law and compliance is generally very high. The number of new cases of high-grade (2/3) CIN registered during the assessment periods in Denmark was recorded. Incidence rates are for women &lt;=26 years of age and were age-adjusted using the European Standard Population. The incidence before Gardasil licensure is an average over the 3-year period.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11/16/18-related Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia for Participants of All Ages</title>
        <description>All Nordic countries participating in this study have national cervical cancer screening programs and registry systems that routinely collect information on cervical cytology, histology, and/or definitive therapy results. In addition, lesional tissue samples were routinely collected and stored; the 2004 to 2006 period was chosen because it was sufficiently recent to reflect HPV type status immediately before licensure of Gardasil. The number of new cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related high-grade (2/3) CIN was estimated based on the proportion of HPV 6/11/16/18 in all CIN in a representative sample. Incidence was age-adjusted according to Nordic Standard Population.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Associated With High-risk HPV Types Other Than 16/18 in Participants &lt;=26 Years of Age</title>
        <description>All Nordic countries participating in this study have national cervical cancer screening programs and registry systems that routinely collect information on cervical cytology, histology, and/or definitive therapy results. In addition, lesional tissue samples were routinely collected and stored; the 2004 to 2006 period was chosen because it was sufficiently recent to reflect HPV type status immediately before licensure of Gardasil. The percentage of new cases of high-grade (2/3) CIN related to high-risk HPV types other than 16 and 18 was analyzed. High-risk HPV types include 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68. Incidence was age-adjusted according to Nordic Standard Population.</description>

          <title>Prevalence of HPV Infection for High-risk Types Other Than 16/18 for Participants &gt;26 Years of Age</title>
          <description>All Nordic countries participating in this study have national cervical cancer screening programs and registry systems that routinely collect information on cervical cytology, histology, and/or definitive therapy results. In addition, lesional tissue samples were routinely collected and stored; the 2004 to 2006 period was chosen because it was sufficiently recent to reflect HPV type status immediately before licensure of Gardasil. The percentage of liquid-based cervical cytology samples positive for high-risk HPV Types other than 16 or 18, and not co-infected with Types 16 or 18, was analyzed.</description>

        <title>Prevalence of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 Infection by Gardasil Vaccination Status</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with liquid-based cervical cytology samples positive for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 was to be analyzed by Gardasil vaccination status.</description>
        <time_frame>Four years to 5 years after Gardasil licensure (2011 to 2012)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population was to be women who underwent cervical screening. A joint decision was made by the study team to forgo the stratified analysis by vaccination status because there were few women who had both been vaccinated with Gardasil and undergone cervical cancer screening. Thus, the number of participants analyzed is zero.</population>
