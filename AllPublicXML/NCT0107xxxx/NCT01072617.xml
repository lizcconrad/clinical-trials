  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this protocol is to determine whether the use of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over vermis of the cerebellum may be safe and therapeutically
      effective in patients with schizophrenia. Because this is the first evaluation of this
      treatment in this population, the focus of this study is safety.

    <description>Potential therapeutic efficacy was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Positive Subscale, a 7 item subscale measuring the presence/absence and severity of positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

Therapeutic efficacy was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, and 1 week post treatment. The overall PANSS total score (minimum = 30, maximum = 210) is computed by summing the positive, negative, and general subscales; and higher values represent more severe schizophrenia psychopathology.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 10 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions to the vermis of cerebellum using the MagPro x100 TMS device. These 10 rTMS sessions will be administered from Monday to Friday in five days, twice a day with a minimum of 4-hour gap between the sessions. Repetitive TMS will be applied with the intermittent theta burst pattern (iTBS). These parameters are known to cause excitation in brain activity.
Anatomically precise localization of rTMS will be achieved using a frameless stereotactic system.</description>

        <title>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Negative Subscale</title>
        <description>Potential therapeutic efficacy was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Negative Subscale, a 7 item subscale measuring the presence/absence and severity of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The minimum score is 7 and the maximum score is 49, with higher values representing greater symptom severity. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed at baseline, after 5 days of treatment, and 1 week post treatment. The overall PANSS total score (minimum = 30, maximum = 210) is computed by summing the positive, negative, and general subscales; and higher values represent more severe schizophrenia psychopathology.</description>

            <description>Participants will receive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation via MagPro x100 device to the vermis of cerebellum twice a day over 5 days Transcranial magnetic stimulation via MagPro x100 device: Participants will receive 10 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions to the vermis of cerebellum using the MagPro x100 TMS device. These 10 rTMS sessions will be administered from Monday to Friday in five days, twice a day with a minimum of 4-hour gap between the sessions. Repetitive TMS will be applied with the intermittent theta burst pattern (iTBS). These parameters are known to cause excitation in brain activity.
Anatomically precise localization of rTMS will be achieved using a frameless stereotactic system.</description>
