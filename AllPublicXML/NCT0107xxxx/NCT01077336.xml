  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Susceptibility testing is commonly employed in patients with bacterial infections in order to
      guide rational use of antibiotics; however, the use of antifungal susceptibility testing is
      limited due to lack of availability, costs, and delays in receiving results. The goals of
      antifungal susceptibility testing should mirror those of antibacterial susceptibility
      testing: to predict clinical response or failure. Additionally, susceptibility reports should
      be used as a guide for physicians when transitioning patients from parenteral to oral
      antifungal agents. Currently, it is unknown whether antifungal susceptibility testing impacts
      treatment decisions in hospitals that routinely perform Candida susceptibility testing. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in antifungal treatment based on in vitro
      susceptibility reports and how these decisions affect mortality, recurrence of infection, and
      length of hospital stay in candidemia patients.
