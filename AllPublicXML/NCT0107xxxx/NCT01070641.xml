      Aim To compare Carvedilol with variceal band ligation in the prevention of first variceal
      bleed.

      End points of trial Primary: Variceal hemorrhage Secondary: Death

      Study design

      Randomised controlled clinical trial. Results analysed for the above end points on an
      intention-to-treat basis.

    <textblock>
      Patients from the Gastroenterology section of the Aga Khan University, Karachi, with liver
      cirrhosis and on endoscopy having grade II, or larger oesophageal varices and who have not
      bled previously from varices.

      Method All suitable patients will be recruited after informed consent is given. Randomisation
      of treatment is by sealed envelopes prepared in batches of 20.

      Carvedilol This will be administered as a once daily dose of 12.5mg.

      Variceal band ligation Endoscopy will be performed ever two weeks until eradication of
      oesophageal varices. Eradication is achieved when no varices or only grade I varices (varices
      which are small and flatten on air insufflations in the oesophagus) are present. Subsequent
      endoscopy sessions will be progressively less frequent, at intervals of 3 months, 6 months
      and 12 months thereafter. Should varices recur, the protocol for eradication as described
      above will be re-instituted.

      Follow-up This will take place in a dedicated clinic. First visit is six weeks after
      initiation of treatment and three monthly thereafter. Clinical and laboratory parameters will
      be obtained at each visit. All patients with alcoholic liver disease will be asked to provide
      an up-to-date status on drinking. Treatment will cease upon reaching any of these end-points:
      variceal haemorrhage, death or liver transplantation. Duration of follow-up is defined as
      time from randomisation to the above end points or to the last follow-up date available.
