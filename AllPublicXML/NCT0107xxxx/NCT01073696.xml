  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic profile of the granisetron patch in healthy subjects when heat is applied</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 196 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effect of locally applied heat on the pharmacokinetic profile of granisetron delivered from the patch. Subjects will be randomized to receive Treatment A Sancuso patch ONLY and Treatment B, Sancuso PLUS Cura-Heat pad. Sancuso will be worn by the subjects for 5 days continuously. The Cura-Heat pad will be applied over the patch for 4.5 hours on each of the 5 days. During these 5 days PK sampling is planned to measure the initial release of granisetron from the patch and cover the predicted maximum observed concentrations with or without the Cura-Heat pad in place.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 23 days post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be assessed by collection of adverse events, safety laboratory assessments, record of vital signs, conduct of physical examination and 12 lead ECG. In addition skin reaction at the patch and Cura-Heat pad application sites will be monitored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>residual granisetron after patch use in healthy subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>120 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>• Residual granisetron after patch use and the calculation of in-vitro flux will be measured. All used patches will be returned to the manufacturer who will measure the amount of remaining granisetron in the patch and then the in-vitro flux will be calculated as follows: Amount delivered(assay amount-residual)/ number of days the patch was applied to the skin</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 45 years at screening. Subjects must
             demonstrate understanding of the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow
             the restrictions and schedule of study procedures, as evidenced by voluntary written
             informed consent (signed and dated) obtained before taking part in any trial-related
             activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any current or previous disease, disorder, allergy or condition (including recent
             unexplained weight loss) that could affect the study conduct or laboratory
             assessments, or that presents undue risk from the study medication or procedures.
             Hypersensitivity to adhesive plasters or surgical tape.

          -  Any physical examination or screening investigation result that indicates the subject
             is unfit for the study.

          -  Scarring on upper arms, including extensive tattoos making skin reactions unevaluable.

          -  A positive virology test, urine test for drugs of abuse, or pregnancy test result
             (females of childbearing potential only).

          -  Recent use of prescribed or over-the-counter medication that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator or the Sponsor, will interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             safety.

          -  Received an investigational drug within 3 months (90 days) preceding patch
             application.

          -  Loss of ≥ 400 mL of blood (e.g. been a blood donor) within the past 3 months.

          -  Average weekly alcohol consumption of greater than 21 units (males) or 14 units
             (females), or habitually smokes ≥ 5 cigarettes or equivalent tobacco per day within
             the 6 months before patch application. Subjects may not smoke while confined to the
             study site. Subjects must not consume alcohol, or xanthine-containing foods or drinks
             within 48 hours prior to dosing until discharge.

          -  Lactating female subjects, and female subjects of childbearing potential who are not
             willing to use an acceptable form of contraception from the screening visit, during
             the study and for 90 days after the study.

          -  Employee of the Investigator or study centre, with direct involvement in the proposed
             study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or study centre, as
             well as family members of the employees or the Investigator.
