  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the present study is that the prophylaxis with palivizumab to prevent the
      severe RS virus infection during the infancy among preterm infants may reduce the risk of
      subsequent recurrent wheezing in childhood.

      The infants born between July 1st and December 31st in 2007 with the gestational age between
      33 and 35 weeks were enrolled into the study at the end of RS virus infection season, April
      2008. The infants were unintentionally divided into two groups, either palivizumab treated or
      untreated group at the enrollment, because the timing for palivizumab prophylaxis were
      already ended.

      The study infants will be followed up until the age of 3 with recording the incidence of
      either parent reported or physician diagnosed recurrent wheezing.

      The difference of the incidence of the recurrent wheezing between the groups will be analyzed
      with Kaplan-Meier method.
