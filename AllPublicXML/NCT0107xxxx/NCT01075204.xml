  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to describe the time to recovery of symptoms (cough, mucus, fever, sore
      throat, and others), tolerability and compliance of treatment with clarithromycin once daily
      in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections in the routine clinical
      practice.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Fast Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Fast recovery is defined as the resolution of symptoms within 5 days or less from the start of clarithromycin modified release treatment. Recovery is defined as returning to the symptom status prior to the onset of the respiratory tract infection, based on the participant and physician's assessment.
Data are reported for all symptoms taken together (all symptoms resolved within 5 days) and for each individual symptom.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Success</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success is defined as the disappearance of cough and other symptoms within 10 days or less from the start of clarithromycin treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Classification of Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the participant and physician's assessment, overall symptom response was classified as follows:
Fast Responders: participants showing clinical recovery of all symptoms within the first 5 days of treatment.
Slow Responders: participants showing clinical recovery between Day 6 &amp; Day 10 (includes participants with a fast response for some symptoms and slow response for the remaining symptoms).
Failure response: participants showing no clinical success by Day 10, or showing need for another anti-infective treatment to resolve aggravated symptoms (includes participants with a failure response for some symptoms and either a slow or fast response for the remaining symptoms).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure is defined as failure to return to baseline symptom status (symptom status prior to the onset of the respiratory tract infection) within 10 days or the need for new treatments or medications during the first 10 days for persistence or aggravation of symptoms.
Participants with treatment failure were further categorized as:
All symptoms improved but not resolved within the study period;
Some symptoms improved and some resolved;
Some symptoms resolved or improved while other symptoms did not improve (unchanged);
Some symptoms resolved or improved while other symptoms became worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Factors Affecting the Speed of Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Factors affecting the speed of recovery were examined and tested for association with the speed of recovery. Logistic regression was conducted to assess whether the following nine variables; age, gender, body mass index (BMI), concomitant tobacco use, steroid use, bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal septum deviation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) act as predictors for speed of recovery of respiratory tract infections. Data shown are the beta regression coefficients for each variable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with their treatment.
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE):
Results in death or is life-threatening, results in admission or prolongation of hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.
Please see Adverse Events section below for more details.</description>

        Assignment to clarithromycin therapy falls within current clinical practice and was not
        decided in advance by this protocol. Study participants were selected from patients seen at
        the primary care clinic, with a preliminary clinical diagnosis of an upper or lower
        respiratory tract infection who were considered for antibiotic treatment and prescribed
        clarithromycin.
