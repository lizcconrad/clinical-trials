  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignant tumor of infancy. Approximately 60% of NB
      patients are clinically diagnosed as the stage IV disease and have a very poor prognosis with
      the 5-year survival rate no more than 30%. Molecular markers of NB have great impacts on the
      tumor behavior. MYCN amplification is the most well-known marker to predict a poor outcome in
      NB patients. However, how MYCN affects the NB cell behavior remains unknown. In our
      preliminary studies, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the differential gene expression
      in 10 NB tumors with MYCN amplification and 10 with normal MYCN copy number. We found that
      aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) reversely correlated with the MYCN expression. This
      relationship was verified in 83 NB tumor samples. In addition, positive AHR expression by
      immunostaining of NB tumors predicted a favorable prognosis. These lines of evidence
      demonstrate that AHR not only relates to the MYCN expression but also plays an important role
      in the tumorigenesis of NB. Therefore in this project we aim at further studying the
      relationship between AHR and MYCN. In addition, the possible role of AHR in the tumorigenesis
      of NB will be clarified. Specifically, we propose a 3-year project with the following three
      aims:

      Aim I. Determine the molecular relationship between AHR and MYCN expression. AHR has been
      shown to suppress the E2F1 expression. E2F1 reversely has been found to upregulate the
      expression of MYCN. In our preliminary microarray study, we also found that the expression
      E2F1 positively correlated with the MYCN expression but inversely correlated with the
      expression of AHR. Therefore, NB cells will be transfected with AHR expression vector or AHR
      siRNA, then the associated E2F1 and MYCN expression will be examined to clarify if AHR could
      regulate MYCN expression via E2F1. Furthermore, the E2F1 levels will also be manipulated to
      determine if the effect of AHR on MYCN depends on E2F1. In addition, the E2F1 expression in
      NB tumor samples will also be examined to clarify its in vivo role.

      Aim II. Determine the effect of AHR expression on the NB cell behavior. The baseline AHR
      expression levels in several NB cell lines will be examined. AHR is then overexpressed by
      gene transfection in NB cells. The cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation after
      AHR overexpression are evaluated. Furthermore the AHR expression in normal neuron cells is
      also examined, and suppressed by siRNA to if downregulation of AHR could lead to cancer
      development.

      Aim III. Determine if AHR could be a target of gene therapy for NB. NB cells with either
      normal MYCN or MYCN amplification before and after AHR gene transfection are inoculated into
      nude mice to demonstrate the effect of AHR expression on NB cells behavior in vivo. AHR is
      then transfected into the wild type NB tumor to see if the tumor growth could be suppressed
      by AHR expression. Then wild type tumor and tumors transfected with AHR are subjected
      microarray analysis to compare with the human tumor data set for evaluation of gene
      expression changes along with differential AHR expression. Altogether, our studies will not
      only establish the relationship between AHR and MYCN, but also allow us to depict the
      functional role of AHR-MYCN interaction in the tumorigenesis of NB.
