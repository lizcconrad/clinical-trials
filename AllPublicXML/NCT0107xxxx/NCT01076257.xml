  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research centers on the comparison of the immediate efficacy (right after therapy) and
      the maintained efficacy (3 months and 6 months) between &quot;Modified Constraint-Induced Movement
      Therapy&quot; (mCIMT) group and control group at different age.

    <textblock>
      &quot;Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy&quot; is one of the most recent treatments for
      children with Brain damage.

      This well-designed and follow-up RCT study compared home-based CIT with a control
      intervention (traditional rehabilitation, TR) by combining kinematic analysis and clinical
      evaluation, which is possible to examine whether functional improvement is accompanied by a
      change in motor control. We hypothesized that home-based CIT would induce better motor
      control strategies (shorter RT, MT, lesser MUs, MGA, and PMGA, and larger peak velocity (PV))
      for greater functional gains than TR. Furthermore, the beneficial effects would be maintained
      at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Findings of this study allow clinicians to understand the
      underlying motor control changes for functional improvement after home-based CIT.

    <description>All children underwent a series of upper limb assessments, including kinematic analysis and functional measures (primary and secondary outcomes), before the start of the intervention (pretreatment). An occupational therapist blinded to group assignment was trained to administer these measures.
