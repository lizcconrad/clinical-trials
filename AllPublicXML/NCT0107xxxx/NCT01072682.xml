  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the safety of a selective cytopheretic device
      (SCD) in patients that are on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute renal
      failure (ARF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure is a condition where the kidneys are not capable of producing adequate
      urine. Therefore, another way to remove waste from the body is needed to hopefully allow time
      for the kidneys to heal. One method of removing waste from the body is called Continuous
      Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) or variations of that therapy. This study will evaluate the
      safety of the device while it is connected to the CRRT tubing for up to 7 days. Patients will
      be followed up until day 60 following the treatment.

    <description>The selective cytopheretic device (SCD) is comprised of tubing, connectors and a hemofilter cartridge. The device is connected in series to a commercially available Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) device. Blood from the CRRT circuit is diverted after the CRRT hemofilter through to the extra capillary space (ECS) of the SCD. Blood circulates through this space and is returned to the patient via the venous return line of the CRRT circuit. Regional citrate anticoagulation is used for the entire CRRT and SCD blood circuits.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A patient, or legal representative, has signed a written informed consent form.

          2. Must be receiving medical care in an intensive care unit (e.g., ICU, MICU, SICU,
             CTICU, Trauma, Mixed, other).

          3. Age 18 to 80 years.

          4. Females of child bearing potential who are not pregnant (confirmed by a negative serum
             pregnancy test) and not lactating if recently post-partum.

          5. Must be receiving and tolerating CRRT therapy for a minimum of 4 hours, but not longer
             than 24 hours.

          6. Expected to remain in the ICU for at least 96 hours after evaluation for enrollment.

          7. A clinical diagnosis of ATN due to hemodynamic or toxic etiologies. ATN is defined as
             acute renal failure occurring in a setting of acute ischemic or nephrotoxic injury
             with oliguria (average &lt;20 mL/hr) for &gt;6-12 hours or: an increase in serum creatinine
             ≥2 mg/dL (≥1.5 mg/dL in females) over a period of ≤4 days. (Note: Prerenal,
             hepatorenal, vascular, interstitial, glomerular, and obstructive etiologies are
             excluded on clinical or other diagnostic grounds.)

          8. At least one non-renal organ failure (modified SOFA organ system score &gt;2), as defined
             in Appendix A or presence (proven or suspected) of sepsis as defined in Appendix B.

          9. All patients must be able to tolerate regional citrate anticoagulation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications to regional citrate anticoagulation.

          2. Irreversible brain damage based on available historical and clinical information.

             Preexisting chronic renal failure is defined as baseline serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL
             (men), or &gt;2.0 mg/dL (women).

          7. ARF occurring in the setting of burns, obstructive uropathy, allergic interstitial
             nephritis, acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, vasculitis,
             hemolytic-uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), malignant

          9. Chronic immunosuppression (e.g., AIDS, chronic glucocorticoid therapy &gt;20 mg/day
             prednisone equivalent on a chronic basis, or chemotherapy). The acute use of
             glucocorticoids is permissible

         10. Severe liver failure as documented by a Child-Pugh Liver Failure Score &gt;12.
