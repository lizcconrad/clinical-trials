      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood
      flow to the cancer. Giving everolimus together with lenalidomide may be an effective
      treatment for lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving
      everolimus and lenalidomide together and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose of RAD001 and lenalidomide in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Hodgkin Lymphoma. (Phase I) II. To assess tumor
      response to RAD001 and lenalidomide in subjects with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
      or Hodgkin Lymphoma. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, and time to
      treatment failure of subjects receiving RAD001 and lenalidomide.

      II. To describe the adverse event profile (using CTCAE CTEP Active Version) of RAD001 and
      lenalidomide.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily and oral lenalidomide once daily on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
