  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysm (localized dilatation in weakened blood vessel wall) rupture is a
      catastrophic disease, with half of the victims died and many of the survivors disabled. There
      is currently no data in the literature for the Chinese population concerning the prevalence,
      characteristics (location and size) and risk of harboring an unruptured intracranial
      aneurysm. In this study, the investigators aim to study the population prevalence and
      characteristics (location and size) of intracranial aneurysm in Hong Kong Chinese, and its
      cost-effectiveness. The screening is carried out using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA),
      with a 3-T magnetic resonance system, which is a well-established non-invasive method for
      intracranial aneurysm detection.
