  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For some years, the investigators observe an increase of the arisen of diabetes in cystic
      fibrosis patients However, this diabetes may be reversible. The investigators speak about &quot;
      Cystic fibrosis related diabetes.&quot;. The objective of this project, is to know better what
      facilitates the appearance and the reversibility of the diabetes, such as the genetic
      mutations, the respiratory state and the lung infections. Theses knowledges should allow to
      adapt the screening of diabetes, and its treatment, for the patients affected by cystic
      fibrosis.
