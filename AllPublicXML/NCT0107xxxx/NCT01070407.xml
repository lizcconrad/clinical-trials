  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HCV001 is a Phase I study to ascertain the safety and immunogenicity of a novel vaccine
      against Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The vaccine is based on the sequential delivery, by
      intramuscular route, of two different adenoviral vectors, of human and chimpanzee origin
      respectively, bearing the same genetic information for HCV antigens (NS region).

      The two recombinant vectors, called Ad6NSmut and AdCh3NSmut, are weakened and unable to
      multiply within the body; they are designed to induce an immune response against HCV
      proteins. Although Ad6NSmut and AdCh3NSmut have never been given to humans before this trial,
      promising results have been obtained in non-human studies.

      The HCV001 study is designed to explore different prime-boost regimes concerning dose, order
      and interval of administration of Ad6NSmut and AdCh3NSmut.
