          -  Confirmed malignant solid tumours for which no standard treatment exists

          -  At least one lesion (measurable and/or non measurable) at baseline that can be
             accurately assessed by CT/MRI and is suitable for repeated assessment at follow up
             visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous treatment with a PARP inhibitor, including olaparib

          -  Patients receiving any systematic chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except for palliative
             reasons) within 2 weeks from the last dose prior to study treatment (or a longer
