  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we are looking to see how effective BIBW 2992 is at suppressing the
      development of the T790M mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Epidermal
      growth factor receptors (EGFR) are proteins found on the surface of some cancer cells that
      promote a growth signal. Some cancer drugs for NSCLC work to block this signal from reaching
      its target on the cancer cells which in turn may slow or stop the cancer from growing.
      However, many times patients with EGFR mutations will stop responding to these cancer drugs
      and develop drug-resistance because they have developed a specific EGFR mutation called
      T790M. BIBW 2992 may prevent the T790M mutation from becoming active and therefore slow
      disease progression.

      -  Participants will take tablets of BIBW 2992 once a day during each cycle. Each cycle is
           28 days (4 weeks).

        -  Participants will come to the clinic on Day 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1. For Cycle 2 through
           8, they will need to come to the clinic on Day 1. After Cycle 8, they will have study
           visits every 2 months.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at these clinic visits: physical
           examination, routine blood tests, research blood samples, EKG (every fourth cycle
           starting cycle 5), ECHO or MUGA (every fourth cycle starting cycle 5), an assessment of
           the tumor by CT or MRI scan (every 8 weeks).

        -  Participants may continue to participate in this research study as long as their tumor
           does not grow and their disease does not worsen and they do not have any severe side
           effects.

        -  Participants will have a tumor biopsy performed at the end of their participation in
           this study if their tumor is growing or if they have a new tumor. The purpose of this
           biopsy is to assess for the presence or the absence of the mutation T790M.

    <description>The progression-free and overall survival times. Overall survival is measured from the start of treatment until the time of death or until the participant is lost to follow-up. Progression free survival is measured from the start of treatment until the time of progression, death, or until the participant is lost to follow-up (whichever occurs first). Progression is defined as having at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least a 5 mm absolute increase in the sum of all lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions denotes disease progression.</description>

        <description>The progression-free and overall survival times. Overall survival is measured from the start of treatment until the time of death or until the participant is lost to follow-up. Progression free survival is measured from the start of treatment until the time of progression, death, or until the participant is lost to follow-up (whichever occurs first). Progression is defined as having at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least a 5 mm absolute increase in the sum of all lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions denotes disease progression.</description>
