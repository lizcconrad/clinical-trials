      This is a prospective, open-labeled, multi-centric trial to evaluate the effect of bisoprolol
      (between low dose and high dose) on surrogate markers of heart failure in Korea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) will be enrolled in this study after
      proper evaluation of NT-proBNP, global assessment of CHF, 6-minute walking test and
      improvement score of New York Heart Association (NYHA) and echocardiogram (left ventricular
      chamber size and ejection fraction [LVEF]). Each subject will be orally administered
      bisoprolol for 6 months starting at 1.25 mg at the Week 0 and titrated up to 10 mg during the
      6 month period if the persistent standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) is greater than (&gt;)
      90 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) and there is no symptom of hypotension at the current dose
      medication (syncope, loss of consciousness, dizziness when standing up).

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

      â€¢ To evaluate the effect of bisoprolol (between low dose and high dose) on surrogate markers
      of heart failure in Korea

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate bisoprolol for the effects on clinical improvement of heart failure in
           Korea:

             1. New York Heart Association (NYHA),

             2. 6-minutes walking test

             3. Echocardiogram (left ventricular chamber size and LVEF)

        -  Hospitalization due to heart failure

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of bisoprolol

        -  Global assessment of CHF

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in N-terminal Pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a substance secreted from the ventricles or lower chambers of the heart in response to changes in pressure that occur when heart failure develops and worsens. The level of BNP in the blood increases when heart failure symptoms worsen, and decreases when the heart failure condition is stable. The BNP level in a person with heart failure is higher than in a person with normal heart function. The percent change of NT-pro BNP was calculated according to the formula: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reduction ratio = 100*(Baseline NT-proBNP - Week 26 NT-proBNP)/Baseline NT-proBNP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Classified as Class I to IV According to New York Heart Association (NYHA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart failure: Class I: No limitation: ordinary physical exercise does not cause undue fatigue, dyspnea, or palpitations. Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity: comfortable at rest but ordinary activity results in fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea. Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity: comfortable at rest but less than ordinary activity results in symptoms. Class IV: Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort: symptoms of heart failure are present even at rest with increased discomfort with any physical activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 6-minute Walking Test (6-MWT) Distance at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>6-minute Walking Test (6-MWT) distance was the distance that a participant could walk in 6 minutes. Participants were asked to perform the test at a pace that was comfortable to them, with as many breaks as they needed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Echocardiographic Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>LVEF was defined as the fraction of blood (in percent) pumped out of the heart's left ventricular chamber with each heart beat and it is used to measure the cardiac output for the heart.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Echocardiographic Left Ventricular Size at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricle size was measured as systolic and diastolic Left Ventricular Internal Dimension (LVID). Diastolic dimension was measured of the left ventricle at the level of the chordae tendineae. The systolic dimension was measured as the smallest dimension between the left septal endocardium and the posterior wall endocardium during systole, whether or not the two walls were exactly apposed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, or diseases that emerges or worsens relative to baseline during a clinical study with an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), regardless of causal relationship and even if no IMP has been administered.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Global Assessment of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Global assessment of CHF: The Investigator defined, graded, and recorded the participant's symptoms and signs by using a 6-point CHF scale ranging from 0 (unassessable), 1 (worsened), 2 (no change), 3 (mildly improved), 4 (moderately improved) and 5 (markedly improved).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in N-terminal Pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) at Week 26</title>
        <description>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a substance secreted from the ventricles or lower chambers of the heart in response to changes in pressure that occur when heart failure develops and worsens. The level of BNP in the blood increases when heart failure symptoms worsen, and decreases when the heart failure condition is stable. The BNP level in a person with heart failure is higher than in a person with normal heart function. The percent change of NT-pro BNP was calculated according to the formula: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reduction ratio = 100*(Baseline NT-proBNP - Week 26 NT-proBNP)/Baseline NT-proBNP.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Echocardiographic Left Ventricular Size at Week 26</title>
        <description>Left ventricle size was measured as systolic and diastolic Left Ventricular Internal Dimension (LVID). Diastolic dimension was measured of the left ventricle at the level of the chordae tendineae. The systolic dimension was measured as the smallest dimension between the left septal endocardium and the posterior wall endocardium during systole, whether or not the two walls were exactly apposed.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all the randomized participants who had at least one dose of the investigational product. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure. 'n' signifies number of participants who were evaluable for specified categories at different time points.</population>
