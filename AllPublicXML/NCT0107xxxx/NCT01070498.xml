      The goal of this study is to determine whether Trichuris suis ova, a potential
      immunomodulator, is safe in adults and children allergic to peanut or tree nuts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is a major cause of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions. Currently
      avoidance of the allergenic food is the only established method of preventing reactions in
      allergic patients. This situation impacts significantly the lives of patients, mainly
      children, and their families. The current increase in the prevalence of allergic diseases,
      food allergy in particular, in the Western world has been attributed in part to changes in
      life style. Before the mid 20th century individuals were exposed to numerous bacterial,
      parasitic and viral agents. Since these times the progress of hygiene has considerably
      reduced the risk of exposure to these agents. It is thought that this lack of exposure,
      particularly during childhood, has led to subtle changes in humans' immune system resulting
      in an increased propensity to develop allergic and autoimmune responses, the so-called
      hygiene hypothesis. One of the means of reverting this propensity could be exposure to
      harmless biological agents. One such agent, eggs of the parasite Trichuris suis (Trichuris
      suis ova, TSO), has been shown to be well tolerated and efficient in patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases. This phase I study will assess whether TSO is safe in adults and
      children with peanut or tree nut allergy.

    <description>Subjects will receive TSO every other week for 3 months. The dose will depend on the age of the subject and vary between 100 and 2500 eggs. TSO will be administered orally as a suspension in single dose vials prepared by Ovamed GmbH, a company not directly involved in the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 to 64 years old

          -  Positive skin-prick test to peanut or tree nut and a history of significant clinical
             symptoms within 60 minutes after the ingestion of peanuts or tree nuts.

          -  Peanut or tree nut allergy of mild to moderate grade based on the presence of
             localized or generalized erythema/urticaria/angioedema/oral pruritis, gastrointestinal
             symptoms, rhinoconjunctivitis, or mild laryngeal edema (voice change/tightening of
             throat/mild asthma), and the absence of symptoms/signs of severity (marked dyspnea,

             consciousness)

          -  Otherwise in good health

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe anaphylaxis to peanut as defined by hypoxia, hypotension, or
             neurological compromise (cyanosis or SpO2 &lt; 92% at any stage, confusion, collapse,
             loss of consciousness, or incontinence)
