  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center pilot study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an asthma
      education program in the pediatric emergency department. Asthma has reached epidemic
      proportions. Nine million American children are affected in the United States alone. This
      problem has increased 75% from 1980 to 1994, with a staggering 160% increase seen in children
      less than five years old.1 The American Lung Association has targeted this overwhelming
      problem on both national and local levels. Asthma impacts American communities who differ
      geographically, culturally, ethnically and by lifestyle, and as a result will present with
      different obstacles.

      The primary objectives are: to determine whether this educational intervention (through
      interactions with a child life specialist and using the asthma based computer game) in the
      pediatric ED can influence children's [and care givers'] knowledge and understanding of the
      disease process and treatment, and to improve asthma self-management and decrease morbidity
      by decreasing ED use and hospitalization.

      A secondary objective is to introduce the Child Life Specialist as an effective asthma
      educator and further strengthen the health care team.

      The target population will be recruited from the pediatric emergency department. We
      anticipate this study to recruit over a one year period and have a one year follow up with an
      anticipated enrollment of 64 children and families. There will be three Child Life Specialist
      involved in this program.

      After consent has been obtained, the child and parent will complete questionnaires (focusing
      on asthma knowledge, quality of life, and perception of asthma) and then a laptop will be
      provided to access the asthma based computer game.

      During the child's ED visit the Child Life Specialist will have opportunities to open
      communication to address barriers or concerns, and reinforce material provided by the game.
      Through these interactions, the importance of communication between the child, parent and
      healthcare provider is highlighted.

      The family will be given information to access the computer game via the internet. Follow up
      phone calls or e-mails will occur at 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months which will entail
      completing questionnaires. The questionnaires uses validated questions along with questions
      from the material covered through this asthma education study.
