      This is a multicenter, open label, single arm, phase I/II study. There will be no placebo
      usage within this trial.

      Phase I:

      Primary: To establish a maximum tolerated dose of the addition of Temsirolimus to a regimen
      of Bendamustine and Rituximab (BERT) in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma and mantle
      cell lymphoma.

      Phase II:

      Primary: To evaluate the ORR in patients with MCL or FL treated with the established BERT
      dose Secondary: To determine the complete remission rate, progression free survival rate and
      overall survival rate and to investigate safety and tolerability of BERT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first part of the study is a phase I study in which the maximum tolerated dose of the
      combination of Temsirolimus, Bendamustine and Rituximab will be established. In the phase I
      part of the trial 3 patients will be included in each dose level. After inclusion of 3
      patients, each patient has to receive at least 2 complete cycles without DLT until the
      enrolment into the next cohort can be initiated. In case of one DLT, 3 additional patients
      will be added to the specific dose level. If a second DLT appears, the last dose level
      without DLT will be considered the standard dose for the phase II trial. If the third dose
      level is achieved without any DLT, there will be no further dose escalation.

      In the phase II proportion of the trial, after establishment of a maximum tolerated dose, the
      efficacy of the combination regimens in two different patient cohorts will be evaluated. In
      the one cohort, 30 patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma will be treated; the second
      cohort will be composed of 30 patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma.
