  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a severe genetic disorder caused by various mutations in
      genes affecting ciliary motility. Various new and complementary diagnostic techniques,
      including measurements of nasal nitric oxide (NO), Video Microscopy (VM), Immunoflourescence
      (IF) and genetic analysis have recently been recognized as simpler and more accurate
      modalities for the diagnosis and characterization of patients with PCD compared to electron
      microscopy. While considered a rare disease worldwide, PCD is more prevalent among highly
      consanguineous populations, such as those found in Israel. We hypothesize that using modern
      state of the art and novel test modalities on a national scale in Israel will improve
      diagnosis, improve phenotypic-genotypic correlations and create a national registry for PCD.

      Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a severe genetic disorder caused by various mutations in
      genes affecting ciliary motility. While diagnosis of PCD in Israel is currently based for the
      most part on electron microscopy (EM) detection of ciliary ultrastructural defects, this
      technique may be unsatisfactory and does not overcome the inherent heterogeneity. Thus, late
      and under-diagnosis and suboptimal characterization of patients is common. Various newer and
      complementary diagnostic techniques, including measurements of nasal nitric oxide (NO), Video
      Microscopy (VM), Immunoflourescence (IF) and genetic analysis have recently been recognized
      as simpler and more accurate modalities for the diagnosis and characterization of patients
      with PCD. While considered a rare disease worldwide, PCD is more prevalent among highly
      consanguineous populations, such as those found in Israel. Given the rarity of cases
      particularly familial ones, the most useful implementation of new diagnostic techniques
      requires multicenter collaboration.

      We hypothesize that using modern state of the art and novel test modalities on a national
      scale in Israel will improve diagnosis, improve phenotypic-genotypic correlations and create
      a national registry for PCD.

      We propose to perform such a multicenter study whose aims are:

        -  To characterize the complex phenotype and genotype of PCD in Israel, using
           state-of-the-art and novel diagnostic techniques.

        -  To create a national registry of patients and families with PCD in Israel

        -  To develop robust national standards of diagnosis and evaluation, which will lead to
           better and earlier diagnosis, treatment and counseling.
