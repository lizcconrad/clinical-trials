      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study comparing famotidine tablets, USP
      20 mg manufactured by OHM Laboratories with Pepcid速 AC Acid reducer famotidine tablets 20 mg
      (containing famotidine 20 mg) distributed by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Merck Consumer Pharmaceutical
      Co. Fort Washington, PA 19034 USA under fasting conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of famotidine tablets,
      USP 20 mg or Pepcid速 AC Acid reducer famotidine tablets 20 mg (containing famotidine 20 mg)
      was administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at
      ambient temperature and under supervision of trained study personnel.

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study for all the subjects.
