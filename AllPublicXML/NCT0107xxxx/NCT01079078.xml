      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single dose, crossover bioavailability study comparing acetaminophen extended
      release gelcaps 650 mg (containing acetaminophen 650 mg) of OHM Laboratories Inc. with
      TYLENOLÒ arthritis pain caplets 650 mg (containing acetaminophen 650 mg) of McNeil Consumer &amp;
      specialty Pharmaceuticals in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fed condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single oral dose of acetaminophen 650 mg was administered (except Subject No. 17) with 240
      mL of drinking water during each period under supervision of trained study personnel.

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical,
      serology parameters and urine analysis) at base line. Laboratory parameters of hematology and
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of study (except Glucose and cholesterol).
