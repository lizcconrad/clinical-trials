      Subjects undergoing an elective complete colonoscopy will randomly receive either PicoPrep:
      2-sachets for oral solution in two divided doses given in the afternoon (first dose - sachet)
      and 6 hours later in the evening (second dose - sachet), given the day before the procedure
      or HalfLytely: for oral solution and two 5 mg Bisacodyl tablets, given the day before the
      procedure to evaluate its effectiveness, tolerability and safety.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Classified as Successes (Excellent and Good Ratings) According to the Aronchick Scale As Assessed by a Blinded Gastroenterologist</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Overall colon cleansing was assessed by a blinded gastroenterologist during the colonoscopy using the Aronchick scale. The Aronchick scale is a 4-step rating scale: inadequate, fair, good, and excellent. Excellent is defined as &gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, minimal suctioning needed for adequate visualization. Good is defined as &gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, significant suctioning needed for adequate visualization.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Classified as Successes (Excellent, Good and Fair Ratings) For Ascending Colon Cleansing According to the Ottawa Scale As Assessed by a Blinded Gastroenterologist</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Cleansing of the ascending colon was assessed by a blinded gastroenterologist during the colonoscopy using the Ottawa scale, a 5-step rating scale: inadequate, poor, fair, good, and excellent. Excellent is defined as mucosal detail clearly visible; if fluid is present, it is clear and there is almost no stool residue. Good - some turbid fluid or stool residue but mucosal detail still visible; washing and suctioning is not necessary. Fair - turbid fluid or stool residue obscuring mucosal detail. However, mucosal detail becomes visible with suctioning and washing is not necessary.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Counts of participants who had TEAEs are summarized in a variety of categories. Severity and relatedness to study drug are in the opinion of the investigator. Severity is rated on a 3-point scale: mild (awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity), moderate (event sufficient to affect usual activity), and severe (inability to work or perform usual activities). Only severe TEAEs are summarized. Relatedness is assessed on a 4-point scale: unrelated, unlikely, possibly and probably. Both possibly and probably answers are reported as 'related' to study medication.</description>

    <description>PicoPrep (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide and citric acid) powder for oral solution consisted of 2 pouches of powder administered in a divided dose. Each PicoPrep pouch was reconstituted by mixing the contents in a cup with 5 ounces of cold water. Subjects randomized to the PicoPrep group will begin treatment (1st sachet) one day before colonoscopy between 4:00 and 6:00 PM, and will complete the treatment (2nd sachet) at least 6 hours later, between 10:00 PM and 12:00 AM. Subjects will consume approximately (5) 8 oz. glasses of clear liquids following the first sachet administration in the afternoon and (3) 8 oz. glasses of clear liquids following the second sachet administration in the evening, one day before colonoscopy.</description>

        <description>Cleansing of the ascending colon was assessed by a blinded gastroenterologist during the colonoscopy using the Ottawa scale, a 5-step rating scale: inadequate, poor, fair, good, and excellent. Excellent is defined as mucosal detail clearly visible; if fluid is present, it is clear and there is almost no stool residue. Good - some turbid fluid or stool residue but mucosal detail still visible; washing and suctioning is not necessary. Fair - turbid fluid or stool residue obscuring mucosal detail. However, mucosal detail becomes visible with suctioning and washing is not necessary.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Classified as Successes (Excellent, Good and Fair Ratings) For Ascending Colon Cleansing According to the Ottawa Scale As Assessed by a Blinded Gastroenterologist</title>
          <description>Cleansing of the ascending colon was assessed by a blinded gastroenterologist during the colonoscopy using the Ottawa scale, a 5-step rating scale: inadequate, poor, fair, good, and excellent. Excellent is defined as mucosal detail clearly visible; if fluid is present, it is clear and there is almost no stool residue. Good - some turbid fluid or stool residue but mucosal detail still visible; washing and suctioning is not necessary. Fair - turbid fluid or stool residue obscuring mucosal detail. However, mucosal detail becomes visible with suctioning and washing is not necessary.</description>

        <description>Counts of participants who had TEAEs are summarized in a variety of categories. Severity and relatedness to study drug are in the opinion of the investigator. Severity is rated on a 3-point scale: mild (awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity), moderate (event sufficient to affect usual activity), and severe (inability to work or perform usual activities). Only severe TEAEs are summarized. Relatedness is assessed on a 4-point scale: unrelated, unlikely, possibly and probably. Both possibly and probably answers are reported as 'related' to study medication.</description>
