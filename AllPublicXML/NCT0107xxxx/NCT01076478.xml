      parameters of diabetic polyneuropathies at baseline, four (4) weeks, eight (8) weeks, and
      twelve (12) weeks after Cilostazol therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Signed written informed consent 2. Male and Female ages 18 to 70 years old. To be able
        to eliminate Type I Diabetes Mellitus among the younger subjects, we will only recruit
        patients who are stable on oral hypoglycemic agent. 3. Established diagnosis of diabetes
        mellitus type 2 (National Diabetes Data Group) who are currently on good control of the
        diabetic state.

        4. Presence of predominantly distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy of the lower limbs
        as assessed by NSS, NIS and NCS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current use of potentially neuropathic agents (Isoniazid, Phenytoin, Dapsone,
             Metronidazole, Vinca Alkaloids, etc.) within the past 1 month;

          2. Presence of severe metabolic disease (renal failure, hepatic failure, etc.),
             alcoholism and malignancy;

          3. Presence of hemorrhagic tendencies;

          4. Patients who are diagnosed to be of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus;

          5. Pregnant and lactating patients, including those who plan to have pregnancy within the
             study period.

          6. Concomitant intake of agents currently used to treat neuropathic pain like gabapentin,
             carbamazepine/ oxcarbazepine, anti-depressants (tricyclic anti-depressants and SSRIs)
             and topical capsaicin.

          7. Concomitant intake of other anti-platelet agents, rheologic agents and anticoagulants.

          8. Have received Cilostazol therapy within the past three (3) months
