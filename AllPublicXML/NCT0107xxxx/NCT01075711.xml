  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common rheumatic disease with symptomatic morning stiffness
      which entails a quite essential restriction in the everyday life and in the life quality.
      This observational, uncontrolled, multicentric study is aimed to assess the improvement in
      the activity status or QoL of subjects with RA being treated with the Tempus tablet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised with a sudden onset , with pains in the little finger
      or toe joints, progressively affecting various joints and symptomatic morning stiffness. For
      subjects with RA, morning stiffness entails a quite essential restriction in the everyday
      life and in the life quality. This observational, uncontrolled, multicentric study is aimed
      to assess the improvement in the activity status or QoL of subjects with RA being treated
      with the Tempus tablet. A total of 8,000 subjects with diagnosed, active RA will be included
      in the study The study will apply to 2 target groups: general physicians, practicing doctors
      and interns (in-house doctors) with an observation period of 3 months; and specialists
      (rheumatologist) with an observation period of 9 months. Three subjects are expected per
      in-house doctor and 10 subjects per rheumatologist.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective:

        -  To examine, to what extent the subject will be directly benefited with the decrease in
           the morning arthritis symptom in the sense of an improvement in the life quality and the
           activity status

             1. The activity status will be assessed in 3 different areas: occupational activities,
                tasks in the household and leisure activities

             2. The life quality is assessed on the basis of the HAQ-DI

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To record side effects of Tempus tablet when used under everyday conditions

        -  To collect socioeconomic data such as e.g. aids or applications
