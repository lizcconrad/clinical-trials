  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves the use of two investigational drugs: sorafenib and bortezomib.
      Sorafenib is designed to stop the growth of cells caused by changes associated with cancer.
      Bortezomib is designed to stop cancer cells from getting rid of waste products. This causes
      the cells to build up toxic levels of waste that leads to cell death. In the laboratory, the
      combination of sorafenib and bortezomib has been shown to fight cancer cells better than
      either drug alone. We are looking to determine if the combination of sorafenib and bortezomib
      is a safe treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. The effectiveness of this
      combination will also be assessed.

      -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered
           safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have melanoma,
           not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose
           participants will get will depend upon the number of participants who have been enrolled
           in the study before and how well they tolerated their doses.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days. Participants will take sorafenib orally twice a day
           and will receive bortezomib as an out-patient intravenous injection on Days 1, 8 and 15
           of every cycle.

        -  At the end of each treatment cycle, participants will be examined to determine whether
           their disease has worsened, improved or stayed the same, and to see if they are
           experiencing any side effects of treatment. The following tests will be done at these
           visits: physical examination, vital signs, blood tests and scans (repeated every 2
           months).

        -  Once the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib and bortezomib have been determined, an
           additional 12 participants will be enrolled in this study. This is called the expansion
           cohort of this study. Participants enrolled in this cohort will be required to undergo a
           biopsy of the tumor lesion before they start study treatment and an additional biopsy
           after you start study treatment.
