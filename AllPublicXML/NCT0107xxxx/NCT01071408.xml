      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an outpatient program can reduce the risk
      of recurrent stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of death and disability. A history of stroke is the strongest
      predictor of a future stroke. Control of risk factors lowers the risk of future stroke, yet
      most persons with stroke do not have their risk factors controlled.

      In this randomized-controlled trial, we will test whether an outpatient stroke prevention
      program consisting of group clinics, patient self-management, and telephone care coordination
      can lower the risk of recurrent stroke by improving patient knowledge, medication adherence,
      and lifestyle habits. If successful, this program may be adapted to other settings.
