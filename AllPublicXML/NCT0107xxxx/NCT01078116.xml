    <textblock>
      Evaluation of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) is of a paramount importance in assessing
      the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on patients' health status, however when costs associated
      with rheumatoid arthritis are also taken into account, the information provided may lead to a
      more balanced view in analyzing the treatment of the disease.

      In accordance with the above, the main objective this study was to evaluate the impact of
      adalimumab treatment not only on patients' Health Related Quality of Life but also on the
      cost of the disease management. In order to accomplish this the study has been focused on:

        1. Estimating the direct and indirect cost incurred by adalimumab treatment.

        2. Measuring the Health Related Quality of Life of rheumatoid arthritis patients under
           adalimumab treatment.

        3. Exploring the cost-utility relationship of rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with
           adalimumab by combining the Health Related Quality of Life of rheumatoid arthritis
           patients and direct as well as indirect costs due to RA.

      More specifically, data related to patients' Health Related Quality of Life and cost
      associated with rheumatoid arthritis will be recorded for one-year period, and collected at
      four subsequent visits: baseline, month 3, 6 and 12. The visit before starting treatment with
      adalimumab will be considered as baseline. This information was used to compare Health
      Related Quality of Life and cost data before and after adalimumab initiation and therefore
      identify the effect of adalimumab treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data concerning patients' Health Related Quality of Life as well as the cost of the disease
      treatment were collected at four subsequent periods and specifically at baseline (Visit 1),
      and at months 3, 6 and 12.

      Moreover, at baseline patients' socioeconomic, and history of illness data as well as the use
      of other prescribed medication and costs due to rheumatoid arthritis have been recorded, in
      order to identify patients' health state before adalimumab treatment initiation.

      Patients discontinuing therapy (drop-outs) either due to adverse events or on their own
      initiative were categorized and analyzed separately, while reasons leading to discontinuation
      were recorded. Adverse events were not collected in this study with the exception of adverse
      events leading to withdrawal.

      In order to evaluate the cost-utility of adalimumab both the cost of the disease treatment
      and the Health Related Quality of Life of rheumatoid arthritis patients have been taken into
      account. The process is described below:

      Face-to-face interviews were conducted by the physicians/investigators in charge in all four
      subsequent periods as well as before adalimumab treatment initiation. A questionnaire,
      divided into the following sections, was administered: 1. Patients' Sociodemographic
      Characteristics 2. Measurement of Health Related Quality of Life in Rheumatoid Arthritis
      patients 3. Cost Assessment

    <measure>Estimation of the Direct and Indirect Cost Incurred by Adalimumab Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment visit (Baseline), month 3, month 6, month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Direct and indirect per-participant costs were estimated at Baseline (enrollment visit) for the 3-month period prior to initiation of adalimumab treatment, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following initiation of treatment. Direct costs included pharmaceutical costs, diagnostic and monitoring test costs, hospitalization costs, rheumatologist's costs, social insurance rheumatologist's costs, other specialists costs, physiotherapy costs, rehabilitation cost, home care cost, equipment cost and transportation cost. Indirect costs refer to loss of income due to rheumatoid arthritis disability.</description>

    <time_frame>Enrollment visit (Baseline), month 3, month 6, month 12</time_frame>
    <description>European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a generic health related quality of life instrument which assesses 5 health dimensions on a scale of 1 (no problems) to 5 (worst health). An overall score is derived ranging from -.59 to +1; a higher score indicates better health.</description>

    <description>Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (MOS SF-36) is a generic health related quality of life assessment that consists of 36 questions within 8 domains. Results from each domain are summarized and transformed into a scale ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

    <measure>Cost-Utility Relationship of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated With Adalimumab Using Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Approach (ICER)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ICER calculation is based on comparison of differences in costs and utilities (based on Quality of Life Adjusted years [QALYs]) between Baseline and the 12 month visit. The ICER represents the extra costs that have to be incurred for one extra unit of perfect health to be produced. A treatment is determined to be cost-effective if the ICER is below a certain threshold (National Health Systems of European Union have suggested a threshold of 50,000 euros).</description>

        <title>Estimation of the Direct and Indirect Cost Incurred by Adalimumab Treatment</title>
        <description>Direct and indirect per-participant costs were estimated at Baseline (enrollment visit) for the 3-month period prior to initiation of adalimumab treatment, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following initiation of treatment. Direct costs included pharmaceutical costs, diagnostic and monitoring test costs, hospitalization costs, rheumatologist's costs, social insurance rheumatologist's costs, other specialists costs, physiotherapy costs, rehabilitation cost, home care cost, equipment cost and transportation cost. Indirect costs refer to loss of income due to rheumatoid arthritis disability.</description>

        <description>The ICER calculation is based on comparison of differences in costs and utilities (based on Quality of Life Adjusted years [QALYs]) between Baseline and the 12 month visit. The ICER represents the extra costs that have to be incurred for one extra unit of perfect health to be produced. A treatment is determined to be cost-effective if the ICER is below a certain threshold (National Health Systems of European Union have suggested a threshold of 50,000 euros).</description>
