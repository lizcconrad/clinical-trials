      The main objective of this study is to determine the frequency of different gastrointestinal
      disorders as the cause of diarrhea in patients at a tertiary referral center using confocal
      laser endomicroscopy.

      Background:

      Diarrhea is characterized by frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements. Common causes
      include various gastrointestinal infections (e.g. clostridium difficile, salmonella),
      inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn´s disease), drugs (e.g. antibiotics)
      and malabsorption syndromes (e.g. celiac and Whipple's disease). Confocal laser
      endomicroscopy (CLE) is rapidly emerging as a valuable tool for gastrointestinal endoscopic
      imaging, enabling the endoscopist to obtain an &quot;optical biopsy&quot; of the gastrointestinal
      mucosa during the endoscopic procedure.

      Scope:

      In patients with diarrhea.

      Methods:

      Patients were randomized in two groups. Group 1: Patients underwent standard video
      colonoscopy for the evaluation of their symptoms. Group 2: During the endoscopic procedure
      CLE will be performed additionally.

      Procedure:

      The patient underwent colonoscopy. In Group 2 patients´ will receive intravenous fluorescein
      or topical mucosal staining with acriflavin or cresyl violet during the procedure, followed
      by in-vivo CLE of the tissue. Confocal images are digitally saved and analyzed afterwards.
