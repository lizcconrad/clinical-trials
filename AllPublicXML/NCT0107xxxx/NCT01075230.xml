        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is a male or female who is undergoing primary unilateral surgery or the first
             surgery of a staged bilateral total knee replacement where the second stage will be at
             least 6 weeks later

          -  Patient agrees to be blinded to their treatment group assignment

          -  Patient is willing and able to return for follow-up over at least a six (6) month
             post-operative period although longer follow-up may be desired

          -  Patient agrees to participate by signing an IRB approved Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient will have a staged bilateral total knee replacement with the second stage to
             be performed less than 6 weeks after the first stage surgery PRP in

          -  Patient has had previous surgery on the operative knee that will necessitate the
             removal of existing hardware (e.g. previous osteotomy)

          -  Patient has a known adverse reaction or sensitivity to bovine (cow) thrombin (used as
             part of the platelet rich plasma system) or other bovine-derived products

          -  Patient has hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 (males), &lt; 11.0 (females)

          -  Patient has a clinically significant anxiety disorder

          -  Patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation medication and has an INR &gt; 1.3

          -  Patient has a severe bleeding disorder

          -  Patient has a known addiction to drugs or alcohol, including, but not limited to:

          -  Patient is actively participating in another medical device, drug, or biologic
             clinical trial (active defined as having treatment within the last 30 days)
