  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a continuous cohort study consisting of 200 participants (one third 6 months old to 5
      years, one third 6 to 15 years old, one third ≥ 15 years old) i.e. a new patient will be
      recruited (from the same age group) for any patient who develops a Pv infection so that the
      cohort will always have 200 patients for 3 years. Each patient will be actively followed-up
      every 8 weeks until Plasmodium vivax infection occurs but the duration of follow up and the
      number of follow up visits for each patient will vary depending on when or if a vivax
      infection occurs and when the patient is recruited. Therefore, the minimum follow up period
      for each patient will be 6 months or time to vivax infection and the maximum will be 3 years
      if a patient does not get vivax infection and is recruited at the beginning of the study.

      This study will evaluate the most likely approach to malaria elimination; the administration
      of a radical curative dose of primaquine to the entire potentially infected population. In
      this study we will focus on patients who have had vivax malaria in the past year and so are
      very likely to harbour liver hypnozoites. Radical treatment is not given on the Thai-Burmese
      border because risks are considered to outweigh benefits, but it is recommended in Thailand.
      We believe that this policy could be changed if there was sufficient information.

      Patients who have received chloroquine only treatment could be considered as incompletely
      treated. We plan to conduct a carefully documented evaluation of radical treatment in such
      patients. Through this we aim to determine the incidence of vivax malaria in patients living
      in a vivax endemic area following radical treatment. This will provide information on the
      safety and tolerability of primaquine, used in the context most likely during an elimination
      programme, and also will provide information on the incidence of vivax malaria. Adults and
      children &gt; 6 months old with a documented P.vivax infection in the last 12 months will be
      recruited. In conjunction with a parallel study evaluating epidemiology in treated vivax
      malaria, we will be able to characterize the relapse history of P vivax. This will provide
      the foundation for further studies evaluating the efficacy of primaquine regimens.
