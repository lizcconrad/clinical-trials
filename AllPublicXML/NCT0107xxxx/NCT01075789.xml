  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasogastric tube insertion is one of the most common invasive procedures performed in
      children's hospitals, and has long been recognised as one of the most traumatic and painful.
      As a once off procedure, a nasogastric tube insertion is extremely distressing but the
      repeated procedures that many children endure as a necessary part of treatment for a chronic
      disease can be so traumatic that psychological damage may occur. There have been a limited
      number of studies carried out which have looked at methods to reduce the pain and trauma
      associated with this procedure, but most of these have been carried out in the adult
      population.

      The investigators propose to carry out a research project in a paediatric setting to
      definitively investigate the use of local anaesthetic spray, in combination with local
      anaesthetic gel, to numb the nasal passages and the back of the throat, with the aim of
      reducing or removing the unpleasant sensation of the nasogastric tube placement. If the study
      shows a benefit from the use of local anaesthetics, it would be an inexpensive and easily
      incorporated intervention that could be inserted into the routine procedure for nasogastric
      tube insertion.

    <description>This arm will include children aged 6 years of age and older seen at the Royal Children's Hospital who are having an NGT inserted for a clinical indication and who have never experienced an NGT insertion before. These children will be randomised to be in this placebo arm or the treatment arm in a 1:1 ratio. The placebo for swallowing is a viscous, coloured, sucrose-flavoured gel designed to match the appearance of the treatment lignocaine gel to be swallowed by the treatment arm, and normal saline will be delivered to the nasal turbinates and nasopharynx in a similar way to atomised xylocaine in the treatment arm.</description>

    <description>This arm will include children aged 6 years of age and older seen at the Royal Children's Hospital who are having an NGT inserted for a clinical indication and who have never experienced an NGT insertion before. These children will be randomised to be in this treatment placebo arm or the treatment arm in a 1:1 ratio. The children in the treatment arm will receive xylocaine viscous 2% to swallow, and atomised 10% xylocaine to the nasal turbinates and nasopharynx.</description>

    <description>This is a contemporaneous arm of children aged 6 years of age and older requiring nasogastric intubation for a clinical reason, who have previously had a nasogastric tube inserted. These children will be ask to rate by recall their previous NGT intubation on a VAS pain scale, and then will perform a post-procedure VAS pain assessment.</description>
