      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and length of effect of Vyvanse on
      lessening Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms in adults. The study will also
      investigate the safety and tolerability of Vyvanse in adults with ADHD.

      Protocol Summary:

      Effectiveness and Duration of Effect of Open Treatment in Adult ADHD Patients Treated with
      Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate- LDX (Vyvanse)

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and duration of effect
      of LDX for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in adults. The study will be a 12-week open label
      extension with 25 adult participants who completed a cross-over study of adherence/efficacy
      of Adderall Immediate Release (IR) vs. Adderall Extended Release (XR).

      The secondary objective is to provide information regarding tolerability, dosing and
      titration of LDX in the adult population with ADHD.

      An additional fifteen participants will be recruited using advertising and previous Mental
      Health and Addictive Behaviour Research Program (MHADRP) studies will be offered treatment
      with LDX. All participants will be diagnosed with ADHD using the Adult Clinician Diagnostic
      Scale (ACDS). We will be collecting demographic information, administering the Scheduled
      Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID), collecting medical history, previous drug
      therapy, and the participant will have a physical with the physician. A coordinator will give
      an electrocardiogram (ECG), and collect a blood sample for blood chemistry and hematology.

    <description>The ADHD-RS with adult ADHD prompts is a semi-structured scale that consists of 18 items that directly correspond to the 18 DSM-IV symptoms of ADHD, and is designed to assess current symptomatology19.
Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe).Each item on the 18-item measure is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms), yielding a possible total score of 0-54. A score of 0-16 means &quot;Unlikely to have ADHD&quot;; a score of 17-23 &quot;Likely to Have ADHD&quot; ; 24 or greater-Highly Likely to have ADHD</description>

    <description>The Adult ADHD Medication Smoothness of Effect Scale (AMSES) is a 6-item, frequency-based, self-report scale that was recently developed to assess the consistency and duration of effect of ADHD medication throughout the day. The AMSES compares the effectiveness of ADHD medication shortly after dosing with the effectiveness later in the day. Respondents are asked to rate how frequently the effective-ness of their medication was the same 2 hr post-dose as it was 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hr post-dose on a 0 to 4 scale (0 = never, 1 = rarel, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = very often). In addition, respondents rate how frequently the delivery of their medication was consistent and smooth throughout the day on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (never) to 100 (very often).</description>

Those on treatment prior to baseline underwent a 7-day (for amphetamine or methylphenidate) or 28-day (for atomoxetine or other medications) washout period prior to initiating LDX treatment. The starting dose was 30mg/day, which could be titrated up by 20mg/day during visits 2-6 (for a maximum dose of 70mg/day). At discretion of investigator, the dose could be down-titrated by 20mg/day during visits 4-6. Once the dose was optimized (after visit 6), the dose was maintained for 8 weeks.</description>

          <description>The treatment arm will receive 12 weeks of Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate-LDX treatment. At baseline, participants were initiated on LDX at a dose of 30 mg/day and began a 4-week dose optimization phase with weekly clinic visits. The dose optimization phase was followed by an 8-week dose maintenance phase, which included clinic visits every 2 weeks for the assessment of safety and efficacy. At visits 3-6, the dose of LDX was increased by 20 mg/day until an optimal dose or the maximum dose of 80 mg/day was reached. An optimal dose was determined by clinical efficacy, defined as a &gt;= 30% reduction in the baseline ADHD Rating Scale, and tolerability. At the discretion of the investigator, the dose could be down-titrated by 20 mg/day at visits 4-6. When an optimal dose was reached, the participant remained at this level for the duration of the study.</description>

Scoring on the AMRS based on 38 items, each scored 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Severe). The lowest scored units on a scale for 1 individual is 0, the highest 114.

            <description>Eligible participants received 12 weeks of open-label treatment. Those on treatment prior to baseline underwent a 7-day (for amphetamine or methylphenidate) or 28-day (for atomoxetine or other medications) washout period prior to initiating LDX treatment. The starting dose was 30mg/day, which could be titrated up by 20mg/day during visits 2-6 (for a maximum dose of 70mg/day). At discretion of investigator, the dose could be down-titrated by 20mg/day during visits 4-6. Once the dose was optimized (after visit 6), the dose was maintained for 8 weeks.
LDX Treatment: 30 mg, 50mg, or 70 mg. Oral capsule, once a day, for 12 weeks.</description>

        <description>The Adult ADHD Medication Smoothness of Effect Scale (AMSES) is a 6-item, frequency-based, self-report scale that was recently developed to assess the consistency and duration of effect of ADHD medication throughout the day. The AMSES compares the effectiveness of ADHD medication shortly after dosing with the effectiveness later in the day. Respondents are asked to rate how frequently the effective-ness of their medication was the same 2 hr post-dose as it was 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hr post-dose on a 0 to 4 scale (0 = never, 1 = rarel, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = very often). In addition, respondents rate how frequently the delivery of their medication was consistent and smooth throughout the day on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (never) to 100 (very often).</description>

At visits 3-6, the dose of LDX was increased by 20 mg/day until an optimal dose or the maximum dose of 80 mg/day was reached. An optimal dose was determined by clinical efficacy, defined as a &gt;= 30% reduction in the baseline ADHD Rating Scale, and tolerability. At the discretion of the investigator, the dose could be down-titrated by 20 mg/day at visits 4-6.

            <description>The treatment arm will receive 12 weeks of Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate-LDX treatment. At baseline, participants were initiated on LDX at a dose of 30 mg/day and began a 4-week dose optimization phase with weekly clinic visits. The dose optimization phase was followed by an 8-week dose maintenance phase, which included clinic visits every 2 weeks for the assessment of safety and efficacy. At visits 3-6, the dose of LDX was increased by 20 mg/day until an optimal dose or the maximum dose of 80 mg/day was reached. An optimal dose was determined by clinical efficacy, defined as a &gt;= 30% reduction in the baseline ADHD Rating Scale, and tolerability. At the discretion of the investigator, the dose could be down-titrated by 20 mg/day at visits 4-6. When an optimal dose was reached, the participant remained at this level for the duration of the study.</description>
