  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and treatment of cancer leads to emotional distress, and major disruptions in
      role functioning. Traditionally, psychosocial services offer individuals diagnosed with
      cancer peer group support or individual counseling with only few consideration of type or
      stage of cancer. Besides most cancers significantly impacting not only the individual but
      also their partners and families, breast and gynecological cancer may be particularly
      embedded in an interpersonal context, namely in the couple's relationship. Breast and
      gynecological cancer cause additional concerns about the women' body image, sexual
      functioning and these cancers may be prone to provoke or enhance maladaptive patterns of
      interaction between women and their partners. Thus, not only the individual but also the
      couple's functioning is threatened by these diagnoses.

      The aim of the here proposed study is to identify predictors of couple's adjustment and to
      help couples to improve their ability to support each other during this time. In a multi-site
      study, we will evaluate the efficacy of a couple-based intervention entitled &quot;Side by Side:
      Coping with Cancer Together (&quot;Seite an Seite: Krebs Gemeinsam Bew√§ltigen&quot;). The intervention
      teaches couples relationship skills that have been repeatedly validated within the marital
      field. The aim of the intervention is to improve couples' skills to talk to each other
      effectively about cancer-related topics, and enhance (or maintain) an affectionate
      relationship in the face of death.

      We will randomly assign 303 women recently diagnosed with either breast or gynecological
      cancer and their partners to one of two conditions: (1) Seite an Seite, or (2)
      Treatment-As-Usual, in which couples receive no active psychosocial intervention. Assessment
      will be conducted pre-, post-, and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. These assessments include
      for both partners negative and positive self-report measures of individual functioning (such
      as mood, anxiety and benefit finding) and relationship functioning (such as relationship
      distress, communication patterns). Furthermore, at pre-, post- and 12-month Follow-up
      observational data on mutual supportive behavior when communicating about a cancer-related
      topic will be collected. The study may enhance our understanding of the significance of
      relationship skills in the process of adjusting to cancer as a couple and as an individual.
