      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond
      to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in predicting response in patients with
      advanced ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate ERCC1 tumor expression, as measured by IHC, as a predictor of
           progression-free and overall survival of patients with advanced ovarian epithelial
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate ERCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (C8092A and codon 118) with ERCC1
           tumor expression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples are analyzed for ERCC1 tumor expression by
      IHC and single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
