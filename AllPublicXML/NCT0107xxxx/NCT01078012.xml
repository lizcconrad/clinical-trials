  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is together with the BIMOH (NCT01314768) RCT study to evaluate
      whether training of GPs in the detection and treatment of medication overuse headache leads
      to improved care for these patients as compared to &quot;business as usual&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present pilot study focuses on testing the logistics and the methodology of short
      intervention on a pilot group of GPs and their patients.

      Due to low recruitment and the pilot study focus on logistics and methodology, the study was
      changed to not include a control (business as usual) arm. The outcomes were evaluated as
      &quot;before - after&quot; data and qualitative comments on acceptability and utility of the method.
      Primary outcomes were changed to be the acceptability and utility (previously listed as
      secondary outcomes) while secondary outcomes were headache days and medication days
      (previously listed as primary).
