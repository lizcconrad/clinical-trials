  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe, Japan and South America. The aim of the trial is to
      compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NN1250 (insulin degludec ([Deg]) with
      insulin detemir (IDet), both combined with insulin aspart.

      The main period is registered internally at Novo Nordisk as NN1250-3585 while the extension
      period is registered as NN1250-3725.

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 55 sites in 7 countries: Brazil (2), Finland (8), India (10), Italy (6), Japan (15), Macedonia (1) and United Kingdom (13). For the extension trial, one trial site in Italy did not enroll any subject since approval was not obtained before the start of the trial from the IEC.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects who completed the 26-week main trial (NN1250-3585, NCT01074268) and were found to be eligible for the extension trial were offered to participate in the 26-week extension trial (NN1250-3725). The total duration of treatment was 52 weeks (26 weeks + 26 weeks), separated by 1 week of follow-up from the main trial.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Extension Trial (Secondary Endpoint): Rate of Nocturnal Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
          <description>Rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes: episodes requiring active assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes: episodes where subject was able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L, with or without symptoms. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes are defined as occuring between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m.</description>
          <population>The SAS included all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational product or its comparator in the main trial including subjects carried through to the extension trial.</population>
