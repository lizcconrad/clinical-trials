    <textblock>
      It is uncertain, whether hilar lymphadenectomy should be performed routinely in patients
      undergoing resection of colorectal liver metastases.

      For this reason it is the aim of the present prospective randomized trial to evaluate, if
      routine lymphadenectomy reduces recurrent disease in patients undergoing resection of
      colorectal liver metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal liver
      metastases may improve outcome of further patients due to the presence of micrometastases
      that have been shown to be of prognostic relevance. While previous studies highlight the
      clinical significance of perihepatic lymph node metastases, the outcome of patients with and
      without hilar lymphadenectomy has not yet been compared and thus no clear conclusion about
      the clinical value of routine hilar lymphadenectomy in CRC patients undergoing resection of
      liver metastases can be drawn from present data.

      As disease recurrence occurs frequently and may affect up to 75 % of patients, further
      strategies are required to improve postoperative outcome. Routine hilar lymphadenectomy may
      offer an effective approach to remove residual disease and by this to reduce disease
      recurrence with little additional morbidity. For this reason it is the aim of the present
      prospective randomized trial to evaluate, if routine lymphadenectomy reduces recurrent
      disease in patients undergoing resection of colorectal liver metastases.
