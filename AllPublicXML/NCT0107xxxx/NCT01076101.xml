      This study enrolled over 400 unaffected sisters of young women diagnosed with SLE. These
      unaffected sisters are being followed with an annual health questionnaire (CSQ) and blood
      sample.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation
      and is accompanied by the development of autoantibodies. The inflammation caused by SLE may
      affect the skin, joints, lungs, blood, kidneys and nervous system. The cause of SLE is
      unknown, but research has indicated that it is caused by a combination of genetic and
      environmental factors.

      Autoimmune diseases often run in families. Close relatives of people with these diseases are
      at greater risk of developing the same or another autoimmune disease. The study is designed
      to determine several things: If sisters of people with SLE make the same antibodies that are
      present in people with SLE, whether or not environmental factors affect the chances of
      developing these antibodies and if so what these environmental factors may be, if the
      presence of these antibodies in healthy people leads to increased risk for the development of
      SLE.

      This study enrolled over 400 unaffected sisters of young women diagnosed with SLE. These
      unaffected sisters are being followed with an annual health questionnaire (CSQ) and blood
      sample.

      Participation is voluntary and participants can stop participating at any time.

      We will use your DNA blood sample to study the function of genes and biomarkers and gain
      understanding of their role in protection against disease or the role they play in increasing
      the risk factors of developing lupus. No, you will not get test results since the information
      we gather is only useful for research and is not diagnostic. Participation in this study is
      not a substitute for regular medical care.

      The information and blood sample that is collected for research will be analyzed for many
      years and it is not possible to know how long this analysis and follow-up will take.
      Therefore, participation allows the information and banking of your blood sample to be
      indefinite.

             diagnosed by and including age 40.

          2. Proband must have at least one biological sister ≥ 10 years of age and ≤ 45 who is
             available and willing to donate a blood sample and enroll in a longitudinal study.
             Both full and half siblings qualify.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        If inclusion criteria above are met for the proband, there are no exclusions.

        Sister who does not have SLE:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female with a full or half sister who has been documented SLE that meets ACR criteria.

          2. Sister must be currently between ages ≥ 10 and ≤ 45 at the time of enrollment and not
             have a diagnosis of SLE.

          3. Sister must be able to complete questionnaires and should be willing to donate a blood
             sample at baseline and follow-up.

          4. Sister should communicate to the recruiter that she is willing to be followed for a
             period of at least two years by phone and/or internet.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        If Sister meets inclusion criteria, there will be no exclusions.
