      This is an efficacy and safety study evaluating an experimental treatment for cognitive
      deficits in adults with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABT-288 in
      approximately 210 adults with schizophrenia. Subjects will be randomized to one of three
      treatment groups (ABT-288 Dose 1, ABT-288 Dose 2 or placebo) for a 12-week Treatment Period.
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether ABT-288 compared to placebo can
      improve cognition and what side effects ABT 288 may cause. Cognition is the way a person
      thinks, and it includes abilities like paying attention, focusing, remembering things, and
      solving problems. Acronyms listed in the Outcomes and/or Eligibility sections for this study
      are defined below:

        -  MCCB: Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS)
           Consensus Cognitive Battery

           Assessment-2
