  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human exercise capacity decreases with aging. One explanation may be that blood vessels
      stiffen with age and release less of a compound called nitric oxide (NO). This compound
      normally relaxes blood vessels and increases blood flow to muscles, but damaging compounds
      called free radicals can interfere with this process. Antioxidants may help prevent free
      radicals from inactivating nitric oxide. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
      effects of an antioxidant supplement that supports NO production on exercise performance in
      elderly male cyclists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the discovery of the vascular smooth muscle relaxant properties of nitric oxide (NO)
      over 25 years ago, studies have implicated this molecule in modulating such processes as
      atherosclerosis, impotence, angina, platelet function, and blood pressure, among others.
      Through vascular smooth muscle relaxation in both coronary and skeletal muscle arteries, as
      well as via independent mechanisms, nitric oxide has also been implicated in improvement of
      exercise capacity. In addition, NO may be involved in the immune system, assist in memory
      function and sleep regulation, and act as a cellular signaling messenger. Youthful, healthy
      and athletic individuals generally have a healthier NO system, compared to sedentary,
      unhealthy and aging individuals. NiteworksTM is a dietary supplement that includes
      L-arginine, an amino acid that acts as a nitric oxide donor and has been shown to increase
      levels of this molecule in the body. NiteworksTM has been formulated as a composite mixture
      along with other supplements, including antioxidants, that may act synergistically with
      L-arginine in enhancing exercise capacity.

    <description>The proprietary supplement NiteworksÂ® was manufactured by Herbalife International Inc. (Century City, California, USA). Each serving contained 5.2g L-arginine in a proprietary blend with L-citrulline, 500mg ascorbic acid, 400IU vitamin E, 400ug folic acid, 300mg L-taurine, and 10mg alpha lipoic acid in a lemon-flavored powder form. One serving of supplement powder was mixed with 8 oz of water, administered at bedtime based on the rationale that nitric oxide levels are lowest during sleep due to inactivity, lack of food and low blood pressure.</description>
