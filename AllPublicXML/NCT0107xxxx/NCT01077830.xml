      The purpose of this extension is to observe the incidence rates of cancer, total mortality,
      and mortality due to cancer over a 21 month follow-up period in patients from the SEAS trial
      (2004_050, MK0653A-043; NCT00092677).

      The SEAS Follow-up Study is a 21 month extension to the base protocol (2004_050, MK0653A-043;
      NCT00092677). The main objective of the extension is to observe the incidence rates of
      cancer, total mortality, and mortality due to cancer over a 21 month follow-up period (from
      04-March 2008 to 31-December 2009) in patients from the SEAS clinical trial. The sources of
      study data will include data collected from national cancer and death registries as well as
      data from the original clinical trial. No patient visits will occur. National cancer and
      death registries exist in 5 of the 7 countries that participated in the base SEAS trial. At
      the time of Follow-up study initiation, accessing the registry data in Ireland was not
      feasible due to local regulations and Cancer and Death registries did not exist in Germany.
      As a result, data will be collected only for all SEAS patients known to be alive at the end
      of the base study originating from Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and the United Kingdom.

    <description>Any incidence of cancer reported during follow-up that was assessed by the Expert Review Committee to be a new case of cancer. The crude new cancer rates for each arm were calculated as follows: Number of participants in the arm was multiplied by the Duration of Follow-up (days) and divided by 365 (days per year) to establish the Total Participant-years for the arm. The Number of New Cancers reported was then divided by the Total Participant-years and the resultant quotient was then multiplied by 100 to determine the Crude New Cancer Rate.</description>

        <description>All deaths reported during follow-up were reviewed by the Expert Review Committee to ascertain if cancer was cause of death. The crude rates of death due to cancer for each arm were calculated as follows: Number of participants in the arm was multiplied by the Duration of Follow-up (days) and divided by 365 (days per year) to establish the Total Participant-years for the arm. The Number of Deaths due to Cancer reported was divided by the Total Participant-years and the resultant quotient was then multiplied by 100 to determine the Crude Rate of Death Due to Cancer.</description>
