  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Training Executive, Attention and Motor Skills (TEAMS) is a new research program for
      preschool children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) that attempts to use
      game-like activities and physical exercise to promote the growth of neural processes that
      underlie the core features of the disorder (e.g., hyperactivity, impulsivity) as well as
      associated areas of difficulty (e.g., socialization, motor skills). These activities are
      implemented at home and in supervised playgroups at no cost to families and are coupled with
      extensive parental education about ADHD symptoms and associated impairments.
