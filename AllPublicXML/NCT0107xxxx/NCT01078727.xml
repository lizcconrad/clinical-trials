  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving upper extremity movement and function in patients with stroke has been one of the
      primary goals for patients and rehabilitation professionals. Thermal stimulation (TS) had
      been first found by a domestic research group to be effective to facilitate sensory and motor
      recovery in patients with stroke within a month. However, the immediate and long-term effects
      of TS and the mechanism of brain plasticity in patients with stroke for more than three
      months (golden recovery stage) remain unknown. Thus, we will design a single-blind randomized
      controlled trial to investigate the immediate and long-term effects of TS in patients with
      stroke at subacute and chronic stages.

    <textblock>
      The study was an assessor-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants with UE
      impairment for more than 3 months poststroke were randomly assigned to either the
      experimental (EXP) group or the control group. All participants received regular conventional
      rehabilitation programs. The EXP group received an additional UE-TS protocol for 30 minutes a
      day (3 days/week for 8 weeks); the control group received the same TS protocol over the lower
      extremity (LE). The Brunnstrom's recovery stage, the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the
      Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM), the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT),
      and the Barthel Index (BI) were outcome measures and were administered at baseline, 4 weeks
      and 8 weeks post inception, and at one-month follow-up.

    <description>The subjects meeting our criteria will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. First stage (3 months after onset), the subjects in the experimental group will receive an upper extremity Thermal Stimulation (TS) protocol for 30 minutes (3 times a week for 8 weeks). The subjects in the control group will receive a lower extremity TS protocol.</description>
