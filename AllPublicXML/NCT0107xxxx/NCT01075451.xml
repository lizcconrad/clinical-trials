  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to study the relationships between antimicrobial
      stewardship program efforts, antimicrobial drug use, and infection control efforts to the
      incidence rates of hospital acquired infections with Staphylococcus aureus in a sample of US
      academic medical center hospitals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients can become infected with a variety of microorganisms, but infections
      caused by Staphylococcus aureus (i.e., &quot;staph&quot; infections) are particularly common. The main
      strategy to reduce the number of patients infected with Staph. aureus is to decrease
      cross-transmission from one patient to another. In addition, increasing evidence suggests
      that improvements in antimicrobial drug use--promoted by hospital Antimicrobial Stewardship
      programs (ASPs) -- may also favorably impact rates of Staph. aureus infections. While many
      Staphylococcal strains remain susceptible to an old drug called methicillin
      (methicillin-susceptible Staph aureus, or MSSA), many Staph. aureus are methicillin-resistant
      (MRSA). The drug of choice for MRSA has historically been vancomycin, and vancomycin is now
      the most commonly prescribed antibiotic in US teaching hospitals. Vancomycin-resistant Staph.
      aureus (VRSA) is still uncommon, but some Staph. aureus are developing &quot;low level&quot; resistance
      to vancomycin. These strains are often called S. aureus with MIC &quot;creep&quot; to vancomycin
      (SA-MICcreep), and Staphylococcus aureus with Heterogeneous Resistance to Vancomycin (hVISA),
      but the epidemiology, clinical significance and risk factors for these organisms are not well
      described. We will survey UHC participating hospitals to learn more about these organisms,
      the drug and ASP related risk factors, and whether hospitals are trying to identify these
      organisms.
