      In this study, the investigators designed a randomized and double-blind prospective trial to
      evaluate the efficiency and safety of the investigators new approach—transurethral ventral
      wall of urethra-preserving enucleation of prostate in comparison with TURP for the
      hyperplasia weighing more than 45 g.

    <textblock>
      Although in recent dozen of years, laser operation and other safer minimally invasive
      surgeries have been well-developed, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is still
      the gold standard for the surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, despite of its
      various complications, and not suitable for the hyperplasia over 80 g which should be
      resected under open surgery. In this study, we design a randomized and double-blind
      prospective trial to evaluate the efficiency and safety of our new approach—transurethral
      ventral wall of urethra-preserving enucleation of prostate in comparison with TURP for the
      hyperplasia weighing more than 45 g.Urodynamic examination [maximum flow rate (QMax),
      detrusor pressure, and so on], transrectal color Doppler ultrasonography for the prostate,
      blood routine, blood electrolyte, prostate specific antigen (PSA), International Prostate
      Symptom Score (IPSS), the quality of life (Qol), blood loss during operation, and the weight
      of resected prostate were studied before and after the operation.
