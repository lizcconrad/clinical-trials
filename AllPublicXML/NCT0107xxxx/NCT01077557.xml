      This US population-based study will explore the incidence of and risks for fracture among
      adults with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The objectives are to
      determine the incidence of fracture among persons with and without HIV infection, compare
      risk factors for fracture among persons with and without HIV infection, and to examine the
      associations of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment exposure for incidence and risk of fracture
      among persons with HIV infection.

      This study uses data from the Integrated Health Care Information Services (IHCIS) National
      Managed Care Benchmarked Database, a health insurance claims database. The study has two
      analytic components. The first is a retrospective cohort study comparing subjects without HIV
      infection to subjects with HIV infection for the incidence of and risk for fracture,
      including the use of anyARV drugs in persons with HIV infection. The second is a nested
      case-control study limited to persons with HIV infectiion within the cohort. Cases are those
      with incident fractures occurring after the diagnosis of HIV infection, and controls those
      without a fracture. Cases and controls will be compared for risk factors for incident
      fracture including ARV drug exposure. The drug exposures will include individual nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (as permitted by sample size) and the other ARV drug
      classes.

      ViiV Healthcare is the new sponsor of this study, and GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of
      updating systems to reflect the change in sponsorship.

A 3:1 match of subjects without HIV infection to a subject with HIV infection will occur.

        The study population will consist of adults (&gt;18 years of age) with and without HIV
        infection continuously enrolled for at least 12 months in the Integrated Health Care
        Information Services (IHCIS) National Managed Care Benchmarked Database, a health insurance
        claims database, during the interval between January 1, 1997 and March 31, 2008, and with
        continuous eligibility for pharmacy benefits. Health plan enrollees in this database are
