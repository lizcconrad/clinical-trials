      The present research is conducted as a randomized, parallel-group, controlled, open study
      (using the PROBE method) to primarily verify the effects on various biomarkers in high-risk
      hypertensive patients treated with ARB (telmisartan, ARB group) as compared with those in
      patients receiving ordinary therapy (non-ARB group (ordinary therapy group)). In addition,
      onset of cardiovascular events and levels of markers that are associated with cardiovascular
      events are observed over time to examine the significance of each marker. The biomarkers will
      be obtained at the start of the study (at registration), after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months from
      the start of the study.

      Events are defined as follows; Cerebrovascular events: Stroke (cerebral infarction, cerebral
      hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, unknown type of stroke), transient ischemic attack
      Coronary events: Myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia
      Cardiac events: Myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia,
      heart failure Aortic/peripheral arterial events: Aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection,
      arteriosclerotic disease (aorta, carotid artery, renal artery, mesenteric artery, peripheral
      artery, etc.) Complications of diabetes: Diabetic nephropathy*, diabetic retinopathy*,
      diabetic neuropathy* Aggravation of renal function: Doubling of serum creatinine level, ESRD
      (initiation of dialysis, renal transplantation)

      *Newly occurred or aggravated

      The followings will be measured as biomarkers; urinary albumin creatinine rates (UACR),
      plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), urinary 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG), serum
      adiponectin, serum high-molecular weight adiponectin, high sensitivity c-reactive protein
      (hsCRP), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Patients who meet all of the criteria listed in [1] to [4] below and
        who have at least one cardiovascular risk listed in [1] to [5] below will be included in
        the study.

          1. Outpatients

          2. Age: ≥ 40 to &lt; 80

          3. Hypertension: Systolic blood pressure of ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥
             90 mmHg in the two latest measurements of casual blood pressure (in the sitting
             position) regardless of treated or untreated condition, or systolic blood pressure of
             &lt; 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of &lt; 90 mmHg that require antihypertensive
             treatment.

             Assessment of hypertension: Blood pressure will be measured at least twice at an
