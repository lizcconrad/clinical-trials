    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given
      together with sorafenib tosylate in treating patients with advanced liver cancer. Sorafenib
      tosylate and vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      Outline: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat. The purpose of this research study is
      to test the safety and effectiveness of a combination of two cancer drugs, sorafenib
      (Nexavar) and vorinostat (Zolinza), in advanced liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).
      Advanced means that the cancer has spread too far to consider surgery. Approximately 19
      people will take part in this study.

      After enrollment of 6 patients at sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day and vorinostat 300 mg
      orally, only 2 of the 6 patients were evaluable for DLT (no DLTs). The other 4 patients were
      not evaluable for DLT because of required dose modifications. Because of this dose
      modification need, Cohort A has been modified to include 2 dose levels: Dose level A-1a
      (sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day and vorinostat 200 mg orally once a day) and dose level
      A1 (sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day with vorinostat 100 mg orally once a day). The
      starting dose upon reopening after approval of this version will be dose level A-1a. Dose
      level A1 will only be used if dose level A-1a is not tolerable.

    <description>Sorafenib + Vorinostat. Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID continuously and vorinostat PO QD, for 5 days each week. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohort A has only one dose level: sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day with vorinostat 300 mg orally. Cohort A was modified to include 2 dose levels: Dose level A1 (sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day and vorinostat 200 mg orally once a day) and dose level A-1 (sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day with vorinostat 100 mg orally once a day).

    <description>Reduced Dose 200mg Sorafenib + Vorinostat. Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID continuously and vorinostat PO QD, for 5 days each week. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohort B has 2 dose levels starting at the second dose level (sorafenib 200 mg orally twice a day with vorinostat 400 mg orally). Cohort B has been closed. Cohort B was intended to evaluate the possibility of dose intensification of vorinostat when patients were unable to tolerate standard dose sorafenib, and required dose-reduced sorafenib. The patients accrued to date in Cohort B were unable to tolerate therapy, and it has been determined that dose intensification of vorinostat is not possible, despite reducing the dose of sorafenib.</description>
