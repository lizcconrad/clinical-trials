      This study primary objective and endpoints are compare the efficacy of two products
      containing filgrastim, evaluating if the formulation produced by Eurofarma can be considered
      non-inferior to the reference product. For this, the study primary endpoint will be the rate
      of grade 4 neutropenia after the first cycle of chemotherapy, according to the classification
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC-AE).

      The study secondary objectives will be to compare other efficacy aspects, as well as the
      tolerability of the two products containing filgrastim.

      The secondary endpoints considered for the study will be:

        -  The febrile neutropenia rate;

        -  The rate of any grade 4 neutropenia;

        -  The duration of the grade 4 neutropenia;

        -  The frequency of the adverse events and the laboratory changes.
