      The study is planned to evaluate the cognitive functions in subjects with RRMS treated with
      interferon beta-1a, and its relationship to the fatigue and neurological dysfunction status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Besides the motor and sensory dysfunctions, the progression of cognitive decline is a
      frequent manifestation of RRMS. Fatigue is another important symptom of MS, and can
      negatively affect subject's Quality of life (QoL) and socio-economic functioning, including
      the ability to work, independent of the direct effects of disability. This is a phase IV
      observational, non-interventional, prospective, multicentric study to evaluate cognition in
      RRMS subjects treated with Rebif and its relationship to the fatigue and neurological
      dysfunction status. The study plans to enroll 300 subjects, across 14 centres in Czech
      Republic, who will be prescribed with Rebif according to its summary of product
      characteristics (SmPC). Assessment of cognitive and fatigue status will be done at baseline
      and follow-up visits at Months 3, 6, 12, 24. Subjects will be selected using the convenience
      method following the non-probability sampling.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess changes of cognition [measured by Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)]
           in RRMS subjects treated with Rebif

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess changes of fatigue [measured by Fatigue Descriptive Scale (FDS)] in RRMS
           subjects treated with Rebif

        -  To assess a correlation between cognition, fatigue and neurological status in RRMS
           subjects treated with Rebif

        -  To assess a relationship between Rebif dosage [22 mcg vs 44 mcg thrice a week (tiw)] and
           cognition (PASAT)

        -  To assess a relationship between Rebif dosage (22 mcg vs 44 mcg tiw) and fatigue (FDS)

        -  To assess adherence to Rebif treatment

        -  To explore the use of antidepressive and antifatigue medicaments
