      Objective: Primary objective is to study the arginine-NO metabolism during fracture healing
      and dysfunctional fracture healing. Secondary objective: to investigate if differences or
      decreased arginine and NO concentrations in bone healing form a prognostic marker for
      non-union development Hypothesis: Early detection of disturbances in the Arginine and nitric
      oxide metabolism during fracture healing are a good prognostic marker for non-union
      development.

      Study design: Prospective observational study. Study population: All acute fracture patients
      (age &gt;18 years), with a fracture of the tibia or femur attending the Department of General
      Surgery, to investigate the Arginine -NO metabolism during normal fracture healing and
      possible dysfunctional healing. In total 100 patients will be included during this study.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary endpoints are arginine and Nitric Oxide levels in the plasma during normal and
      dysfunctional fracture healing the bone in patients with and without non-union Secondary
      endpoints are levels of Nitric Oxide citrulline, ornithine and other amino acids in bone and
      in plasma Other parameters: baseline demography details will be obtained, including possible
      confounders, such as bodyweight, smoking, alcohol abuse, which may interfere with the outcome
      of this study.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The extent of the burden and risk associated with participation is expected to
      be low during this study. In total, 7 blood samples will be taken during this study (45ml, in
      total). During the primary (and possible secondary) surgical procedure, bone debris will be
      taken. Bone debris is usually discarded but will be used for analysis in this study. There is
      no extra surgical procedure necessary to obtain the bone debris.
