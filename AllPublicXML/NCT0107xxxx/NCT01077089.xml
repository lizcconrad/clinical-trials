  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients are often moved from their rooms to other hospital locations,
      particularly imaging facilities. For patients with traumatic brain injury, such movements may
      raise the risk of secondary brain injuries. The purpose of this study is to monitor brain
      injured patients during transport and to measure the resulting changes in intracranial
      pressure. This will allow for documentation of the frequency of secondary injury and help in
      understanding their causes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary insults, such as hypoxia and hypotension, may worsen a brain injury. We hypothesize
      that secondary brain insults may occur frequently during in-hospital transport in patients
      with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We additionally hypothesize that automated data collection
      devices used during transport could more reliably document the frequency of these events and
      help us to understand the causes. During transport of patients with TBI, intracranial
      pressure and arterial blood pressure will be continuously recorded to a monitor and saved for
      later analysis. Additional continuous measurements of pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon
      dioxide, and mechanical ventilation settings will be made. The study will identify patients
      at risk for secondary insults, the etiology of these insults, and assist in development of a
      road map to prevent future incidents.
