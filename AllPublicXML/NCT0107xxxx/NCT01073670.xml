  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following signed informed consent, patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were
      randomly assigned to one of 3 groups to be given acetaminophen, Indomethacin or a combination
      of both immediately following induction and then at 6, 12, 18 &amp; 24 hours following surgery.
      Our primary outcome measure was the amount of blood drained from the mediastinal tubes and
      chest drains. Secondary outcome measures included conventional blood coagulation indices as
      well as other measures of clotting as indicated by thromboelastography (TEG). Other secondary
      outcome measures included consumption of morphine equivalents and pain scores.

    <measure>Morphine equivalents required to provide effective analgesia</measure>
    <time_frame>perioperative period until 24 hours post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The milligram quantities of morphine or the equivalents of morphine administered (in addition to the acetaminophen, indomethacin or combination therapy) were recorded and compared between groups. This provided an indication of how effective each of our interventions were at providing pain relief.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>perioperative period until 24 hours post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Resting pain scores were recorded for all subjects at 6, 12 18 and 24 hours following surgery and compared between groups. These scores provided an indication as to the efficacy of each of our interventions at providing pain relief.</description>
