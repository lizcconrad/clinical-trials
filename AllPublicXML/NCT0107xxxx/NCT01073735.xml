  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will determine the psychometric adequacy of a newly developed
      instrument - Childhood Cancer Survivor Study Needs Assessment Questionnaire (CCSS-NAQ).
      Additionally, the study will explore the feasibility of selected study methods -- sample
      selection, length of time to complete recruitment, and response rates - in order to inform a
      larger national periodic survey of adult survivors' health related needs
    </textblock>

      This study will focus on the following primary and secondary objectives:

        1. Examine the construct validity, short-term stability, internal consistency and
           item-response performance of a health-related needs assessment self-report instrument
           for adult childhood cancer survivors

        2. Inform future sample stratification by over-sampling minority and rural-dwelling
           survivors to enhance the heterogeneity of the respondent pool;

        3. Describe the met and unmet health-related needs and their covariates in a large,
           stratified, random sample of childhood cancer survivors;

        4. Evaluate the sample selection methods, length of time to complete recruitment, and
           response rates in the study sample.
