  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project addresses the following hypotheses (A) the normal balance of beneficial
      and detrimental commensal intestinal bacteria is deranged in IBS, with selective alterations
      in clinically defined patient subsets i.e., diarrhea predominant IBS (D-IBS) and
      post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS); (B) these changes in intestinal microflora are associated with
      sub-clinical mucosal inflammation and activation of the mucosal immune system; and (C)
      activation of the mucosal immune system leads to alterations in gastrointestinal (GI)
      functions (i.e., motility and sensation) and functional symptoms.

    <textblock>
      There are two main aims in the research study. The first aim is to determine whether
      sub-clinical mucosal inflammation occurs in patients with D-IBS by identifying alterations in
      mucosal markers for inflammation (inflammatory cytokines and inflammation-related mediators).
      The second aim is to investigate whether the identifiable alterations in inflammatory markers
      are associated with specific abnormalities in intestinal motor and sensory functions that are
      relevant to the pathophysiology of IBS.

        This research plans to study 33 diarrhea predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome and
        IBS-mixed/alternators patients with current symptom activity (abdominal pain at least once
        a week in the past month) and 33 healthy controls. The subjects will be of any gender, race
        or ethnicity and at least 18 years of age. Recruitment for the proposed study takes
        advantage of an ongoing NIH-supported research study on the heterogeneity of IBS (NIDDK
        Grant DK 31369, WE Whitehead - PI, IRB#01-1397, GCRC# 1846) currently conducted at UNC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any sex, race, or ethnicity.

          -  At least 18 years of age (no upper age limit).

          -  D-IBS and M-IBS patients must meet Rome II criteria for IBS and must have been
             evaluated by a physician to exclude alternative diseases that could explain the
             symptoms. For the latter, patients' self statement is acceptable (by self-report, no
             official document is required).

          -  D-IBS and M-IBS subjects older than 50 years old must have had a colonoscopy in the
             past 5 years with a normal report. Hemorrhoids, diverticulosis and polyps are allowed.

          -  Participation in Dr. Whitehead's heterogeneity of IBS research study, or Dr. Ringel's
             Probiotic Pain Study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy controls must have no significant or recurring gastrointestinal symptoms.

          -  Patients and healthy controls should not have a serious, unstable medical condition.

          -  Patients and healthy controls must have had no gastrointestinal tract surgery other
             than appendectomy or cholecystectomy, or any abdominal surgery within the past 3
             months. Appendectomy and cholecystectomy are allowed if done more than 2 years ago and
             symptoms were not changed following the surgery.

          -  Pregnancy and breastfeeding (by self-report).

          -  No history of inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, or other diagnosis that
             could explain chronic or recurring bowel symptoms in IBS patients or controls (by
             self-report).

          -  Patients and controls should have no history of lactose malabsorption (by
             self-report).

          -  Patients and controls should have no history of clinical symptoms of acute infections
             during the last 8 weeks prior to enrollment in the study.

          -  Patients and controls should have no history of anti-inflammatory agents including
             aspirin, non-aspirin, non-steroid anti-inflammatory (NSAID), steroids, antibiotic, or
             probiotics treatment during the last 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study.

          -  Patients should not have an implanted or portable electro-mechanical medical device

             appointment for IBS-M subjects ONLY: In the past week, subject cannot have less than 3
             (0-2) bowel movements. Also, in the past week, subject cannot have hard/lumpy stools
             for 2 or more days.

        Only subjects with IBS may participate in the optional SmartPill testing. Subjects are
