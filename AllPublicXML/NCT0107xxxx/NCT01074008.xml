    <textblock>
      This study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of
      multiple oral doses of ABT-450/ritonavir (r), ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir), or ABT-072
      in hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype 1-infected, treatment-naïve adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2a, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in
      chronically, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected participants designed to explore the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity, as well as the evolution and
      persistence to resistance of ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072. Participants were treated with
      ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 monotherapy for 3 days, followed by 81 days (12 weeks minus 3
      days of monotherapy) of ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 combined with pegylated
      interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV), followed by 36 weeks of pegIFN/RBV alone. Participants
      randomized to an ABT-450/r treatment group who achieved rapid virologic response (RVR) and
      had HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels &lt; 25 IU/mL at all subsequent visits were eligible to
      stop pegIFN/RBV therapy on or after Week 24.

    <measure>Maximal Change From Baseline in Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV RNA) Levels During ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 Monotherapy Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to dosing on Day 1 to before the morning dose on Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma HCV RNA levels (reported as log10 IU/mL) were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay that had a lower limit of detection of 10 IU/mL and a lower limit of quantification of 25 IU/mL. The baseline value was the HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 1. The maximal change during monotherapy was the difference from baseline to the lowest log10 HCV RNA level anytime after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 through the last log10 HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 4. Data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

    <description>Baseline samples were analyzed for resistance-associated amino acid variants using population and clonal sequencing and were compared with the appropriate reference sequence (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Phenotypic resistance to ABT-450 at baseline was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) compared with the EC50 for the appropriate reference replicon (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Available samples at Day 4 with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL were analyzed for resistance-associated variants using population and clonal sequencing and were compared with the baseline sequences to assess amino acid changes. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-450 at Day 4 was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the EC50 compared with the EC50 for the corresponding baseline sample.

        <title>Maximal Change From Baseline in Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV RNA) Levels During ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 Monotherapy Treatment</title>
        <description>Plasma HCV RNA levels (reported as log10 IU/mL) were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay that had a lower limit of detection of 10 IU/mL and a lower limit of quantification of 25 IU/mL. The baseline value was the HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 1. The maximal change during monotherapy was the difference from baseline to the lowest log10 HCV RNA level anytime after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 through the last log10 HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 4. Data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

        <population>Participants received at least one dose of study drug (direct-acting antiviral agent) and have both baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement of HCV RNA levels during monotherapy treatment.</population>

        <title>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Ritonavir</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected immediately prior to morning dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and prior to dose on Day 2 (24 hours after Day 1 dose). The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ritonavir using validated analytical methods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax; measured in ng/mL) is the highest concentration that a drug achieves in the blood after administration in a dosing interval. The Cmax of ritonavir was estimated using non-compartmental methods and data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

        <title>Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of ABT-072</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected immediately prior to morning dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and prior to dose on Day 2 (24 hours after Day 1 dose). The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ABT-072 using validated analytical methods. The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax; measured in hours) is the time it takes for a drug to achieve Cmax. The Tmax of ABT-072 was estimated using non-compartmental methods and data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

        <description>Plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay that had a lower limit of detection of 10 IU/mL and a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU/mL. Complete EVR was defined as HCV RNA levels &lt; LLOQ (&lt; 25 IU/mL) at Week 12. Data are reported as the percentage of participants with cEVR.</description>

        <population>To be included in the efficacy analysis, participants received at least one dose of study drug (direct-acting antiviral agent) and have at least one post-baseline measurement of HCV RNA levels.</population>

        <description>Baseline samples were analyzed for resistance-associated amino acid variants using population and clonal sequencing and were compared with the appropriate reference sequence (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Phenotypic resistance to ABT-450 at baseline was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) compared with the EC50 for the appropriate reference replicon (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Available samples at Day 4 with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL were analyzed for resistance-associated variants using population and clonal sequencing and were compared with the baseline sequences to assess amino acid changes. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-450 at Day 4 was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the EC50 compared with the EC50 for the corresponding baseline sample.

        <title>Number of Participants With Resistance-Associated Variants and Phenotypic Resistance to ABT-072 in Non-structural Viral Protein 5B (NS5B)</title>
        <description>Baseline samples were analyzed for resistance-associated amino acid variants using population and clonal sequencing and were compared with the appropriate reference sequence (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Phenotypic resistance to ABT-072 at baseline was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) compared with the EC50 for the appropriate reference replicon (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Available samples at Day 4 with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL were analyzed for the presence of resistance-associated variants using population and clonal sequencing and were compared with the baseline sequences to assess amino acid changes. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-072 at Day 4 was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the EC50 compared with the EC50 for the corresponding baseline sample. The number of participants with variants at resistance-associated amino acid positions and phenotypic resistance are presented.</description>
