      To examine the effectiveness and clinical care outcomes of cognitive-behavioral therapy
      interventions at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioral interventions are the most widely studied and evidenced-based
      psychosocial treatment approaches for mental health and health related behavioral problems.
      Despite their documented efficacy, there is a scarcity of licensed mental health
      professionals who are available to treat patients with problems that would be amenable to
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). While CBT interventions have a strong base in terms of
      efficacy in randomized trials, effectiveness and dissemination studies are lacking in
      comparison, and hence, these interventions are not reaching the patients in most need of
      services. Complicating the problem further, insurance companies typically do not reimburse
      for services provided by trainees who are not licensed. This is a public mental health
      problem because it limits the degree to which CBT clinicians can be trained to deliver these
      treatments, and a particular problem at MGH because referring providers do not have a place
      to send their patient for CBT services, as trainees constitute a large portion of clinical
      staff. To address this issue, the current study seeks to document outcomes of CBT
      interventions delivered by credentialed but not licensed trainees. This information can be
      used to guide policy and reimbursement guidelines for trainees, as well as promote the
      ability to disseminate efficacious interventions. Information gained from this project will
      be used to provide feedback to insurance companies, licensing boards, and mental health
      community stakeholders regarding decision making re: reimbursement for care provided by
      supervised trainees. Additionally, this may be used as a pilot study for a comparative
      effectiveness study comparing trainees to licensed staff psychologists.

    <description>The Schwartz Outcome Scale (SOS-10) is designed to measure a broad domain of psychological health. It appears to be sensitive to change with treatment. So, we will be measuring whether the total score of this scale changes throughout treatment, i.e., whether the CBT interventions tend to improve psychological health.</description>

    <description>The participant will then undergo a structured clinical interview with a supervised psychology intern/fellow, which will take approximately 1-3 hours over the course of 1-3 sessions. The initial assessment will be followed by up to 24 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy tailored to their particular diagnosis (most diagnoses/problems require approximately 12 sessions, some require fewer, others require more). The length of treatment will depend on the primary diagnosis/ problem and the complexity and severity of the case. The clinician and patient will agree on a treatment plan after the initial evaluation, targeting a particular mental health or health related behavioral problem with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This treatment plan will include an agreed upon number of treatment sessions (up to 24).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting to the Behavioral Medicine Service are generally individuals with
             an acute or chronic medical condition or medically related concern with or without an
             associated DSM-IV psychiatric disorder, as well as adult patients who require
             assistance with changing health or health-risk behaviors. Patients presenting to the
             OCD program typically have obsessive compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder,
             Tourette syndrome, compulsive skin picking, or trichotillomania. Patients presenting
             to the general CBT program typically have panic disorder, social phobia, generalized
             anxiety disorder, depression, specific phobia, post traumatic stress disorder,
             attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or an eating disorder. Patients at any of
             the programs have an identifiable behavior or behavioral pattern/ mood problem that
             they would like to change.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exhibit active suicidality (suicidal ideation with intent or plan) to the point that

          -  Active untreated and unstable bipolar disorder (i.e. stable bipolar disorder under
             care of a psychiatrist is allowed).

          -  Psychosis.

          -  Mental retardation.
