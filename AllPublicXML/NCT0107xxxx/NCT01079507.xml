    <textblock>
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not a single disease, but a composite of heterogeneous
      subgroup. Accordingly, more sophisticated classification in ALL is essential to achieve
      further improvement of treatment outcomes. However, only a few genetic markers are revealed
      to have significant prognostic implications in ALL patients. The current study is designed to
      stratify the ALL patients according to their prognosis and to predict their outcomes by a
      pharmacogenetic approach. A predictive model will be generated from 130 genotypes in adult
      ALL patients diagnosed at the Samsung Medical Center (SMC), Sungkyunkwan University School of
      Medicine, Seoul,Korea between 1994 and 2008. The validation of the predictive model will be
      performed using an independent external cohort of ALL patients.

        1. Definition of the cohort: two hundred ALL patients from the SMC as a test set, another
           100 patients from the SMC as a first validation set, and another 150 independent
           external patients as second external validation set. DNAs will be extracted and stored
           from patients' samples collected at the time of diagnosis.

        2. In the test set, genotypes will be determined using a MALDI-TOF based platform
           (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) for 130 SNPs of the candidate genes involved in DNA
           repair pathway, drug metabolism/transport pathway and folate metabolism pathway.

        3. Bioinformatic analyses will be performed to identify around 13 genotypes (10%) having
           strongest predictive significance out of these 130 SNPs in terms of their treatment
           outcomes, drug toxicity and prognosis in the test set.

        4. These 13 genotypes will be validated in the first cohort of 100 ALL patients using a
           multivariate Cox's proportional hazard model.

        5. The predictive model will be built up based on Cox's proportional hazard model derived
           from 13 candidate genotypes and clinical risk factors.

        6. The predictive model based on pharmacogenetic information will be validated again in the
           second, independent external cohort of 150 ALL patients.

      Definite prognostic value was not established for genetic or molecular markers in acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) except BCR/ABL fusion gene. The current study attempts to build
      up a predictive model based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with pharmacogenetic
      approach using 130 genotypes in the multiple candidate pathways such as DNA repair pathway,
      drug metabolism / transport pathway and folate metabolism pathway. The predictive model based
      on SNPs will be generated and validated with respect to treatment outcomes, drug toxicity and
      prognosis in adult ALL patients.

      The present study will demonstrate that: 1) Pharmacogenetic information derived from SNPs
      involved in the DNA repair pathway, drug metabolism/transport pathway and folate metabolism
      pathway, is helpful to predict the treatment outcomes, drug toxicity and prognosis in ALL
      patients; 2) Predictive model derived from pharmacogenetic information will be effective and
      reasonable approach to stratify ALL patients according to their clinical outcomes; 3) The
      SNP-based predictive model could be reasonably applied to the treatment of ALL patients, thus
      becoming a basis for further improvement of treatment outcome; 4) Finally, this project will
      enhance and facilitate the pharmacogenetic research in the hematology area, thus make the
      team to lead the pharmacogenetic research in the world.
