  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of geriatric rehabilitation following an acute illness is rapid restoration of
      normal activity. The key elements are pain control, restoration of bowel functions, good
      sleep quality, appetite and general well-being, as well as return to pre illness physical
      capabilities. Emphasis has recently been placed on finding innovative multi-disciplinary
      methods that can improve the care of elderly people who had suffered an acute illness. The
      aim of this prospective study is to assess the effect of mind-body therapy(including guided
      imagery, relaxation techniques, mediation and touch therapy) as as an adjunct to medical and
      physical rehabilitation in geriatric patients.
