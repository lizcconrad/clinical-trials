  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic cardiomyopathies are a leading cause of death in both men and women. When a person
      has a heart attack, blood is unable to reach a certain area of the heart, and if the blood
      supply is not re-established quickly, that area of the heart can suffer permanent damage.
      While recovery from a heart attack can be managed through medications and lifestyle changes,
      these treatments can not reverse the all damage to the heart. Current research is focusing on
      the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to repair organs that have been
      irreversibly damaged by disease. A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem
      cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. This study will evaluate the safety of
      injecting MSCs directly into the heart to repair and restore heart function in people who
      have had a heart attack and who have chronic myocardial ischemia with heart failure.

      Mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow can differentiate into endothelial cells and
      participate in the development of new blood vessels in ischemic tissue. The aim of the study
      is in a phase I safety study to evaluate the clinical effect of autologous mesenchymal stem
      cell therapy in patients with severe chronic myocardial ischemia.10 patients with reversible
      ischemia on a SPECT will be treated with direct intramyocardial injections of autologous
      isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells.Clinical and objective evaluations will be
      performed at baseline and during 24 months follow-up.
