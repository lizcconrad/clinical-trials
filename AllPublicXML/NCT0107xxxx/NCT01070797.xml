    <textblock>
      Patient's on this protocol have a type of blood cell cancer, other blood disease or a genetic
      disease and have received a stem cell transplant. The donor of the stem cells was either a
      brother or sister, another relative, or a closely matched unrelated donor. The patient is
      being asked to participate in this study which tests if blood cells from the donor that have
      been grown in a special way, can prevent or be an effective treatment for early infection by
      three viruses - Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and adenovirus.

      Adenovirus is a virus that usually causes symptoms of a common cold, but can cause serious
      life-threatening infections in patients who have weak immune systems. It can affect the lungs
      and cause very serious pneumonia, and can also damage the gut, liver, pancreas and eyes.CMV
      can also cause serious infections in patients with weak or suppressed immune systems. It
      usually affects the lungs, causing a very serious pneumonia, but it can also affect the gut,
      the liver and the eyes. Approximately 2/3 of normal people harbor this virus in their body.
      In healthy people CMV rarely causes any problems because the immune system can keep it under
      control, but after a transplant, the risk of developing CMV disease is much higher because
      the immune system is so weak. EBV is the virus that causes glandular fever. It is also a life
      long infection like CMV that is normally controlled by the immune system. When immunity is
      weak, the virus can become active and cause fevers, enlarged lymph nodes and sometimes a type
      of cancer called lymphoma.

      Investigators want to see if a kind of white blood cell called T lymphocytes (T cells)can be
      used to prevent and treat adenovirus, CMV and EBV in the early stages of reactivation or
      infection. T cells have been grown from the patient's stem cell donor in the laboratory in a
      way that will train them to recognize the virus and control it when they are given after a
      transplant. This treatment with specially trained T cells (also called CTLs) has had activity
      against these viruses in previous studies and in this study investigators want to see if they
      still have activity when they are made in a simpler and faster way. These donor-derived
      multivirus-specific special cell lines are an investigational product not approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether donor-derived multivirus-specific special
      cell lines are safe and can control three viruses: EBV, CMV and adenovirus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood has been previously taken from the patient and the donor to make the cells.

      To make the special cell line, special blood cells called dendritic cells (DCs)were made
      first from the donor blood. Then, a specially produced gene called a plasmid that carries the
      adenovirus, CMV, and EBV genes was introduced into the dendritic cells. Dendritic cells with
      these new genes are then mixed with T cells to stimulate them. This stimulation trains the
      donor T cells to kill cells that are infected with CMV, EBV, and adenovirus. Once a
      sufficient numbers of T cells were made, they were tested to make sure they killed the
      patient's cells infected with these viruses, but not the patient's normal cells, and were
      frozen.

      If the donor has never been infected with CMV, the CTLs made for the patient may not have
      activity against a CMV infection. If these donor CTLs show no activity against CMV infection,
      the cells will not be given.

      The patient may receive Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Tylenol (acetaminophen). Then, the
      donor's special cells will be thawed and injected into the patient's intravenous line. After
      the patient receives the cells, the levels of these three viruses in the patient's blood will
      be monitored. Investigators will also take blood to see how long the T cells given to the
      patient are lasting in the patient's body.

      If the special cell infusion has helped the infection or if the patient has had a treatment
      (for example with steroid drugs) that might have destroyed the T cells that were given to
      them, then the patient is allowed to receive up to 2 more doses of the cells.

      The patient will continue to be followed by his/her transplant doctors after the injection.
      The patient will either be seen in the clinic or contacted by a research nurse to follow up
      for this study every week for 6 weeks then at 8 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months. The patient
      may have other visits for standard care.

      The patient will also have regular blood tests done to follow counts and the viral infection.
      To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body, up to an extra
      30-40 ml (6-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion and then at 1, 2, 4, 6,
      and 8 weeks and 3 months. Blood should come from the central intravenous line, and should not
      require extra needle sticks. Total time participation for this study will be 1 year.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be eligible following any type of allogeneic transplant to receive CTLs as
        prophylaxis or for early reactivations as defined below.

          1. Prior myeloablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
             using either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells.

          2. Prophylaxis for patients at risk of CMV, adenovirus or EBV infection (for Phase 2
             portion only). In the phase 1 portion patients must meet criteria in 3 below.

          3. Early treatment of reactivation or infection which is defined for each virus as below:

               1. CMV: CMV antigenemia is monitored at least weekly post transplant. Early
                  reactivation is defined at CMV antigenemia with less than 10 leucocytes positive.
                  If any patient develops CMV antigenemia (with greater than 10 leukocytes
                  positive) or clinical evidence of CMV infection (defined as the demonstration of
                  CMV by biopsy specimen from visceral sites (by culture or histology) either pre
                  or after CTL infusions, standard treatment with Ganciclovir, and/or Foscarnet and
                  Immunoglobulins will be initiated. Patients may receive CTLs for antigenemia or
                  elevated PCR without visceral infection.

               2. Adenovirus: Adenovirus infection will be defined as the presence of adenoviral
                  positivity as detected by PCR or culture from ONE site such as stool or blood or
                  urine or nasopharynx. Adenovirus disease will be defined as the presence of
                  adenoviral positivity as detected by culture from more than two sites such as
                  stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx. In patients who meet the criteria for
                  disease Cidofovir may be added unless the subject could not tolerate this agent
                  due to nephrotoxicity. Patients may receive CTLs for elevated PCR in blood or
                  stool.

               3. EBV EBV-LPD is defined according to recent guidelines as proven EBV-LPD defined
                  by biopsy or probable EBV-LPD defined as an elevated EBV DNA level associated
                  with clinical symptoms (adenopathy or fever or masses on imaging) but without
                  biopsy confirmation. Patients with EBV DNA reactivation only defined as EBV DNA
                  levels &gt; 1000 copies/ug may also receive CTLs on study. Patients with proven or
                  probable EBV-LPD should also receive Rituxan

          4. Early treatment may be given to eligible patients with a single or multiple
             infections. Patients with multiple infections with one reactivation and one controlled
             infection are eligible to enroll.

          5. Patient with a CMV seronegative donor may only receive CTLs for a CMV reactivation in
             the dose escalation phase if the line has activity against CMV.

          6. Clinical status at enrollment to allow tapering of steroids to less than 0.5 mg/kg/day
             prednisone.

          7. Karnofsky/Lansky score of 50 or greater

          8. ANC greater than 500/µL.

          9. Bilirubin 2x upper limit normal or less

         10. AST 3 x normal or less

         11. Serum creatinine 2 x upper limit normal or less

         12. HgB &gt;8.0

         13. Pulse oximetry of &gt; 90% on room air

         14. Available multi-virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes

         15. Negative pregnancy test in female patients if applicable (childbearing potential who
             have received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen).

         16. Written informed consent and/or signed assent line from patient, parent or guardian.

        DONOR ELIGIBILITY: The donor for the CTL product will be the same donor who donated the
        allogeneic product for the patient's transplant. These donors for allogeneic (i.e. HLA
        matched or mismatched related or unrelated) stem cell transplants will have fulfilled
        eligibility for and consented to stem cell donation as per the stem cell transplant
        program's standard operating procedures.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion Criteria for initial CTL and for subsequent infusions:

          1. Patients receiving ATG, or Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal
             antibodies within 28 days of screening for enrollment.

          2. Patients with other uncontrolled infections. For bacterial infections, patients must
             be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72
             hours prior to enrollment. For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive
             systemic anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week
             prior to enrollment.

             Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or
             new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to
             infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as
             progressing infection.

          3. Patients who have received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 28 days.

          4. Patients with active acute GVHD grades II-IV.

          5. Active and uncontrolled relapse of malignancy.
