      This study is designed to assess the incidence of cardiovascular events occurred within an 12
      month follow up period in type 2 diabetic patients with either high risk of cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) or history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of diabetes patients around the world has increased from 30 million in 1985 to the
      current 180 million, and is expected to grow to 366 million in 2025, with 75 percent
      occurring in developing countries such as India and China. In China, economic prosperity and
      changes in diet and lifestyles have resulted in steep increase in prevalence of overweight,
      obesity, and diabetes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk for both
      micro-and macrovascular complications, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common
      causes of death in these patients. Preventing the onset or the worsening of the
      cardiovascular diseases is thus one of the most important goals in managing type II diabetes.
      This study is designed to better understand the incidence of cardiovascular events under
      current patterns of treatment in type 2 diabetic patients with either 3 or more risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease such as older age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, etc, or existing or
      prior history of coronary artery disease and stroke. Approximately 1000 patients from major
      hospitals across several regions of China will be recruited for this study.
