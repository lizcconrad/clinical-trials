  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer usually begins in the endometrium, which is the tissue lining of the
      uterus. Endometrial cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gynaecological malignancy in
      Australia. It affects 1 in 80 Australian women and there are about 1400 new cases and 260
      deaths from the disease every year. Most affected women are aged between 50 and 70 years. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the possible role of the endocrine system in the
      regulation of human endometrial cancer. By looking at the laboratory results of people with
      endometrial cancer and also those without endometrial cancer we hope to gain a better
      understanding of how endometrial cancer develops and progresses. This may lead to the
      development of new, effective therapies for endometrial cancer.
