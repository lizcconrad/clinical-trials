      This trial will determine the pharmacokinetics of Posiphen® in both plasma and CSF after a
      10-day treatment period with Posiphen® in subjects with amnestic MCI. The effects of this
      treatment on biomarkers will also be determined in CSF, whole blood, and plasma or serum as
      primary pharmacodynamic (PD) objectives.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or post-menopausal females aged 55 to 80 years, inclusive.

          2. Must have Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (amnestic subtype) according to Petersen's
             criteria (2004).

          3. Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score should be ≥24.

          4. Must score below a pre-determined cut-off score on the logical memory II delayed
             paragraph recall sub-test of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised (WMS-R).

          5. Must have a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 with a memory box score of 0.5 or 1.0.

          6. Modified Hachinski score of less than or equal to 4.

          7. Hamilton Depression rating scale (HAMD17) score of less than or equal to 12 with a
             score of 0 on items 1, 2, and 3 (depressed mood, feelings of guilt, and suicidal
             ideation).

          8. No evidence of current suicidal ideation or previous suicide attempt in past 2 years
             as evaluated in the Columbia Suicidality Checklist.

          9. MRI scans within 12 months prior to screening, or per screening MRI, without evidence
             of infection, infarction, or other focal lesions and without clinical symptoms
             suggestive of intervening neurological disease.

         10. No clinically significant abnormalities in the lumbar spine should be present on a
             lumbar X-ray that would contraindicate lumbar puncture.

         11. Adequate visual and hearing ability (physical ability to perform all the study
             assessments).

         12. Normal B12, folic acid, and thyroid function tests (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH],
             free T4, and free T3).

         13. Do not require nursing home care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant neurologic disease other than amnestic MCI, or history of significant
             head trauma followed by persistent neurologic deficits or known structural brain
             abnormalities.

          2. Major depression, schizophrenia or another major psychiatric disorder as described in
             the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text
             Revision (DSM-IV-TR) within the past 2 years.

          3. Psychotic features, agitation, or behavioral problems within the last 3 months which
             could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol.

          4. History of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within the past 2 years.

          5. Subjects with any febrile illness within 1 week prior to the CSF collection.

          6. Subjects who have history of migraine headaches and any other type of headaches of at
             least moderate severity more than twice per month.

          7. Any significant systemic illness or unstable medical condition which could lead to
             difficulty complying with the protocol or pose potential risk to the subjects.

          8. Use of medications prohibited by the study.

          9. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.

         10. Subjects with infection or inflammation of the skin or skin disease at or in proximity
             to the lumbar puncture site.

         11. History of lumbar spine surgery or chronic low back pain (CLBP).
