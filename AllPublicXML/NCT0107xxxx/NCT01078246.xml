      Study participants contributed data to one or more of 3 cohorts: 1) Historical Cohort:
      HIV-infected participants treated with antiretroviral therapy in the course of ordinary
      clinical practice at the clinics and medical centers of Kaiser Permanente (KP) between 1
      January 2000 and 12 October 2007 (date of market authorization for raltegravir in USA), 2)
      Concurrent Cohort: HIV-infected participant treated with a new non-raltegravir antiretroviral
      therapy in the course of ordinary clinical practice at the clinics and medical centers of KP
      on or after 12 October 2007, and 3) Raltegravir Cohort: HIV-infected participant treated with
      raltegravir in the course of ordinary clinical practice at the clinics and medical centers of
      KP on or after 12 October 2007. Participants could contribute data to more than one cohort,
      but no overlap in follow-up time was allowed.

    <measure>Incidence of AIDS-defining and Non-AIDS-defining Malignancy</measure>
    <time_frame>Historical Cohort: up to 33 months (January 2005 to October 2007); Raltegravir and Concurrent Cohorts: up to 69 months (October 2007 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>All new malignancies occurring during the risk period, including Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-defining and non-AIDS-defining malignancies, were identified through the Kaiser Permanente cancer registries. The registry data was supplemented by the use of computer-stored records of outpatient visits, Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations to identify cancers that would not be captured through the cancer registries (e.g. cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma).The AIDS-defining malignancies reported for any cohort were invasive cervical cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Incidence is reported as unadjusted, crude rates.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Clinically Important Hepatic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Historical Cohort: up to 33 months (January 2005 to October 2007); Raltegravir and Concurrent Cohorts: up to 69 months (October 2007 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatic events occurring during the risk period were identified through computer-stored records of laboratory values, outpatient visits, Emergency Department visits, and hospitalizations. Significant hepatic events were identified based on algorithms utilizing a combination of diagnoses, procedures, and laboratory results. Incidence is reported as unadjusted, crude rates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Clinically Important Skin Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Historical Cohort: up to 33 months (January 2005 to October 2007); Raltegravir and Concurrent Cohorts: up to 69 months (October 2007 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>Significant skin events (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) occurring during the risk period were identified through the use of computer-stored records of outpatient visits, Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations. The identification of potential significant skin events was based on algorithms utilizing a combination of diagnoses, procedures and/or medications. Surveillance of outpatient visits was limited to rashes coded as drug-related and requiring use of steroid (e.g. prednisone) administration. Incidence is reported as unadjusted, crude rates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Clinically Important Muscle Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Historical Cohort: up to 33 months (January 2005 to October 2007); Raltegravir and Concurrent Cohorts: up to 69 months (October 2007 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>Significant muscle events (e.g. rhabdomyolysis) occurring during the risk period were identified through the use of computer-stored records of laboratory values, outpatient visits, Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations. The identification of potential significant muscle events was based on algorithms utilizing a combination of diagnoses, procedures and/or laboratory results for creatinine kinase. The number of muscle events did not meet the threshold for statistical analysis per protocol. Incidence is reported as unadjusted, crude rates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Lipodystrophy</measure>
    <time_frame>Historical Cohort: up to 33 months (January 2005 to October 2007); Raltegravir and Concurrent Cohorts: up to 69 months (October 2007 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>Lipodystrophy (e.g. lipoatrophy, facial wasting) occurring during the risk period was identified through the use of computer-stored records of outpatient visits, Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations. The identification of potential lipodystrophy was based on two coded diagnoses codes indicative of lipodystrophy appearing at least 6 months apart over the course of patient care, the identification of interventions to treat such conditions (e.g. sculptra therapy), or procedural codes for Computerized Tomography indicating incident neck or abdominal lipoaccumulation. Incidence is reported as unadjusted, crude rates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Clinically Important Cardiovascular Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Historical Cohort: up to 33 months (January 2005 to October 2007); Raltegravir and Concurrent Cohorts: up to 69 months (October 2007 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>Significant cardiovascular events occurring during the risk period were identified through the use of computer-stored records and defined as inpatient events based on algorithms that utilize a combination of diagnosis and/or procedure codes. The identification of potential significant cardiovascular events was based on the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) which include acute myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, unstable angina, revascularization (e.g. percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG)), and cardiovascular death. Incidence is reported as unadjusted, crude rates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of All-cause Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Historical Cohort: up to 33 months (January 2005 to October 2007); Raltegravir and Concurrent Cohorts: up to 69 months (October 2007 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>All-cause mortality occurring during the risk period was identified through the use of computer-stored records of Emergency Department visits, hospitalizations, and state death certificates. Deaths were identified from administrative Kaiser Permanente databases, including Kaiser Permanente regional research and respective state(s) mortality files as well as the Social Security Administrative files. Incidence is reported as unadjusted, crude rates.</description>

        <description>All new malignancies occurring during the risk period, including Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-defining and non-AIDS-defining malignancies, were identified through the Kaiser Permanente cancer registries. The registry data was supplemented by the use of computer-stored records of outpatient visits, Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations to identify cancers that would not be captured through the cancer registries (e.g. cutaneous Kaposi’s sarcoma).The AIDS-defining malignancies reported for any cohort were invasive cervical cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

        <title>Incidence of Lipodystrophy</title>
        <description>Lipodystrophy (e.g. lipoatrophy, facial wasting) occurring during the risk period was identified through the use of computer-stored records of outpatient visits, Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations. The identification of potential lipodystrophy was based on two coded diagnoses codes indicative of lipodystrophy appearing at least 6 months apart over the course of patient care, the identification of interventions to treat such conditions (e.g. sculptra therapy), or procedural codes for Computerized Tomography indicating incident neck or abdominal lipoaccumulation. Incidence is reported as unadjusted, crude rates.</description>
