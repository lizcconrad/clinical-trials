    <textblock>
      The objective of this phase I study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      combination therapy of paclitaxel and everolimus in small cell lung cancer patient with
      previous treatment history.

    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% to 20% of all lung cancer, and more than half
      of these patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease (ED). SCLC is a particularly
      aggressive form of lung cancer with a tendency for rapid tumor growth, early dissemination
      and high frequency of the metastasis In this study, we evaluate the MTD of everolimus
      combined with paclitaxel combination chemotherapy in SCLC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer

          2. Regarding a limited disease, the disease in a patient, who had concurrent
             chemoradiation therapy before, is relapsed or progressing, the patient should have

             progressing/relapsed during or after the previous treatment.

          3. Regarding an extensive disease, the progression/relapse of the disease during or after
             the first line platinum-based anticancer therapy should be confirmed.
