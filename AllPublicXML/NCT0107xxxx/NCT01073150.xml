      Patients with clinical diagnosis of chronic blepharitis were included in this study. A check
      list of symptoms and an ophthalmologic examination including best corrected visual acuity and
      biomicroscopy were performed.

      Under a slit lamp visualization, three lashes with cylindrical dandruff of each eyelid were
      epilated by fine forceps. The lashes were immersed in fluorescein dye and examined under a
      light microscope at a 20-times magnification. The mites were detected based on its
      morphological characteristics and movement.

      The patients with chronic blepharitis who had Demodex were randomly divided in two groups.
      The treatment group was prescribed lid hygiene with Tea Tree Oil shampoo 0.25% and ointment
      5% daily and Tea Tree Oil oily solution 50% once a week - produced by Ophthalmos, S達o Paulo.
      The control group used the same posology of placebo similar products.

      After six weeks, all subjects underwent the initial clinical and laboratory examination. The
      symptoms and the quantity of mites (mites/eye) were compared before and after the treatment
      in both groups.
