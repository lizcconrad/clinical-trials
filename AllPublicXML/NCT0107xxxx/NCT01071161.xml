    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of azithromycin to produce a
      significant change in the cough-related health status, measured with the Dutch version of the
      Leicester Cough Questionnaire in patiÃ«nts with COPD gold classification 2-4 and chronic
      productive coughing.

      This study is a prospective double-centre, double blind randomised trial. Patients &gt; 40 years
      of age, referred to our outpatient clinic with chronic cough and sputum production due to
      COPD will be recruited after informed consent is obtained.

      Consenting patients will be randomises to a 12-week treatment with 250 mg azithromycin three
      times a week or placebo.

      Before randomisation all patients have to fill in the SF 36 , SGRQ and the Dutch version of
      the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) for assessment of the baseline quality of life and
      the disease specific quality of life.

      The LCQ questionnaires will be performed at the beginning and every 3 weeks afterwards until
      18 weeks, except the second LCQ which will be filled in after 2 weeks. Scores from this
      questionnaire will be used to calculate the 2-week repeatability. The SF 36 and SGRQ will be
      performed at the start of the study and after 12 weeks. Adverse events will be recorded
      during the whole treatment period. After 2 and 12 weeks a Global Rating of Change will be
      performed. This questionnaire will be used to validate the LCQ in COPD patients.

      Randomisation will take place using a computer allocation program (BAMI-computer)

      Azithromycin and placebo will be provided by Teva Pharmaceuticals. Placebo and azithromycin
      will be identical in appearance and packaging.
