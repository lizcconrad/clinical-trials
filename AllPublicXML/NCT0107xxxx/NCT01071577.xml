  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be grown from bone marrow provided by healthy
           volunteers. Volunteer bone marrow donors for BMSCs are generally required to meet the
           same healthy history and infectious disease marker screening criteria as volunteer blood
           donors. BMSCs are being used to treat a number of immune system and cardiovascular
           disorders, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), heart disease, and vascular
           disease. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center is interested in collecting
           bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy volunteers to produce clinical-grade
           BMSCs to treat Clinical Center patients.

        -  This study will also collect bone marrow from autologous donors (donors who will later
           receive their own BMSCs) for further treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To collect bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy subjects and autologous donors
      in order to produce BMSCs.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are either healthy volunteers or individuals who
      will need to receive their own BMSCs.

      Design:

        -  Prospective healthy volunteers will be asked a series of questions designed to identify
           exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C, or other
           transfusion-transmitted diseases. A blood sample will be collected and tested for the
           abovementioned diseases and for other problems that may prevent bone marrow donation.

        -  Prospective autologous donors will also have blood tests to evaluate their own
           suitability for bone marrow donation.

        -  Eligible participants will be scheduled to provide a marrow aspirate/biopsy, taken from
           the upper part of the thigh bone, using standard bone marrow donation techniques.

        -  The collected bone marrow will be processed into BMSCs at the National Institutes of
           Health.

      Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be grown from bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, and
      are being used to treat a number of disorders including: graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),
      ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of
      this protocol is to collect bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy volunteers to
      produce clinical grade BMSCs to treat Clinical Center patients and to develop new methods for
      producing and assessing the quality of BMSCs. In some cases, the donors will be the
      recipients of the ex vivo expanded cells (autologous transplantation). In other cases, no
      matching of HLA or other antigens is required between the marrow donor and the BMSC
      recipient, so the donors will be required to meet the same healthy history and infectious
      disease marker screening criteria as volunteer blood donors. The BMSCs will be produced in
      the GMP Clinical Cell Processing Laboratory, located in the Cell Processing Section (CPS),
      Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM), Clinical Center. After the BMSCs are produced by
      the Cell Processing Laboratory, they will be infused directly into Clinical Center patients
      on protocol, or cryopreserved and stored, and used as they are needed to treat Clinical
      Center patients. Up to 250 subjects will be enrolled in this study. This protocol will
      provide a mechanism for banking fresh and frozen BMSC products that can be used for patient
      care and research. This is not a treatment protocol. Subjects receiving these BMSC products
      will be enrolled in specific BMSC treatment protocols.
