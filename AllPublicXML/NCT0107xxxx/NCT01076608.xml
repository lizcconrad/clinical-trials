  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are, along with cancer, the most frequent causes for mortality and
      morbidity in the industrialized nations. Numerous clinical efficient approaches to reduce the
      known risk factors have been introduced in clinical routine care; yet with quite limited
      success, e.g. modification of behavioral risk factors, drug treatment and the combination of
      both. On the population level only marginal changes have been demonstrated, i.e. the
      mortality from myocardial infarction and stroke remains high.

      To answer questions about underlying factors, for this unsatisfactory status, we might profit
      tremendously from studies that examine the situation, where treatment of patients most
      frequently take place: in primary care. This approach pays attention to the General
      Practitioner's (GP) in their gate keeping function in health care. Information from primary
      care in particular is largely lacking as recently stated by the &quot;Sachverständigenrat für die
      konzertierte Aktion im Gesundheitswesen&quot; in 2001. The DETECT study has been designed to
      address these critical issues.

      On 16th and 18th September 2003, 3,188 GPs completed a standardised assessment of the
      diagnostic and therapeutic profile of 55,518 unselected consecutive patients. All patients
      completed a questionnaire on their demographic data, their complaints, their illness history,
      their knowledge about selected diseases and their attitude towards those. A sub sample of
      7,519 patients additionally attended a standardized laboratory screening program. In this
      screening the focus was on blood constituents connected with cardiovascular diseases and
      diabetes, including e. g. cholesterol, lipoproteins, triglycerides and HbA1c. These patients
      were assessed a second time in the follow up period after one year in 2004 and for a final
      time after completion of the five-year follow-up period.

      What kind of information will DETECT provide?

      I. From the cross sectional part (descriptive epidemiological part on 16th/18th September
      2003)

        -  Frequency, characteristics and severity of cardiovascular diseases, selected associated
           metabolic syndromes and atherosclerotic diseases and syndromes

        -  Identification and determination of the proportion of patients with high-risk
           constellations (e.g., post myocardial infarction, associated morbidities, laboratory
           measures)

        -  Rates of General Practitioners recognition, diagnostic and therapeutic profiles

        -  Assessment of quality of care (comparison with guidelines)

        -  Indicators of undertreatment, overtreatment and inadequate treatment

      II. From the longitudinal part

      Changes of laboratory parameters and diagnoses after one and five years, in relation to:

        -  Initial diagnostic and therapeutic status

        -  Selected intervention criteria

        -  Composition of risk indicators, and comparison with existing indices (PROCAM,
           Framingham, Score etc.)

        -  Measurement of frequency and point of critical outcomes e.g., myocardial infarction,
           associated morbidity, hospitalisation, critical medical interventions

        -  Significance of established and &quot;new&quot; cardiovascular risk factors

        -  Prognostic value of biomarkers for risk stratification
