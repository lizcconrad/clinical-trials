  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A majority of women with breast cancer receive radiation therapy, and many of them experience
      the debilitating side effects of fatigue and insomnia. There is a need for an effective
      treatment that could ameliorate these symptoms and improve quality of life in the radiation
      therapy population.

      The primary purpose of the proposed research is to study the impact of massage therapy as a
      tool for the management of fatigue and insomnia experienced by women diagnosed with breast
      cancer and receiving radiation therapy.

      The secondary purpose is to explain, at the biochemical level, the effect of therapeutic
      massage on the level of fatigue and insomnia in radiation therapy patients. Prior studies
      have shown an association between fatigue and insomnia in the breast cancer patient following
      radiation therapy and the presence of inflammation as evidenced by increased proinflammatory
      cytokine production. The investigators hypothesize that therapeutic massage will ameliorate
      the symptoms of fatigue and insomnia associated with radiation therapy, and will be
      associated with a reduction in the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6),soluble IL-6
      receptor (sIL-6R/CD126), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). This reduction in proinflammatory
      biomarkers will be due to the activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via the
      activation of the vagus nerve.
