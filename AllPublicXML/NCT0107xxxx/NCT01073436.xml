  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML)
      previously treated with interferon-alpha (IFN) and presently on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (TKI) (imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, or nilotinib) with achievement of a complete cytogenetic
      and at least a major molecular remission, are able to discontinue therapy and maintain a
      durable remission. Relapse-free survival (RFS) rate at 1 year after discontinuation of TKI
      will be the measurement of this objective.

        Diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic
             myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.

          2. Patients must have received prior therapy with interferon-alpha for their CML, for a
             period of at least 2 years, and achieved at least a partial cytogenetic response on
             this therapy, defined as 1% - 34% Ph+ cells in metaphase, present in the bone marrow.

          3. Patients must be actively receiving treatment for their CML with a TKI (imatinib
             mesylate, dasatinib, nilotinib). If patients are receiving dasatinib or nilotinib,
             this can only be for reasons other than imatinib-resistant CML.

          4. Patients must have an ongoing complete hematologic response (CHR) on a TKI, defined as
             follows:

               -  WBC ≤ 10 x 109/L.

               -  Platelet count &lt; 450,000 x 109/L.

               -  No blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood.

               -  No evidence of disease-related symptoms and extramedullary disease, including the
                  liver and spleen.

          5. Patients must have a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) on a TKI for a minimum of
             one year leading up to enrollment. Complete cytogenetic response is defined as 0% Ph+
             cells in metaphase, in the bone marrow and/or a negative peripheral blood FISH
             analysis for the BCR/ABL gene fusion, and an ongoing CCyR must be confirmed by bone
             marrow aspirate cytogenetics and/or peripheral blood FISH for BCR/ABL within 4 weeks
             of discontinuing therapy.

          6. Patients must have at least a major molecular remission on a TKI for a minimum of 1
             year, present on 2 consecutive analyses, performed at least 3 months apart, in the 6
             to 12 months leading up to enrollment. Major molecular remission is defined as ≥ 3 log
             reduction from a standard baseline value (equivalent to a BCR-ABL/ABL of ≤ 0.1%) in
             BCR/ABL transcript by quantitative RT-PCR performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow
             aspirate. Complete molecular remission is defined as a negative quantitative RT-PCR
             (QPCR) analysis for BCR/ABL, present on 2 consecutive analyses, performed at least 3
             months apart, in the 6 to 12 months leading up to enrollment.

          7. Patients must be eighteen years of age or older

          8. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Appendix 13.1)

          9. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and standard
             alternative therapy. All patients must sign and give written informed consent in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had prior progression of their CML to accelerated phase or blast
             crisis.

          2. Patients who have previously undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

          3. Patients receiving dasatinib or nilotinib due to a prior history of imatinib-resistant
             CML.

          4. Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
             potentially unreliable.
