  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative active warming is usually performed by skin warming. There are several
      forced-air systems on the market; forced air warming is generally described as the most
      effective yet feasible method of patient warming.

      Augustine Biomedical (Eden Prairie, MN, USA) recently introduced a new patient warming system
      named &quot;Hot Dog&quot; with an active polymer warming upper-body blanket and a new under-body
      warming mattress. The polymer-heating devices consist of an electronic regulator and the
      polymer blankets, which are covered with a washable fabric. Conventional mains power the
      system. The manufacturer claims, that the new system &quot;Hot Dog&quot; (with combination of under
      body and upper body warming) is as effective as forced air warming, while not having any
      disadvantages of the forced air system, like: airborne infection, noise, high power
      consumption and hard-to-clean hose.

      The investigators will compare the new Hot Dog patient warming device combination (under body
      + upper body) with the established warming system, which blows warm air via a mattress over
      the body of the patients).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will study 40 patients (18-90 years) undergoing elective orthopedic
             lower limb surgery at the trauma surgery unit. The patients must have normal weight
             (20-30 BMI), the duration of surgery should last between 2 - 3 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There will be no other exclusion criteria (except severe peripheral arterial disease
             in the warmed extremity), as forced air patient warming is routinely used for all
             patients during this procedure.
