    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the molecular modulatory effect of Sunitinib when given in
      a neoadjuvant setting prior to radical or partial nephrectomy. The study will evaluate
      aforementioned outcomes in 30 patients at a dose of 50mg/day for 4 weeks followed by surgery
      2-4 weeks following the last dose.
