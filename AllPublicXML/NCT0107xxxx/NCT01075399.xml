      This pilot phase II study is designed as a test and retest study to investigate [F 18]HX4 as
      a reliable non-invasive PET imaging marker for detection of tumor hypoxia regions and to
      establish a threshold for [F 18]HX4 uptake in the tumor. The study will evaluate the
      relationship between hypoxia biomarkers (HIF1α and CA-IX) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
      tumor uptake of [F 18]HX4 by PET imaging.

      A Pilot Phase II Study

      The primary objectives for this study are:

        -  To test the reproducibility of [F-18] HX-4 uptake in tumors by imaging the same patient
           on sequential days in a test-retest protocol

        -  To test and confirm the relationship between hypoxia in tumors measured by hypoxia
           related biomarkers (HIF1α and CA-IX) with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and regional [F-18
           HX-4] uptake in tumors with PET/CT.

      The secondary objectives for this study are:

        -  To continue safety evaluation by the collection of safety data from all patients

        -  To establish the threshold for hypoxia uptake in [F- 18]HX4 PET imaging

        -  To collect data to test [F-18]HX4 PET imaging as a predictor of response in a subgroup
           of patients receiving treatment

        -  To gain experience with [F-18]HX4 PET/CT in order to improve the study design to conduct
           future studies

      Design: An open label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, single group assignment, pilot efficacy
      study

      Procedures: Informed consent, collection of demographic information, medical history, blood
      labs, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, two or three sets of [F-18]HX4 dosing and
      imaging scans including two pretreatment, and one mid-treatment if [F-18]HX4 tumor/background
      ratio ≥ 1.3 from pre-treatment scans, one pre-treatment [F-18]FDG, one mid-treatment if [F-
      18]HX4 tumor/background ratio ≥1.3 from pre-treatment scans, concomitant medication
      collection, adverse event monitoring, and assessment of tumor response to treatment

      Patients: Approximately forty (40) patients who have diagnosis confirmed by histopathological
      examination of tumor tissue from head/neck, lung, liver, rectal or cervical cancers and will
      receive chemotherapy, radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy. This allows for approximately
      30 evaluable patients to complete this study at approximately six sites.

    <description>Primary tumor uptake of [F 18]HX4 was measured on PET images by onsite radiologist or nuclear medicine physician for 1st and 2nd PET scans. Values measured were: SUV (Standard Uptake Value), SUV Max (Maximum standard uptake value), SUV Mean (Mean standard uptake value), and T/B ratio (Tumor to background ratio). Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for each of the parameter.</description>

        <title>Reproducibility of [F18]HX4 PET Imaging in Measuring Hypoxia in Tumors</title>
        <description>Primary tumor uptake of [F 18]HX4 was measured on PET images by onsite radiologist or nuclear medicine physician for 1st and 2nd PET scans. Values measured were: SUV (Standard Uptake Value), SUV Max (Maximum standard uptake value), SUV Mean (Mean standard uptake value), and T/B ratio (Tumor to background ratio). Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for each of the parameter.</description>
        <time_frame>Time between 1st and 2nd scan was 1 to 6 days</time_frame>
