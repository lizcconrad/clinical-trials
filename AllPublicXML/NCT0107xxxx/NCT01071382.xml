    <textblock>
      Increasing air travel has resulted in a significant increase in aeromedical evacuation over
      the past decade. However there is only a small amount of epidemiological data available on
      the diagnosis, costs and transport characteristics of aeromedical evacuation cases. In the
      present study Cases of aeromedical evacuation by a relief organization (Workers' Samaritan
      Federation Germany) were analyzed based on the following criteria: age, sex and diagnosis of
      the patient, ventilation mode, days of illness before transport, type of transport, flight
      routes, flying time, flight distance, type of aircraft, type and distance of connecting
      transport from the destination airport to the final hospital, total cost per repatriation,
      and costs per flight-minute of each transport type.
