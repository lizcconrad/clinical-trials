    <measure>Time-weighted Sum of Pain Relief Rating and Pain Intensity Difference From 0-3 Hours (SPRID 0-3) for Ibuprofen Sodium Versus Placebo Tablet</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID:time-weighted sum of pain relief rating combined with pain intensity difference (PRID) over 3 hours. SPRID score range:-3 (worst) to 21 (best) for SPRID 0-3. PRID: sum of pain intensity differences (PID) and pain relief rating(PRR) at each time point. PRID score range: -1=worst to 7=best. PID: baseline pain severity score minus pain severity score at a given time point (score range 0=none to 3=severe; baseline score range 2=moderately severe to 3=severe). Total score range for PID: -1(worst) to 3 (best). PRR:assessed on 5-point pain relief rating scale (0=No relief to 4=Complete relief).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Meaningful Relief for Ibuprofen Sodium Versus Ibuprofen (Motrin IB) Tablet</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated the time to meaningful relief by stopping a second stopwatch labeled 'meaningful relief' at the moment the participant first began to experience meaningful relief. It was also considered achieved if the participant stated &quot;meaningful relief&quot; at the time the first stopwatch was depressed. Stopwatch was active up to 3 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered.</description>
