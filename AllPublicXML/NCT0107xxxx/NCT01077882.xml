  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      'OnderHUIDs' is an educational program (Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Gent)
      for patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. We want to stimulate the patient to
      actively participate in their therapeutic approach by enhanced self care. We call the
      hypothesis that this program will help the patients learn to cope with their disease and to
      be loyal to their treatment, which will result in a better quality of life, better clinical
      outcome and cost effectiveness.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effectiveness of a novel educational program on the quality of life and the clinical outcome.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks, after 6 and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Therefore quality of life questionnaires are completed at the beginning of the program, at the end of the program (12 weeks), after 6 months and after 9 months. The quality of life questionnaires are Daily life quality index, Skindex 29, EuroQol -5D, Short Form - 36 , Psoriasis disability index, Quality of Life Index for Atopic Dermatitis.
The clinical effectiveness is determined by measuring psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) or scoring atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) at the beginning of the program, at the end of the program (12 weeks), after 6 months and after 9 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression severity</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks, 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a self-completed questionnaire with 21 questions. It is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring depression severity. BDI scores are collected during the four study visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lifestyle</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks, 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are queried for changes in smoking behaviour and physical activity monthly. Also, stress is examined during the four study visits,therefore we use the Everyday Problem Checklist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical consumption and cost-effectiveness evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks, 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medical therapy of patients is divided into: topical therapy, systemic therapy, combination of topical and systemic therapy or no therapy. Patients are asked for changes in medical therapy monthly. Also, medical consumption is followed: costs for medication and doctor visits related to the management of the skin disease. EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaires are used as standardised instrument to measure health outcomes. For cost-utility analysis, gain in quality-adjusted life years utilities is plotted against time, using the area under the curve approach (cost in EUR/EQ-5D gain).</description>
