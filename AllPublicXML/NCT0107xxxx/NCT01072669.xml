  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a drug called ambrisentan,
      approved by the FDA for use in pulmonary hypertension (a condition where there is increased
      pressure in the right side of the heart) in scleroderma patients, to see if this medicine may
      be beneficial in relieving and/or preventing Raynaud's flares in you and other patients like
      you. This medicine may have some short-term and long-term benefits in persons with
      scleroderma

      Baseline screening-we will screen you with a baseline review of your history, medications and
      lab values and you will need to get blood drawn for hemoglobin level, liver function panel
      and blood pregnancy test for females in child bearing age group. Women are advised strongly
      to use 2 reliable forms of contraception while in this study unless you have had tubal
      ligation or intrauterine device placement.

      You are advised to stop taking medications like nitrates (like nitroglycerin), calcium
      channel blockers (like nifedipine or amlodipine), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
      (like lisinopril or enalapril or captopril), angiotensin receptor blockers (like valsartan or
      candesartan) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (like Viagra or Revatio) at least 1 week prior
      to you coming for the first visit for the study and abstain from them during study period
      unless absolutely necessary.

      Please avoid caffeine, smoking and over the counter cold remedies at least 2 days prior to
      the first visit and during the study period.

      You will be asked to go to the Clinical Research Unit( CRU) located on M 51 in Cleveland
      Clinic main campus to partake in the study and will go back there for subsequent visits at 1
      week and then at 12 weeks after having started the study.

      This is a placebo-controlled randomized trial where 15 patients will get the active
      medication and the other 5 will get a placebo (pill with no active ingredient but not harmful
      to you in any way). This means you have a 3 in 4 (75%) chance of getting the active
      medication (ambrisentan) versus the placebo- both pills will look exactly the same. This
      process is called &quot;randomization&quot; and is similar to flipping a coin. The patients getting the
      active medication versus placebo will be randomly selected by the computer; the medications
      will be distributed by the central pharmacy and sent to the nurses on CRU and given to you on
      your first visit to the CRU. No one will know who received the active medication versus the
      placebo till the study ends and the data is analyzed.

      Those getting the active medicine ambrisentan will initially get a dose of 5mg by mouth daily
      and then the dose will be increased to 10mg by mouth daily after 4 weeks if the medicine is
      well tolerated. This will be done by the computer for randomization/selection and the
      pharmacist for drug dispensing. If you experience any side effects, please contact us for
      further advice. You will be evaluated each visit by the nurses at weeks 0, 1 and 12 for any
      drug related problems. We will be monitoring the routine scheduled blood work results to make
      sure you do not develop any drug related problems which can be detected on blood work.

      A machine called the 'Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging' machine will be used at each of your
      visits to the CRU at weeks 0, 1 and 12. This machine uses simple laser beams and will scan
      the top part of your non-dominant hand (the left hand for most people) to measure the blood
      flow through the blood vessels there when your hand is at room temperature (around 77'F) and
      when it has been cooled to 50'F for 2 minutes with the help of a cold flask. This is a safe
      and simple technique and does not involve any radiation exposure.

      You will also be asked to fill out 3 questionnaires at each of visits (week 0, 1 and 12) to
      the CRU-these have some simple questions regarding your degree of pain, severity of Raynaud's
      symptoms and the effect of scleroderma in your day-to-day functioning.

      Please budget at least 1-2 hours for your initial visit (week 0) to the CRU and then 1 hour
      for your visits at 1 week and 12 weeks to the CRU.

    <description>Subjects will receive ambrisentan 5 mg orally once daily or identical placebo pills for the first 4 weeks and then increased to ambrisentan 10mg once daily[if the lower dose is tolerated] or identical placebo pills for the rest of the study. They will be instructed to take the 5mg/pink pills for 4 weeks and then switch to 10mg /red pills unless they are having any drug related side effects or concerns. There will be no routine visit planned at 4 weeks to assess drug tolerance unless a complication arises. Adherence to treatment will be assessed by pill counting at each follow up visit. Follow up digital blood flow measurements will be obtained with LDPI at 1 week and at 3 months, where the same protocol (as that in the initial visit) will be followed.</description>

          <description>Change in digital micro-vascular flow measured by LDPI in patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) and digital ischemia secondary to SSc at 1 week and 12 weeks</description>
          <population>Assuming a standard deviation of 0.40, and use of a two-sample t-test with significance level of 0.05, there will be 80% power to detect differences in the change from baseline of at least 0.65 units if moderate correlation (r=0.50) exists, and 0.45 units if strong correlation (r=0.75) exists between treated</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Small sample size and short duration of study Some patients had hand contractures which made the LDPI images somewhat inaccurate Could not adjust for all variables in final analysis Placebo effect reflected in patient responses to questionnaires</limitations_and_caveats>
