  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that Depakote will be better tolerated then lithium in treating African
      Americans with bipolar disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 14 week randomized open study of 50 inpatients or outpatients with bipolar I r II.
      African American subjects will receive lithium or depakote ER. Measures will be made of
      psychopathology, reported side effects, and study completers. Measures will also be made of
      RBC/plasma lithium to determine if this level is better predictive of lithium tolerability.
