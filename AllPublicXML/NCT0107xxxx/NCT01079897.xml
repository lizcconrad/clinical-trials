      This study evaluates the efficacy of the topical used ectoine-formulation EHK02-01 compared
      to Atopiclair. Patients are examined at visit 2 (baseline visit). The patient topically
      applies EHK02-01 or Zarzenda® twice daily on two symmetric lesional areas over 28 days.
      Response to therapy is recorded at each visit.
