      Background: studies have demonstrated the crucial role of clinical pharmacists as integrated
      part of heath care team. Not only in Jordan but also in the Middle East region, clinical
      pharmacy practice is not well established. This current study is the first to evaluate
      physicians - pharmacists' collaborative approach to uncontrolled blood pressure in Jordan and
      the Middle East.

      Objective: this study aimed to evaluate clinical pharmacists' role in the management of
      uncontrolled hypertensive patients in Jordan. Design: single blinded randomized controlled
      clinical trial. Patients: 253 patients with uncontrolled hypertension specified as higher
      blood pressure readings than the recommended goals by the seventh report of the Joint
      National Committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure
      (JNC VII) at the time of enrollment.

      Interventions: patients were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group: 130 and
      123 patients, respectively. Patients in both arms were followed up for 6 months. In the
      intervention group, patients were managed by physician-clinical pharmacist team. In the
      control group, patients were managed by physician(s) only and were not provided
      pharmaceutical care services.
