  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a common disease worldwide. Increasing evidence is demonstrating that
      colorectal cancers arise from 'cancer stem cells.' Stem cells in the colon reside at the
      bottom of thousands of microscopic crypts throughout the wall of the colon. They create all
      the cells lining the bowel wall. These cells are created in the base of the crypt and ascend
      to the top acquiring the characteristics of mature cells of the bowel wall as they ascend.

      It is now thought that colorectal cancer cells arise from stem cells where the genetic
      material regulating growth and division of the stem cell has become defective. This leads to
      unregulated production of cells which in turn have defective genetic information and cancer
      formation.

      Prior studies have demonstrated that the earliest changes before a cancer develops are
      changes in cellular proliferation. Now that reliable markers to identify stem cells have been
      found, the researchers aim to investigate stem cell numbers and changes in distribution in
      those at normal risk of colorectal cancer and those at higher risk. The researchers
      hypothesise that changes in cellular proliferation at the top of the crypt in individuals at
      higher risk of colorectal cancer are due to a change in the number of stem cells in the crypt
      base.

        All patients referred for lower gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy at a participating centre
        will be considered for inclusion. Patients with a previous adenomatous polyp resection
        under surveillance will be considered for inclusion to the polyp group. Patients with
        ulcerative colitis under surveillance will be considered for inclusion to the ulcerative
        colitis group.
