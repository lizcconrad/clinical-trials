  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether two doses of an extract from bran
      demonstrate a prebiotic effect on colonic bacteria (by modulating selected fecal microbial
      populations, particularly bifidobacteria). The secondary objective is to measure the
      potential beneficial effects of consuming an extract from bran on the following physiological
      parameters: laxation, fecal pH, fecal moisture and stool consistency, blood glucose and
      insulin concentrations, plasma lipid profiles and serum free fatty acids, colonic bacterial
      short chain fatty acid production, ammonia metabolism and protein degradation, and biomarkers
      of oxidative stress and inflammation.
