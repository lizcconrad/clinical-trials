      This observational study will assess predictors of early on-treatment and sustained
      virological response in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C initiated on
      treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and ribavirin. Data will be collected during
      the treatment period (24 or 48 weeks) and 12 and 24 weeks after the end of treatment. Target
      sample size is &lt;5000.

    <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as virological response (VR) at 24 weeks after end of treatment (EOT). Virological response was defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) of &lt;15 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) as assessed by COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (CAP/CTM) or another HCV RNA test with at least the same degree of sensitivity. The CAP/CTM test is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantification of HCV. This test possesses a high sensitivity (lower limit of detection [LLOD] 15 IU/mL) and a broad linear range of quantification (43 IU/mL up to 69 million IU/mL) in all HCV genotypes. The SVR is reported in treatment naive hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infected modified all-treated (mTRT) who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virological Response by Genotype in Modified All Treated Population</title>
        <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as virological response (VR) at 24 weeks after end of treatment (EOT). Virological response was defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) of &lt;15 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) as assessed by COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (CAP/CTM) or another HCV RNA test with at least the same degree of sensitivity. The CAP/CTM test is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantification of HCV. This test possesses a high sensitivity (lower limit of detection [LLOD] 15 IU/mL) and a broad linear range of quantification (43 IU/mL up to 69 million IU/mL) in all HCV genotypes. The SVR is reported in treatment naive hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infected modified all-treated (mTRT) who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>
        <time_frame>At 24 weeks after EOT</time_frame>
        <population>The mTRT population included all participants who received at least one dose of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin, and had at least one post-baseline HCV RNA test result.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virological Response by Genotype in Modified All Treated Population</title>
          <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as virological response (VR) at 24 weeks after end of treatment (EOT). Virological response was defined as hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) of &lt;15 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) as assessed by COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (CAP/CTM) or another HCV RNA test with at least the same degree of sensitivity. The CAP/CTM test is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantification of HCV. This test possesses a high sensitivity (lower limit of detection [LLOD] 15 IU/mL) and a broad linear range of quantification (43 IU/mL up to 69 million IU/mL) in all HCV genotypes. The SVR is reported in treatment naive hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infected modified all-treated (mTRT) who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>
          <population>The mTRT population included all participants who received at least one dose of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin, and had at least one post-baseline HCV RNA test result.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Predictive Values of Virological Response by Week 4 and 12 on Modified Sustained Virological Response by Genotype After Treatment Initiation in Per-Protocol Population</title>
        <description>The probability that a participant who developed VR by Week 4 and 12 and also achieved mSVR at 24 weeks after EOT was called the PPV of the VR by Wk 4 for mSVR. The probability that a participant who failed to develop VR by Wk 4 and 12 and also failed to achieve mSVR at 24 weeks after EOT was called the NPV of the VR by Wk 4 and 12 for mSVR. Predictive values of VR are reported in treatment naive HCV mono-infected PP population who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>

        <description>Virological response was defined as HCV RNA &lt;15 IU/mL as assessed by CAP/CTM or another HCV RNA test with at least the same degree of sensitivity. The CAP/CTM test is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantification of HCV. This test possesses a high sensitivity (LLOD 15 IU/mL) and a broad linear range of quantification (43 IU/mL up to 69 million IU/mL) in all HCV genotypes. The VR is reported in treatment naive HCV mono-infected mTRT population who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Virological Response by Genotype in Per-Protocol Population Over Time</title>
        <description>Virological response was defined as HCV RNA &lt;15 IU/mL as assessed by CAP/CTM or another HCV RNA test with at least the same degree of sensitivity. The CAP/CTM test is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantification of HCV. This test possesses a high sensitivity (LLOD 15 IU/mL) and a broad linear range of quantification (43 IU/mL up to 69 million IU/mL) in all HCV genotypes. The VR is reported in treatment naive HCV mono-infected PP population who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Modified Virological Response by Genotype in Per-Protocol Population Over Time</title>
        <description>Modified virological response is defined as HCV RNA &lt;50 IU/mL as assessed by CAP/CTM or another HCV RNA test with at least the same degree of sensitivity. The CAP/CTM test is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantification of HCV. This test possesses a high sensitivity (LLOD 15 IU/mL) and a broad linear range of quantification (43 IU/mL up to 69 million IU/mL) in all HCV genotypes. The mVR is reported in treatment naive HCV mono-infected PP population who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Relapse After Modified End of Treatment Response by Genotype in Modified All-Treated Population at 12 Weeks After End of Treatment</title>
        <description>Participants whose last test result in their respective follow-up time window showed mVR were considered to have maintained their modified end of treatment response (mEOT-R). Participants whose last test result in the respective follow-up time window did not show mVR, or who did not have a test result in the respective follow-up time window but whose last follow-up test result before the time window did not show mVR, were considered to have relapsed. Only participants with mEOT-R who had a HCV RNA measurement in the follow-up time window (without use of backward imputation), or whose last HCV RNA measurement at a follow-up time point before the time window did not show mVR, were included in the calculations. The percentage of participants with relapse is reported in treatment naive mTRT population who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>

        <description>Participants whose last test result in the follow-up time window showed mVR were considered to have maintained their mEOT-R. Participants whose last test result in the respective follow-up time window did not show mVR, or who did not have a test result in the respective follow-up time window but whose last follow-up test result before the time window did not show mVR, were considered to have relapsed. Only participants with mEOT-R who had a HCV RNA measurement in the follow-up time window (without use of backward imputation), or whose last HCV RNA measurement at a follow-up time point before the time window did not show mVR, were included in the calculations. The percentage of participants with relapse is reported in treatment naive PP population who received PEG-IFN alfa-2a. The EOT was 12, 24, 48 or 72 weeks after initiation of treatment.</description>
