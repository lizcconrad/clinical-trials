  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of otelixizumab in rheumatoid arthritis subjects will provide safety,
      tolerability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information which will enable the
      identification of appropriate safe and well-tolerated dosage regimens to be used in clinical
      efficacy studies. This study will consist of a screening phase, followed by a treatment
      period where four cohorts of subjects will receive 5 daily intravenous infusions of
      otelixizumab. The cumulative dose will increase in each successive cohort and infusion rates
      can be adjusted based on signs and symptoms of cytokine release syndrome and to ensure the
      specified maximum infusion rate is not exceeded. Serial blood samples will be obtained for
      clinical laboratory testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum otelixizumab PK
      parameters, exploratory biomarkers and immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from
      the previous cohort(s) will be evaluated prior to dosing subsequent cohorts to ensure safety.
      Adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs and ECG's will be monitored closely during
      this study. All subjects in the study will undergo long-term follow-up out to 48 months to
      monitor patient safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive.

          -  Female subjects of: a. non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females
             with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12
             months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with
             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 mIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml
             (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods
             in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. b. Child-bearing potential
             and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 of the
             protocol for an appropriate period of time to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for at least
             2 weeks prior to dosing and for at least 60 days after the last dose.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1
             of the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of

             first dose of study drug (e.g., infection requiring hospitalization, major surgery, or
             IV antibiotics to resolve); other infections, e.g., bronchitis, sinusitis, localized
             cellulitis, candidiasis, or urinary tract infections, must be assessed on a
             case-by-case basis by the investigator regarding whether they are serious enough to

             conducted in accordance with local guidelines. The tuberculin skin test results should
             be evaluated according to the criteria for immunocompromised subjects. Subjects with a
             positive skin tuberculin test should be excluded if the investigator judges the
             patient to be at risk of latent TB infection.

          -  The subject has undergone any major surgical procedure within the 8 weeks before

             infarction within a year of screening; Any cardiac surgery including percutaneous

             condition including, but not limited to renal, hepatic, hematological,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurological, cerebral psychiatric disease, or
             evidence of demyelinating disease.

          -  Positive plasma / white cell JC virus (JCV) PCR (either compartment).

          -  The subject has a condition or situation that, in the investigator's judgment, is
             likely to cause the subject to be unable or unwilling to participate in study
             procedures or to complete all scheduled assessments.

          -  The subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory values during the Screening
             period, other than those due to RA. Abnormal values are permitted if, upon re-test,
