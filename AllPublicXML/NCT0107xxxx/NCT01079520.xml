  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate staging of the mediastinum is essential to evaluate prognosis in non-small cell lung
      cancer and to devise an appropriate treatment plan. Mediastinal staging by surgical
      techniques (mainly cervical mediastinoscopy) is considered to be the gold standard, although
      surgical staging is invasive, requires general anesthesia, and is subject to potential
      serious complications. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-transbronchial needle aspiration
      (TBNA) is a new modality for the evaluation of mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastasis
      from lung cancer. Compared to other diagnostic methods, EBUS-TBNA is a real-time procedure
      that enables multiple biopsies with high-quality histologic cores under local anesthesia.
      However, there have been few data on the head-to-head comparisons of mediastinoscopy and
      EBUS-TBNA. The aim of this prospective study is to determine the sensitivity, specificity,
      positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of EBUS-TBNA and
      mediastinoscopy in identifying N2 and N3 lymph node for patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer.

             one of three criteria) : 1) enlarged (1cm or more in short axis diameter) mediastinal
             lymph node(s), 2) FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph node(s), or 3) FDG uptake in N1
             node(s)

          -  The patient is otherwise considered a candidate for a surgical treatment with the
             intention to cure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for bronchoscopy

          -  Uncorrected coagulopathy

          -  Concurrent other malignancies

          -  Suspicious mediastinal lymph node metastasis which are not accessible by EBUS-TBNA or
             mediastinoscopy (i.e. paraaortic, aortopulmonary window, or paraesophageal lymph
