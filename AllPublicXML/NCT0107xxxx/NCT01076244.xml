  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study evaluating the outcomes of patients with painful lumbar spinal
      stenosis who were treated with the mild procedure (minimally invasive lumbar decompression.
      The patients will be followed for 6 months after the procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50 patients at a single center will be enrolled and followed for a period of up
      to 26 weeks. Adult patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis who meet the enrollment
      criteria will be offered the mild procedure as an alternative to surgery or continued
      standard non-surgical medical management.

    <measure>Pain as Measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six months</time_frame>
    <description>A validated ten point scale was used where ten is the worst possible pain and zero represents complete lack of pain. The change from baseline to six months is presented below, where a positive value represents the baseline value minus the 6 month value.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Functional Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measured subjectively by the Oswestry Disability Index. Extent of disturbance in activities of daily living is subjectively reported using this validated instrument.Higher score indicate greater limitations in activity. The questionnaire is divided into 10 topics including pain intensity, personal care, lifting walking standing sitting, sleeping social life, traveling, employment/homemaking. Each topic is rated zero (no pain or no limitation) to 5 (high pain or very limited physically) based on typical pain and/or physical limitations. The worst possible score is 50 (100% disability) and the best score is zero (0% disability).Change from baseline to month 6 is reported below, where a positive value represents the baseline value minus the month 6 value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life as Measured by the Symptom Severity Scale of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 6</time_frame>
    <description>As a validated patient outcome tool specific to lumbar spinal stenosis, Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) captures symptom severity as a quality of life indicator. A mean score of 1 is the best possible outcome representing 'no pain' in symptom severity, whereas higher mean scores up to a maximum of 5 indicate worse patient symptoms. The symptom severity outcomes are presented below as change from baseline to month 6 where a positive value represents the baseline value minus the 6 month value. Treatment is considered 'successful' or 'clinically relevant' if the patient population has at least a 0.5 improvement in symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life as Measured by Physical Function Scale of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 6</time_frame>
    <description>For this ZCQ domain, a mean score of 1 is the best possible outcome representing 'no limitation' in physical function, whereas a mean score of 4 indicates worst physical function. Zurich Claudication physical function scale from this validated lumbar spine-specific measurement questionnaire are reported below as change from baseline to month 6. A positive value represents the baseline value minus the 6 month value. Treatment is considered clinically relevant when at least a 0.5 improvement is achieved.</description>

    <intervention_name>Minimally Invasive Lumbar Decompression</intervention_name>
    <description>This minimally invasive procedure is performed under fluoroscopic image guidance through a dorsal approach to the spine. The patient is given local anesthesia and a sedative but needs to be responsive to the surgeon's questions for neurological monitoring. Under image guidance, the mild tools are inserted and positioned on the posterior spinal lamina, to the left or right of the spinous process. The tools are used to cut and remove tissue and bone from the posterior side of the lumbar spine to create a space inside the spine that can help decompress some of the spinal nerves.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life as Measured by the Symptom Severity Scale of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ).</title>
        <description>As a validated patient outcome tool specific to lumbar spinal stenosis, Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) captures symptom severity as a quality of life indicator. A mean score of 1 is the best possible outcome representing 'no pain' in symptom severity, whereas higher mean scores up to a maximum of 5 indicate worse patient symptoms. The symptom severity outcomes are presented below as change from baseline to month 6 where a positive value represents the baseline value minus the 6 month value. Treatment is considered 'successful' or 'clinically relevant' if the patient population has at least a 0.5 improvement in symptom severity.</description>
