  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite extensive reports of the benefits of statins in reducing serious cardiovascular
      events such as stroke and heart disease in patients with elevated LDL-cholesterol, patients
      do not take their medicines regularly as prescribed. Reasons include forgetfulness, lack of
      understanding of the seriousness of the disease, and fear of side effects. An intervention
      strategy comprising 3-5 minutes of counseling, emotional support and cost-sharing may be
      motivational and improve adherence to treatment.
