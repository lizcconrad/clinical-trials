  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study. The purpose of the study is to facilitate the development of a new
      biomarker of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function using rectal
      tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CF research has advanced to the point where small molecule agents have been developed to
      overcome the underlying genetic defects caused by CFTR mutations.

      There is a critical need to develop new sensitive biomarkers of CFTR function and
      biochemistry that can be used in early phase clinical trials to demonstrate biologic effects
      of investigative agents in vivo. Intestinal Current Measurement (ICM) from rectal biopsy
      samples is an assay that has been proven to be sensitive and specific for CFTR function. This
      method and site of investigation is particularly attractive, since CFTR is expressed at high
      levels in the rectum, it is not altered by disease manifestations, and the tissue can be
      studied ex vivo, providing more flexibility in the nature of the techniques to detect and
      quantify CFTR activity.

      This study will aid in the development of new biomarkers in human rectal tissue for use in CF
      clinical trials. Testing compounds that are designed to restore function to disease-causing
      CFTR genes and proteins will provide an opportunity to improve and standardize techniques in
      the acquisition and measurement of CFTR activity in rectal biopsy specimens.

        Non-CF subjects: Adults undergoing endoscopic procedures (colonoscopies) who meet the
        eligibility criteria.

        CF subjects: Adults with a diagnosis of CF who meet the eligibility criteria. CF subjects
        can include both patients who will be undergoing endoscopic (colonoscopies) and
        nonendoscopic procedures requiring anesthesia or sedation as a part of clinical care (e.g.,
        sinus surgery, central line placement), or CF subjects not undergoing planned
        surgical/anesthetic procedures.
