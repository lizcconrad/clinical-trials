  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although discography and spinal imaging techniques, either alone or in combination, are
      commonly used to diagnose discogenic pain, their exact role in predicting surgical results
      are poorly defined. Our aim in this study is to compare the ability of Functional anesthetic
      discography (FAD), and Provocative Discography (PD) to diagnose discogenic pain and to
      correctly identify the disc levels for the surgical treatment. Proper identification for disc
      levels should improve the overall results of surgery for this condition. Patients with
      discogenic pain have better outcomes if the disc levels for the fusion surgery are identified
      by using FAD compared to similar disc level identification by PD.

    <description>The patients disc levels for surgical treatment will be based exclusively on their Functional anesthetic discography results. The discography will be performed at a maximum of two disc levels. Discs showing the following MRI findings will be considered for discography:
Loss of disc signal intensity on T-2 weighted sagittal MR images.
Loss of disc height on sagittal MR images.
Patients will be followed-up at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after the surgery by research personnel. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires before their discography and at every follow-up visit.</description>

    <description>The patients disc levels for surgical treatment will be based exclusively on their Provocative Discography results. The discography will be performed at a maximum of two disc levels. Discs showing the following MRI findings will be considered for discography:
Loss of disc signal intensity on T-2 weighted sagittal MR images.
Loss of disc height on sagittal MR images.
The control disc, in the case provocative discography group must appear normal on the MRI - must have preserved disc height and central disc signal intensity on T-2 weighted images. The provocative discography will be performed using the standard IASP criteria. The patients will be followed-up at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after the surgery.</description>
