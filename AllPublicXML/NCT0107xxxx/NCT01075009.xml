    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria continues to increase in US hospitals. This
      comes at a time when there are few new drugs in development that are active for these
      resistant organisms. The implication is that we must learn to use the drugs that we have more
      wisely and develop new strategies that will preserve existing agents. Antimicrobial
      &quot;stewardship&quot; programs are one strategy that many hospitals are adopting to improve the
      quality of antimicrobial use. The goal of this project is to develop a consortium of US
      academic medical centers that will allow characterization of the relationships between
      antibiotic use and rates of resistance for gram-negative pathogens, and to help hospital
      devise new strategies that will modify antibiotic use and possibly delay or reduce
      resistance.

      The specific hypotheses are:

        -  Hospitals with established or emerging resistance in gram-negative pathogens, including
           extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms, carbapenem-resistant
           enterobacteriaceae (CRE)and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa have a different pattern
           of antimicrobial drug use compared to hospitals with fewer of these organisms.

        -  Hospital use of ertapenem is not associated with the rates of carbapenem-resistant
           organisms.

      Antibacterial drug use

      Systemic antibacterial drug use in adult inpatients discharged between January 1, 2006 and
      December 31, 2010 was obtained from patient-level billing records. These data were aggregated
      and reported for each hospital as days of therapy per 1000 patient days (DOT/1000PD) as
      previously described [10]. Any dose of an antibiotic received by a patient during a 24 hour
      period is counted as one DOT. For example, administration of imipenem/cilastatin 1000 mg
      every 8 hours, or administration of 500mg every 6 hours, is counted as one DOT. We have
      recently reported advantages of measuring antibiotic use by DOTs versus the metric usually
      recommended, the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) [12].

      Antimicrobial susceptibility

      In year 2009 we requested the annual cumulative hospital antibiograms from the 50 hospitals
      for the years in which we had carbapenem drug use. The contact at each hospital was usually
      the antimicrobial stewardship pharmacist, but may also have included the infectious diseases
      physician(s), clinical microbiologist or infection control practitioner. We utilized
      antibiograms with a full calendar year of susceptibility reported for all clinical isolates
      (at least 30 isolates), the total number of isolates and the proportion of resistant
      isolates.

      All hospitals received an on-line survey requesting additional information regarding
      susceptibility testing methods and antibiogram construction. We used the secure survey
      instruments provided by REDCap (Research electronic data capture; www.project-redcap.com) to
      send and compile survey responses. Specifically we inquired about the inclusion/exclusion of
      duplicate clinical isolates in the antibiogram, method(s) of susceptibility testing, policy
      regarding surveillance cultures and we attempted to verify that Clinical Laboratory Standards
      Institute (CLSI) interpretative breakpoints were used for all years. As recommended by
      Schwaber we recorded both proportions and rates of carbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa [13].
      The resistant proportion was the number of resistant isolates divided by total number of
      isolates, and the resistant incidence rate was the number of resistant isolates per 1000
      adult patient days (PD).
