      Study purpose:

      The disease course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is variable. During the course of
      the disease some patients will get better, some will stay the same, and others will get
      worse. Currently doctors do not have any way to predict an individual patients disease
      course. The purpose of this study is to determine if 'biomarkers' such as proteins or genes
      isolated at the time of diagnosis can be used to predict the disease course. These
      'biomarkers' will be obtained from samples of blood, from a procedure call a bronchoscopy,
      and in some patients from extra tissue obtained by a surgical lung biopsy.

      The objectives of this study are as follows:

      Specific Aim 1: Assemble a network of clinical centers to procure biologic samples from
      subjects with recently diagnosed IPF and follow these subjects for at least 48 weeks.
      Specific Aim 2: Correlate and integrate biologically plausible biomarkers of disease activity
      obtained from multiple compartments (SLB, BAL, TBB, blood) from the same subject with
      longitudinal measures of disease progression (change in forced vital capacity, change in
      diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis, and death).

      General Study Design This study will take place in two phases. During the first phase of the
      study we will identify and collect baseline specimens from subjects with either suspected or
      recently diagnosed (within 48 months) IPF. During the second phase of the study subjects with
      IPF will be followed from between 48 and 80 weeks. Subjects will be followed until the end of
      study (2 year grant award) or until they meet any part of a composite endpoint (death, acute
      exacerbation of IPF, relative decline in FVC of at least 10% or DLCO of 15%). This is a
      prospective cohort study. There is no treatment prescribed or studied as part of this
      prospective cohort study. Subjects are able to utilize any treatments prescribed by their
      physician, including participation in clinical trials as long as they are able to comply with
      the follow up schedule in this study.
