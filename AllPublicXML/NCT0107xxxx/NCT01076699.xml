             Baseline phase.

          -  Have IBS-D according to Rome III criteria and ≥25% of stools on the BSS inclusion
             criteria rated as 6 or 7 during the Baseline phase.

             non-prescription) and prescription analgesics at least two (2) weeks prior to the
             start of the baseline period until after the final study visit. (Final study visit
             occurs two (2) weeks after the last dose of study medication.) Acetaminophen may be
             used as a rescue medication as long as it is carefully documented on the Case Report
             Form (CRF). Fiber supplements are permitted if they are taken at the same frequency
             and amount throughout the study and were taken during the four (4) weeks prior to the
             Baseline phase. This must be documented in the source document file and the CRF.

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study-related procedures, including not
             incorporating significant changes in diet.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive for fecal ova and parasites (O&amp;P) or Clostridium difficile (ELISA) or other
             bacterial pathogens (standard stool culture) during the Screening phase.

          -  Taking medication for the treatment of IBS during the baseline phase (other than
             acetaminophen).

          -  Taking any treatment for IBS including any of the following classes of medications
             within 2 weeks prior to baseline visit (Visit 2), or at any point during the study:

               -  Antispasmodic or anticholinergic agents

               -  Combination products including atropine, hyoscyamine, phenobarbital, and/or
                  scopolamine

               -  Antidepressants (such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOI], selective serotonin
                  reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], and tricyclic antidepressants), to include, but not
                  limited to the following:

               -  Combination products including pheniramine, phenyltoloxamine, or pyrilamine

               -  Laxatives

               -  Opioids/narcotic analgesics

               -  Phenothiazines antipsychotics and anti-emetics

             anticholinergic medications).

          -  Laboratory values greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) alanine
             transaminase (ALT/SGPT) or aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT).

          -  Laboratory values greater than two times the ULN for total bilirubin (TBil),
             creatinine (sCr) or blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

          -  Active infection with hepatitis (A, B, or C) or positive confirmatory test for HIV1,
             or HIV2 (results of the HIV testing will be kept strictly confidential. Subject may

             India pursuant to NACO).

          -  History of allergic reaction to l-hyoscyamine or atropine, or any component in the
             formulation of the study drugs.

          -  Evidence of disease (based on medical history) that could adversely affect the
             subject's safety during participation in this study or interfere with the
             interpretation of study results, including but not limited to: glaucoma; pyloric
             stenosis; clinically significant benign prostatic hypertrophy; clinically significant
             heart or lung or disease; active peptic ulcer; celiac disease; digestive tract
             obstruction or paralysis; myasthenia gravis; inflammatory bowel disease; poorly

             retention, or lactose intolerance.

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 2),
