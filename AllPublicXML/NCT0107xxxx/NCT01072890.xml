  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of temsirolimus and pazopanib at different
      doses. Patients who have an advanced cancer that is not felt to benefit from standard
      treatment or are no longer responding to other treatment will be asked to take part in this
      study. The study hypothesis is that temsirolimus and pazopanib can be administered safely in
      combination and that combined targeting of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) signaling pathways will be effective in
      treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite encouraging clinical activity reported with single-agent VEGF inhibitors, mTOR
      inhibitors, and other novel agents, patients rarely achieve complete disease response and
      ultimately undergo disease progression. The limited efficacy of single-target inhibition may
      be due to numerous, overlapping signaling pathways involved in Renal Cell Carcinoma
      proliferation and growth. A strategy of multi-target &quot;vertical inhibition&quot; of the overlapping
      aberrant VEGF and mTOR pathways by combination therapy may translate to enhanced efficacy
      over each single agent alone. We hypothesize that temsirolimus and pazopanib can be
      administered safely in combination and that combined targeting of the mTOR and VEGFR
      signaling pathways will be effective in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

    <description>Patients will be treated on an outpatient basis with both temsirolimus and pazopanib. All patients will receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) weekly days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients will receive oral pazopanib on a daily basis starting day 1. Treatment will be administered on 28 day cycles. Patients will be in this study for a minimum of 8 weeks or 2 cycles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable solid
             tumor for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer
             effective.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  Zubrod (ECOG) Performance Status 0 - 2

          -  May have measurable or non-measurable disease.

          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function as assessed by the following within 14 days
             prior to registration.

          -  Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens is allowed.

          -  Any prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy must have been completed at
             least 2 weeks prior to start of this protocol and all side effects (except alopecia,
             lymphopenia and hyperglycemia) resolved to grade 1 or less. Any prior radiation must
             have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to start of therapy.
