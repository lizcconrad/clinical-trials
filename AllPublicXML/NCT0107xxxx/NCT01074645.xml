      Background: Reactivation of hepatitis B is a well-characterized syndrome marked by the abrupt
      reappearance or rise of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in the serum of a patient with previously
      inactive or resolved HBV infection. Reactivation can be spontaneous, but is most commonly
      triggered by cancer chemotherapy, immune suppression, or alteration in immune function.
      Spontaneous acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B infection is seen with a cumulative
      probability of 15±37% after 4 years of follow-up.2 Significant number of patients of
      spontaneous acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B may present with very high ALT levels,
      jaundice and liver failure.3 This condition should be defined as acute-on-chronic liver
      failure (ACLF) according to a recent Asia-Pacific consensus recommendation.

      The short term prognosis of patients of spontaneous acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B
      leading to ACLF like presentation is extremely poor, with a mortality of 30-70% in different
      series.8,9,10 Liver transplantation has been the only definitive therapy available to salvage
      this group of patients. However ,this is not readily available and affordable. Another
      therapeutic option is antiviral therapy but has limited data. The efficacy of lamivudine was
      evaluated and compared by historical control but was not found to be beneficial.8,9,10
      However ,a study from Taiwan showed a survival benefit in a subgroup of patients who were on
      lamivudine and had baseline bilirubin below 342 mmol/L (20 mg/dL).11 Tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF) is a potent, rapidly acting, oral acyclic nucleotide analogue, reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor that has been shown to be highly effective in suppressing hepatitis B
      virus replication.12 Tenofovir has also shown excellent activity against HBV in both LAM-
      naïve and LAM-resistant patients.13,14. Its efficacy has not been evaluated in patients of
      reactivation of hepatitis B who present as ACLF Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesis that
      Tenofovir reduces the morbidity and mortality in patients with Spontaneous reactivation of
      hepatitis B by reducing HBV DNA.
