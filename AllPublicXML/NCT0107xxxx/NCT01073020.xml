  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial clinical evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of currently
      practiced bariatric surgical techniques to improve metabolic control and/or resolve type 2
      diabetes (T2DM) in clinically severe obese patients (class 3 obesity). Evidence suggests such
      procedures have greater effects on insulin secretion and insulin action than that expected
      from weight loss alone, which has led to the recent claim that such procedures may be useful
      as a primary treatment for T2DM in the moderately obese population. Concurrently, there have
      also been substantial advances in the non-surgical medical management of T2DM. As a result,
      the best treatment algorithm for T2DM patients with class 1 &amp; 2 obesity is increasingly
      controversial. This trial investigates the utility of currently practiced and available
      bariatric surgical procedures as compared with multidisciplinary intensive medical and weight
      management for the treatment of T2DM with class 1 and 2 obesity.
