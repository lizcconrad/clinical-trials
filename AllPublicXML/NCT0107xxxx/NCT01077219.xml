  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study purpose is (1) to develop the new energy expenditure equation; (2) to increase
      accuracy of energy cost prediction of cycle ergometer; (3) to find out some dependent
      factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen consumption (ml/min) was measured while subjects were at rest and exercised at four
      submaximal workloads in steady state on cycle ergometer. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was
      used to estimate the body fats and skeletal muscle mass.
