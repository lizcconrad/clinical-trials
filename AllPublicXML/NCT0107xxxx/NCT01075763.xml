    <textblock>
      This was a 52-week, multicentric, phase II, pilot study conducted in 40 subjects with
      early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) to evaluate safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy
      of subcutaneous (sc) interferon (IFN) beta-1a [Rebif® 22 microgram (mcg), three times per
      week (tiw)] in the treatment of AD by comparing the neuropsychological performance changes
      into placebo and treatment arms from screening/baseline to 52 week.

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment resulting from
      neuronal loss. The primary pathological feature of the disease is the extracellular
      deposition of fibrillary amyloid and its compaction into senile plaques. The senile plaque is
      the focus of a complex cellular reaction involving the activation of both microglia and
      astrocytes adjacent to the amyloid plaque. In fact, microglias are the most abundant and
      prominent cellular components associated with these plaques. Plaque-associated microglia
      exhibits a reactive or activated phenotype. Through the acquisition of a reactive phenotype,
      microglia responds to various stimuli, as is evident by the increased expression of numerous
      cell-surface molecules, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II antigens
      and complement receptors.

      Traditionally, multiple sclerosis (MS) has been considered a &quot;demyelinating&quot; disease. Recent
      immunocytochemical studies suggest that MS may be more than a demyelinating disorder, and
      that even in early stages of the disease, MS pathological scenario envisages axonal damage.
      Interferons, the modern therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MS, are cytokines -
      proteins which lead to a network of signals within different cells. In the immune system,
      IFNs act at different levels. For example, IFNs increase the expression of MHC class II
      antigens and, thereby, facilitate the antigen-presenting process and the activation of
      lymphocytes. T-lymphocytes are important targets of IFN immunomodulation. In MS, it is
      believed that IFN beta suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ
      and TNF-α, and increases the production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin-4
      (IL-4) and IL-10. Since the activation of microglia and astrocytes is common to both AD and
      MS, IFN beta could have therapeutic applications in the treatment of AD. Furthermore, recent
      studies have also found that through astrocyte production, IFNs promote the activation of
      nerve-growth factor.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of IFN beta-1a (Rebif® 22 mcg,
           tiw) in the treatment of AD

      In this study, subjects were randomized into two groups: the first group (treatment arm,
      n=20) received Rebif® 22 mcg tiw; the second group (placebo arm, n=20) received placebo. The
      treatment period was for 28 weeks and subjects were followed up to Week 52. Efficacy was
      determined by comparing neuropsychological performance changes into placebo and treatment
      arms from screening/baseline to Week 52.

      On Day 1 of the study treatment period, subjects received injection training and were
      administered the first dose of Rebif under the supervision of the clinical personnel by
      subcutaneous injection tiw at approximately the same time each day preferably in the late
      afternoon or evening. All subjects received 28 weeks of therapy and after 24 weeks from the
      therapy conclusion, a termination visit was conducted.

    <description>ADAS: global rating scale created to evaluate both cognitive and functional aspects linked with disease progression. ADAS-Cog: subscale of ADAS which consists in a series of short tests aimed to evaluate possible cognitive impairment due to disease progression. It includes 11 items, testing word-finding difficulty, following commands, naming: objects and fingers, orientation, word recognition, recall of test instructions, constructions, ideational praxis, spoken language ability, comprehension of spoken language and word recall.

        <description>MMSE is a tool for screening cognitive decline associated with dementia. It is a brief examination intended to evaluate an adult participant's level of cognitive functioning. The test is performed in following areas: orientation in time and place, learning and immediate recall, mental control and concentration, short-term recall, naming ability, language expression, verbal comprehension, writing comprehension, writing ability and visual-spatial coordination. Scores range between 0 (maximum cognitive deficit) and 30 (no cognitive deficit).</description>

        <description>ADAS-NonCog is a subscale of ADAS aimed to evaluate the non-cognitive features such as mood state and behavioral changes. It takes about 10 minutes to be performed and includes 10 items: testing tearful, depressed mood, concentration/distractibility, uncooperative to testing, delusions, hallucinations, pacing, motor activity increase, tremors and appetite change. Scores range between 0 (excellent performance) and 35 (worst performance).</description>

        <description>IADL is used to evaluate participants with early-stage disease, both to assess level of disease and to determine participant's ability of self-care. IADL scale measures functional impact of emotional, cognitive, and physical impairments. It provides information about participants' compromising rate and care he might need. It includes 8 items: testing ability to use telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, mode of transportation, responsibility for own medication and ability to handle finances. Scores range between 0 (impairment) and 8 (full independence).</description>

The scale is based on theory that human behavior can be ordered in a hierarchy of complexity, within each category, a further hierarchy of complexity runs from basic to complex activities. It includes 6 items, testing the following areas: toilet use, eating, dressing, physical appearance, deambulation and bath.

        <description>CIBIC-PLUS: structured instrument based on comprehensive evaluation of 3 domains: participant cognition, behavior and functioning, including assessment of daily living activities. It includes 15 items and represents assessment of skilled clinician using validated scales based on the observation at interviews conducted separately with participant and caregiver familiar with behavior of participant. According to comparison between baseline and follow-up assessments, scores can range between 1 (markedly improved) and 7 (markedly worsened), with 4 indicating no change observed between two visits.</description>
