      The purpose of this research was to assess the absolute and relative incidence of acute
      pancreatitis in persons initiating exenatide compared with persons initiating a different
      antidiabetic agent, and secondarily, persons without diabetes. This protocol summarizes a
      retrospective cohort study using eligibility, pharmacy claims, and medical claims data from a
      large US health plan affiliated with i3 Drug Safety.

      Limitations of the study: The results provided below should be interpreted in light of the
      following limitations:

        -  Misclassification of acute pancreatitis may have distorted our estimates of absolute and
           relative IRs. In cases where the degree of misclassification is non-differential with
           respect to the exposure cohort, as is likely the case in administrative data, the RR
           would be biased toward the null value, although the magnitude of bias will depend on the
           amount of misclassification.

        -  Lack of information on important potential confounders, like obesity and alcohol use, is
           another limitation of the present analysis. Although we adjusted for propensity scores
           of exenatide initiation, which included a large number of factors derived from the
           claims data, it is likely that the present estimates are somewhat inaccurate due to
           residual confounding.

        -  Our definition of current use in the time-on-drug analysis, which extended 31 days past
           the nominal end of the last dispensing of the cohort-defining drug, may be too long in
           duration and thus misclassify exposure during the relevant etiologic period.

        -  Additionally, these analyses assume that when pharmacies submit a claim for a medication
           that patients receive and consume the medication. While it is possible that
           misclassification of exposure by non-adherence to the medications dispensed occurred,
           prior work showed that pharmacy claims are valid for ascertaining medication exposure.

        This retrospective study utilized medical claims data from a large US health plan
        affiliated with i3 Drug Safety. The individuals covered by this health plan are
        geographically diverse across the United States. The health plan provides fully insured
        coverage for physician, hospital and prescription drug services. The providers of these
        services submit their claims for payment directly to the health plan. i3 Drug Safety uses
        de-identified data derived from these claims daily for a wide range of safety, utilization,
        and economic analyses.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Exenatide Initiators: The date of the first dispensing of exenatide under which a
             potential cohort member might qualify will be 1 June 2005, and the latest date will be
             31 December 2007. We will note the first initiation of exenatide, and also note
             subsequent initiation of other antidiabetic drugs. Eligible exenatide initiators will
             be included in the exenatide initiator cohort on the first eligible dispensing
             following at least 9 months of continuous health plan enrollment.

          -  Other Antidiabetic Drug Initiators: The date of the first dispensing of an
             antidiabetic drug other than exenatide under which a potential cohort member might
             qualify will be 1 June 2005, and the latest date will be 31 December 2007. We will
             note the earliest date of other antidiabetic drug dispensings within their cohort
             membership, and also note subsequent initiation of other antidiabetic drugs. We will
             choose a subset of this comparator cohort randomly selected to be approximately 9
             times larger than the exenatide initiators and will oversample patients receiving
             certain drugs to the extent necessary to ensure inclusion of at least as many persons
             initiating these drugs as initiating exenatide. Specifically, oversampling will be
             performed as needed on initiators of metformin, TZDs, SUs, sitagliptin and insulin
             glargine to allow for further sub-analysis.

          -  Exenatide and Other Antidiabetic Drug Initiators: For all patients in these two study
             cohorts, the date of cohort entry (the date ranged between January 1, 2005 and
             December 31, 2007) marked the beginning of observation for study outcomes (follow-up).
             The end of observation for a given patient happened on the earliest of occurrence of
             likely acute pancreatitis, end of the study period (March 31, 2008), or disenrollment
             from the health plan.

          -  Non-Diabetes Cohort: A third cohort will consist of randomly-selected Ingenix Research
             Data Mart members who have no claim associated with a diabetes diagnosis or
             antidiabetic drug dispensing in the baseline continuous enrollment period. This cohort
             will enter as of the later of 1 June 2005 or completion of 9 months continuous
             baseline enrollment and will provide follow-up through end of enrollment or 31 March
             2008, or the receipt of an antidiabetic drug dispensing or diabetes diagnosis, at
             which point they may enter one of the other exposure cohorts.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The 3 cohorts (exenatide initiators, other antidiabetic initiators, and those without
             diabetes) will be subject to minimal exclusions in order to observe acute pancreatitis
             across a wide spectrum of patient characteristics. We will apply a baseline enrollment
             requirement of 9 months prior to cohort entry so that the first day of follow-up (on
             which acute pancreatitis could occur) will be characterized with the same level of
             detail (based on 9 months of preceding health insurance claims) as any other day
             during the study.

          -  Consistent with the principle of minimal exclusions, we will only exclude from the
             cohorts people who have baseline claims associated with pancreatitis (in the 9-month
             period preceding cohort entry) as these people either had pre-existing pancreatitis or
             had a pre-existing suspicion of pancreatitis. We will not exclude persons with a type
             I diabetes diagnosis as we intend to observe the spectrum of clinical practice with
             respect to antidiabetic drug initiation.
