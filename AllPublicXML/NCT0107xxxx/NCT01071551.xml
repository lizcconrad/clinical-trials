  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) is related to poor physical health, obesity, elevated
      cardiovascular risk factors and iron deficiency anemia. We plan to offer a comprehensive
      framework allowing the &quot;Nutrition Enrichment and Healthy Living Model&quot; (NEHLM) among a low
      SES Kindergarten children. The model offered is designed to take into account the current
      economic status of the child's family. We shall conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      assess the efficacy of the intervention.

      Our main objective:

      To compare the influence of the intervention on changes in food consumption, physical
      activity and ,and caries rates in the children in kindergartens where it is applied versus
      the control kindergartens.

      The research hypothesis:

      Integrative Nutrition Enrichment and Healthy Living Model (NEHLM) will improve health
      behaviors among children and parents in comparison to control intervention (physical activity
      only).

    <description>The &quot;Nutrition Enrichment and Healthy Living Model&quot; (NEHLM) is an Integrative model covering variety of lifestyle issues such as nutrition, dental care, and physical activity. The model will be applied to kindergartens and a sample of their parents. Children participating will be given 10 lessons in nutrition, 5 lessons in dental-care and 20 physical activity lessons. Parents for children in this group will be given 2 nutrition-education meetings and a meeting with a dental clinician.2 additional meetings will be held for parents and children together, one in nutrition and one in dental-care.</description>
