      1. Primary purpose To evaluate disease free survival rate (DFS) after taking 36 months with
           Letrozole in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer who
           complete 5 years of Toremifene

        2. Secondary purpose

             -  To evaluate follows after taking 36 months with Letrozole in postmenopausal women
                with hormone receptor positive breast cancer who complete 5 years of Toremifene.

                  1. Disease Free Survival rate(DFS)-12 months, 24 months

                  2. Distant disease free survival rate(DDFS), Overall Survival(OS)

             -  12 months, 24 months, 36 months c. safety

             -  Change of lipid profiles

             -  Mortality and morbidity due to Cardiovascular disease

             -  Incidence of Fracture

             -  Change of Bone density

             -  Common toxic effect
