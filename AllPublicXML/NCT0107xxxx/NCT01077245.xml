    <textblock>
      Patients with confirmed C. difficile infection (CDI) who meet eligibility requirements will
      be invited to participate. All study patients must receive treatment for CDI with
      metronidazole or vancomycin. Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      MIYA-BM Fines Granules [Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 Strain (CBM588)] or a placebo
      orally twice a day for 42 days. Patients will be evaluated for safety and clinical outcomes
      through Day 180. Occurrence of adverse events (AEs), diarrhea history, and concomitant
      medications will be evaluated at scheduled study visits and telephone contacts.

      This study is a Phase 2 blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of an oral
      probiotic product, MIYA-BM Fine Granules [Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 Strain (CBM588)],
      in patients diagnosed with CDI and treated with metronidazole or vancomycin. Two hundred
      patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive
      either MIYA-BM (2g/dose) or placebo orally twice daily for 42 days. After randomization, all
      patients will be followed for a total of 180 days (6 months) for safety and recurrent CDI. If
      initially hospitalized, patients will be followed daily for diarrhea history, collection of
      concomitant medications and AEs, and monitored for their response to treatment. Patients will
      be followed through clinic visits and safety telephone calls. All patients will be given a
      Diary Card to report AEs, diarrhea history, and concomitant medications on a daily basis. If
      patients have signs or symptoms of CDI following resolution of the initial episode, they will
      be instructed to return to the clinic as soon as possible for evaluation of recurrent CDI. If
      a patient is diagnosed with recurrent CDI, they will discontinue study treatment (MIYA-BM or
      placebo) and be treated and followed according to the institution's standard of care for
      recurrent CDI.
