  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, the Rochester Center for Behavioral Medicine (RCBM) has evaluated many
      patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A recurrent finding in these
      patients is a history of unexplained fatigue and musculoskeletal pain.

      Treatment of these patients in our clinic has revealed that when their underlying ADHD is
      treated with psychostimulant medication, many patients report significant improvements with
      regard to their fatigue and musculoskeletal pain. Patients report less subjective fatigue and
      pain and note overall functional improvement, although the initial and primary objective was
      the treatment of their attention or hyperactivity problems. We speculate that stimulants are
      efficacious by offering two distinct clinical properties. 1) anti-fatigue properties and 2)
      properties that allow patients to filter out extraneous stimuli (i.e. chronic muscle pain).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a result of these findings RCBM developed a chronic fatigue/fibromyalgia clinic in the
      early 2000's. This clinic was staffed by a board-certified rheumatologist and the psychiatric
      staff at RCBM. Through the major referral hospital in the area, patients with self-identified
      fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue were referred to our clinic. Over eighteen months, we
      evaluated 75 patients, and found that in patients who had comprehensive evaluations, nearly
      70 percent also had a history of ADHD, inattentive or combined types. Diagnosis was made
      using clinical history and standardized symptom checklists. Oftentimes, the ADHD had been
      previously undiagnosed. This finding supports the link between ADHD and FMS/CFS.

      Results from these evaluations reinforced our initial findings: patients who are treated for
      their ADHD symptoms also show a reduction in their chronic pain and fatigue symptoms. This is
      true regardless of previous (unsuccessful) therapies to treat their fibromyalgia.

      As a result of these findings, we are conducting a controlled study to further demonstrate
      the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) in controlling fatigue symptoms in patients
      presenting with chronic fatigue syndrome. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      over a period of 8 weeks, where subjects are randomized to either LDX or placebo. We will
      evaluate subjects through standardized pain, fatigue and ADHD assessment scales.

    <measure>BRIEF-A</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF-A (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-- Adult Form) is comprised of the following sub-scales: Metacognition Index, Behavioral Regulation Index, Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Self-Monitor, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organziation of Material. These subscales are summed to provide the GEC or Global Executive Composite. Listed below are the mean improvement scores on the GEC index from baseline to endpoint. The Global Executive Composite raw score range is 70-182, with higher scores indicating more compromised executive functioning. The scores listed in the table depict mean improvement on the GEC from the beginning to the end of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale is designed to measure the impact of fatigue on the life of the subject. It is a nine-question likert scale survey with a raw score range of 0-63. Scores of 36 and above indicate significant fatigue. In this study, we compared the mean change in the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) from baseline to endpoint between LDX and placebo treated patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamiliton Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Scale is a 14-items clinician-rated scale designed to measure anxiety severity. Each of the 14 items is scored from 0 (symptom not persent) to 4 (severe symptom). The total range is 0-56. A total score of less than 17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 indicates mild to moderate severity, and a score of 25-30 indicates moderate to severe symptoms. In this study, we compared the mean change in the Hamilton Anxiety scale from baseline to week 6 between LDX and placebo-treated patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The McGill Pain Questionniare (Short Form) consists of 15 pain descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale. 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate or 3 = severe. The sum of the intensity scores of the words chosen for sensory, affective and total descriptors are added for a total score. The score range is 0-45. In this study, we compared the change in the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) from baseline to week 6 between LDX and placebo treated patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is an assessment that quantifies the impact of fibromyalgia on an individual, including questions on pain level, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and psychological distress, among others. The score range is 0 to 100, with higher number indicating higher Fibromyalgia severity/impact.
Below, we compare the mean change in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) from baseline to week 6 between LDX and placebo treated patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) is an 18-item scale based on DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. Each item is rated using a likert scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), with a total score range of 0-54, with higher scores indicating more symptoms/severity. In this study, we compared mean change in ADHD-RS total score from baseline to endpoint of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (Severity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (Severity) is a one-item clinician-rated measure. The item is a likert scale on which the clinician rates the subject based on perceived severity of psychopathology, with higher numbers indicating higher severity. In this study, we compared the mean change in severity from baseline to endpoint.</description>

        <title>BRIEF-A</title>
        <description>The BRIEF-A (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-- Adult Form) is comprised of the following sub-scales: Metacognition Index, Behavioral Regulation Index, Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Self-Monitor, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organziation of Material. These subscales are summed to provide the GEC or Global Executive Composite. Listed below are the mean improvement scores on the GEC index from baseline to endpoint. The Global Executive Composite raw score range is 70-182, with higher scores indicating more compromised executive functioning. The scores listed in the table depict mean improvement on the GEC from the beginning to the end of the study.</description>

Each of the 14 items is scored from 0 (symptom not persent) to 4 (severe symptom). The total range is 0-56.

        <description>The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) is an 18-item scale based on DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. Each item is rated using a likert scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), with a total score range of 0-54, with higher scores indicating more symptoms/severity. In this study, we compared mean change in ADHD-RS total score from baseline to endpoint of the study.</description>
