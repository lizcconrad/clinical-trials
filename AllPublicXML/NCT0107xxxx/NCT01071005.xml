      The primary objective of this study is to examine, in healthy subjects, the comparative
      pharmacodynamics of Lorelin Depot (leuprorelin), manufactured by the Chemical Pharmaceutical
      Laboratory Bergamo Ltda with the product Lupron Depot ® (leuprorelin), manufactured by Abbott
      Laboratories Ltd, through the strength of biological markers follicle stimulating hormone
      (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and total testosterone, associated with the activity of the
      substance.

      Secondarily be observed safety (tolerability) of subjects in clinical research through the
      comparison of clinical and laboratory parameters pre-and post-study, and incidence of adverse
      events.
