  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a population-based cohort of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from
      general medical practices in the UK, France, and Germany with a nested case control component
      to assess associations between drug exposures of interest and clinical outcomes relevant to
      patients using cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors / nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDS).

      The main objective of the study is to describe in European participants with AS: 1) the use
      of etoricoxib 2) characteristics of those who use etoricoxib. 3) the safety profile of
      etoricoxib and other anti-inflammatory therapies with respect to specific clinical outcomes
      of interest relative to non-use of these medications and relative to each other.
