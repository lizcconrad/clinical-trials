      Rescue therapy refers to 1 of 2 types of additional therapy, each given for a different
      reason: any additional therapeutic intervention in participants who developed persistent,
      severe hyperglycemia despite full compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, or
      initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication following study drug
      discontinuation. Participants who received rescue therapy were included in the analysis
      population, but only measurements obtained prior to the beginning of rescue therapy were
      included in specified efficacy analyses.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 52 and 78 Weeks in Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell Function (HOMA2-%B) and Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA2-%S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52, and 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is a method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta (β)-cell function. HOMA2-B is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). HOMA2-S is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate insulin sensitivity (%S), as percentages of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population for both HOMA2-B and HOMA-2S were set at 100%. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline of C-peptide based HOMA2-%B and HOMA2-%S were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 26, 52 and 78 Weeks in the EuroQol 5 Dimension</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26, 52, and 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life - 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. It consists of 2 parts: the first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 3 possible levels of response (no problem, some problem, or extreme problem). These dimensions are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score. The EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK) score ranges from -0.59 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health and negative values are valued as worse than dead. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) on which the participants rated their perceived health state on that day from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health). Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted by treatment, country, and baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 26, 52, and 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (renamed the Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire [APPADL]) contains 7 items that assess how difficult it is for participants to engage in certain activities considered to be integral to normal daily life, such as walking, standing and climbing stairs. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = &quot;not at all difficult&quot; and 1 = &quot;unable to do&quot;. The individual scores from all 7 items are summed and a single total score is calculated and may range between 7 and 35. A higher score indicates better ability to perform activities of daily living. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 26, 52, and 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Impact of Weight on Self-Perception (IW-SP) questionnaire contains 3 items that assess how often the participants' body weight affects how happy they are with their appearance and how often they feel self-conscious when out in public. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = never and 1 = always. A single total score is calculated by summing the scores for all 3 items. Total score ranges between 3 and 15, where a higher score is indicative of better self-perception. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 26, 52 and 78 Weeks in the Low Blood Sugar Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26, 52, and 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Low Blood Sugar Survey (LBSS) contains 33 items comprised of 2 subscales (behavior and worry), each of which is rated on a 5-point numeric rating scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). It captures behavioral changes associated with the concerns and experiences of hypoglycemia and the degree to which participants are worried about certain aspects associated with hypoglycemia during the previous 4 weeks. The behavior (or avoidance) subscale has 15 items, and the worry (or affect) subscale has 18 items. Subscale scores are calculated by summing participant responses to items (behavior range 0-60; worry range 0-72). A total score is calculated as the sum of both subscales (range 0-132). Higher scores indicate greater negative impact on subscales and total score. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 52 and 78 Weeks in Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell Function (HOMA2-%B) and Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA2-%S)</title>
        <description>The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is a method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta (β)-cell function. HOMA2-B is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). HOMA2-S is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate insulin sensitivity (%S), as percentages of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population for both HOMA2-B and HOMA-2S were set at 100%. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline of C-peptide based HOMA2-%B and HOMA2-%S were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26, 52 and 78 Weeks in the EuroQol 5 Dimension</title>
        <description>The European Quality of Life - 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. It consists of 2 parts: the first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 3 possible levels of response (no problem, some problem, or extreme problem). These dimensions are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score. The EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK) score ranges from -0.59 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health and negative values are valued as worse than dead. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) on which the participants rated their perceived health state on that day from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health). Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted by treatment, country, and baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26, 52 and 78 Weeks in the Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living</title>
        <description>The Impact of Weight on Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (renamed the Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire [APPADL]) contains 7 items that assess how difficult it is for participants to engage in certain activities considered to be integral to normal daily life, such as walking, standing and climbing stairs. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = “not at all difficult” and 1 = “unable to do”. The individual scores from all 7 items are summed and a single total score is calculated and may range between 7 and 35. A higher score indicates better ability to perform activities of daily living. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <description>The Impact of Weight on Self-Perception (IW-SP) questionnaire contains 3 items that assess how often the participants' body weight affects how happy they are with their appearance and how often they feel self-conscious when out in public. Items are scored on a 5-point numeric rating scale where 5 = never and 1 = always. A single total score is calculated by summing the scores for all 3 items. Total score ranges between 3 and 15, where a higher score is indicative of better self-perception.

        <title>Change From Baseline to 26, 52 and 78 Weeks in the Low Blood Sugar Survey</title>
        <description>The Low Blood Sugar Survey (LBSS) contains 33 items comprised of 2 subscales (behavior and worry), each of which is rated on a 5-point numeric rating scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). It captures behavioral changes associated with the concerns and experiences of hypoglycemia and the degree to which participants are worried about certain aspects associated with hypoglycemia during the previous 4 weeks. The behavior (or avoidance) subscale has 15 items, and the worry (or affect) subscale has 18 items. Subscale scores are calculated by summing participant responses to items (behavior range 0-60; worry range 0-72). A total score is calculated as the sum of both subscales (range 0-132). Higher scores indicate greater negative impact on subscales and total score. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with country and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events at 26, 52 and 78 Weeks</title>
        <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an event that first occurs or worsens (increases in severity) after baseline regardless of causality or severity. The number of participants with one or more TEAE is summarized cumulatively at 26, 52, and 78 weeks. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Rate of Self-reported Hypoglycemic Events at 26, 52 and 78 Weeks</title>
        <description>Hypoglycemic events (HE) were classified as severe (defined as episodes requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer resuscitative actions), documented symptomatic (defined as any time a participant feels that he/she is experiencing symptoms and/or signs associated with hypoglycemia, and has a plasma glucose level of =&lt;3.9 mmol/L), asymptomatic (defined as events not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but with a measured plasma glucose of =&lt;3.9 mmol/L), nocturnal (defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurred between bedtime and waking), or probable symptomatic (defined as events during which symptoms of hypoglycemia were not accompanied by a plasma glucose determination). The 1-year adjusted rate of hypoglycemic events is summarized cumulatively at 26, 52, and 78 weeks. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adjudicated Cardiovascular Events at 26, 52 and 78 Weeks</title>
        <description>Information on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors was collected at baseline. Data on any new CV event was prospectively collected using a CV event electronic case report form. At prespecified visits, participants were asked about any new CV event. Deaths and nonfatal cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) were adjudicated by a committee of physicians with cardiology expertise external to the Sponsor. The nonfatal cardiovascular AEs to be adjudicated include myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, coronary interventions (such as coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention), and cerebrovascular events including cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and transient ischemic attack. The number of participants with adjudicated CV events is summarized cumulatively at 26, 52, and 78 weeks. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <description>The QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave and was calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG) data using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT/RR^0.33. Corrected QT (QTc) is the QT interval corrected for heart rate and RR, which is the interval between two R waves. PR is the interval between the P wave and the QRS complex. Least Squares (LS) means of change from baseline were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.</description>
