      Primary Objective:

        -  Describe real-life survival of CRPC patients who received first-line docetaxel and have
           disease progression

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Describe treatment patterns

        -  Describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients who received second-line
           taxane-based treatment compared to others

        -  Describe economic and patient-reported outcomes
