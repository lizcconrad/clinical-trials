    <textblock>
      Background: Estimates of central venous pressure (CVP) can be very helpful in guiding fluid
      therapy in the intensive care unit, operating room or emergency room. Current standard
      technique for CVP assessment is invasive, requiring insertion of a catheter into a
      subclavian, internal jugular or peripheral vein. Several ultrasound based and clinical
      methods have been described as potential non-invasive alternatives to assess CVP.

      Aim: To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of CVP assessment by a) inferior vena cava
      diameter and collapsibility b) internal jugular vein diameter c) compression sonography of a
      forearm vein and d) clinical assessment of peripheral vein collapse in comparison to invasive
      CVP measurement.

      Study design: single center, prospective observational study

      Patients and Methods:

      We will examine 77 consecutive patients with invasive venous access and invasive hemodynamic
      monitoring at the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). After obtaining informed consent,
      ultrasound examinations of the inferior vena cava, internal jugular vein and compression
      sonography of a forearm vein as well as clinical evaluation of peripheral vein collapsibility
      will be performed in a random sequence by different experienced examiner. Invasive CVP is
      recorded simultaneously to each measurement. Examiners are blinded to clinical parameters and
      results of previous CVP measurements.

      Primary endpoint: Accuracy of each non-invasive method to determine CVP defined by invasively
      measured CVP.

      Secondary endpoint: Comparison of the feasibility of each non-invasive method.

      Expected results: We hypothesize that sonographic measurement of inferior vena cava diameter,
      internal jugular vein diameter and compression sonography of a forearm vein as well as
      clinical assessment of peripheral vein collapsibility are reliable methods for CVP
      determination in comparison to invasive CVP measurement.

      Significance: The validation and comparison of sonographic / clinic CVP assessment would
      enable clinicians to choose an accurate non-invasive method to assess volume status which is
      an important adjunct in the management of many critically ill patients. The non-invasiveness
      of these methods broadens the feasibility to measure CVP and may guide fluid therapy in new
      patient populations.

        This single center, prospective observational study will be performed at the surgical
        intensive care unit (ICU) of the tertiary care teaching hospital of the University of
        Basel. ICU, rather than Emergency Department patients will be consecutively enrolled
        because of the higher prevalence of CVP catheters and the higher likelihood of clinical
        stability (by means of hemodynamic parameters, therapeutic interventions etc.).
