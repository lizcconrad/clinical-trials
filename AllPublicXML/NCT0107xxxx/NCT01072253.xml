  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate eye amputated patients health related quality of
      life, perceived stress, self-rated health, labour marked participation and socio-economic
      position.

      The investigators hypothesis is that quality of life, perceived stress and self- rated health
      of many eye amputated patients are drastically changed. Eye amputation has a marked negative
      influence on labour marked participation and socio-economic position of the patients.
