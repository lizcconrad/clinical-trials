  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are admitted to the critical care unit of the hospital because of medical conditions
      that have a high likelihood of causing severe problems with blood flow, breathing, or brain
      function. These conditions also have a high likelihood of causing death. Approximately 10 to
      15% of all critically ill patients die in hospital. A large amount of scientific evidence
      suggests that a substantial proportion of these deaths is due to a combination of blot
      clotting and inflammation in the blood vessels.

      Statins are drugs that interfere with cholesterol and fat metabolism. Cholesterol and fat in
      the blood are associated with blood clotting and inflammation in the blood vessels. Statins
      are known to be very beneficial in improving the survival after heart attacks, and in
      preventing heart attacks.

      The question that VASTVALUS asks is: do statins improve survival among all critically ill
      patients? In VASTVALUS, we will concentrate on patients that do not currently require a
      statin because of their medical condition e.g. after a heart attack, but we are concerned
      with the rest of the critically ill. In VASTVALUS, participating patients will receive either
      atorvastatin 80 mg daily or a placebo. Atorvastatin is a statin with a well-established
      record of safety and effectiveness. A placebo has no known medical activity. We will follow
      all patients in VASTVALUS to determine whether atorvastatin has any effect on the occurrence
      of death, stroke, heart attack, or kidney failure among the critically ill. Results from
      VASTVALUS will be shared with the medical community after the study is completed. As with all
      clinical trials, patients in VASTVALUS participate of their own choice, and can change their
      mind at any time.
