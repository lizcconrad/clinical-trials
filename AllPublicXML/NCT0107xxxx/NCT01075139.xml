  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that a high percentage of college students do not meet recommended
      national guidelines for physical activity or fruit/vegetable intake. The purpose of this
      study was to pilot test the short-term efficacy of a one-on-one, brief motivational
      intervention (BMI) designed to increase physical activity and fruit/vegetable intake. It was
      hypothesized that participants in the BMI condition would report greater physical activity
      and fruit/vegetable intake at follow-up than those in an education-only control condition.
