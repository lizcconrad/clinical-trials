      Background:

        -  A person s mental state, personal relationships, or spiritual well-being often change in
           many ways during or after cancer. Some of these changes can have a life-changing
           positive side, called psycho-socio-spiritual or PSS Healing. For example, a person may
           feel mentally stronger or more whole than before their cancer.

        -  Because researchers are interested in enhancing such experiences in other cancer
           patients, there is interest in developing a way to measure PSS Healing that would be
           helpful in understanding this phenomenon.

      Objective:

      - To determine and categorize the characteristics of PSS Healing, which could lead to
      development of a psychometric instrument to measure it.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults who have cancer or have had cancer that was diagnosed after the age of 18 and who
      have had at least one strong positive emotional or mental change in relation to the cancer
      (e.g., relationships with others, spiritual well-being or faith, thoughts about the meaning
      of life, reactions to stress).

      Design:

        -  The study design does not involve any treatment or counseling.

        -  Participants will be interviewed by a research team member. The one-time interview will
           last up to 2.25 hours and will be audiotaped and transcribed.

        -  Interviews will consist of an in-depth portion to assess the positive changes in
           relation to the illness. Participants will then be asked to identify from a list of
           short descriptions the ones that best reflect their personal experience of PSS Healing.

        -  Transcribed information will be coded and categorized according to standard research
           techniques.

    <textblock>
      We identify healing in the context of chronic or life-threatening illness as a
      patient-reported outcome consisting of growth or benefit in psychological, social and/or
      spiritual dimensions representing improvement well above the patient s pre-morbidity
      baseline. This positive outcome often occurs despite substantial suffering during the
      illness, even in terminal cases (Kearney 2000).

      In previous phenomenological studies, qualitative descriptions of healing and the processes
      by which it develops have not been structured in categories suitable for the development of a
      fully validated and standardized psychometric instrument. Also, the relationship of healing
      to psychometrically measurable constructs such as posttraumatic growth, resilience, coping,
      and acceptance is not clear.

      Objective: This program is to provide (1) a qualitative model of healing-related processes,
      (2) phenomenological categories of healing suitable for a psychometric instrument
      development, (3) the relationship of healing to other relevant constructs such as trauma,
      coping, and adult development, and (4) questionnaire items for healing assessment and (5)
      software tools that greatly increase the qualitative analysis speed and rigor of
      phenomenological category building.

      Study populations: Two populations of subjects who have experienced a life-threatening
      disease or serious chronic illness (cancer or cardiac disease) will be recruited from three
      sites. The first population (50 subjects) are individuals with exemplary healing experiences
      (life-transforming positive outcomes connected to illness along psychological, social and/or
      spiritual dimensions) or in the early stages of healing-related processes. In-depth interview
      data from these subjects will empirically help identify endpoint markers and process pathways
      of profound healing. The second population (400 subjects) consists of current or past
      participants in structured healing or medical rehabilitation programs. In a written
      interview, these participants will qualitatively evaluate questionnaire items for identifying
      readiness for and progress toward healing using their first-hand, illness-related experience.

      Design: This protocol has a qualitative, phenomenological, natural history design similar to
      identifying features of a medical syndrome or psychological disorder. It has two formats of
      data collection: in-depth individual interviews of the exemplary healing population, and
      self-administered written interviews for current participants in formal healing or
      rehabilitation programs. In-depth interview sessions have 2 1/4-hour duration with three
      components: a 50-minute, in depth phenomenological interview, a 30-minute short-statement
      interview (how subjects view healing-related short questionnaire statements), and a 25-minute
      related-constructs interview (how their positive outcomes, may be related to personality).
      Interview and short-statement analyses consist of standard qualitative methodologies
      including transcription, memo-writing, coding, categorization, and modeling.

      Outcome measures: None (non-interventional)

               2. Audio clarity subjects must be able to participate in oral interviews with
                  sufficient speaking volume and clarity to enable clearly audible recording of the
                  participant s verbal responses using a recorder. For example, subjects with
                  severe hearing disability who nonetheless reads lip well are eligible for

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE STUDY POPULATION 1:

          1. Age under 18 years. Subjects under 18 years of age are less likely to have a
             sufficient volume of life experience and maturity of perspective to address the full
             range and depth of psychological, social and spiritual issues that arise in the
             context of psycho-socio-spiritual healing.

          2. Born with the illness or diagnosed before 17 1/2 years of age. Even if the subject is
             at least 18 years of age at the time of the interview, the scope of this study is
             focused on the adult psycho-socio-spiritual response to cancer (see exclusion
             criterion 1 above).

          3. Emotional distress self-report (by the subject) that is equal to or above 3 as
             indicated on the Distress Thermometer instrument s 0-10 scale.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR POPULATION 2:

          1. Age under 18 years. Subjects under 18 years of age are less likely to have a
