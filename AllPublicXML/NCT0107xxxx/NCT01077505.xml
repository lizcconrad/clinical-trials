      This study will be an open-label study to evaluate the effect of albiglutide on the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a standard oral contraceptive regimen (Brevicon).
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the lack of effect of albiglutide doses
      on the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol in healthy female subjects.

      This study will be an open-label study in at least one center to evaluate the effect of
      albiglutide administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a standard oral
      contraceptive regimen (Brevicon). The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the
      lack of effect of albiglutide doses on the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl
      estradiol in healthy female subjects.
