      This study compares a new oral Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) product with NiQuitin™
      lozenge 2 mg and 4 mg, respectively, after 5 hours of witnessed nicotine abstinence with
      respect to urges to smoke during the first 5 minutes after start of treatment. Single doses
      of each treatment are given during separate treatment visits scheduled in a crossover setting
      with randomized treatment sequences. The study will include 200 healthy smokers between 19-55
      years, who have been smoking at least 10 cigarettes daily during at least one year preceding
      inclusion, and who smoke within 30 minutes of waking up. Subjects, study personnel and
      monitor will be aware of what type of product is administered at a given visit, but not of
      the administered dose of the lozenge.
