      The purpose of this study is to examine changes in ventilation and airway pressures during
      conventional bronchoscopy of intubated patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanically ventilated patients often need bronchoscopy as a diagnostic procedure or for
      visually directed elimination of secretions. Partial endotracheal tube occlusion by the
      bronchoscope increases airflow resistance. Inhibition of inspiratory flow may be compensated
      for by augmented inspiratory pressure. Reduced expiratory flow however, cannot be compensated
      for by most ventilators and could lead to higher airway - and intrathoracic pressures that
      are not detected by pressure transducers in the ventilator tubing. In this study we compare
      changes in ventilation, airway pressures, ventilator pressures and blood gases during
      bronchoscopy of intubated patients in both volume controlled and pressure controlled
      ventilation. Our hypothesis are that 1) increased resistance in the tube during bronchoscopy
      leads to high intrabronchial airway pressures when the ventilator is in volume controlled
      mode, and 2) when the ventilator is in pressure controlled mode, increased resistance in the
      tube during bronchoscopy leads to reduced Tidal Volume and moderately increased paCO2.
