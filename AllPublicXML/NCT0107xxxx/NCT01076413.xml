      The purpose of this research study is to compare two different exercise treatments for
      walking problems in older adults. The investigators want to determine if participation in the
      exercise programs for 3 months will improve walking abilities by improving balance and
      strength.

      The purpose of this research study is to compare two different exercise treatments for
      walking problems in older adults. We want to determine if participation in the exercise
      programs for 3 months will improve walking abilities by improving balance and strength.

      Adults aged 65 years or older, who are able to walk without the help of another person, are
      being asked to participate. If you are able to walk independently and you have medical
      clearance from your physician to participate in activities requiring low to moderate physical
      activity, you are invited to participate. We plan to enroll 40 older adults, all who have
      small problems with walking due to balance or strength, in this research study.
