  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous
      dose of MEDI-578, a monoclonal antibody, in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. It will
      also be evaluated how MEDI-578 is absorbed and distributed through the body.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with painful osteoarthritis of the knee.

          -  The pain from the knee must exceed pain experienced from any other condition.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to discontinue all current analgesic treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other form of arthritis than osteoarthritis.

          -  Presence of neuropathic pain, or fibromyalgia, or wide spread chronic pain not related
             to osteoarthritis.

          -  Significant abnormalities on the clinical examination that may interfere with the
             study or present a safety risk to the patient, as judged by the investigator.
