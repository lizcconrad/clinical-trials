    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose escalation study using a 3 + 3 design to determine if INCB028060
      (study drug) is safe, well-tolerated and effective in patients with advanced malignancies.
      Patients will be enrolled and treated in cohorts of three and each observed a minimum of 28
      days before the next group is enrolled and may begin to receive study drug. Doses will be
      escalated unless a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in one of three subjects.

    <description>Subjects will be enrolled and treated in cohorts of three and each observed a minimum of 28 days before the next group of patients may be enrolled and receive study drug. The initial cohort will be treated with 10 mg QD. The second cohort will be treated with 20 mg QD. The third cohort will be treated with 50 mg QD. Subsequent cohorts will be treated with two times the dose of the prior cohort to a limited toxicity level.</description>
