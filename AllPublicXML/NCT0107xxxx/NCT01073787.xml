    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of intravenous fluid (0.9% sodium
      chloride and water) alone on headache pain in children with migraine visiting the Emergency
      Department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common and disabling disorder for children. The pain may be severe and
      relatively few effective medications are approved for use in children. The Emergency
      Department (ED) remains an important resource for children suffering from migraine whom have
      not responded to their usual therapy. While a number of effective intravenous therapies have
      been studied in adults, there has been only one such study in children. As such, emergency
      physicians have little or no information about the safety and efficacy of these medications
      in children. However, the conduct of clinical trials where pain is the outcome measure is
      often limited by a high placebo-response rate. The expectation of treatment can significantly
      alter the response to medications especially when pain severity is the outcome measure.
      Moreover, the investigators have found that intravenous fluid alone may help to treat
      migraine headache in children. The investigators propose a study to examine the response to
      intravenous fluid hydration as initial therapy comparing a group with expectation of
      medication and another group without the initial expectation of medication. The results of
      the study will help to estimate the rate of response to intravenous fluid and to evaluate the
      placebo-effect (i.e. expectation of treatment) in studies of migraine treatment in the ED.
      Exposure to additional and possibly unnecessary medications will thus be minimized and the
      results of future trials more definitive on the effect of the study medication.
