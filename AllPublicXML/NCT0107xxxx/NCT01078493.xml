  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wrinkles result from imperfect repair of the dermal layer resulting in loss of collagen
      commonly due to ageing, smoking and sun exposure. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) contains a host
      of growth factors, which have been used in other clinical trials for various medical
      conditions such as tendonitis, and also in surgery such as the surgical repair of facial
      defects. Results from these clinical trials suggest that PRP helps in collagen formation and
      organisation to promote healing of tissues. This study attempts to document the clinical
      effects of intradermal injection of PRP on wrinkles.

      10 selected participants will have 10 ml of blood removed for platelet extraction with
      MyCells®. The resulting Platelet rich plasma will be injected intradermally into the facial
      wrinkles.
