  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current asthma medicines include inhalers. A common inhaler used in asthma is called a
      beta-agonist (for example salbutamol). They improve asthma symptoms by stimulating areas in
      the human airway resulting in widening of the human airway. Although these drugs are useful
      after the first dose, longterm use can cause worsening asthma symptoms.

      Beta-blockers are the complete opposite type of medication. Just now they are avoided in
      patients with asthma as after the first dose they can cause airway narrowing and cause an
      asthma attack.

      New research has suggested that long term use of beta-blockers can reduce airway inflammation
      which can improve asthma control and improve symptoms.

      This research was done in asthmatic patients who didn't need inhaled steroids to control
      their asthma. What the investigators want to do is see if the same benefit of beta-blocker
      use is asthma can be seen in people who take inhaled steroids.
