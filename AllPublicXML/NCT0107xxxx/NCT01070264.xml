  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tahitian Noni Juice (TNJ) made from Morinda citrifolia (noni) fruits may provide a safe
      adjunctive treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic
      properties. In this study the investigators examined whether TNJ was able to improve the
      symptoms and quality of life (QOL) of OA patients. The investigators also sought to evaluate
      the tolerability and safety of TNJ.

      This was an open label three-month intervention pilot study. Data were collected by pre and
      post intervention survey as well as laboratory testing. Inclusion criteria were: adults of
      both sexes aged 40 to 75, with a diagnosis of OA on the hip or knee by their primary care
      physician, not on prescription medicine for OA, and who were willing to drink 3 oz of TNJ a
      day.
