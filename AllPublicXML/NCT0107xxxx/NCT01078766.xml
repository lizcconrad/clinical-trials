    <textblock>
      The combination of the constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) method as a complement to
      hand arm bimanual training (HABIT) will improve the frequency and quality of cooperative hand
      use and function in children with hemiplegic CP.

    <description>Rasch built, it measures how effectively a child with unilateral disability typically makes use of their affected (assisting) hand during bimanual performance. It is conducted by a semi-structured play session requiring bimanual handling that is video-recorded. Scoring is performed by a analyzing the video on 22 predefined items using a 4-point criterion-referenced rating scale</description>
