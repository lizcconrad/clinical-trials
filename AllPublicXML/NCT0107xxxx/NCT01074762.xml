      The aims of a concluding 14-year follow-up study are:

        -  To investigate what long-term effect the project model for structured, personalized
           diabetes care has on 1) the patients' mortality and development of diabetic
           complications, 2) the patients' use of services from the primary and secondary sector,
           3) the patients' self-rated health and motivation, and 4) the doctor-patient
           relationship.

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an increasingly common illness that is linked to considerable
      excessive mortality. There are many indications that treatment of raised blood pressure and
      blood glucose as well as dyslipidaemia can postpone the development of diabetic
      complications. Treatment of T2DM is primarily done in general practice, where the results are
      not satisfactory. The purpose of the project is to create a basis so the existing
      research-based knowledge can be used to improve the quality of diabetes care in general
      practice.

      The answer will be based on the information from 1,428 newly diagnosed diabetic patients aged
      40 or over who were followed since 1989 in a randomised trial among more than 600 general
      practitioners. The intervention, which ended at the beginning of 1996, provided optimum
      conditions for follow-up, doctor-patient communication and treatment, among other ways by
      training the doctors, producing clinical guidelines and setting individual treatment goals.
      In the project, the general practitioner is seen as the coordinator of the whole health
      system's prophylactic efforts in relation to the individual diabetic patient.

      The aims of a concluding 14-year follow-up are:

        -  To investigate what long-term effect the project model for structured, personalized
           diabetes care has on 1) the patients' mortality and development of diabetic
           complications, 2) the patients' use of services from the primary and secondary sector,
           3) the patients' self-rated health and motivation, and 4) the doctor-patient
           relationship.

    <description>General practitioners (GPs) were recommended to perform regular follow up every three months and an annual screening for diabetic complications. The GP was requested to define, together with the patient, the best possible goals for blood glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), diastolic blood pressure, and lipids within three predefined categories. At each quarterly consultation, the GP was asked to compare the achievements with the goal and consider changing either goal or treatment accordingly. The doctors received annual descriptive feedback reports on individual patients. The GPs were introduced to possible solutions to therapeutic problems through clinical guidelines supported by an annual half day seminar. Patient leaflets were produced for the doctor to hand out.</description>
