  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the
      formation of posthepatectomy ascites with a focus on the significance of changes in portal
      venous hemodynamics after hepatic resection. By evaluation of other factors that may be
      involved in the formation of ascites this study may help to show to what extent the increase
      of portal venous pressure contributes to ascites formation. Detailed knowledge about
      pathogenetic factors concerning the formation of postoperative ascites might help preventing
      protracted hospital stay and further inconveniences to the patient.

    <textblock>
      The mechanisms underlying the development of large-volume ascites after hepatectomy remain
      poorly understood. While studies on animal models suggest an increase of portal venous
      pressure after hepatectomy that may in turn favor the transudation of fluid into the
      peritoneal cavity further factors may be critically involved in the postoperative formation
      of ascites. These factors may include a drop in serum protein levels (and colloid osmotic
      pressure), a transient impairment in renal function and a surgery-induced capillary leakage.
      However, a better knowledge of the pathophysiology represents the prerequisite for efficient
      treatment.

      In the present study the impact of changes in hepatic hemodynamics after hepatectomy on
      development of ascites will be investigated. Enrolled patients will receive measurement of
      portal venous flow and pressure as well as hepatic artery flow before and after hepatic
      resection. Associations of changes in these parameters with development of postoperative
      ascites and further postoperative complications will be evaluated.
