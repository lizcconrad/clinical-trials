    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an assessment protocol that measures the need
      for support with smoking cessation and that will be administered by primary health care
      nurses helps patients with obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) quit smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with COPD continue to smoke despite the importance of quitting. A specially
      developed assessment protocol for such patients may support nurses in their discussions with
      the patients about smoking cessation. In a previous qualitative study involving in-depth
      interviews with patients with COPD, the assessment protocol &quot;Trying to quit smoking&quot; (TTQ)
      was developed. The protocol consists of approximately 40 statements that the patient responds
      to on a scale ranging from 1 (agree entirely) to 4 (disagree). The purpose of the protocol is
      to identify areas in which the patient may need extra support in order to quit smoking.

      The aim of this study is to validate the TTQ by testing it in a clinical setting. The study
      will be conducted at approximately 40 primary health care centers in Stockholm County. Nurses
      at the participating centers will be randomized into a group that will give patients care as
      usual (Usual care group) and a group that will administer the protocol to patients (Protocol
      group). The nurses in both groups will identify 10 consecutive patients who have COPD and
      smoke. All nurses will complete a questionnaire for each patient at baseline (after visit 1)
      and after 3 months describing treatment provided. The nurses in the Protocol group will ask
      each patient to fill in the TTQ and will provide individual counseling on the basis of the
      answers. After 3 months, the nurses in both groups will ask all patients if they still smoke.
      The nurses in the Protocol group will ask the patients to fill in the TTQ again. Appropriate
      statistical methods will be used to analyze the questionnaire data.
