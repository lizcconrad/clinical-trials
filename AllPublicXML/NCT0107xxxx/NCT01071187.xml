    <textblock>
      The varenicline for alcohol dependence trial investigates the efficacy of varenicline versus
      placebo for maintaining abstinence in the postacute treatment of alcohol dependent subjects.
      The main study hypothesis is that subjects treated with varenicline have more abstinent days
      during the study.
