      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a disease management programme (DMP)
      for very old patients with HF and significant co-morbidity.

      METHODS: A multicenter randomized trial will be conducted with 700 patients with heart
      failure, aged over 75 years, admitted to the acute-care units of the Geriatrics Departments
      in 8 hospitals. Patients will be randomly allocated to a DMP or to conventional usual-care.
      Randomization will be stratified by hospital and performed with concealment of the allocation
      list.

      The DMP will be conducted by a case manager, and will include three main components:

        1. patient education to improve disease' knowledge and self-care

        2. monitoring of clinical status

        3. therapeutic adherence. Main statistical analyses will be performed according to the
           intention-to-treat principle, and will use Cox regression models to examine the
           association of a DMP with hospital readmission, quality-of-life, and mortality over 12
           months.
