  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung isolation is used to achieve one lung ventilation to facilitate thoracic surgery. Two
      methods are commonly used, a double lumen tube (DLT) or a bronchial blocker introduced
      through a single lumen tube. However, both techniques have advantages and disadvantages.
      Briefly, the DLT can be positioned faster and remains firmly in place, but is sometimes
      difficult or even impossible to introduce. The DLT is larger than a conventional single lumen
      tube and the incidence of postoperative hoarseness and airway injuries is higher. Compared to
      the DLT, bronchial blocking devices are more difficult to position and need more frequent
      intraoperative repositioning. These disadvantages of the existing devices for lung isolation
      prompted further development of the bronchial blocker concept. The design of a new Y shaped
      bronchial blocker, the EZ- Blocker® (AnaesthetIQ BV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) (EZB),
      combines the advantages of both lung isolation techniques. The aim of the study is to compare
      in a randomised, prospective way the ease of placement, the incidence of malpositioning and
      the quality of lung deflation of a left DLT and a EZB. Secondly, the incidence and severity
      of damage to laryngeal, tracheal and bronchial structures caused by the use of the DLT or the
      EZB is a target of the study.

    <description>Traditionally, single lung ventilation is obtained with a double lumen tube (DLT). In our institution a polyvinyl DLT (Broncho-cath, Mallinckrodt,) without carinal hook, is used. This type of tube exists of a tube with two lumen with two distal cuffs. One lumen (called the bronchial lumen) extends some distance further, has a slight curvature and has a small blue cuff. The other lumen (called the tracheal lumen) has a larger cuff. A DLT tube exists in four sizes and one can choose in a left or a right configuration. Almost always, we use a left sided DLT. A DLT has a much larger diameter than a standard single lumen endotracheal tube</description>

    <description>The EZ-blocker (EZB) is a semi-rigid catheter but it has two distal extensions, both with an inflatable cuff and a central lumen. It is intended for use in combination with a standard single lumen tube. After the EZB is advanced trough the distal end of the single lumen tube, both extensions spread out and find their way in the left and right main stem bronchi. The place where the two extensions are attached to the shaft now rests on the carina. Fiber optic bronchoscopy should be used for proper positioning. After placement of the EZB, one of the cuffs can be inflated to obtain lung separation under direct visual inspection with fiber optic bronchoscopy.</description>

    <description>The gold standard for lung isolation is the use of a double lumen tube (DLT). A DLT is a bifurcated tube with a bronchial and a tracheal lumen.</description>

    <description>Bronchial blockers are balloon-tipped semi-rigid catheters. Different types are available. They are not easy to put in position and frequently dislocates during repositioning of the patient or during surgical manipulation. To solve these problems, a novel type of bronchus blocker, i.e. the EZ- Blocker® is developed. The EZB is also a semi-rigid catheter but it has two distal extensions, both with an inflatable cuff and a central lumen. These improvements owe to the fact that the blocker anchors itself on the carina with the two extensions.</description>
