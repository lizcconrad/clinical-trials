  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uraemic pruritus (UP) remains a frequent and distressing problem in patients with advanced or
      end-stage renal disease. Its intensity ranges from sporadic discomfort to complete
      restlessness during both the day- and night-time and its distribution varies significantly
      over time. Many attempts have been made to relieve this bothersome symptom in affected
      patients, however with generally limited success. Incidence of UP varies widely between
      studies and seems to decline over the last 30 years (from 85% in the 1970s and 50-60% in the
      1980s to a 22% in the 2000s) (Gunal AI).

      We use Pregabalin for the relief of diabetic neuropathic pain in patients on haemodialysis in
      our centre. In addition to neuropathic pain, several of our patients have complained of
      pruritus and after Pregabalin treatment, their pruritus has promptly and completely resolved.
      Accordingly, we intend to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to
      assess the effectiveness of Pregabalin in chronic UP.
