  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the onset of action of fluticasone furoate nasal
      spray compared to olopatadine nasal spray and placebo nasal spray in reducing nasal allergic
      signs and symptoms following ragweed exposure in the Allergen BioCube (ABC) after single dose
      administration and six consecutive days of treatment.
