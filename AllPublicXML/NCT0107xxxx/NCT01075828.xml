      After consultation with the Korean Health Authorities, the two Post-Authorization Safety
      Studies EMR 62202-509 (NCT01082315) and EMR 62241-508 (NCT01075828) were combined within one
      study protocol EMR 062202-551. This Post-Marketing Surveillance Study (PMS) EMR 062202-551 is
      requested by the Korean Health Authorities to continue monitoring of Erbitux and provide
      further information about safety and toxicity in clinical practice in at least 900 patients
      during 6 years.

      All data points from the EMR 62202-509 (NCT01082315) and EMR 62241-508 (NCT01075828) remain
      unchanged in protocol EMR 062202-551. Therefore, the Sponsor has decided not to separately
      disclose the EMR 062202-551 study titled &quot;A Korean Post-Marketing Surveillance Study On
      Erbitux速 (Cetuximab) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Recurrent and/or Metastatic
      Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (originally EMR 62241-508) and in Patients With
      EGFR-expressing, KRAS wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (originally EMR 62202-509)&quot; on
      clinicaltrials.gov.

      This is a prospective, Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study on Erbitux速 (Cetuximab) in
      patients with locally advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the
      head and neck in Korea

      This prospective study will collect safety information from more than 300 subjects treated
      with Erbitux as final evaluable cases. During the PMS period, subject background, subject's
      medical (surgery, anti-cancer treatment) history, Erbitux treatment status, concurrent
      medication, response evaluation, status and reason of discontinuation, all adverse events
      (AEs; regardless of the causal relationship to Erbitux), and abnormal results of laboratory
      tests will be collected for the study purpose.

      The PMS is based on all cases treated with Erbitux at least once. The PMS will be done within
      6 years from the approval date of the new indication. This PMS is requested by the Korean
      Regulatory Authorities. After approval of new indication in Korea, it is further required to
      investigate more than 300 subjects during 6 years according to local regulations to continue
      monitoring and provide further information about safety and toxicity in clinical practice.

      OBJECTIVES Analysis on safety and efficacy information on the use of Erbitux in the market
      and factors affecting its safety and efficacy.

      Primary objective:

        -  To obtain safety information on the use of Erbitux in subjects with locally advanced
           SCCHN or recurrent and/or metastatic in terms of frequency and severity of AEs

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To gather clinical efficacy information of the treatment
