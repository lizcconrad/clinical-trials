  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One obvious property difference between energy-yielding beverages and solid foods is the oral
      mechanical processing required to prepare the two food forms for swallowing. Considerable
      human data are consistent with a contribution of mechanical stimulation to appetite
      suppression. However, no study has isolated this property and assessed its influence on
      ingestive behavior in humans. This is the aim of the present study. The null hypothesis is
      that food rheology will have no effect on these indices. The alternate hypothesis is that
      increased mechanical stimulation will result in stronger satiation/satiety and reduced energy
      intake. Further, it is hypothesized that the effects of mastication will be less evident in
      obese compared to lean individuals.

    <arm_group_label>soft gum</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>. Participants will either chew nothing or chew one of the two gum varieties (flavorless soft or hard) at a constant rate (determined by a metronome) for 15 minutes while sipping apple juice through a straw. Appetite will be measured continuously via a slide potentiometer attached to a 100mm gLMS scale. The juice will provide 10% of the participants estimated daily energy requirement (i.e., equal to 1-2 servings of most commercial snacks). It will also contain 10g of lactulose (a soluble, non-absorbable carbohydrate used to assess gastric transit time via analyses of breath hydrogen) and acetaminophen (a marker for gastric emptying).</description>
