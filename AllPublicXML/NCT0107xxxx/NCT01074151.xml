             occurred during pregnancy

          -  Sufficient data to establish in which trimester of pregnancy the exposure to Cymbalta
             first occurred (i.e., first, second or third trimester)

          -  Sufficient information to determine whether the pregnancy is prospectively or
             retrospectively registered (i.e., whether the outcome of pregnancy was known at the
             time of first contact with the Registry)

          -  Date the pregnancy exposure is reported to the Registry

          -  Source of the report (Health Care Professional or pregnant patient)

          -  Full contact information for the reporter and Health Care Professional willing and
             able to provide accurate pregnancy-related information (name, address, phone number,
             etc.)

        Exclusion Criteria:
