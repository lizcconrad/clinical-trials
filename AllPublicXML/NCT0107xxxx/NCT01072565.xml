    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Self Monitoring of Blood
      Glucose (SMBG) for clinical decisions related to the management of type 2 diabetes and to
      determine the benefit of using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for clinical diabetes
      management.

    <description>You will measure your blood glucose 4 times daily by finger sticks using a blood glucose meter and you will also wear a CGM device. The CGM measurements will be blinded (neither you nor the study doctor will be able to see the CGM measurements until your final study visit). Only your SMBG measurements will be considered to help manage your diabetes. Your medications will be changed or adjusted based on your HbA1c and/or glucose readings with a goal to achieve an HbA1c level of less than 7%.</description>
