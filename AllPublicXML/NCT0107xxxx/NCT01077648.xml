    <textblock>
      The purpose of this epidemiologic study is to establish a population-based cohort of women
      with advanced stage breast cancer which can be used to quantify the frequency and timing of
      brain metastases, and other distant metastases, in this patient population.

      A retrospective cohort study will be conducted in the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS). Using
      medical record review, we will identify all women diagnosed with advanced stage (stage III
      and IV) breast cancer between January 1, 1995- December 31, 2007. For each case included in
      the study, we will obtain data on demographics, tumor information, treatment related medical
      encounters and procedures, and occurrence and timing of brain and/or other distant
      metastases. The main outcome for this study is the development of distant metastases. Each
      patient in the cohort will be classified as to the occurrence and date of distant metastases.
      Metastases will be classified as Brain, Distant lymph node, Lung/pleural effusion, Liver,
      Bone, Other visceral, Other non-visceral.

      Other secondary outcomes to be explored include:

        -  Survival after advanced breast cancer—time in months from the date of advanced stage
           breast cancer diagnosis until death or end of study period

        -  Time to brain metastases—time in month from the date of advanced stage breast cancer
           diagnosis until brain metastases diagnosis

        -  Survival after brain metastases—time in months from the date of diagnosis of brain
           metastases until death or end of study period
