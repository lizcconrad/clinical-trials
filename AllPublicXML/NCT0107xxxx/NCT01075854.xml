      This is a prospective, observational study in women using Gonal-F filled-by-mass (FbM) in
      ovarian hyperstimulation as part of their in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection (ICSI) treatment at infertility clinics in Korea. The purpose of this study
      is to assess Gonal-F FbM in a practical setting encompassing all subject groups and local
      practices.

      Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a complex hetero-dimeric glycoprotein used
      therapeutically to stimulate follicular development in the ovary. The technical advance of
      recombinant technology to manufacture FSH has resulted in a biochemically pure FSH
      preparation with high batch-to-batch consistency. The protein content can be reliably
      quantified in mass units by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. These
      developments have enabled recombinant human FSH follitropin alfa (Gonal-F) to be filled and
      released in vials on the basis of mass with a variability of only ±2%. In one study, the FbM
      batches appeared to deliver a more consistent therapeutic effect than the filled-by-bioassay
      batches. In another randomized trial, self-administration and subjects' satisfaction were
      significantly higher in the pen device group than the conventional syringe group. Local
      reactions at injection sites and pain were significantly higher in the conventional syringe
      group than in the pen device group. The authors concluded that the pen device of Gonal-F is
      safe, convenient, and less painful, with more subject satisfaction than the conventional
      syringe form.

      This prospective, multicentric, observational study is planned in women using Gonal-F FbM in
      ovarian hyperstimulation as part of their IVF/ICSI treatment at infertility clinics in Korea.
      Subjects fulfilling the eligibility criteria shall be enrolled in a consecutive manner over a
      9-month period (approximately 1500 subjects).

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To assess the effectiveness Gonal-F FbM

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the safety and subject convenience of Gonal-F FbM in a normal clinical
           practice over a period of 9 months

    <description>Follitropin alfa FbM solution for injection in a prefilled pen is available in three strengths: 300 IU/0.5 ml (22 µg/0.5 ml), 450 IU/0.75 ml (33 µg/0.75 ml) and 900 IU/1.5 ml (66 µg/1.5 ml). The starting dose is usually recommended to be between 150 and 300 IU. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.</description>
