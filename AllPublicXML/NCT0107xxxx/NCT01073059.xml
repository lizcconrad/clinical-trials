      -  This trial is conducted to assess pharmacokinetic characteristics of valproic acid when
           valproic acid single treatment and valproic acid &amp; ertapenem combination treatment

        -  This trial is performed to evaluate safety of the combination treatment compare with
           single treatment

        -  The investigators carry this trial out to study mechanism of combination treatment
