  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complications following total joint arthroplasty are rare, and the majority of follow-up
      visits are routine. The technology now exists to conduct annual follow-up assessments without
      having to physically see the patient.

      This study will investigate the cost-effectiveness of web-based follow-up assessments
      compared to standard in-clinic follow-ups. We will also assess patient satisfaction,
      preference, and the validity of the web-based follow up assessments. Patients coming up to
      their 1 year follow-up or greater will be randomized to either the web-based group or the
      usual care group.

      Web-based patients will complete all questionnaires using an online database system, and have
      their x-ray taken at their local radiology facility. The surgeon will review radiographs
      online. If there are any concerns with the x-ray or responses to questionnaires, arrangements
      will be made for the patient to be seen at the clinic. Patients in the Usual Care group will
      come into the clinic for their follow-up assessment and have their x-ray taken at University
      Hospital as usual.

      Online assessment could significantly decrease wait times in orthopaedic clinics, as well as
      increase availability for OR time and new consultations. This approach could also potentially
      reduce patient burden by decreasing travel distances, financial burden and time requirements.

    <description>Patients who are at least 2 years following knee or hip replacement will complete a questionnaire online and routine x-rays at a PACS enabled imaging center. The patient's surgeon will receive an email from the database summarizing the patient's responses to key questions and will review the x-rays. The surgeon will determine whether the patient needs to be seen in-person.</description>
