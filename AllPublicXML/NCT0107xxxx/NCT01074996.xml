      A randomized , open-label, multicenter, phase II study to compare the efficacy of S-1 and S-1
      plus Leucovorin as second line treatment on gemcitabine-refractory patients with inoperable
      or advanced pancreatic cancers，investigate the correlation between efficacy and the
      expressions of thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and orotate

    <description>Assuming a 1.8 months median PFS in the S-1 arm, the study was designed to detect an improvement in PFS to 3.5 months in the S-1 plus Leucovorin arm, or 96% prolongation. The calculated number of PFS events needed to detect this difference with α (two-side) of 0.05 and power of 0.8 was 70. Assuming an average enrollment rate of 2.2 patients per month during planned 3-years study period, a total of eighty patients would be able to provide sufficient number of PFS events for the study at end of the study. However, a total of 90 patients were planned for the study, in consideration of comparison for safety and the overall survival between the two treatment groups.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed inoperable or APC.

          2. Failure of one prior gemcitabine-based regimen was required,chemotherapy used as a
             radiation sensitizer in the adjuvant or locally advanced setting was not considered as
             a prior regimen. Patients received last adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy less
             than (or equal to) six months can be enrolled into this study.

          3. Disease had to be measurable by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) criteria.

          4. Age ≥18 years old.

          5. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          6. Written informed consent and able to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Local (Stage IA to IIB) pancreatic cancer and locally advanced (stage III) pancreatic
             cancer. Patients relapsing with metastatic disease, after initial diagnoses with local
             disease can be enrolled into this study.

          2. Previous adjuvant radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer, except for patients with
             progressive lesions outside the radiation port who completed the radiotherapy at least
             6 months prior to study entry.

          3. More than (or equal to) six months since last adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant therapy
             without gemcitabine based adjuvant therapy is not allowed. Patient must have recovered
             from all treatment related toxicity prior to enrollment and must have documented
             evidence of disease progression (metastatic) following prior chemotherapy.

          4. No previous gemcitabine-based therapy for inoperable or APC.

          5. Other primary tumour (including primary brain tumours) within the last 5 years prior
             to enrollment, except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal
             cell skin cancer.

          6. Evidence of spinal cord compression or current evidence of central nervous system
             (CNS) metastases.

          7. History or evidence upon neurological exam of CNS disease (unless adequately treated
             with standard medical therapy) e.g. uncontrolled seizures.

          8. Inability to take oral medication, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption or
             resulting in the requirement for intravenous alimentation or parenteral nutrition with
             lipids, and/or active peptic ulcer disease

          9. Pregnant or lactating females. Serum pregnancy test to be assessed within 7 days prior
             to study treatment start, or within 14 days with a confirmatory urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to study treatment start

         10. Men and women of childbearing potential (&lt;2 years after last menstruation) not using
             effective means of contraception (oral contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive
             device, barrier method of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly or
             surgically sterile)

         11. Current or recent (within the 30 days prior to starting study treatment) treatment
             with another investigational drug or participation in another investigational study

         12. Evidence of any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates use of an investigational drug, or patient at high risk from treatment
             complications

         13. Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs
