    <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. Ratings of 1 - 10 mean the participant is in persistent danger of severely hurting self or others (e.g., recurrent violence) or persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death. Ratings of 91 - 100 indicate no symptoms, and the participant exhibits superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities. Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement in functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Young Mania Rating Scale Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline), Week 8 or last postbaseline observation (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is a clinician-rated, 11-item checklist used to measure the severity of manic episodes. Information for assigning scores is gained from the participant's subjective reported symptoms over the previous 48 hours and from clinical observation during the interview. Seven items are ranked 0 through 4 and have descriptors associated with each severity level. Four items (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive behavior) are scored 0 through 8 and have descriptors for every second increment. The total scale is 0-60. A score of ≤12 indicates remission of manic symptoms, and higher scores indicate greater severity of mania. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in severity of mania.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Responders At Different Treatment Weeks According to the 30-Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician Rated (IDS-C30) Total Score</title>
        <description>A responder is a participant with a ≥50% decrease or greater from baseline in the total score of the IDS-C30. The IDS-C30 is a standardized 30-item, clinician-rated scale to assess the severity of a participant's depressive symptoms. Every effort was made to have the same rater evaluate a participant across all visits.
Total scores range from 0-84, with a score of 0 indicating no depression and a score of 84 indicating the most severe depression.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Different Treatment Weeks in the Total Score From the 30-Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician-Rated (IDS-C30)</title>
        <description>The IDS-C30 is a standardized 30-item, clinician-rated scale to assess the severity of a participant's depressive symptoms. Every effort was made to have the same rater evaluate a participant across all visits.
Total scores range from 0-84, with a score of 0 indicating no depression and a score of 84 indicating the most severe depression. Negative change from baseline values indicate improvement in the severity of depression.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Different Treatment Weeks in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) for Depression</title>
          <description>The CGI-S is an observer-rated scale that measures illness severity on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients). Negative change from baseline values indicate improvement in the severity of depression.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 4, 8 and Endpoint in the Global Assessment for Functioning (GAF) Scale</title>
        <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. Ratings of 1 - 10 mean the participant is in persistent danger of severely hurting self or others (e.g., recurrent violence) or persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death. Ratings of 91 - 100 indicate no symptoms, and the participant exhibits superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities. Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement in functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Young Mania Rating Scale Total Score</title>
        <description>The YMRS is a clinician-rated, 11-item checklist used to measure the severity of manic episodes. Information for assigning scores is gained from the participant's subjective reported symptoms over the previous 48 hours and from clinical observation during the interview. Seven items are ranked 0 through 4 and have descriptors associated with each severity level. Four items (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive behavior) are scored 0 through 8 and have descriptors for every second increment. The total scale is 0-60. A score of ≤12 indicates remission of manic symptoms, and higher scores indicate greater severity of mania. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in severity of mania.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The C-SSRS-B (baseline) was performed at screening and the C-SSRS-SLV ('Since Last Visit') was performed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 or last postbaseline observation.
The Suicidal Behavior - Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior question records whether the participant committed a potentially self-injurious act that was not associated with a wish to die since the last visit.</description>

          <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The C-SSRS-B (baseline) was performed at screening and the C-SSRS-SLV ('Since Last Visit') was performed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 or last postbaseline observation.
The Suicidal Behavior - Aborted Attempt question records whether the participant began to take steps toward making a suicide attempt but stops themselves before starting the potentially self-injurious act since the last visit.</description>
          <population>The safety analysis set includes randomized participants who took 1 or more doses of study drug. The number analyzed includes participants with treatment assessments at the indicated time period.</population>

        <title>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ‘Since Last Visit’ Version (C-SSRS-SLV) For Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and Endpoint For the Suicidal Ideation - Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts Question</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The C-SSRS-B (baseline) was performed at screening and the C-SSRS-SLV ('Since Last Visit') was performed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 or last postbaseline observation.
The Suicidal Ideation - Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts question records whether the participant shares general non-specific thoughts of wanting to end one's life/commit suicide since the last visit.</description>

          <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The C-SSRS-B (baseline) was performed at screening and the C-SSRS-SLV ('Since Last Visit') was performed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 or last postbaseline observation.
The Suicidal Ideation - Some Intent to Act Without a Specific Plan question records whether the participant has active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself and reports having some intent to act on such thoughts since the last visit.</description>
          <population>The safety analysis set includes randomized participants who took 1 or more doses of study drug. This question is asked if the answer to the 'Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts' question was YES, or based on the judgment of the assessor. The number analyzed includes participants with treatment assessments at the indicated time period.</population>
