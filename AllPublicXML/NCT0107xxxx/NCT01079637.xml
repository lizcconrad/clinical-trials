  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare treatment failure rates of surgical arthrodesis
      with MFB against cast treatment in patients suffering from early stage Charcot
      neuroarthropathy (CN) of the midfoot (Sella and Barrette stages 0, 1 or 2) within the first 2
      years after initial treatment. Treatment failure is defined as the occurrence of one or more
      of the following: 1. Amputation, 2. Occurrence of ulcer or worsening of existing ulcer, 3.
      Surgical intervention for correction of deformity after initial treatment. The secondary aims
      are to compare foot function, radiologic outcome, quality of life, complications and foot
      temperature between the two groups.
