      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) when given together with vismodegib in treating
      patients with breast cancer that is metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. RO4929097 may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as vismodegib, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving RO4929097 and vismodegib together may slow the growth of tumor cells and
      may be a more active treatment for advanced breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of continuous daily administration of 150 mg/day
      of GDC0449 (vismodegib) in combination with escalating doses of RO4929097
      (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) administered on a repeated
      schedule of days 1-3, 8-10 every 21 days (for a total of 6 days of RO4929097 administration
      per 21 day cycle) in patients with advanced breast cancer.

      II. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and identify the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for this administration schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenetics (PG) of GDC0449 and RO4929097,
      each alone and in combination.

      II. To attempt to evaluate select pharmacodynamic (PD) stem cell differentiation biomarkers
      in the hedgehog and notch signaling pathways (e.g. GLI family zinc finger [Gli]1/2/3, patched
      [Ptch] 1/2, hairy and enhancer of split 1, [Drosophila] [Hes1], huntingtin interacting
      protein 1 [Hip1], hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif 1 [Hey1], Notch4, Jagged1,
      numb homolog [Drosophila] [numb], BMI1 polycomb ring finger oncogene [Bmi-1], cluster of
      differentiation [CD]44/CD24, aldehyde dehydrogenase [ALDH] proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein
      kinase [Src] family kinases) and the percentage of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) in serial
      breast tumor biopsies before and after GDC0449 or RO4929097 alone and after 1 cycle of
      treatment with the combination of GDC0449 and RO4929097.

      III. To determine tumor response in patients with measurable disease as assessed by the
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

      IV. To perform molecular profiling of the tumor cell and BCSC populations before and after
      GDC0449 or RO4929097 alone and after 1 cycle of treatment with the combination of GDC0449 and
      RO4929097 at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097.

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) on
      day 1 or days -2, -1, and 1 of course 1 and days 1-3 and 8-10 of course 2 and all subsequent
      courses. Patients also receive vismodegib PO once daily (QD) beginning day 8 of course 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             patients with prior treated brain metastases (treated and stable for &gt;= 1 month) are
             allowed, providing that they were not accompanied by seizures and that a baseline
             brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to study entry demonstrates no
             current evidence of progressive brain metastases

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with
             intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets

          -  Patients with clinically active liver disease, including active viral or other
             hepatitis or cirrhosis, are ineligible

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the
             institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study

          -  GDC is a cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) inhibitor; CYP2C9 is an enzyme that metabolizes
             warfarin sodium (Coumadin) into an inactive metabolite; patients who are on warfarin
             anticoagulation are allowed to participate as long as they fit the following 4
             criteria:

               -  They are therapeutic on a stable warfarin dose

               -  Their international normalized ratio (INR) target range is no greater than 3

               -  They are monitored with weekly INR testing

               -  They have no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries high risk of
                  bleeding.

               -  Other anticoagulants, including enoxaparin (Lovenox) and fondaparinux (Arixtra)
                  are also permitted

          -  Caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 and GDC-0449 concurrently with
             CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 substrates; furthermore, patients who are taking
             concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP2C8,
             CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize
             any potential risk; investigators will make every effort to switch to another agent
             and assess the eligibility of the patient to participate in this study

          -  Baseline QTc &gt; 450 msec in males and QTc &gt; 470 msec in females by ECG using Bazett's
             formula

          -  Patients without accessible tumor or who refuse serial biopsies
