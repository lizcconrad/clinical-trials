  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis designed
      to assess the biochemical, immunological and pharmacokinetic profiles of a large, actively
      infusing natalizumab patient population. A duration effect for progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy (PML) risk associated with natalizumab therapy appears to exist. There is
      minimal data available to understand this effect at the biochemical and cellular level. The
      purpose of this study is to gather preliminary data on several parameters to guide in more
      focused research on the duration effect.
