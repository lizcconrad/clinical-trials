      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical effects of the investigational drug,
      SB-509, in subjects with diabetic neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SB-509 contains the gene (DNA—a kind of biological &quot;blueprint&quot;) for a protein. When a
      researcher injects SB-509 into your legs, the drug enters the muscle and nerve cells around
      the injection site and causes these cells to make a protein. This protein causes your cells
      to increase production of another protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      which may improve the structure and function of nerves. In addition, there are changes in the
      levels of additional proteins in your cells. These proteins function to promote the growth of
      cells, are structures in cells, help synthesize products, and affect immune cells, and some
      have unknown functions. This increase in your own VEGF proteins may protect and repair the
      damaged nerves caused by diabetic neuropathy.
