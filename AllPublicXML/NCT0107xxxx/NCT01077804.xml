      The purpose of these continuing post-licensure studies is to evaluate the long-term
      effectiveness of VARIVAXÂ® [Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (Oka/Merck)] and to assess the impact
      of the vaccine on the epidemiology of varicella and herpes zoster.

      Parents/guardians of the cohort of children vaccinated between 12 and 23 months of age during
      a six-month period in 1995 (June-November) at KPMCP Northern California were interviewed by
      telephone at 6-month intervals to ascertain whether their child had varicella or herpes
      zoster in the 6 months prior to interview. Follow-up continued for a minimum of 14 years
      after vaccination.
