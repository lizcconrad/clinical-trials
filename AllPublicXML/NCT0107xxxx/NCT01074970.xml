      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate 2-year disease-free survival in this patient
      population treated with single agent cisplatin and patients treated with cisplatin in
      combination with Rucaparib following preoperative chemotherapy. Side effects and tolerability
      of this treatment in patients with residual disease following preoperative chemotherapy will
      also be observed and characterized.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Safety Run-in will be for the first 12 patients on study only (6 in cohort 1 and 6 in cohort
      2). Patients in the safety run will be included in the efficacy analysis on intent to treat
      basis:

      Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles; Rucaparib 16-30 mg IV D 1,2,3 every 3
      weeks x 4 cycles

      If cycle 1 is well tolerated, the dose of Rucaparib will be escalated from 16 mg to 24 mg for
      subsequent cycles in the cohort 1, and 24 mg to 30 mg in the cohort 2.

      If ≤ 1 of 6 patients in cohort 1 experiences DLT, cohort 2 will commence. If 2 or more of 6
      patients in cohort 1 experience DLT, the study will be suspended and an amendment to explore
      lower doses will be considered.

      If ≤ 1 of 6 patients in cohort 2 experiences DLT, the randomized portion of the study will
      commence. If 2 or more of 6 patients experience DLT, the study will be suspended and an
      amendment to proceed with the randomized portion at the cohort 2 dose (24 mg) will be
      considered.

      During the randomized portion of the study, patients will be randomized to either Arm A or
      Arm B.

      Stratification factors:

        -  Anthracycline vs. not

        -  Residual LN involvement vs. No Residual LN involvement

      Arm A (Cisplatin Monotherapy) Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles

      Arm B (Combination Therapy) Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles; Rucaparib
      16-30 mg IV D1,2,3 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles

      Rucaparib maintenance 30 mg IV weekly x 24 weeks

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-)
             invasive breast cancer, stage I-III at diagnosis (AJCC 6th edition) based on initial
             evaluation by clinical examination and/or breast imaging. NOTE: Patients with ER+
             and/or PR+ may enroll ONLY if they are known carriers of a deleterious mutation in
             BRCA1 or BRCA2. Patients with HER2+ tumors may not enroll regardless of BRCA status.

          -  Must have completed preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. NOTE: Acceptable
             preoperative regimens include an anthracycline or a taxane, or both. Patients may NOT
             have received cisplatin as part of their neoadjuvant therapy regimen. Patients who
             received preoperative therapy as part of a clinical trial may enroll. No adjuvant
             chemotherapy after surgery other than that specified in this protocol is allowed.
             Adjuvant bisphosphonate use is allowed.

          -  Must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. The last surgery for breast
             cancer must have been completed at least 14 days prior to registration for protocol
             therapy.

          -  Must have significant residual invasive disease at the time of definitive surgery
             following preoperative chemotherapy. Significant residual disease is defined at least
             one of the following:

               -  Miller-Payne response in the breast of 0-25.

               -  Residual Cancer Burden (RBC) classification II or III6

               -  Residual carcinoma in one or more regional lymph nodes that would meet AJCC 6th
                  edition criteria for N1 - N3 disease.

               -  Alternatively, if Miller-Payne or RCB grading is not available, the patient will
                  be eligible if the pathology report indicates that the area of residual invasive
                  disease in the breast measures at least 2 cm following preoperative therapy. The
                  presence of DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease in the
                  breast.

          -  Whole breast radiotherapy is required for patients who underwent breast conserving
             therapy, including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy. Patients receiving adjuvant
             radiation therapy must have completed radiotherapy at least 14 days prior to
             registration for protocol therapy.

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  Must consent to allow submission of archived tumor tissue sample from definitive
             surgery.

          -  Must consent to collection of blood samples for PK analysis.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and males must be willing to use an effective method
             of contraception from the time consent is signed until 4 weeks after treatment
             discontinuation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days
             prior to registration for protocol therapy.

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies are required in
             the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings that would suggest distant disease.

          -  No treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to registration for
             protocol therapy.

          -  No history of chronic hepatitis B or C

          -  No clinically significant infections as judged by the treating investigator.
