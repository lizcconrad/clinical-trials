    <textblock>
      Rationale: Infection following total knee replacement (TKA) is a devastating complication
      that usually requires prosthesis removal, hospitalization while the infection is eradicated,
      and a second surgery to implant a revision prosthesis. For primary TKA, prophylactic
      antibiotic-loaded cement (ABC) may not only reduce the rate of infection it may also reduce
      the rate of revisions due to implant loosening. Current controversy about the use of ABC
      exists around the world. Without a definitive trial, patients will be exposed to a treatment
      of uncertain efficacy that may cause antibiotic resistant bacterial strains and will
      certainly generate high costs to the healthcare system. Purpose: To determine, 1) the extent
      to which ABC compared to regular cement reduces the infection rate in patients over the first
      two years following TKA and, 2) the resource use implications associated with the use of ABC
      for TKA. Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial in which 8,800 patients with undergoing
      primary TKA are allocated to either Simplex™ P with Tobramycin or Simplex™ P bone cement. We
      will exclude patients with a prior joint infection, an allergy to tobramycin, and those with
      no fixed address. All patients will be administered IV antibiotics immediately prior to
      surgery. Patients and surgeons will be blind to group allocation. The primary outcome measure
      is infection. Follow-up visits will take place at 6 weeks and 3, 12 and 24 months
      postoperative. A blinded adjudicator will review all reported infections and determine
      whether the putative infection is a study event. Blinded radiologists will interpret the 2
      year series of radiographs for each patient. We will compare the rates of infection and
      implant loosening between the two treatment groups using survival analyses. This study
      includes a full economic analysis.

    <description>All patients will receive preoperative antibiotics administered within the hour prior to surgery. All patients will undergo a cemented total knee replacement (both femoral and tibial components) with the type of implant left to the discretion of the surgeon. The patella may or may not be resurfaced depending on indication and preference. All patients will receive one of the two study cements (Simplex™ P with Tobramycin or Simplex™ P) in a blinded fashion; all cement vials will be similar in size and shape and the cement will be similar in odour, color and texture. No additional antibiotics will be added to the cement. Surgeons can use their preferred cement preparation technique (i.e. manual or vacuum mixing). The use of a suction drain will depend on surgical indication and preference.</description>
