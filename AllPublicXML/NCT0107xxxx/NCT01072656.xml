      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Deep Brian Stimulation
      (DBS) of the ventral capsular/ventral striatal as a treatment for patients with Thalamic Pain
      Syndrome (TPS). The central hypothesis to be tested in this investigation is that VC/VS
      stimulation will modulate the affective component of TPS and, consequently, improve pain
      related disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical study of the therapeutic benefits of ventral capsular/ventral
      striatal deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for 10 patients with medically
      refractory thalamic pain syndrome. Patients to be enrolled under this protocol will have
      experienced severe pain for more than six months and will be considered medically refractory.
      Study subjects may have undergone and failed other surgical procedures or interventional
      procedures. Study subjects will have chronic, medically refractory pain of disabling
      severity, refractory to treatment attempts with conventional medications. Patients that are
      enrolled in the study will have bilateral DBS surgery, with implantation of one Medtronic
      3391 DBS lead on either side of the brain. These leads will then be connected at first to a
      single Medtronic PC pulse generator to be implanted in the infraclavicular region on one
      side. Once the PC pulse generator is depleted, and the patient has completed the blinded
      phase of the study, the PC pulse generator will be replaced for an RC pulse generator. The RC
      pulse generator has a battery life of 9 years and is a good option for the open label phase
      and for continued stimulation after the study is completed. However, the RC is not ideal for
      the blinded phase because patients may be able to tell if they are receiving active or sham
      stimulation. For this reason, patients enrolled in this study will receive, initially, the
      implant with the PC generator. Patients will have at least 6 months of stable chronic pain
      associated with TPS.

    <time_frame>Blinded stimulation phase (3 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Disability Index (PDI) directly measures disability related to the main components of daily life function and has been validated for thalamic pain syndrome. Range is 0 (no disability) to 10 (worst disability). The components are Family/Home Responsibilities, Recreation, Social Activity, Sexual Behavior, Life-support Activity, Occupation, &amp; Self-care. This is an average score of the 3 month period for each Active and Sham phase.</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups: the Treatment Group (active stimulation and programmed to the settings found to be optimal during the titration phase) and the Control Group (sham stimulation - IPG is set to ON but the voltage is set to 0V). In order to prevent too many patients from being randomized to ON or to sham early in the study, we will use, for the first 4 patients, randomization blocks of four or six. In this fashion, the first four consecutive patients will have two patients randomized to the Treatment Group and two patients in the Control Group. In the same fashion, the final six patients will have three patients randomized to the treatment group and three patients to the control group.</description>

             dolorosa).

          -  Six months or more of medically refractory severe pain (see below).

          -  Pain disability reported by the pain index &gt;30 points at the time of enrollment.

          -  Average daily pain for the past 30 days reported as &gt;5 on a 0-10 scale

          -  Failure to respond adequately to at least one antidepressant, one anti-seizure
             medication and one oral narcotic.

          -  MRI done within one year of the first visit showing a lesion that involves the
             posterior thalamic region or a lesion in the dorsal or ventral vicinity of the
             thalamus (i.e. semi oval white matter or brain stem). The lesion will be contralateral
             to the hemibody affected by chronic pain or will involve cortical-subcortical areas in
             topography consistent with sensory thalamocortical connections. This will include
             patients with infarcts in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. A more recent
             MRI may be required if the patient's condition changed within the previous year.

          -  Capable of understanding and providing informed consent

          -  Age ≥ 21 years

          -  Women of childbearing age must be on regular use of an accepted contraceptive
             method(s).

          -  Previous surgical procedures: Patients with severe and refractory thalamic pain
             syndrome may have undergone other interventional or surgical procedures, as an attempt
             to alleviate the thalamic pain syndrome. Surgical procedure may include blocks, spinal
             cord stimulation, thalamic DBS, posterior limb of the internal capsule DBS or
             periaqueductal gray / periventricular gray DBS, cortical stimulation, peripheral
             ablative procedures or cerebral ablative procedures. In this study, patients with
             previously implanted cortical stimulation systems, or spinal and peripheral nervous
             system stimulation systems may be included. However, patients with previous motor
             cortex stimulation must have had the cortical stimulation system before being
             considered a candidate for this protocol. Removal of the cortical stimulation system
             will not be covered under this protocol. Patients with spinal or peripheral
             neuromodulation system may be included in the research provided that the implanted
             systems are compatible with the all research protocols (including fMRI) to be
             performed during the research. Patients with pervious DBS implants will not be
             considered candidates.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not capable of understanding or providing informed consent.

          -  Aphasia severe enough to limit the consent process or communication between the
             investigators and the patient. Patients with mild or recovering aphasia may be
             considered candidates at the discretion of the PI.

          -  Coagulopathy. Patients will be excluded unless assessed and cleared by hematology

          -  Inability to stop Coumadin or platelet anti-aggregation therapy for surgery and after
             surgery. Patients taking these medications will need to discuss the need/risk of
             continuing these medications with their physicians and the PI or study personnel may
             contact the treating physician(s) as well to discuss the risks of anticoagulation /
             antiaggregation therapy discontinuation.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Malignancy with &lt; 5 years life expectancy.

          -  Major medical co-morbidities: end stage renal failure, heart failure, severe
             congestive heart disease, severe respiratory problems, liver failure or other
             significant medical co morbidities.

          -  Major neurological disorder other than the one that led to the TPS.

          -  Patients may be excluded from enrollment due to a condition that, in the judgment of
             the PI, significantly increases risk or reduces significantly the likelihood of
             benefit from VC/VS DBS.

          -  Untreated / uncontrolled (severe at the time of enrolment) depression or other
             psychiatric disorder.

        <description>Pain Disability Index (PDI) directly measures disability related to the main components of daily life function and has been validated for thalamic pain syndrome. Range is 0 (no disability) to 10 (worst disability). The components are Family/Home Responsibilities, Recreation, Social Activity, Sexual Behavior, Life-support Activity, Occupation, &amp; Self-care. This is an average score of the 3 month period for each Active and Sham phase.</description>

In order to prevent too many patients from being randomized to ON or to sham early in the study, we will use, for the first 4 patients, randomization blocks of four or six. In this fashion, the first four consecutive patients will have two patients randomized to the Treatment Group and two patients in the Control Group.
