  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) may occur during cataract surgeries in patients
      treated with alpha 1 blockers. IFIS related to alpha 1 blocker Tamsulosin (used for prostate
      hypertrophy) was reported in 50-90% of patients. IFIS during surgery make the surgery more
      difficult and raise complication rate.

      Using anterior corneal incisions was reported briefly in literature as a prophylactic means
      but was not studied prospectively. we believe (according to our clinical experience) that
      these anterior incisions do help to reduce the incidence and severity of IFIS signs and
      complications rate during surgeries.
