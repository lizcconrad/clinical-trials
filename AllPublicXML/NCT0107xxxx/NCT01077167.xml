        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has signed an Informed Consent Form/Patient Information Sheet for this

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; / = 35% by most recent echocardiogram within 3
             months of enrollment. For patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), left
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment for eligibility must be performed at
             least 3 months after device implantation

          -  Treated for HF with optimal, stable pharmacological therapy. In general, optimal
             treatment will include a beta-blocker and an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)
             inhibitor and/or an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) at doses shown to be
             efficacious in Heart Failure (HF) trials, unless not tolerated. Stable medical therapy
             is defined as having no new HF drug class introduced 4 weeks prior to enrollment,
             although doses of all drugs may be adjusted throughout the trial

          -  Considered to be an appropriate candidate for study enrollment as determined by the
             patient's clinical laboratory findings, vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs)
             within normal range, or if outside of the normal range not deemed clinically
             significant in the opinion of the Investigator

          -  For female patients only: The patient is post-menopausal (≥ 1 year) or sterilized, or
             if she is of childbearing potential, she is not breastfeeding, her pregnancy test is
             negative, she has no intention to become pregnant during the course of the study and
             within 1 week following the last dose of omecamtiv mecarbil, and she is using highly
             effective methods of birth control. Postmenopausal female is defined as 12 continuous
             months of spontaneous amenorrhea confirmed by a serum follicle-stimulating hormone
             (FSH) result &gt; 40mIU/mL, or at least 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy (with
             or without hysterectomy) as documented in medical history (verified with an operative
             note, if available)

          -  For male patients only: Male patients agree for the duration of the study and 11 weeks
             after the last dose of omecamtiv mecarbil to use a condom during sexual intercourse
             with female partners who are of reproductive potential and to have female partners use
             an additional effective means of contraception (eg, diaphragm plus spermicide, or oral
             contraceptives) or the male subject must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse for
             the duration of the study and 11 weeks after the last dose of omecamtiv mecarbil.
