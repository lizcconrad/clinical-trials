      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the safety of adjuvant treatment with
      cisplatin plus gemcitabine for a period of 6 months after curative resection of
      cholangiocellular carcinoma

      Secondary objectives:

      Secondary objectives of the trial are to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the adjuvant
      therapy and to determine duration of response and patterns of failure compared to historical
      controls without postoperative treatment

      Exploratory objectives:

      To obtain blood samples and tumor tissue after resection for establishment and
      characterization of new cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and tumor antigens. Other aims are
      identification of tumor specific antibodies from blood samples, and characterization of tumor
      antigens with consecutive development of new specific immunological therapies, e.g.
      cancer-testis antigens (CTA) for tumor vaccination.
