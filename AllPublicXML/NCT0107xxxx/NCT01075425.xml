      RATIONALE: Belinostat and bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving belinostat together with bortezomib may kill more
      cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      giving belinostat together with bortezomib in treating patients with relapsed or refractory
      acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the recommended phase II doses for the combination of
      bortezomib and belinostat in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia (AL),
      myelodysplasia (MDS), and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
      I. Determine safety and tolerance and describe the toxicities of the combination. II. To
      demonstrate adequate methods for the assessment of pharmacodynamic response of leukemia cells
      from the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood in terms of effects on NF-kB (nuclear RelA by
      immunofluorescence microscopy), NF-kB dependent proteins XIAP and Bcl-xL, and BIM, and
      document pharmacodynamic responses observed in the course of this study. III. To document
      activity of the combination observed in the course of this study. OUTLINE: Patients receive
      belinostat IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and 8-12 and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed
      periodically.
