  <brief_title>Intraperitoneal Bortezomib and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>

    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of intraperitoneal bortezomib when
      given together with intraperitoneal carboplatin in treating patients with ovarian epithelial
      cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that is persistent or has come
      back. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may help carboplatin work better by making
      tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Infusing bortezomib and carboplatin directly into the
      abdomen (intraperitoneal) may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
      intraperitoneal (IP) bortezomib (BTZ) when administered with intraperitoneal carboplatin in
      women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that is
      persistent or recurrent and who have failed primary therapy and at least one second-line
      therapy.

      II. To examine the safety of administering BTZ in combination with carboplatin by the IP
      route.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate objective tumor response rate as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BTZ and carboplatin when administered
      intraperitoneally once every 21 days.

      III. To characterize the frequency of carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) when
      administered as an intraperitoneal infusion in the context of recurrent ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib intraperitoneally (IP) and carboplatin IP on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
