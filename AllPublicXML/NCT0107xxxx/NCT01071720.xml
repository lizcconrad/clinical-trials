    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of CKD-501 in healthy subject.

      And, secondarily, pharmacokinetic characteristics of the main metabolites will be identified.

    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers are administrated single-dose (CKD-501 1mg), two treatment(fed vs.
      fasting), two-period, two sequence crossover.

      Every time before and after each medication, PK parameters and safety of CKD-501 1mg is
      performed using a blood sample and conducting some tests respectively.
