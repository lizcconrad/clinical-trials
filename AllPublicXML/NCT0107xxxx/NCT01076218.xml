  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to confirm that the accuracy and safety of Version 1.5 of the
      FreeStyle Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitoring System are not impacted by the updates to
      the system algorithm and minor changes to the user interface and sensor delivery unit, such
      as adhesive sterilization method. It is anticipated that information collected will be
      submitted as a supplement to Premarket Approval Application (P050020) to the US Food and Drug
      Administration for approval to market this version of the system.
