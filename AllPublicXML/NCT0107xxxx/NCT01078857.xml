    <textblock>
      Neurological dysfunction is a common complication of late stage chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      and peripheral nerve system is often involved in such complication. Sensory disturbances such
      as paresthesia and hypoesthesia are the predominant symptoms in uremic polyneuropathy and it
      is traditionally thought the uremic polyneuropathy mainly involve large-diameter sensory
      nerves. However in uremic patients the abnormal thermal thresholds, the sensory symptoms like
      numbness, burning, paradoxical heat, cold or freezing, and pain, and the frequent symptoms of
      autonomic dysfunction suggest that small-fiber neuropathy should be a clinical entity in
      patients of CKD. But there are still few investigations with emphasis on the changes of
      small-fiber nerves in CKD, and little is known about the characteristics and mechanism of
      small-fiber neuropathy in CKD. Skin biopsy with evaluation of epidermal nerve density and the
      morphology of epidermal nerves and the subepidermal nerve plexus is an effective and
      minimally invasive test for assessment of small-fiber neuropathy. Contact heat evoked
      potential (CHEP) recording the brain responses evoked by contact heat stimuli on the skin is
      a non-invasive technique to investigate the thermo-nociceptive pathways mediated by
      small-fiber nerves. In the current study, we will use an integrated approach by combining the
      skin biopsy, quantitative sensory testing, autonomic function tests, and CHEP to investigate
      the pathological, psychophysical and physiological aspects of small-fiber neuropathy in
      patients of CKD. The aims of the current study is to address the following issues: (1) the
      changes of small fiber nerves in uremia and CKD of different stage; (2) the correlation of
      skin innervation with clinical manifestations, thermal thresholds, and autonomic function;
      (3) the influence of dialysis therapy, the type of dialysis therapy, or renal transplantation
      on the small fiber neuropathy in uremia; (4) the roles of blood chemical substances, metals,
      and endocrine profiles on the development of small-fiber neuropathy; (5) the relationship
      between the small-fiber neuropathy and pruritus or restless leg syndrome; and (6) the
      pathological and physiological correlates of painful symptoms by skin biopsy and CHEP in CKD
      related neuropathy. The results of the study will provide important insights in the
      understanding of the pathogenesis, and the prevention and new treatments of small-fiber
      neuropathy in CKD.

    <description>A 3-mm-diameter skin biopsy punch was taken at the lateral side of the distal leg and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Sections of 50 m perpendicular to the dermis were cut on a sliding microtome, quenched with 1% H2O2 in methanol, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated with rabbit antiserum to protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5, UltraClone, Isle of Wight, UK, 1:1000) overnight. PGP 9.5 is a ubiquitin carboxyl hydrolase, which labels myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers in the peripheral nervous system. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Vector, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h and the avidin-biotin complex (Vector) for another hour. The reaction product was demonstrated using chromogen SG (Vector).</description>
