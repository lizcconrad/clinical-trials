  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for patients with bone-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer is
      chemotherapy. If a patient elects not to choose chemotherapy, 70% will progress within 6
      months. KX2-391 given orally twice a day for 6 months will be evaluated for its ability to
      delay/prevent disease progression in patients who have not had prior chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial
      evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered KX2-391 in adult
      male patients with progressive bone-metastatic CRPC. Patients must have 1) documented
      bone-metastatic prostate cancer, 2) castrate levels of testosterone, 3) not received prior
      chemotherapy, and 4) documented disease progression based on rising PSA, progressive
      measurable visceral disease and/or progressive bone lesions (one criteria is sufficient) as
      per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines (Scher et al 2008).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must provide signed informed consent prior to performing any study-related
             procedures;

          -  The patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate
             adenocarcinoma;

          -  The patient must have presence of at least one documented osseous metastasis on bone
             scan;

          -  The patient must have a castrate testosterone level &lt;50ng/dl within 4 weeks prior to
             initiation of KX2-391 treatment. If chemically castrate, the patient must also agree
             to stay on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist medication for the
             duration of the study;

          -  The patient must have documented disease progression as evidenced by one or more of
             the following 3 criteria:

          -  Rising PSA, defined as three rising PSA values ≥ 2 weeks apart with the 3rd value
             2ng/ml or greater (historical values may be used). Rising PSA must be seen in the 3rd
             value relative to the 2nd value AND in the 2nd value relative to the 1st value (i.e.
             two consecutive rises over time muse be noted). Given potential for fluctuations in
             PSA values, one drop in rising PSA values over time may be seen when determining
             eligibility. Pre-therapy PSA doubling time may also be calculated (if there are 3 or
             more values 4 or more weeks apart.

          -  Evidence of nodal or visceral progression. Progression must be evident within 3 months
             prior to study entry.

             20mm in diameter may be counted.CT is preferred over MRI. The radiographic measurement
             technique used at Baseline must be serially used throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Evidence of progression of bone metastases on bone scan. Appearance of ≥ 2 new lesions

             entry).Documentation of bone metastases by bone scintigraphy (using PCWG2 criteria)
             within 4 weeks of study entry.
