  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using quantitative and qualitative data, this study will assess the impact of community
      accompaniment with supervised antiretrovirals (CASA) on HIV-positive individuals and
      community members in Lima, Peru.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-based accompaniment with directly observed antiretroviral therapy (DOT-HAART) may
      improve adherence and clinical outcomes among impoverished individuals starting HAART in
      resource-poor settings. Furthermore, the utilization of community health workers may build
      social capital. This is cluster-randomized trial, with randomization at the level of health
      centers. Individuals in both intervention and control clusters will receive community-based
      adherence support (monthly adherence visits) and standard care. In addition, individuals
      residing in intervention clusters will receive 12 months of community-based DOT-HAART. We
      will enroll patients as well as community members (health providers, treatment supporters,
      and community health workers) to assess individual and community-level outcomes.

    <description>For 8 months, DOT-HAART of all doses in the participant's home or alternate location. DOT worker ensures that HIV medications are taken as indicated and witnesses ingestion of all medications including other medications prescribed by physician. The worker will be trained to identify, triage and notify providers of any psychosocial and medical problems/complications. Transition to self-administration begins in months 9-12 when DOT will be tapered and greater participation of treatment supporter to prepare patients for self-administration.</description>
