  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous randomized trial showed a possible negative association with labor neuraxial
      analgesia with high compared to low doses of fentanyl, and breastfeeding at 6 weeks
      postpartum. The significance of this study would be to validate or refute these findings. In
      addition, we hope to better evaluate the impact of cumulative dose of fentanyl on
      breastfeeding success in the initial postpartum period as well as at 6 weeks and 6 months
      post delivery. In order to better assess the quality of breastfeeding, we will utilize a
      validated breastfeeding assessment tool, LATCH (Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of Nipple,
      Comfort, and Help). This validated tool can assess maternal and infant variables, define
      areas of needed intervention, and determine priorities in providing patient teaching. The
      LATCH assessment has been shown to be a predictor of breastfeeding duration. We also plan to
      vary the dosage of fentanyl analgesia to determine the relationship between doses below 150
      micrograms and changes in breastfeeding assessments. If a clear association between decreased
      breastfeeding and total fentanyl is identified, then regimens to reduce cumulative doses of
      fentanyl can be developed to improve the likelihood of breastfeeding success in mothers that
      desire to breastfeed.

      Prior observational studies have inferred epidurals negatively affect breastfeeding by
      decreasing maternal plasma oxytocin release which may adversely affect infant neurobehavioral
      development. In a study by Beilin et al., it was reported that mothers receiving a high
      cumulative dose (&gt; 150 microgram) epidural fentanyl were more likely to have stopped nursing
      6 weeks postpartum compared with groups receiving no fentanyl or those receiving &lt; 150
      microgram. The study however, was underpowered to detect differences in breastfeeding prior
      to hospital discharge. In addition, the breastfeeding assessment tool utilized resulted in
      binary assessments, and therefore, a global rating of the quality of breastfeeding was not
      available.

      Participants in this study will be asked to complete a questionnaire called the Intrinsic
      Motivation Inventory (IMI).

      Subjects will be randomized at the time they request neuraxial analgesia to one of three
      groups: Group 1: patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with bupivacaine 1mg/mL; Group
      2: PCEA with fentanyl 1 mcg/mL plus bupivacaine 0.8 mg/mL; Group 3: PCEA with fentanyl 2
      mcg/mL plus bupivacaine 0.625 mg/mL. Labor analgesia will be initiated in all groups using
      fentanyl 15 mcg plus bupivacaine 2.5 mg administered intrathecally. A basal infusion rate for
      the PCEA will be set at 8 mL/h with patient administered boluses of 8 mL every 10 minutes and
      a one hour limit of 32 mL. Breakthrough pain in all groups will be managed using
      anesthesiologist administered boluses of bupivacaine 1.25 mg/mL without fentanyl.

      The patient as well as individuals who evaluate the study patient will be blinded to the
      group assignment. Samples of maternal venous blood Â½ teaspoon (2 mls) and cord blood 2ml (1/2
      teaspoon) will be collected after the delivery of the fetus. Blood concentrations of fentanyl
      and bupivacaine will be ascertained using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
      analysis. Success of breastfeeding using the LATCH assessment tool will be measured by the
      lactation nurses within 24 hrs of delivery. At 6 weeks and at 3 months postpartum, follow-up
      phone calls by the anesthesia service will be made to assess for duration of breastfeeding.
      Also, the patient's obstetrician will be contacted to obtain the patient's Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Score to assess for postpartum depression, which may be a variable in
      decreasing breastfeeding success.
