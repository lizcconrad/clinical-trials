  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients
      receiving total knee replacement with the same implant using two different types of cutting
      guides during surgery:

        1. Standard knee cutting guides;

        2. MRI generated patient specific custom cutting guides.

      Both types of cutting guides used in this study are registered with the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and are routinely used for knee replacement surgery. However, it is
      unknown if one type of cutting guide has risks or benefits over the other.

    <description>Standard cutting guides use traditional instrumentation to determine knee implant positions. During surgery, a rod is placed in the leg bone and the cutting guide is attached to that rod.</description>

    <arm_group_label>MRI generated patient specific custom cutting guides</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patient specific cutting guides are custom-made for each patient based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Before surgery, MRI of the knee is done and used to create a cutting guide that is formed to the exact shape of the knee. The patient specific cutting guides have platforms that can be attached to the bone, so the rod does not need to be placed in the leg bone.</description>
