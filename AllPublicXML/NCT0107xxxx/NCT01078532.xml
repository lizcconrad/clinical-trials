    <textblock>
      This project seeks to improve health care outcomes in complex patients with cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) or who are at high risk for developing CVD by promoting patient
      self-management. This will be accomplished in 4 diverse, large primary care practices through
      the following 3 aims: (1) develop a patient-specific, active component to an existing
      electronic PHR directed towards patients with complex illnesses that is designed to reduce
      the risk of cardiovascular disease, (2) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the
      effectiveness of passive and active PHRs for improving adherence and clinical outcomes of
      complex patients in an ambulatory environment, and (3) enumerate the barriers and
      facilitators to implementation and use of an PHR among providers and patients in an
      ambulatory setting. To accomplish the aim 1, a users group will be assembled to determine
      which potential features of an 'active PHR' would be most acceptable and useful to them. To
      accomplish the 2nd aim, 1,000 patients with complex chronic disease leading to increased
      cardiovascular risk (i.e., CVD or 2 of the 4 conditions of hypertension (HTN), diabetes
      mellitus (DM), or hyperlipidemia requiring at least one medication for control) will be
      randomized to a passive PHR (n=500), or an active PHR (n=500) at 4 sites where the PHR
      currently is installed and in use. Outcomes to be assessed include improvement in control of
      risk factors (e.g., blood pressure), frequency of compliance with testing guidelines (e.g.,
      annual dilated retinal exams in DM), and clinical outcomes (e.g., myocardial infarction,
      hospitalizations). Aim 3 will be accomplished by surveying all participants using the PHR,
      along with nurses and physicians at the study sites, and by conducting focus groups of PHR
      participants, nurses, and physicians to determine the most useful features of the PHR and to
      barriers and facilitators of use.
