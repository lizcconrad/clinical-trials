  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance),
      double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being
      taken, or at what dosage), parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness
      and safety of ustekinumab compared to placebo in the treatment of patients with active
      psoriatic arthritis who have or are currently receiving treatment with a disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and/or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including
      those who have previously received anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents [(examples
      are infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira)]. The primary
      effectiveness endpoint will be measured by the reduction in signs and symptoms of arthritis,
      as defined by 20% improvement from baseline in American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
      measurements of arthritis at Week 24. The study will additionally look at higher levels of
      joint improvement (ie, 50% or 70% improvement from baseline) and improvement in activity and
      quality of life, as well as the impact of ustekinumab on psoriatic skin lesions. Safety
      assessments will be performed throughout the study and include obtaining and evaluating
      laboratory tests, vital signs (eg, blood pressure) and the occurrence and severity of adverse
      events (side effects). Patients will be assigned to one of three treatment groups. Patients
      will receive either 45 mg ustekinumab, 90 mg ustekinumab, or placebo at Weeks 0, 4 and every
      12 weeks until Week 40. Patients who do not have &gt;=5% improvement in their disease (tender
      and swollen joints) at Week 16 may be eligible to receive an increase or change to their
      ustekinumab dosage. Ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo subcutaneous injections at Weeks 0
      and 4 followed by every-12-week dosing with the last dose at Week 40. Early escape
      possibility at Week 16. Patients randomized to placebo will crossover to receive ustekinumab
      at Weeks 24 and 28 followed by every-12-week dosing with the last dose at Week 40. Expected
      duration of exposure to study agent including follow up for safety is 60 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response at Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR 20 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 20 percent improvement from baseline in swollen (66 joints) and tender (68 joints) joint counts and greater than or equal to 20 percent improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) Participant's assessment of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm), 2) Participant's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm), 3) Physician's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm) 4) Participant's assessment of physical function as measured by the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI) (score of 0-3 in 8 functional areas) and 5) C reactive protein.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Disability Index Score as Measured With the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI is 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 (no difficulty), to 3 (inability to perform a task in that area). The average score across the functional areas yields an overall HAQ-DI score which ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). In psoriatic arthritis, a decrease in score of 0.30 indicates clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants (With &gt;= 3% Baseline Body Surface Area (BSA) Psoriatic Involvement) Who Achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI 75) Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a physician-administered assessment tool used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). A PASI 75 response is defined as greater than or equal to 75 percent improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR 50 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 50 percent improvement from baseline in swollen (66 joints) and tender (68 joints) joint counts and greater than or equal to 50 percent improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) Participant's assessment of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm), 2) Participant's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm), 3) Physician's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm) 4) Participant's assessment of physical function as measured by the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI) (score of 0-3 in 8 functional areas) and 5) C reactive protein.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Total Modified Van Der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) Score for the Combined Radiographic Data From Studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The modified vdH-S score is a radiographic evaluation of hand and feet erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) for 20 joints per hand and 6 joints per foot with a total score ranging from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher scores and positive score changes indicate more radiographic damage and radiographic progression, respectively. As per protocol, the analysis for this outcome measure used pooled data from 2 studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and PSA3002) because initial power assumptions showed that 900 participants would be required to evaluate the impact of ustekinumab on structural damage (SD) progression. The 2 studies, (which had similar study designs and dosing regimens and differed only with regards to prior exposure to anti-TNFÎ± therapies), were intended to independently measure efficacy in terms of signs, symptoms and physical function, while effects on SD progression would be provided from an integrated analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Disability Index Score as Measured With the &quot;Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire&quot; (HAQ-DI)</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 (no difficulty), to 3 (inability to perform a task in that area). The average score across the functional areas yields an overall HAQ-DI score which ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). In psoriatic arthritis, a decrease in score of 0.30 indicates clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Total Modified Van Der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) Score for the Combined Radiographic Data From Studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002</title>
        <description>The modified vdH-S score is a radiographic evaluation of hand and feet erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) for 20 joints per hand and 6 joints per foot with a total score ranging from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher scores and positive score changes indicate more radiographic damage and radiographic progression, respectively. As per protocol, the analysis for this outcome measure used pooled data from 2 studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and PSA3002) because initial power assumptions showed that 900 participants would be required to evaluate the impact of ustekinumab on structural damage (SD) progression. The 2 studies, (which had similar study designs and dosing regimens and differed only with regards to prior exposure to anti-TNFÎ± therapies), were intended to independently measure efficacy in terms of signs, symptoms and physical function, while effects on SD progression would be provided from an integrated analysis.</description>
