    <textblock>
      We are doing a study to assess the impact of including patients in making decision regarding
      their own medical care in the emergency department. We will randomly assign them to either
      receive a decision aid or usual care. In doing this, we aim to increase patient satisfaction
      and safely decrease medical cost.
