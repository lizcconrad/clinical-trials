  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (SCH) is a devastating brain disorder with grave personal, family and social
      cost. SCH is a complex and heterogeneous (both genetic and clinical) disorder with
      oligogenetic endowed vulnerability risk of disease, which manifested as a clinical syndrome
      comprised of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms in late adolescent or young adulthood
      under the interaction with environmental stress. The fact that most positive psychotic
      symptoms can be well controlled by dopamine-blocking antipsychotics substantiates that
      dopamine hyperactivity is the pathophysiological model of SCH positive symptoms. This is the
      dopamine model of SCH.

      The presence of negative and cognitive symptoms has not being fully explained by the dopamine
      model. The hypo-glutaminergic function was hypothesized to replace or to supplement the
      dopamine pathological model. The hypo-glutaminergic state was due to a neurodevelopmental
      disturbance in early-stage of life, and was coined as a pathophysiological mechanism of SCH.

      The neurodevelopmental disturbance supports the hypo-glutamine model based on the
      cytoarchitecture abnormality in glutamate-pyramidal cells and reduced gray matter volume. We
      have found potential vulnerability genes of DISC1 and NRG1 in our Taiwanese SCH family
      samples. These two genes have functions on neurodevelopmental process. Besides, we, the
      investigators, also found two vulnerability genes of DRD2 receptor gene and COMT genes in our
      Taiwanese SCH families. The dopamine neurotransmission disturbance could be another
      pathophysiological mechanism of SCH.

      With the awareness of confounding variables of antipsychotic treatment response revealed in
      pharmacogenetic studies, such as drug metabolism related genes and plasma HVA level, we
      intend to test the etiological genetic hypotheses in antipsychotic treatment response: (1)
      The group of neurodevelopmental etiology with risk variations in DISC1 and NRG1 genes is of
      poor treatment response group; (2) The group of pure hyperdopamine etiology with risk
      variation in DRD2 receptor and COMT genes is of good treatment group.

      The potential treatment response related biomarkers, which are directly or indirectly induced
      by the etiological risk genetic variations, will be examined. These potential biomarkers
      include homovanillic acid (HVA), glutamate, serotonin, cytokines, and signaling proteins, the
      neurocognitive function, event-related evoked potential, Niacin skin test, and the AKT1 level
      in the peripheral lymphocytes.

      After obtained the informed consult, we'll recruit 30 drug-na誰ve early schizophrenia (first
      episode or prodromal stage) patients for pre-treatment and post-treatment assessment on
      treatment response using positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), changes in biomarkers
      (including biochemical, electro-physiological and neuro-cognitive variables), and brain
      imaging (studies of component Project No.2 of this Integrated Program) of PET, fMRI, MRI, DSI
      and MRS (please refer to Project No.2) in addition to genotyping on DISC1, NRG1, DRD2 and
      COMT genes. The treatment agent is the dopamine stabilizing agent (aripiprazole, 15mg/day for
      4 weeks) taking the advantage of dopamine activity balancing effect. Besides, we'll recruit
      30 normal controls matched with age, gender, and education, who will receive genotyping and
      evaluations in all biomarker variables, and brain imaging studies.

      In order to have adequate statistical power in the genetic analysis of 17 SNP variations in 4
      vulnerability genes of DISC1, NRG1, DRD2, COMT, we'll recruit 200 more cases of schizophrenia
      with duration of illness less than 5 years, who have received regular clinical follow up and
      had good compliance on medication. The treatment response will be evaluated using PANSS.
      These cases will also receive all biomarker examinations and genotyping studies. For
      comparison, we'll also recruit 100 normal controls for study.

      We'll delineate the heterogeneity issue of schizophrenia using genetic variation,
      neurobiological biomarkers. This study result will be beneficial for understanding
      pathogenesis of SCH, and for developing better treatment and prevention methods.

      The project will use the early stage and drug na誰ve schizophrenic patients as the study
      subjects. The specific aims are:

        1. To test the hypothesis that the patient group with good antipsychotic treatment response
           mainly carries the risk polymorphism of DRD2 and COMT genes (the dopamine transmission
           genes) while the group with poor antipsychotic treatment response mainly carries the
           risk polymorphism of DISC1 and NRG1 genes (the neurodevelopmental genes). This
           association is controlled by the polymorphism of genes of drug metabolizing enzymes.

        2. The good vs. poor treatment response group will have different manifestation patterns in
           biomarkers directly or indirectly related to neurodevelopmental or dopamine
           neurotransmission genes. These potential biomarkers included biochemical parameters,
           electrophysiological and neurocognitive indicators.

        3. The good vs. poor responder group has differential changes of the response-related
           biomarkers comparing pre-treatment and post-treatment status in special sub-sample of
           the drug-na誰ve early schizophrenia patients.
