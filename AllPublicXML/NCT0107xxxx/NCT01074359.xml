  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study. Twenty-one
      patients who qualify for the study will be randomly assigned to either active drug or
      placebo. The study will take place at Newcastle University. Patients will have a 66% chance
      of getting active drug. Patients will be required to take study treatment orally twice a day
      for 28 days. A baseline visit will occur within 21 days of screening visit. All patients will
      be followed for 1 week after completion of study or early withdrawal from the study.
