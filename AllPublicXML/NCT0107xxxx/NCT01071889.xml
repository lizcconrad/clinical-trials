    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatment with
      sublingual (s/l) Flumazenil in healthy volunteers as reversing the effect of the
      sleep/hypnotic drugs. This study is designed to collect short-term safety and tolerability
      data.

      In addition, the psychomotor/ cognitive and behavioral effects of Flumazenil will be assessed
      to monitor the degree and the duration of action in a single use of Flumazenil.
