      The primary objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      effect of two commercial preparations of interferon beta-1a (IFN Test: Lab Bergamo and IFN
      Comparator: Rebif Â® - Merck Serono Lab) after single administration (12.000UI) in healthy
      subjects by modifying the parameters Cmax, Tmax and AUC (pharmacokinetics) and the levels of
      2'5' oligoadenylate synthase and beta-2-microglobulin (pharmacodynamics).

      Secondly, safety will be observed (tolerability) clinically after administration of a single
      dose in study subjects, by comparing the clinical and laboratory parameters before and after
      study and the incidence of adverse events.
