      Primary Objective:

      To investigate the value of the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire (ECQ) against the
      ankle-brachial index (ABI) in Canadian patients mainly followed in general practice, with
      documented acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA)
      and who are not known to have peripheral arterial disease (PAD) at the time of enrolment.

      Secondary Objective:

      To collect data on the prevalence of PAD in this population as measured by ABI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented acute coronary syndrome (Unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction,
             Q-wave myocardial infarction) or/and documented ischemic stroke/transient ischemic
             attack (IS/TIA)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously known symptomatic or asymptomatic PAD confirmed by one of the following
             diagnostic methods or interventions (documented in the patient's medical record):

               -  Non-invasive or invasive vascular diagnostic tools (e.g.: ABI, Toe-brachial
                  index, Duplex ultrasound, Magnetic resonance angiography, Computer tomographic
                  angiography, Contrast angiography)

               -  Previous related intervention (such as angioplasty, stenting, atherectomy,
                  peripheral arterial bypass graft, other vascular intervention including
                  amputation)

          -  Patients whose ABI cannot be measured accurately

          -  Patients already in a clinical trial or a product registry

          -  Hospitalized patients

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
