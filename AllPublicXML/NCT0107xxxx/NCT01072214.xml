      A study to determine the safety and tolerability of pazopanib eye drops. The study will also
      determine how the drug is absorbed and metabolized over time. Repeat doses of eye drops will
      be administered to healthy adult volunteers over a 14-day period with one additional dose
      given on the 15th day of the session. Three groups of subjects may receive either active drug
      or placebo (drops without drug). The first group of subjects will receive a maximum of 1.6mg
      of pazopanib or placebo. The dose of drug to be given to the next two groups will be
      determined based on the results of the first group of subjects. The last group of subjects
      will be of Japanese descent.

      The purpose of this study is to characterize the ocular safety and tolerability, the systemic
      safety and tolerability, and the pharmacokinetic profile of repeat doses of a higher strength
      ophthalmic formulation of pazopanib, 10 mg/mL. The higher strength formulation provides an
      opportunity to increase the total daily dose of pazopanib administered. In this 3-cohort
      study, healthy adult volunteers will participate in one 14-day repeat-dose session (plus a
      single dose on day 15), randomized to receive either pazopanib eye drops or placebo. Subjects
      in cohort 1 will receive 1 drop four times daily for a calculated total daily dose of 1.6 mg.
      The dosage regimen for two subsequent cohorts will be determined based on the emerging safety
      profile. The Japanese population chosen for the third cohort will provide a safety and
      tolerability profile as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of pazopanib prior to further
      development of this formulation in Japanese patients with AMD.
