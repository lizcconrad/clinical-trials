    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline), Weeks 4, 8, and last postbaseline observation (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. Ratings of 1 - 10 mean the participant is in persistent danger of severely hurting self or others (e.g., recurrent violence) or persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death. Ratings of 91 - 100 indicate no symptoms, and the participant exhibits superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities. Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement in functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline), last postbaseline observation (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is a clinician-rated, 11-item checklist used to measure the severity of manic episodes. Information for assigning scores is gained from the participant's subjective reported symptoms over the previous 48 hours and from clinical observation during the interview. Seven items are ranked 0 through 4 and have descriptors associated with each severity level. Four items (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive behavior) are scored 0 through 8 and have descriptors for every second increment. The total scale is 0-60. A score of ≤12 indicates remission of manic symptoms, and higher scores indicate greater severity of mania. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in severity of mania.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants in Remission At Different Treatment Weeks According to the 30-Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician Rated (IDS-C30) Total Score</title>
          <description>A participant in remission was defined as a participant with an IDS-C30 total score of 11 or less.
The IDS-C30 is a standardized 30-item, clinician-rated scale to assess the severity of a participant's depressive symptoms. Every effort was made to have the same rater evaluate a participant across all visits.
Total scores range from 0-84, with a score of 0 indicating no depression and a score of 84 indicating the most severe depression.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set which includes participants who took 1 or more doses of study drug and who have at least 1 postbaseline IDS-C30 efficacy assessment. The denominator for calculating the percentages at each visit is the number of participants with a nonmissing value at that visit. Endpoint was the last observed postbaseline data.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 4, 8 and Endpoint in the Global Assessment for Functioning (GAF) Scale</title>
        <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. Ratings of 1 - 10 mean the participant is in persistent danger of severely hurting self or others (e.g., recurrent violence) or persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death. Ratings of 91 - 100 indicate no symptoms, and the participant exhibits superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities. Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement in functioning.</description>

        <title>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
        <description>AEs were graded by the investigator for severity on a three-point scale: mild, moderate and severe. Causality is graded as either related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in death, a life-threatening adverse event, hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may require medical intervention to prevent any of the previous results.
Protocol-defined adverse events requiring expedited reporting included skin rash, hypersensitivity reaction, emergent suicidal ideation or suicide attempt, and psychosis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The YMRS is a clinician-rated, 11-item checklist used to measure the severity of manic episodes. Information for assigning scores is gained from the participant's subjective reported symptoms over the previous 48 hours and from clinical observation during the interview. Seven items are ranked 0 through 4 and have descriptors associated with each severity level. Four items (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive behavior) are scored 0 through 8 and have descriptors for every second increment. The total scale is 0-60. A score of ≤12 indicates remission of manic symptoms, and higher scores indicate greater severity of mania. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in severity of mania.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The C-SSRS-B (baseline) was performed at screening and the C-SSRS-SLV ('Since Last Visit') was performed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 or last postbaseline observation. The Suicidal Behavior - Actual Attempt question records whether the participant committed a potentially self-injurious act with at least some wish to die since the last visit.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The C-SSRS-B (baseline) was performed at screening and the C-SSRS-SLV ('Since Last Visit') was performed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 or last postbaseline observation.
The Suicidal Behavior - Aborted Attempt question records whether the participant began to take steps toward making a suicide attempt but stops themselves before starting the potentially self-injurious act since the last visit.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that assesses suicidality from ideation to behaviors and monitors the potential emergence of suicidality in clinical studies. The C-SSRS-B (baseline) was performed at screening and the C-SSRS-SLV ('Since Last Visit') was performed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 or last postbaseline observation.
The Suicidal Ideation - Some Intent to Act Without a Specific Plan question records whether the participant has active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself and reports having some intent to act on such thoughts since the last visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and Endpoint (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>The safety analysis set includes randomized participants who took 1 or more doses of study drug. This question is asked if the answer to the 'Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts' question was YES, or based on the judgment of the assessor. The number analyzed includes participants with treatment assessments at the indicated time period.</population>
