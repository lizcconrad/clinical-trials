    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of an investigational antipsychotic drug (called OPC-34712) in
      adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) when taken with an approved
      stimulant medication to explore a possible impact on sleep, quality of life and cognitive
      function.

    <textblock>
      Subjects who have been taking prescription medication for ADHD, may be switched to a
      different one. In addition, subjects will be randomly (by chance) assigned to the
      investigational medication or placebo (pill without active medication). Total study
      participation lasts 6-20 weeks (up to 5 months). 675 men and women will be in the study at 40
      study centers throughout the U.S.
