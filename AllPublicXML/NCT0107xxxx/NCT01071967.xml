  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Care coordination, disease management, geriatric care management, and preventive programs for
      chronically ill older adults vary in design and their impact on long-term health outcomes is
      not well established. This study investigates whether a community-based nursing intervention
      improves longevity and impact on cardiovascular risk factors in this population. The results
      reflect the impact of one of the study sites (Health Quality Partners) selected by the
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to participate in the Medicare Coordinated
      Care Demonstration, a national demonstration designed to identify promising models of care
      coordination for chronically ill older adults. The study began in April 2002.

      The community-based nursing care management model developed by Health Quality Partners
      represents a comprehensive set of integrated preventive and monitoring services designed for
      older adults living with chronic diseases. The individual programs and services integrated
      within the model were selected on the basis of previously demonstrated evidence of
      effectiveness. The model is delivered in the communities in which participants reside. Care
      is delivered through in person contacts, (1 to 1 and group) as well as by telephone. In
      person contacts occur in the home, in readily accessible community and faith-based
      organizations, health facilities, or the offices of Health Quality Partners. Efforts are made
      to contact participants in the intervention group at least monthly with care continued until
      death, voluntary disenrollment, mandatory disenrollment due to changes in insurance coverage,
      relocation out of the service area, or change in long term level of care (e.g., nursing home
      placement, hospice).
