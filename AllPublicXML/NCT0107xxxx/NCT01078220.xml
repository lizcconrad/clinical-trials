    <measure>Incidence Rate of Syncope</measure>
    <time_frame>On day of each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Syncope was defined as the presence of a syncope diagnosis code in the emergency room or hospital setting in the vaccination risk period or in the post-vaccination self-comparison period. These codes could have represented a new event, a pre-existing event, a prior history of the event, a &quot;rule out&quot; diagnosis, miscoding, or a misdiagnosis. Consistent with the study's design, diagnosis codes for general safety analyses were not confirmed in this study.</description>

    <description>Cellulitis was defined as the presence of a cellulitis or abscess diagnosis code in the emergency room or hospital setting in the vaccination risk period or in the post-vaccination self-comparison period. These codes could have represented a new event, a pre-existing event, a prior history of the event, a &quot;rule out&quot; diagnosis, miscoding, or a misdiagnosis.
