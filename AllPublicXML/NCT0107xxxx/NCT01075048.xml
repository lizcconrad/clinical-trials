      ARQ 197 or placebo in combination with irinotecan and cetuximab in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer (CRC), in subjects with wild-type KRAS alleles who have failed front-line
      systemic therapy, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ARQ 197, define the
      recommended dose for Phase 2.

      After the recommended dose is determined for Phase 2, subjects receive study drug or placebo
      with irinotecan and cetuximab.

      Phase 1/2 Multicenter study:

        -  Phase 1 portion is open-label to evaluate the safety of ARQ 197 administered in
           combination with irinotecan and cetuximab.

        -  Phase 2 portion is designed as a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study to
           assess the efficacy and safety of ARQ 197 or matching placebo administered in
           combination with irinotecan and cetuximab.

             clinical trial or evaluation of the clinical trial results.

         13. Any condition that is unstable or that could jeopardize the safety of the subject and
             the subject's protocol compliance including known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
