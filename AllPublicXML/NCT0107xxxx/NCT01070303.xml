      The objectives were: (1) To demonstrate the efficacy of adalimumab in the long-term
      maintenance of clinical remission in participants with Crohn's disease; and (2) To delineate
      the long-term safety of adalimumab when administered to participants with Crohn's disease.

    <textblock>
      Study M02-433 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in the
      maintenance of clinical remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The study consisted
      of 2 phases: 1. a 1-year phase (Week 0 to Week 56) (NCT00055497) that consisted of a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled portion with a concomitant open label (OL)
      portion, and 2. a long-term open-label extension (OLE) phase (NCT01070303) that lasted 264
      additional weeks (Week 56 to Week 320).

      Participants who completed the lead-in study NCT00055523, were eligible to participate in the
      rollover study, NCT00055497. 176 participants were documented as having completed Year 1
      (NCT00055497); however, 177 participants were still receiving study drug and were evaluated
      at Week 56 of NCT00055497; these participants are included in the OLE data (NCT01070303).

      At Week 4 of NCT00055497, participants who demonstrated clinical remission (defined as a
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score &lt;150 points) at Baseline of NCT00055497 and who
      remained in clinical remission at Week 4 (&quot;Remitters&quot;) were randomized to receive 1 of 3
      blinded treatments: placebo, adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow), or adalimumab 40 mg
      every week (ew). Participants who did not demonstrate clinical remission at Baseline of
      NCT00055497 or who were no longer in clinical remission at Week 4 of NCT00055497
      (&quot;Non-remitters&quot;) were assigned to receive OL adalimumab 40 mg eow. All study drug (placebo
      and active) was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection.

      At any time during Study NCT00055497, a participant receiving blinded study drug who
      developed a disease flare could be switched to OL adalimumab 40 mg eow. A participant
      receiving OL adalimumab 40 mg SC eow who developed a flare or was a non-responders could have
      had his/her dose increased to 40 mg SC ew.

      After 1 year (Week 56 of NCT00055497), patients who were still participating could continue
      in the OLE phase (NCT01070303). Participants who were receiving blinded study drug were
      switched to OL adalimumab 40 mg SC eow, and participants who were receiving OL study drug
      continued on their previous OL adalimumab dose (adalimumab 40 mg SC eow or ew).

      Data are summarized for Remitters and Non-remitters, with the exception of data for primary
      reason for noncompletion. Summaries of primary reason for noncompletion were available only
      for all participants, not for Remitters and Non-remitters. Data are reported for Weeks 104,
      152, 212, and 260 of Study M02-433, starting from Week 0 of NCT00055497; these weeks
      correspond to 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of participation in NCT01070303. Change from Baseline
      results (clinical response 70, clinical response 100, Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire, and fistula remission) are calculated from Baseline of the lead-in study
      (NCT00055523). Results on each assessment at each measurement time point are presented as
      individual outcome measures because different numbers of participants were evaluated at each
      time point (as observed analysis).

    <description>IBDQ is a validated disease−specific instrument that assesses the impact of IBD on patient quality of life during a 2−week recall period. It has 32 questions about bowel function and related symptoms, and their social and emotional impact. For each question, participants selected 1 of 7 responses, where 1=poor quality of life (e.g., feeling of fatigue &quot;all of the time&quot;) and 7=good quality on the item (e.g., feeling of fatigue &quot;none of the time&quot;). IBDQ scores range from 32 to 224. Higher scores indicate better quality of life, and increases in IBDQ indicate improved overall quality of life.</description>

          <description>Participants who were still receiving study drug and were evaluated at Week 56 of NCT00055497 could continue into the OLE. In the OLE, participants who received double-blind study drug (adalimumab 40 mg) during the DB portion were started on adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow). Participants who received OL adalimumab 40 mg during the DB portion continued the dose they were receiving. Any participant who was receiving 40 mg adalimumab eow during the OLE and who experienced a disease flare (recurrence of active disease) could change to 40 mg adalimumab weekly. 176 participants were documented as completing Year 1 of the study; however, efficacy data were recorded for 177 participants at Week 56, and those participants are included in the OLE. Safety data are summarized for all participants (N = 276) who entered the study (NCT00055497).</description>

CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's−related variables during a 1−week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;/= 0 and without upper limit. The range of scores during Study NCT01070303 was 0 to 464. Scores at Baseline of the lead-in study (NCT00055523), which were used to calculate clinical response, ranged from 201 to 450.

          <description>A CR-100 is a decrease from Baseline of lead-in study (NCT00055523) in CDAI score of 100 or more points, indicating significant improvement in disease severity. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's−related variables during a 1−week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;/= 0 and without upper limit. The range of scores during Study NCT01070303 was 0 to 464. Scores at Baseline of the lead-in study (NCT00055523), which were used to calculate clinical response, ranged from 201 to 450. A lower score indicates less severe Crohn's disease activity.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving CR-70 at Week 212 (3 Years of Participation in NCT01070303)</title>
        <description>CR-70 is a decrease from Baseline of lead-in study (NCT00055523) in CDAI score of 70 or more points, indicating a significant improvement in disease severity. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's−related variables during a 1−week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;/= 0 and without upper limit. The range of scores during Study NCT01070303 was 0 to 464. Scores at Baseline of the lead-in study (NCT00055523), which were used to calculate clinical response, ranged from 201 to 450. A lower score indicates less severe Crohn's disease activity.</description>

        <title>Changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Scores</title>
        <description>IBDQ is a validated disease−specific instrument that assesses the impact of IBD on patient quality of life during a 2−week recall period. It has 32 questions about bowel function and related symptoms, and their social and emotional impact. For each question, participants selected 1 of 7 responses, where 1=poor quality of life (e.g., feeling of fatigue &quot;all of the time&quot;) and 7=good quality on the item (e.g., feeling of fatigue &quot;none of the time&quot;). IBDQ scores range from 32 to 224. Higher scores indicate better quality of life, and increases in IBDQ indicate improved overall quality of life.</description>
