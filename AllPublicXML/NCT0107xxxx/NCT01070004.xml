  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep deprivation induces degradation of night-time driving ability via sleepiness. Because
      of conflicts between physiological needs and social or professional activities, it is
      necessary to develop affordable countermeasure to sleepiness. In real-life driving studies,
      nap and coffee are efficient countermeasures of sleepiness at the wheel. However the effect
      of caffeine is quick but brief and varies between individuals. There is a need for more
      knowledge in order to know what to recommend to drivers. Exposure to 460-nm monochromatic
      light (blue light) decreases subjective sleepiness and improves performances. One objective
      of this project is to investigate whether blue light exposure during driving would be useful
      in a real driving situation when sleepiness becomes acute. Owing to the fact that our
      knowledge of the effects of exercise on driving is very sparse and to the absolutely need to
      standardize the bouts of exercise that will be applied to the subjects. One objective of the
      present study will be to investigate in a simulator study the effects of a bout of moderate
      exercise on participants driving ability when sleepiness becomes acute. Nocturnal
      neurobehavioral performance varies widely between individuals and only certain subjects seem
      significantly affected by sleep loss. It is of interest to find biological markers for sleep
      drive to identify vulnerable drivers to sleep deprivation or to identify responders to
      sleepiness countermeasures (i.e., coffee and blue light). One objective of this study is to
      determine individual differences (genetic, hormonal and cognitive) in the impairment of
      driving skills induced by sleep loss and in the efficiency of countermeasures (blue light and
      coffee).
