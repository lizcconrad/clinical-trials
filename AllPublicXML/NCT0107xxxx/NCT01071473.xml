    <textblock>
      This application proposes a prospective, single arm feasibility clinical trial of a 12-week
      period of combined endurance and resistance training in survivors of childhood cancer who
      were treated with doxorubicin and/or daunorubicin and have impaired cardiac function.

      Baseline and post intervention imaging, laboratory, and neuropsychological evaluations will
      be used to determine the effects of the intervention on body composition, serum lipid
      profile, exercise tolerance, and neurocognitive functioning. Participants will be called
      weekly to monitor compliance with the intervention. Incentives will be given at intervals
      during the trial to optimize compliance with the intervention.

      This study will evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week exercise intervention on the cardiac
      function of survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracyclines and known to have
      cardiomyopathy.

      As a secondary objective, the study will document the effect of a 12-week exercise
      intervention on exercise tolerance, as determined by measurement of peak VO2 and peak
      exercise workload, shortening fraction, ejection fraction, and left ventricular wall
      thickness, and assess the impact of the intervention on neurocognitive functioning in
      survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracyclines and known to have cardiomyopathy.
