  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of Pain/Heat in the Lower Extremities Scored by the Participants on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Following Intra-arterial Administration of ISOVUE-250 or VISIPAQUE 270 in Peripheral DSA</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after administration of agent using a power injector for the administration</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-centimeter Pain VAS was completed by the Group 1 patients to assess his/her pain level (not scoring heat separately from pain) in the lower extremity of interest. The scale was 0 to 10 cm, with the left end (0 cm)of the scale indicating no pain and the right end (10 cm) of the scale indicating the worst pain.
The 10-centimeter Pain VAS (excluding Heat assessment, which was separately assessed) was completed by the Group 2 patients to assess his/her pain level in the lower extremity of interest. The scale was 0 to 10 cm, with the left end (0 cm)of the scale indicating no pain and the right end (10 cm) of the scale indicating the worst pain.
Group 1 completed the Pain VAS (heat not separate from pain). Group 2 completed the Pain VAS for pain only and, separately, the Heat VAS for heat only.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of Heat in the Lower Extremities Scored by Group 2 as Assessed on the Heat VAS Following Intraarterial Administration of ISOVUE-250 or VISIPAQUE 270 in Peripheral DSA</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after administration of agent using a power injector for the administration</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-centimeter Heat VAS was completed by the Group 2 patients to assess his/her heat level (separately from pain) in the lower extremity of interest. The scale was 0 to 10 cm, with the left end (0 cm)of the scale indicating no heat and the right end (10 cm) of the scale indicating the worst heat.
The Heat VAS was completed by the patient before completing the Pain VAS to assess pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Participants With Significant Motion Artifacts (Scores of 3 or 4) Following Intraarterial Administration of ISOVUE-250 or VISIPAQUE 270 in Peripheral DSA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Using the following 5-point scale, the Investigator reviewed the images for motion artifact in vessels distal to the knee: 0 = None; 1 = Mild, not significant; 2 = Significant, but correctable; 3 = Degrades image quality; 4 = Images uninterpretable. Scores of 3 and 4 were counted as significant motion artifacts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Participants Requiring Repeat Injection(s) Following Intraarterial Administration of ISOVUE-250 or VISIPAQUE 270 in Peripheral DSA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed the images and recorded the number of repeat power injections required due to motion artifacts for each participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Participants With Adequate Quality of Opacification Following Intraarterial Administration of ISOVUE-250 or VISIPAQUE 270 in Peripheral DSA</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed all study images obtained for each patient using a 2-point scale (1 = adequate quality; 2 = inadequate quality); assessment was independent of factors or problems relating to the underlying patient condition or the imaging parameters selected.
Results are provided for patients with adequate quality.</description>

        <description>The 10-centimeter Pain VAS was completed by the Group 1 patients to assess his/her pain level (not scoring heat separately from pain) in the lower extremity of interest. The scale was 0 to 10 cm, with the left end (0 cm)of the scale indicating no pain and the right end (10 cm) of the scale indicating the worst pain.
The 10-centimeter Pain VAS (excluding Heat assessment, which was separately assessed) was completed by the Group 2 patients to assess his/her pain level in the lower extremity of interest. The scale was 0 to 10 cm, with the left end (0 cm)of the scale indicating no pain and the right end (10 cm) of the scale indicating the worst pain.
Group 1 completed the Pain VAS (heat not separate from pain). Group 2 completed the Pain VAS for pain only and, separately, the Heat VAS for heat only.</description>

        <title>The Number of Participants With Adequate Quality of Opacification Following Intraarterial Administration of ISOVUE-250 or VISIPAQUE 270 in Peripheral DSA</title>
        <description>The Investigator assessed all study images obtained for each patient using a 2-point scale (1 = adequate quality; 2 = inadequate quality); assessment was independent of factors or problems relating to the underlying patient condition or the imaging parameters selected.
Results are provided for patients with adequate quality.</description>
