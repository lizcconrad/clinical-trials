  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, dexmedetomidine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for short-term analgosedation (&lt;24h) in mechanically-ventilated critical care adult
      patients and sedation of non-intubated adult patients prior to and/or during surgical and
      other procedures. Trials are underway to investigate its pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy
      and safety in long-term use. Clinical experience with dexmedetomidine in the paediatric
      population is limited. Moreover, during childhood many developmental changes take place with
      consequences on drug exposure and drug response. Finally, critical illness itself can affect
      drug pharmacokinetics and -dynamics. Therefore, we cannot simply extrapolate adult data for
      use in children but we are in need of data on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in every
      paediatric subpopulation.

    <description>dexmedetomidine will be given max 48h. In case analgosedation is still needed after stop of the dexmedetomidine infusion, the treatment is switched to conventional analgosedation regimens.
Additional drugs are given to every inadequately sedated patient (assessed by regular Comfort scoring). In case of oversedation or adverse drug events (hypotension, bradycardia), a downtitration (or stop) of the dexmedetomidine infusion is needed.</description>

    <description>Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic modelling is limited to a maximum of 1,8 ml/kg (in line with the EMEA guidelines on maximum blood sampling in children). Pharmacokinetic parameters and influence of covariates on these parameters will be assessed by a population pharmacokinetic approach.</description>
