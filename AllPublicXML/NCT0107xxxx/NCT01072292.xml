  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-phase research study is being conducted. In Phase 1 of the study, the cognitive
      behavioral therapy intervention for insomnia was implemented in a small (n = 5) group of
      people with moderate to severe COPD and insomnia. The intervention was pilot-tested to
      determine feasibility and acceptability, and the intervention will be refined as needed. In
      Phase 2 of the study, a two-group randomized controlled study (n = 20) will be conducted to
      test the effects of the cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia intervention on the primary
      outcomes of sleep quality and fatigue and the secondary outcomes of mood and functional
      performance. It is hypothesized that people with COPD receiving cognitive behavioral therapy
      for insomnia will demonstrate significant improvements in sleep quality, fatigue, mood and
      functional performance as compared to people with COPD who receive a wellness program. This
      research will yield valuable information regarding effective interventions aimed at
      mitigating problems such as poor sleep quality, fatigue and reduced ability to perform valued
      daily activities. This information will be used to increase the likelihood of long-term
      successful outcomes such as the ability to maintain productive roles in society for people
      with COPD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will have moderate to severe COPD. Severity of COPD will be defined according
             to the new GOLD standards (moderate IIA (moderate), 50% &lt; FEV1 &lt; 80% predicted;
             moderate IIB (severe) 30% &lt; FEV1 &lt; 50%). 58

          -  Insomnia. Insomnia will be defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep,
             waking up too early or poor quality sleep. 59

          -  Subjects must be &gt; 45 years of age with no other major health problems

          -  Subjects must be clinically stable at the time of enrollment into the study without
             major exacerbation of COPD within the previous two months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of restrictive lung disease or asthma.

          -  Evidence of a major sleep disorder other than insomnia (sleep apnea evidenced by
             apnea/hypopnea index of &gt; 10, periodic limb movement disorder, narcolepsy).

          -  Hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic or antidepressant use.

          -  Pulse oximetry (SaO2) reading of &lt; 90% at rest.

          -  Significant sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index â‰¥ 10).

          -  .Acute respiratory infection within the previous 2 months.

          -  Class &gt; 2 functional status according to the New York Heart Association.

          -  The presence of a potentially debilitating disease such as cancer, congestive heart
             failure, kidney disease, liver failure or cirrhosis; evidence of alcohol or drug
             abuse, musculoskeletal or degenerative nerve disease.

          -  A self-reported current diagnosis of major depression or psychiatric disease or a
