    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a future trial that will assess
      whether an integrated intervention combining psychosocial counseling and supported referrals
      for antiretroviral therapy (ART) at any CD4 cell count and substance use treatment for
      HIV-infected people who inject drugs (PWID) will reduce HIV transmission to HIV-uninfected
      injection partners, as compared to routine care dictated by national guidelines for
      HIV-infected PWID.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, two-arm, randomized, vanguard study. Network units will consist of an
      HIV-infected index participant and his/her HIV-uninfected network injection partner(s).
      Network units will be randomized to the intervention or standard of care arms in a 1:3 ratio,
      stratified by site. To assess feasibility of the intervention, additional interviews will be
      conducted with study staff (systems navigators and counselors) and clinic-based stakeholders
      at each study site.

      Approximately 500 Index participants and their partners will be enrolled.
