  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a serious global health problem, second only to cardiovascular disease.
      Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease in the elderly population,
      characterized by loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and continuous destruction of bone
      microstructure, especially in postmenopausal women. It gives rise to bone fragility and
      fracture risk. Moreover, as people grow older, falls frequently occur with high severity, and
      nearly 35% to 45% of persons aged 65 or older fall at least once a year. Osteoporotic
      fractures increase mortality, morbidity, chronic pain, and the cost of social care and it
      decreases the quality of life. Here, investigators plan to perform different exercise
      interventions such as circuit exercise, aerobic dance and Tai Chi on the community's older
      adults to evaluate whether exercise intervention could improve the bone mineral density,
      physical fitness, muscle strength or quality of life.

    <measure>Change from baseline bone mineral density</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month-follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density measurement is measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Measurements are made over the lumbar spine and over the upper part of the hip and the measurement is assessed at Pre-intervention, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month-follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline elbow muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month-follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Extension and flexion of elbow were tested by the HUMAC NORM system (CSMi, Stoughton, MA) with the eccentric/concentric contraction mode at an angular velocity of 60 degrees/s.Isokinetic tests were performed five times for each participant, and each test was separated by a rest period of 3 min.The Muscle strength was present as a peak torque which was normalized to body weight (Unit:Nm/kg). The participants are assessed at Pre-intervention, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month-follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline SF-36 questionnaire assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month-follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. Eight sections including physical function, role limitation due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitation due to emotional problems, and mental health. Additionally, the eight health domains can be used to provide a physical component summary and mental component summary score. The outcome measurement is assessed at Pre-intervention, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month-follow-up.</description>
