      The purpose of the investigators'study was To compare 2 different diameter rigid hysteroscopy
      in vaginoscopic approach regarding pain during and after the procedure.

      And to evaluate patient acceptability and tolerability in order to determine the best way to
      perform hysteroscopy in an outpatient setting.

      Office hysteroscopy is used as diagnostic tool to investigate abnormal uterine bleeding and
      other diseases involving the uterine cavity one of The main limitation to its widespread use
      is feared from pain and low patient tolerability Narrower diameter hysteroscopy and
      endometrial biopsy devices are being developed to improve the acceptability of office
      hysteroscopy. Miniature optical systems allow performance of most diagnostic and operative
      hysteroscopy (after proper patient selection) in an outpatient or office setting .Flexible
      hysteroscopy seem to be less painful at the beginning and during the procedure ,but the
      optical qualities are poor Hysteroscopy is safe, feasible and accurate procedure for
      diagnosing intrauterine pathology.

      Provision of outpatient based diagnostic and operative services are gaining prominence as a
      standard of cure but the experience of pain can be off-putting for patients having outpatient
      diagnostic hysteroscopy.

      saline solution is an excellent alternative to carbon dioxide in women undergoing outpatient
      hysteroscopy, and there are fewer complications
