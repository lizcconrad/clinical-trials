  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage works in
      identifying biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with non-small
      cell or small cell lung cancer. Bronchoscopy uses a thin, tube-like instrument inserted
      through the nose or mouth to view the inside of the trachea, air passages, and lungs.
      Bronchoalveolar lavage washes out the bronchi and alveoli by flushing with a fluid.
      Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage may make it easier to help determine biomarkers that
      are more present in some cancers than others that will help determine which individuals have
      a greater or lesser chance of benefiting from immunotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To discover predictive immune biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitor
      therapy in individuals with primary lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine biomarkers that may be predictive of treatment related adverse events,
      specifically pneumonitis.

      II. To further elucidate lung immunologic microenvironment by performing single cell analysis
      in addition to mass cytometry (Cytof) on cells of bronchoalveolar lavage.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage over 45 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer
             (SCLC)

          -  Candidate to undergo immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for SCLC or NSCLC (ICI
             as any line of chemotherapy is acceptable) as deemed by individual's treating
             oncologist

          -  Enrollment into this study may occur in tandem with other clinical therapeutics trials
             occurring at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) as long as this trial does
             not violate protocol or inclusion criteria of that study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Coagulopathy with international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2.0 or

             T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)

          -  Subjects with an active or recent history of a known or suspected autoimmune disease
             or recent history of a syndrome that required systemic
             corticosteroids/immunosuppressive medications

          -  Respiratory failure requiring greater than 6 Lpm supplemental oxygen (O2) by nasal
             cannula or mechanical ventilation within the past six weeks
