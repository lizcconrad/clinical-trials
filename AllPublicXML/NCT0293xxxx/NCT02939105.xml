    <measure>Blinded independent review of photographs to assess change in visible arm fat between baseline (pre-treatment) and 12 weeks post treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be determined by correct identification of baseline (pre-treatment) vs. 12 weeks post-final treatment photographs by at least two out of three blinded, independent reviewers. Success will be defined as at least 70% correct identification of the baseline (pre-treatment) photographs.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female subjects &gt; 22 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age.

          -  Subject has clearly visible fat sufficient for treatment on the upper arm, which in
             the investigator's opinion, may benefit from the treatment.

          -  No weight change exceeding 5% in the preceding month.

          -  Subject agrees to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5% of total body weight) by
             not making any major changes in their diet or exercise routine during the course of
             the study.

          -  Subject has read and signed the study written informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History of a fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction, surgery, lipolytic agents,
             etc.), or implants in or adjacent to the area of intended treatment.

          -  History of prior surgery in the arms.

          -  Known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, cold agglutinin disease, or
             paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.

          -  Known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a response to cold
             exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.

          -  History of bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the investigator's
             opinion may increase the subject's risk of bruising.

          -  History of carpal tunnel syndrome, compartment syndrome or deep vein thrombosis in the
             upper extremities.

          -  Currently taking or has taken diet pills or weight control supplements within the past
             month.

          -  Any dermatological conditions, such as scars, infection, in the location of the
             treatment area that may interfere with the treatment or evaluation.

          -  Active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or drug delivery system.

          -  Pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 5 months.

          -  Lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.

          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements.

          -  Currently enrolled in a clinical study of any other unapproved investigational drug or
             device. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional
             opinion of the investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the
             integrity of the data or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.
