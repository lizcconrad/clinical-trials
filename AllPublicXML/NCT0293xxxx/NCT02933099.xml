    <textblock>
      To compare the antiemetic combination of palonosetron, dexamethasone, and aprepitant (PDA)
      with antiemetic combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone (PD) in nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma patients receiving docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU based chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive different antiemetic regimens . In the
      experimental group,patients will receive aprepitant, palonosetron and dexamethasone .In the
      other group,patients will accept the same dose of palonosetron and dexamethasone. During the
      treatment, any grade of nausea and vomiting should be recorded in order to evaluate the
      complete response rate of CINV,nausea patients will be measured by a visual analogue scale
      (VAS) ,other adverse events should be recorded as well.
