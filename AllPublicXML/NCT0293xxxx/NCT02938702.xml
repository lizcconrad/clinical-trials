      The study is a multi-center prospective cohort study of active surveillance in papillary
      thyroid cancer with low risk. The purpose of the study is to observe natural course of low
      risk papillary thyroid cancer in Korean population, and comparison of prognosis between
      active surveillance group and conventional surgery group. Patient will be well informed about
      their choice of active surveillance or surgery.
