  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, eccentric exercise can be realized in a dynamic way with an ergocycle wich permits
      eccentric (ECC) lower limbs contractions at a defined power output. With this type of
      ergometer, O2 consumption (VO2) in ECC is three fold lower than in concentric (CON) for the
      same power output. Consequently, ECC program could be used in chronic disorders with limited
      capacities, such as obesity.

      The investigators hypothesis that an eccentric training program, as it will induce higher
      mechanical constraints, would improve body composition, especially by reducing fat mass. This
      effect could be explained by an increased rest energy expenditure and a better improvement in
      biological parameters (particularly lipid profile and insulin-resistance) after ECC training
      (versus CON training).

      This study aims to compare the modification of fat mass after an ECC program versus a CON
      program at the same VO2. The secondary goal is to assess the physiological mechanisms
      involved in the modification of body composition

      Thirty adults will be randomized into 2 groups: CON or EXC. The patients of ECC group will
      follow habituation sessions (2weeks) to avoid the secondary muscular effects of high
      intensity eccentric exercise. The training program will last 12 weeks for the two groups.
      Before and after, each subjects will participate to the following measurements: total and
      segmental body composition (DXA), aerobic capacities (maximal incremental exercise test,
      VO2max), muscular lower limbs strength (isometric end isokinetic dynamometer), rest energy
      expenditure (indirect calorimetry), biological parameters (lipid profile,
      insulin-resistance), physical activity (actimetry), food intakes and quality of life
      (questionnaires).
