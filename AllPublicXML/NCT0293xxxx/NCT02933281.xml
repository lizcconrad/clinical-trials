    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, double-blind, randomized, BCG-controlled, dose-escalation safety and
      immunogenicity study in 120 healthy adults with and without LTBI. All participants will have
      received previous BCG vaccination in infancy. The investigational product is MTBVAC at four
      dose levels: 5 x 10^3 CFU, 5 x 10^4 CFU, 5 x 10^5 CFU, and 5 x 10^6 CFU. The active control
      is BCG (5 x 10^5 CFU).

      Participants meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized within a study
      cohort to receive a single dose of MTBVAC or BCG revaccination administered intradermally on
      Study Day 0. The study will be conducted at one site in South Africa. Participants will be
      enrolled into one of eight cohorts and followed for safety and immunogenicity endpoints
      through Study Day 182. The estimated time to complete enrolment is approximately 9 months.

      Cohorts 1-8 will include 60 QFT-negative (Cohorts 1-4) and 60 QFT-positive (Cohorts 5-8)
      participants. Participants will be randomized within each cohort, to receive either MTBVAC
      (N=96) or BCG (N=24). The cohorts will be enrolled as described in the protocol, as long as
      no pausing/stopping rules are triggered

             vaginal ring, or intrauterine device (IUD).

          5. Has general good health, confirmed by medical history and physical examination.

          6. Had BCG vaccination, documented through medical history or presence of scar.

          7. Has not shared enclosed living or work space with someone diagnosed with TB during the
             3 months prior to Study Day 0.

          8. [Cohorts 1-4] Does not have LTBI, determined by a negative QFT test at screening.

        or [Cohorts 5-8] Has LTBI, determined by a positive QFT test at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute illness on Study Day 0.

          2. Oral temperature &gt;37.5 degrees C on Study Day 0.

          3. Abnormal laboratory values from most recent blood collection prior to Study Day 0

             toxicity table, or if deemed clinically significant.

          4. Severe anemia, defined as &lt;10 g/dL or hematocrit &lt;30%.

          5. Suspicion or evidence (including but not limited to sputum Xpert MTB/RIF positive) of
             active TB disease at any site. An attempt must be made to obtain sputum from each
             participant; persons who are sputum unproductive will be assumed to be Xpert MTB/RIF
             negative.

             immunodeficiency state including but not limited to any laboratory indication of HIV-1
             infection.

         14. History of allergic disease or reactions, including eczema, likely to be exacerbated
             by any component of the investigational product.

         15. Previous medical history that may compromise the safety of the participant in the
             study, including but not limited to: impairment of pulmonary function from TB
             infection or other pulmonary disease; chronic illness with signs of cardiac or renal
             failure; suspected progressive neurological disease; uncontrolled epilepsy or
             infantile spasms; or diabetes mellitus.

         16. History or evidence on physical examination of any systemic disease or any acute or
             chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine, including axillary
             lymphadenopathy.

         17. Female participants: currently pregnant or lactating/nursing; or positive urine
             pregnancy test during screening or pre-vaccination on Study Day 0.

         18. Any current medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, could endanger the participant or make it unlikely
             that the participant will comply with the protocol.
