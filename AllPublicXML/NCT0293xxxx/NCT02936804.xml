      The present study is a single arm clinical trial aiming to improve the key technology in the
      diagnosis and treatment of early stage lung cancer. 60,000 high-risk subjects (age 45-70) are
      planned to recruit and assign to the Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) screening arm
      (Baseline + 2 rounds of biennial repeated LDCT screening). Management of positive screening
      test will be carried out by a pre-specified protocol.

    <description>LDCT was performed at baseline and 2 rounds of biennial repeated LDCT. The abnormal nodules were defined as noncalcified nodules (NCN) larger than 4 mm. The management of abnormal nodules including precision diagnosis by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), electromagnetic navigation bronchoscope (ENB) and peripheral biomarkers, and precision therapy by intraoperative frozen section guided lung resection and ENB radiofrequency ablation.</description>
