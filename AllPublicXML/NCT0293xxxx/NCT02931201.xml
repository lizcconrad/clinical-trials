  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative interpretation using the
      liver SUVmax as reference can better interpret 18F-FDG PET/CT and predict disease progression
      during chemotherapy or survival in DLBCL.

      In this study investigators develope a semi-quantitative interpretation using the liver
      SUVmax as reference to interpret 18F-FDG PET/CT. Positive lesions in PET were indicated as
      SUVmax of residues higher than the threshold (1.6 fold of liver SUVmax) or new 18F-FDG avid
      lesions. Investigators compare the prognostic accuracy of the liver SUVmax-based criteria
      with the 5-PS criteria and ΔSUVmax interpretation with respect to predicting disease
      progression during chemotherapy or survival in DLBCL. Furthermore,investigators improve the
      prognostic ability of interim PET/CT by comparing the results to the clinical prognostic
      factors.

    <description>18F-FDG PET/CT will be conducted before, during and after chemotherapy. Patients were instructed to fast for at least 6 h before PET. The blood glucose level was measured to ensure that it was &lt;200 mg/dL. 18F-FDG was intravenously administered at a dose of 3.7 MBq/kg. Approximately 60 ± 10 min post-injection, a whole-body acquisition commenced in 6-8 bed positions (1 min/bed) using a hybrid system (PHILIPS Gemini TF) and covered from the base of the skull to the upper thigh, which was followed by CT in a non-contrast phase (modulated 100 mAs; 120 kV; slice thickness, 3 mm) for attenuation correction and anatomical localization purposes. The head acquisition was performed in one bed position (8-10 min/bed).</description>
