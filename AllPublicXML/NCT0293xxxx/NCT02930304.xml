    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a painful musculoskeletal condition, which is
      considered to be due to overuse, over-stress or over-exertion of the wrist extensors of the
      forearm, especially extensor carpi radialis brevi.

      The aim of this study is to The compare the short-term effects of different physiotherapy
      approaches on pain, function and grip strength in the rehabilitation of patients with lateral
      epicondylitis.

      Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a painful musculoskeletal condition, which is
      considered to be due to overuse, over-stress or over-exertion of the wrist extensors of the
      forearm, especially extensor carpi radialis brevi. Different treatment approaches are
      described in the literature. The primary aim of the treatment approaches are decrease the
      pain and improve the functional level in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Thus,
      decreasing pain and regaining the functional performance in the daily living activity is
      essential in early diagnosed patients.

      The aim of this study is to compare the short-term effects of different treatment approaches
      on pain, function and grip strength in the rehabilitation of patients with lateral
      epicondylitis.
