        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp,
             defined by an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 2 at
             baseline/randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose scalp psoriasis necessitates systemic or other concomitant topical
             therapies during the study (concomitant treatment of body psoriasis with over the

          -  Patient has a scalp skin condition that would interfere with the diagnosis or
             assessment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp (e.g., seborrheic dermatitis, eczema,
             cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or other forms of psoriasis including guttate, inverse,
             pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis)

          -  Presence of pigmentation, extensive scarring, pigmented lesions, or sunburn in the
             treatment areas that could interfere with the rating of efficacy parameters, including
             planned extensive exposure to sunlight during the study.

          -  History of psoriasis unresponsive to topical treatments.

          -  Current immunosuppression or history of organ transplant.

          -  Patients who have a history of or current diagnosis of glaucoma.

             plan to have eye or eyelid surgery during the study.

          -  Patients with active infection (including but not limited to bacterial, fungal and
             viral infection) and/or open wounds on the entire head and neck area.
