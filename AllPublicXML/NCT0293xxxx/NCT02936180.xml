  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza, a vaccine-preventable respiratory disease, is ranked 8th among the causes of death
      in the Canadian population. Among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, the incidence of both
      seasonal influenza and serious influenza-related illness (IRI) are increased. Despite being a
      high priority group targeted for vaccination, the diagnosis of RA and other patient-specific
      factors (i.e. older age, treatment, current smoking) are linked to impaired vaccination
      responses.

      Thus the burden of influenza among people with RA is disproportionally high, and
      interventions to improve responses to influenza vaccination are urgently needed. Strategies
      to optimize protection in another vulnerable group, the elderly, include the use of
      quadrivalent vaccines, higher antigen doses, and adjuvants. A high-dose, trivalent,
      inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-TIV) has recently been shown to have a similar safety
      profile to standard dose vaccine (SD-TIV) with improved immunogenicity and protection in
      adults ≥65 years of age. Whether or not analogous strategies to improve responses to
      influenza vaccine will enhance protection in people with RA is unknown. The investigators
      hypothesize that the use of the HD-influenza vaccine will improve vaccine-induced protection
      (i.e. seroconversion and seroprotection) in people with RA compared to SD-influenza vaccine.
      The investigators propose to conduct a stratified, randomized, modified double blind,
      active-controlled trial to assess immune responses to two commercial influenza vaccines
      containing different antigen doses in individuals with RA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of seropositive RA (rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-CCP antibody
             positive) based on the 2010 ACR-EULAR criteria.

          2. At least 6 months of treatment including anti-TNF agents, abatacept, rituximab (dose
             received within the previous 6 months) and/or methotrexate.

          3. Informed consent form signed and dated.

          4. Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Vaccination against influenza in the 6 months preceding the trial vaccination.

          2. Systemic hypersensitivity to eggs, chicken proteins, or any of the vaccine components,
             or a history of a life-threatening reaction to TIV or to a vaccine containing any of
             the same substances.

          3. History of Guillain-Barré syndrome within six weeks of a previous influenza
             vaccination.

          4. Dementia or any other cognitive condition that could interfere with the trial
             procedures.

          5. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorder contraindicating IM vaccination (according to
             treating rheumatologist).

          6. Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction.

          7. Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever. If this exists, vaccination
             will be deferred until the individual has been medically stable and/or afebrile for at
             least 24 hours.

          8. Signs and symptoms of an acute infectious respiratory illness. If this exists,
             vaccination will be deferred until the symptoms resolve.

          9. Pregnant women (the rationale for excluding this group is not their lack of indication
             for vaccination but the changes of maternal immune responses during pregnancy)
