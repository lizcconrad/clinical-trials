  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preventing or reducing obesity is one factor that has been hailed as a way to improve quality
      of life, reduce recurrence, and increase survival rates among breast cancer survivors. An
      experienced team of multi-disciplinary researchers has developed an innovative and unique
      approach to encourage enhanced nutrition and exercise behaviors in this population using
      principles of behavioral economics. In particular, the use of social norms or exemplars has
      been shown in other applications to be effective, and if successful in this population could
      be inexpensively scaled up for widespread adoption. The proposed pilot study develops a
      system of text messages for social/mobile media that will provide ongoing reinforcement of
      desired behavior in breast cancer survivors. These messages would focus on achieving
      compliance with the expert-developed nutrition and exercise recommendations of the American
      Cancer Society. In the main study, 310 breast cancer survivors will be randomly placed in
      intervention and control groups for the 12 week study. Behavior change will be measured using
      established measures of self-reported behavior. In a sub-study, 60 of the breast cancer
      survivor participants will also provide blood and urine samples so changes in biomarkers can
      be assessed. The impact of the study will be measured by biomarkers and self-reported survey
      responses.

    <description>The subjects in the intervention group will receive text messages with nutrition and physical activity-related information throughout the study period on a daily basis, varying text message arrival over a 10 am to 7 pm time frame. The American Cancer Society recommends a set of exercise and nutrition behaviors for cancer survivors based upon developed expert evidence. These behaviors have been structured to achieve healthier lifestyles, improve quality of life and reduced mortality. The intervention will provide via text messaging exemplars and social norms designed to improve compliance with this advice.</description>
