  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In proximal urea cycle disorders (UCD), particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency
      (OTCD), hyperammonemia (HA) causes increased brain glutamine (Gln) which perturbation is
      thought to be at the core of the neurological injury. In contrast, in distal UCD such as
      citrullinemia (argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency; (ASSD) and argininosuccinic aciduria
      (argininosuccinate lyase deficiency); (ASLD) cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric
      disease are common even in the absence of acute HA. As a consequence, both citrulline and
      argininosuccinate (ASA) or their metabolic products have been implicated as neurotoxic. In
      this project the investigators will use state-of- the-art neuroimaging and neuropsychological
      methods to investigate whether patients with OTCD have chronically elevated brain Gln and
      reduced myo-inositol (mI) levels that correlate with regional brain structural abnormalities
      and neurocognitive dysfunction. The researchers will further investigate whether during an
      acute episode of HA elevated brain Gln and decreased mI levels correlate with the magnitude
      of cytotoxic edema and whether a Gln/mI ratio threshold can be identified at which the
      cytotoxic edema is followed by cell loss. Finally, the researchers will investigate whether
      regions of brain damage in ASSD and/or ASLD are distinct from those in OTCD and compare brain
      Gln levels in ASSD and ASLD in the absence of HA to those in OTCD. The investigators will
      also seek to determine if brain citrulline and ASA can be identified in the brains of
      patients with distal UCD and whether they correlate with brain abnormalities seen in MRI and
      neuropsychological testing. This project will elucidate the chronology of brain pathology
      both in acute hyperammonemia and chronic UCD and whether, proximal and distal UCD differ in
      their pathophysiology of brain damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UCDs are a group of rare genetic diseases that affect how protein is broken down in the body.
      The cause of UCDs is a deficiency in one of eight enzymes responsible for removing ammonia, a
      waste product of protein metabolism, from the bloodstream. Normally, ammonia is converted
      into urea and then removed from the body in the form of urine. However, in people with UCDs,
      ammonia accumulates unchecked and is not removed from the body. Toxic levels of ammonia can
      build up and cause irreversible neurologic damage that can affect metabolism, cognition,
      sensation, and movement. This study will focus on the most common enzyme disorder among UCDs,
      ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), a disorder inherited from mothers. Using
      different types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study will evaluate how UCD-related
      neurologic injuries affect metabolism, cognition, sensation, and movement in adults with
      OTCD.

      This study will be separated into three sections. The first study will study longitudinal
      changes in OTCD. The second section will study the recovery of OTCD participants from a
      hyperammonemic episode over time. The third section will be a longitudinal study of the
      distal urea cycle disorders. In all cases, participants in this study will attend an initial
      study visit that will include a review of medical history, current symptoms, impairments, and
      diet history; a physical exam; a full neurological exam; and cognitive and motor testing.
      During this visit, participants will undergo imaging studies and additional cognitive and
      motor testing over a 1-2-day period. This will include standard MRI studies and four sessions
      consisting of functional MRI (fMRI) (CNMC only), diffusion tensor imaging, and 1H magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy. For the fMRI study, participants perform various motor and behavioral
      tasks while in the imaging scanner. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is used to study
      and evaluate the chemical makeup of specific brain areas. Diffusion tensor imaging is used to
      assess myelination of major brain pathways and their alteration in disease states. This study
      will involve multiple time point participation. The study will be conducted at Children's
      National Medical Center and Boston Children's Hospital.

    <description>Concentration based on area under curve on 1H MRS and quantitated by LCModel. A metabolite's tissue concentration is related to the integrated amplitude of the MRS signal it produces. Integrated amplitude is the area under the MRS signal curve. While MRS signals are usually acquired in the time domain as free induction decays or echoes, they are usually viewed and analyzed in the frequency domain. The frequency domain representation is derived from the acquired time domain data by the Fourier Transform. The protocols used selects 257 averages. This means, 257 free induction decays. The machine summates the data at each time point to generate one value for the area under the curve. Therefore, we don't have the measurement at each time point.
Furthermore, we measured voxels in two different brain areas containing different kinds of brain matter: one voxel was located in posterior cingulate gray matter (PCGM) and the other in parietal white matter (PWM).</description>

    <description>Measure of white matter integrity in OTCD Patients and Controls in frontal white matter. Fractional anisotropy values fall on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 meaning that the diffusion of water is isotropic and unrestricted, or equally restricted, in all directions and with 1 meaning that diffusion occurs along only one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. Scores closer to 1 are associated with intact white matter while scores closer to 0 are associated with white matter damage.</description>
