  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare maternal and early neonatal outcomes of abdominal disimpaction with
      lower uterine segment support in comparison to the classic &quot;push&quot; method for delivery of
      impacted fetal head during Cesarean section for obstructed labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructed labor refers to failure of labor progress in spite of good uterine contractions
      and is attributed to mismatch between the size of the presenting part of the fetus and the
      mother's pelvis. Approximately 8% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributed to obstructed
      labor and subsequent puerperal infection, uterine rupture, and postpartum hemorrhage.

      In these situations, Cesarean section could minimize maternal and neonatal morbidity.
      However, Cesarean section is challenging when the head is deeply impacted and is associated
      with high risk of maternal injuries and perinatal injuries. The most common complication is
      extension of uterine incision which could involve the vagina, bladder, ureters and broad
      ligament. Neonates are also at risk of skull fractures, cephalhematoma, and subgaleal
      hematoma mainly due to manipulations. Currently, the most popular approaches for fetal head
      delivery are the push and pull methods. Although push method seems to be more convenient and
      does not necessitate extensive experience, it is more significantly associated with extension
      than the pull method. Although pull method seems to be more safe, it is more difficult to
      perform and usually warrants an aggressive uterine incision to deliver the fetus. In 2013,
      investigators published a case series on abdominal disimpaction with lower uterine segment
      support which basically allows obstetricians to deliver the fetal head through a transverse
      uterine incision with minimal risk of extensions and neonatal complications. In this study,
      investigators aim to validate this approach in comparison to the classic push method.

    <description>Abdominal disimpaction with lower uterine segment support: the edge of the lower uterine segment is grasped by 4-5 Allies forceps applied 1.5 to 2 cm apart from the other along the lower edge of the incision until it is completely supported. These forceps are handled by the assistant, and gentle traction is applied upward, perpendicular to the uterine surface and away from the fetal head without excessive force. Accordingly, the hand of the surgeon could be inserted into the uterine cavity, and adequate space for manipulations is available without applying pressure on the lower segment. The fetal head is eventually grasped and delivered.
