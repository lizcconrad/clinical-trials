  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary long-term objective of this research is to reduce smoking relapse through the use
      of automated mobile smoking cessation interventions that tailor content (e.g., treatment
      messages/materials) in real-time based upon currently present symptoms. The primary
      short-term objective of this pilot study is to determine the initial utility of a novel
      smartphone based smoking cessation intervention compared with standard in-person smoking
      cessation clinic care and the free National Cancer Institute (NCI) QuitGuide smoking
      cessation application. The current pilot study is a 3 armed randomized clinical trial that
      aims to determine the initial utility of a novel smartphone based smoking cessation
      intervention compared with standard in-person smoking cessation clinic care and the free NCI
      QuitGuide smoking cessation application.

      Description of Study Visits.

      Screening and Baseline Assessment (Visit 1). Individuals attending the orientation visit of
      the Tobacco Treatment Research Clinic (TTRC) will be provided with detailed information about
      the study and given the opportunity to have their questions answered within a private room to
      ensure confidentiality. Study staff will review the consent form with interested
      participants, and they will be screened for eligibility on-site in a private room in the
      clinic. Participants will be questioned about their 1) age, 2) current level of smoking, 3)
      willingness to quit smoking, and 4) willingness/ability to attend 4 sessions (including the
      first visit). Participants will be randomized to treatment as usual (TAU), QuitGuide, or
      Smart-T groups and advised of their group assignment. Participants will complete the
      assessment portion of visit 1. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a
      laptop/tablet computer; and weight, and height will be measured in a private room to ensure
      confidentiality. Participants will be loaned an Android smartphone and instructed regarding
      the use of the phone as well as the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures.

      Quit Day (Visit 2). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a laptop/tablet
      computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a private room to ensure
      confidentiality. Participants will compensated completion of the in-person assessments. All
      questions about study phones will be appropriately addressed and answered. Participants who
      do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their self-reported smoking status.

      4 Weeks Post-Quit (Visit 3). Participants will complete self-report questionnaires on a
      laptop/tablet computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a private room to
      ensure confidentiality. Participants will be compensated for the completion of the in-person
      assessments, which will take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete. When participants
      return the phone they will be compensated according to the compensation schedule described
      above. Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their
      self-reported smoking status and to request that the study phone be returned by mail or
      in-person at the next visit.

      12 Weeks Post-Quit (Visit 4; Follow-Up). Participants will complete self-report
      questionnaires on a laptop/tablet computer; and expired CO and weight will be measured in a
      private room to ensure confidentiality. Participants will be compensated for the completion
      of the in-person assessments, which will take approximately 60 minutes to complete.
      Participants who do not attend will be contacted by phone to obtain their self-reported
      smoking status.

    <description>Behavioral: Treatment as Usual (TAU) is the Tobacco Treatment Research Program (TTRP) which offers all components of an intensive tobacco treatment intervention including: 1) initial assessment of willingness to participate, 2) the use of multiple types of clinicians, 3) at least 4 treatment sessions, in an individual- or group-counseling format, that are greater than 10 minutes in duration, 4) counseling that includes problem-solving, skills training, and social support components, and 5) and the opportunity to use effective medications to aid in tobacco cessation.</description>

    <description>Behavioral: The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) QuitGuide app is a free smartphone app that is available through the Smokefree.gov website. Participants can track cravings, smoking triggers, and motivations for quitting. Participants who are randomly assigned to the QuitGuide app group will receive a smartphone that is preloaded with the QuitGuide app and a quit date scheduled for 1 week after the baseline visit.</description>
