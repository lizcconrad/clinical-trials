    <textblock>
      That study combines High Frequency Percussive Ventilation (HFPV) with radiotherapy treatment
      in patients with tumors that are moving with respiration like breast or lung cancers. The use
      of a High Frequency Percussive Ventilation system leads to the cessation of respiratory
      motions while administering radiotherapy (RT) to tumors which allows a reduction of the
      amount of irradiated normal tissues and which potentially decrease radiation-induced
      collateral damages.

      Primary objective :

      Demonstrate the clinical benefit of the HFPV coupled to thoracic radiotherapy in 2 distinct
      and frequent clinical situations :

        1. Tomotherapy for lung and left breast tumors. The investigators assume that the volume of
           irradiated healthy tissue will be much less when using HFPV as compared to free
           breathing during tomotherapy sessions .

        2. In comparison with Active Breathing Control (ABC system). The investigators assume that
           the HFPV will lead to breathing motions cessation the same way as the ABC system, but
           will abrogate pause times when administrating the radiotherapy. This will shorten the
           radiotherapy sessions for lung patients treated with stereotaxis and for breast cancer
           patients.

    <description>Radiotherapy treatment fractions (locally advanced lung: 33 fractions). Each patient will undergo a planning CT scan: one with HFPV and one without. The CT scan is done after the patient has been registered in the study and before treatment start.
Dose distribution will be determined for both situations and patients will be treated with the most favourable one.</description>

    <description>Lung (5 fractions) or breast (25 fractions). Each patient will undergo a planning CT scan: one with HFPV and one without. The CT scan is done after the patient has been registered in the study and before treatment start.
The time of fractions administration will be compared to theoretical times of treatment when patient is free breathing (lung 45 min for 12Gy/ breast 10 min for 2Gy).</description>
