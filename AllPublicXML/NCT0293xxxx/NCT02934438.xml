  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability is a hallmark of a number of cardiovascular diseases
      (CVD) including peripheral artery disease (PAD). The investigators will test the hypothesis
      that sub-chronic NEO40™ supplementation will improve vascular NO function and improve
      intermittent claudication in patients with PAD. Using a prospective, double blind, placebo
      controlled experimental design in 30 patients, graded treadmill tests will be performed at
      baseline and after 3 months after randomization, according to the Skinner-Gardner protocol.
      Initial claudication distance (ICD) and absolute claudication distance (ACD) will be
      recorded. Two consecutive treadmill tests will be performed within 1 week at baseline (before
      administration of study drug); and 2 test will be performed at 3 months. Functional status
      will also be assessed by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire and the Health Status Survey
      SF-36 questionnaire (SF-36). Vascular function will be assessed with the use of a Vendys®
      vascular reactivity (endothelial function) test (Endothelix Inc). Digital pulse amplitude
      will be assessed using sensor probes on the index finger during reactive hyperemia. Blood
      will be collected for measurement (by Neogenis) of plasma levels of nitrite and nitrate at
      baseline and at the completion of the study. Based on previously published trials using this
      NO technology, the investigators predict that the group receiving the active supplement will
      exhibit an improvement in claudication distance and all measures of vascular function after 3
      months.

    <description>Utilizing intellectual property developed out of the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, Neo40 is a GMP certified, over the counter, all natural formulation that provides a system for generating NO in an endothelium-dependent and independent manner. The NEO40™ Daily™ product ingredients list and packaging was submitted to FDA Office of Compliance by Neogenis Labs, Inc. for use as a dietary supplement. It is made up of Beet root extract, hawthorne berry, Vitamin C, L-citrulline and sodium nitrite. The lozenges utilize natural product chemistry activated by the saliva to generate authentic NO gas in the oral cavity through the one-electron reduction of nitrite. This product's formulation was designed to be a quick dissolve that melts in the mouth within four to five minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons of at least 45 years of age

          -  Persons with unilateral or bilateral PAD confirmed by a resting ankle-brachial index
             (ABI) &lt;0.9

          -  Persons with stable intermittent claudication for the previous 3 months

          -  Persons with the ability to walk 1 to 12 minutes on a treadmill. The pre-randomization
             treadmill test is limited by exercise-induced leg pain, which is relieved by cessation
             of the test. Variability of maximum walking distances between 2 consecutive screening
             treadmill tests will be &lt;10%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons with ischemic rest pain, ulceration or gangrene

          -  Persons with history in the previous 3 months of acute coronary syndrome or
             revascularization involving the peripheral or coronary arteries

          -  Persons with major amputation

          -  Persons with malignancy within the previous 5 years (except for treated non-melanoma
             skin cancer)

          -  Persons with proliferative retinopathy

          -  Persons with uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Persons with active inflammatory, infectious, or autoimmune diseases.
