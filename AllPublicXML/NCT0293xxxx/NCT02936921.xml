  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several decades ago, France has made the choice to implement a national prevention program
      for congenital toxoplasmosis. The identification in their first trimester of pregnancy of all
      pregnant women who are susceptible to Toxoplasma infection has been mandatory since 1985. In
      1992, the decision was made to extent the program to the monthly retesting of all women
      identified as not immune, in an attempt to reduce the number of severely infected children.

      The systematic detection of all maternal and congenital infections has generated many
      questions from clinicians, biologists, parents and older patients, on the short and long-term
      prognosis of congenital toxoplasmosis, on the best tests to use to diagnose infections in
      mothers and children, on the efficacy of existing treatments, and on how to manage patients
      in the long-term.

      The need to answer these many questions has prompted the medical team working within the
      laboratory and the outpatient department of the Parasitology Department at the Croix-Rousse
      Hospital in Lyon to implement a clinical research program. It is based on the systematic
      inclusion in our cohort of all pregnant women whose infection is confirmed, on their follow
      up, in order to monitor the outcome of pregnancy 2) and on the follow up of their children in
      order to confirm their infection or to rule it out. All congenitally infected subjects
      undergo clinical examinations, serological tests and ocular examination at least once a year
      without age limit.

      The following data are prospectively collected in a dedicated database: gestational age at
      maternal infection and corresponding serological profile; type and dates of maternal
      treatment; findings of ultrasound tests and amniotic fluid analysis; serological and clinical
      findings at birth; types and dates of postnatal treatment; postnatal serological profiles;
      infection status at one year of age; long term clinical (ophthalmologic) et serological
      findings.

      These data have allowed producing original findings on the risk of maternal-foetal
      transmission according to gestational age at maternal infection, on the long term
      ophthalmological outcome of congenital toxoplasmosis and to offer guidelines for the
      diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of maternal and congenital infections.

      These efforts are still to be maintained in the future in order

        -  to further analyse the impact of puberty, pregnancy, or adult co-morbidities on the risk
           of ophthalmological events

        -  to increase precision around our risk estimates for materno-foetal transmission,

        -  to continue innovating in terms of diagnostic strategy to improve tests performances and
           reduce costs

        -  to explore new potential clinical outcomes such as neuropsychiatric disorders associated
           with congenital and postnatal infection

        -  to determine if infections due to oocysts could have different clinical outcomes than
           those due to the ingestion of cysts

        -  to assess the efficacy of treatments for maternal and congenital infections
