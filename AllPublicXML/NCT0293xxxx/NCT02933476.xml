    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the possibility of a new, non-invasive, non-drug
      treatment for Parkinson's disease. The treatment involves gentle vibratory stimulation
      delivered to the fingertips (called 'vibrotactile stimulation'). Along with the treatment,
      participants will also undergo kinematic testing.

      Patient will be phone screened and/or have a physical and neurological examination to
      determine if it is appropriate for them to participate in this study. This testing includes
      the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III (UPDRS III). Research assistants will
      explain the study and obtain informed consent. There will be three consecutive days of
      testing, as well as 2 follow up visits at 1 and 4 weeks. Visits include the following:
      Patients will have sensors put on their hands, feet, and chest. These sensors measure their
      movement while they perform kinematic tasks such as forward walking, wrist movements, and the
      UPDRS III. Patients will also be given vibrotactile stimulation for a total of 4 hours
      throughout the day. During this time, patients will be provided with books/movies as
      entertainment, and they may move around freely. Patients will also be asked to complete
      several questionnaires throughout the visits about their Parkinson's symptoms.

    <description>We used the motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and excluded rigidity and speech from the assessment. Overall range of the score for the motor portion (excluding rigidity and speech) range from 0 to 108, where 0= best possible outcome and 108= worst possible outcome.</description>

    <description>Using data collected from inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors on subject, we were able to measure gait asymmetry. For each subject, the swing time (SW) was calculated and averaged across strides for the left and right legs (SWL and SWR). We obtained gait asymmetry using the following: 100 x /ln(SWR/SWL)/. 0 marks perfect symmetry and greater values higher asymmetry. There is no maximum limit.</description>

        <description>We used the motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and excluded rigidity and speech from the assessment. Overall range of the score for the motor portion (excluding rigidity and speech) range from 0 to 108, where 0= best possible outcome and 108= worst possible outcome.</description>

Vibrotactile Stimulation: The tactile stimulator is being tested for an off-label use as treatment for Parkinson's disease. There are nodes embedded into the fingertips of gloves that gently vibrate in an alternating pattern. The sensation is similar to the feeling of a phone vibrating. This is a non-significant risk device.</description>

        <title>Gait Asymmetry</title>
        <description>Using data collected from inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors on subject, we were able to measure gait asymmetry. For each subject, the swing time (SW) was calculated and averaged across strides for the left and right legs (SWL and SWR). We obtained gait asymmetry using the following: 100 x /ln(SWR/SWL)/. 0 marks perfect symmetry and greater values higher asymmetry. There is no maximum limit.</description>
