    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial where subjects following an anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction will be randomized to either a control group who will receive the normal
      rehabilitation or an experimental group who will perform a 2-week gait rehabilitation using
      the anti-gravity treadmill in addition to the normal rehabilitation. The intervention will be
      added to the existing care received at Linkoping University Hospital 2 weeks post-surgery,
      while the evaluation will be performed in week 5 and 12 post-surgery using: a 3D-gait
      analysis (with the Qualisys software), self-reported function questionnaires and a clinical
      examination.

    <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a self-administered questionnaire which consists of 42 items which can be sub grouped into five categories. These categories are pain, other disease-specific symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreation function and lastly knee-related quality of life.</description>
