      This study is designed for determining the safety and relative engraftment levels of the
      redirected autologous T cells transduced with the anti-CD19 lentiviral vector in patients
      with CD19-positive B cell leukemia and malignant lymphoma.

      A single arm open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and
      engraftment potential of CAR-CD19 T cells in patients with CD19-positive malignant B cell
      leukemia and lymphoma. All subjects will receive CAR-CD19 T cells infusion.

      Primary objectives:

        1. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
           with the anti-CD19 lentiviral vector (referred to as &quot;CAR-CD19 T&quot; cells).

        2. Determine the duration of in vivo survival of CAR-CD19 T cells.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CAR-CD19 T
           cells infusions.

        2. To determine the amplification and survival of CAR-CD19 T 4-1BB:CD3ζ and CD28:CD3ζ as
           measured by the relative engraftment levels of CAR-CD19 T 4-1BB:CD3ζ and CD28:CD3ζ cells
           over time.

        3. Estimate relative trafficking of CAR-CD19 T cells to tumors in bone marrow and
           lymphnodes.

        4. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19,
           and assess correlation with loss of detectable CAR-CD19 T (loss of engraftment).

        5. Determine the relative subsets of CAR-CD19 T cells.

    <description>Duration of in vivo survival of CAR-CD19 T cells is defined as &quot;engraftment&quot;. The primary engraftment endpoint is the # DNA vector copies per mg blood of CAR-CD19 T cells on week 4 after the first infusion. Q-PCR for CAR-CD19 T vector sequences will also be performed after infusion at 24 hours, weekly x 4, monthly x 6, and every 3 months thereafter until any 2 sequential tests are negative documenting loss of CAR-CD19 T cells.</description>
