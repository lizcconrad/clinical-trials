    <textblock>
      Attempted suicide is a major public health problem, and the efficacies of current postvention
      protocols vary. The investigators evaluated the effectiveness of telephone follow-up of
      patients referred to an emergency psychiatric unit for attempted suicide on any further
      attempt/s over the following year.

      In a single-center, controlled study with intent to treat, they evaluated the efficacy of a
      protocol of telephone follow-up of patients at 8, 30, and 60 days after they had been treated
      for attempted suicide. For comparison, they evaluated as controls patients with similar
      social and demographic characteristics referred to their emergency psychiatric unit in the
      year prior to the study who did not receive telephone follow-up after their initial
      hospitalization. Data were analyzed using logistic regression.

      The importance of suicide and suicidal attempts recurrence is a major public health problem.
      Indeed, the suicide attempt is one of the most important predictors of suicide, as well as
      suicidal relapse is considered a suicide risk factor. It is therefore essential to establish
      the suicidal relapse prevention devices.

      Moreover, the consensus conference on suicidal crisis (6) in particular stresses the
      importance of organizing continuity of care and foster a therapeutic alliance to avoid a
      break in continuity of care.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of telephone Callback patients on suicide rate
      of recurrence at 6 months of suicidal gesture. A secondary objective is to assess and promote
      compliance.

      Patients were included after a psychiatric interview following a suicide attempt in the North
      hospital's emergency unit no emergency hospitalization or indication in the interview before
      the release of the psychiatric emergency service. The interview provides an assessment of
      suicide risk and oral information about the protocol. A map showing the coordinates of the
      psychiatric emergency service and a reminder of the protocol is given. A consent form is
      signed. This protocol does not replace the usual care.
