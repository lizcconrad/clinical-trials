    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the main cause of death in patients on dialysis. The aim of
      this study is the long-term prognostic values of carotid intima-media thickness and coronary
      flow reserve in cardiovascular mortality of peritoneal dialysis patients.

      Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a precursor and cause of cardiovascular diseases. Defining of
      endothelial thickness and coronary microvascular function could be useful for detecting ED.
      Endothelial dysfunction could be assessed by coronary flow reserve (CFR), carotid intima
      media thickness (IMT). Repeating measurement of IMT and CFR could be predictor of
      cardiovascular events and mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients.

        All patients were treated by peritoneal dialysis or followed up as kidney transplant
        recipient at the Istanbul Medical Faculty from October 1994 to October 2011. Two groups
        were established for trial as peritoneal dialysis patients and renal transplant recipients.
        Patients had follow up shorter than six months and missing data not included in the trial
