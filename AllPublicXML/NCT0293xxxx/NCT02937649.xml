  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staple-line leak is the most frequent and incapacitating complication after laparoscopic
      sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare the
      staple-line leak rate after LSG according to the use of a bougie calibre of 36 or 48-Fr,
      assuming that a higher diameter is correlated with a lower risk of leak, without lowering
      long-term weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become an increasing bariatric procedure. The most
      common complication is gastric leak from the staple line, observed in approximately 3% of
      cases, and can result in long and incapacitating treatment. The diameter of the bougie used
      to calibrate the remnant stomach could impact the rate of gastric leak, a higher diameter
      being correlated with a lower risk of leak, without lowering long-term weight loss.

      The aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare the outcomes of LSG according to
      the use of a bougie calibre of 36 or 48-Fr on postoperative gastric leak and mid-term weight
      loss.
