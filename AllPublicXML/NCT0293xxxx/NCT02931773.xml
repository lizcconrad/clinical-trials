    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the initial autonomic alterations in participants recently
      diagnosed with DM2 and in those patients classified as Pre-Diabetes, mainly focused on the
      baroreceptor sensitivity and on the peripheral sympathetic innervation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now the autonomic dysfunction in Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2)has been broadly studied
      in long term patients. Thus, clinical features as cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and the
      lack of the baroreceptor reflex were widely described in patients with a long standing
      Diabetes. However, there hasn´t been a description of the initial autonomic imbalance in both
      Pre-Diabetes and recently diagnosed DM2 patients. This is the goal of the present research
      study, to assess the autonomic dysfunction among these sets of patients.

      Yet CAN is finding mostly happening in late stages of DM2 and so the lack of Baroreceptor
      reflex sensitivity there are other subtle indicators of dysautonomia which hasn't been
      extensively analyzed. In fact, rest tachycardia and orthostatic intolerance may point to an
      early dysautonomia. A description of the impairment of the cardiovascular autonomic
      regulation is still missing. Therefore, the investigators intend to evaluate this regulation
      through the means of a Task Force System.
