    <textblock>
      To select among different dietary (mild or high flatulogenic diet) and clinical conditions
      (FGID or non-FGID population) as well as different measured parameters (self-completed
      questionnaires assessing gas related symptoms, digestive well-being and bowel functions, gas
      volume distribution in the colon by MRI, volume and composition of gas collected per anus and
      frequency of gas evacuations per anus), the most appropriate to assess the impact of a
      fermented milk product on gas-related symptoms.
