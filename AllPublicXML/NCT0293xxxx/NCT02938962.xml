    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the effects of intravenous and topical
      administration of tranexamic acid during revision hip arthroplasty on blood loss, allogenic
      blood transfusion rates, length of hospital stay and perioperative complications.

      This study will use a prospective randomized single-blinded study design. The study will
      include one hundred and sixty patients undergoing revision total hip arthroplasty at a single
      institution (Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), Toronto, ON, Canada). Tranexamic acid has been
      routinely administered as a single intravenous preoperative dose (unless contraindicated) in
      all revision hip arthroplasty cases at MSH since May 2012. In this study, participants will
      be randomized into 2 treatment groups: intravenous (IV) administration of tranexamic acid
      (TXA) and topical administration of TXA. The IV administration group will receive a single
      20mg/kg dose of TXA prior to the skin incision. The topical administration group will have a
      100mL solution (3g TXA in 100cc of normal saline) instilled into the surgical field during
      surgery. The primary outcome measured will be the delta hemoglobin (defined as the change in
      hemoglobin from preoperative measurement to POD 0, 1, 2, 3, 5). Secondary outcomes to be
      analyzed include intraoperative estimated blood loss, allogenic blood transfusion rates,
      length of hospital stay and postoperative complications.
