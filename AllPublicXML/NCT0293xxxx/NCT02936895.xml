  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood deaths from pneumonia is almost 2000 times higher in developing countries than in
      developed countries. In 1970, pneumonia was responsible for 9% of all deaths in children
      under 5 years. This rate was 2% in 2007.

      Some studies have shown that supplementing with vitamin D reduces disease of the respiratory
      tract infection. Some other studies have shown anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D in cell
      lines. Studies about the role of vitamin D supplementation in pneumonia in children are
      inadequate to conclude about its role.

      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in
      Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) hospitalized clinical outcomes of
      hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
