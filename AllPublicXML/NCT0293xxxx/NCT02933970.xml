  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effectiveness of a patient-centered, opiate agonist treatment (OAT)-integrated
      telemedicine-based approach for management and delivery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment
      to persons with substance use disorders (PWSUD) versus usual care, which we anticipate in
      most cases will be referral to an offsite location for HCV management. The effectiveness will
      be expressed through the primary patient centered and clinical outcome, achievement of viral
      eradication, defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks post-treatment cessation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a non-blinded stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled
      trial with two arms: onsite HCV management through telemedicine versus HCV management through
      usual care, which in most cases will be referral to an offsite liver specialist (Referral).
      The arm assignment will be at the cluster (clinic) level. After an initial period (6 months)
      in which all clinics implement the control intervention (usual care), at regular intervals
      (i.e., the &quot;steps&quot;) of 6 months duration each, one group of clinics will be randomized to
      cross over from the Usual Care arm to the Telemedicine arm. In this way, there will be enough
      time for implementation and assessment of the intervention within each time period. The
      process continues until all clinics have crossed over to implement telemedicine, and thus all
      clinics contribute data to both interventions. In addition, patients will be followed for two
      years post-treatment cessation to assess for reinfection or relapse of HCV RNA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HCV antibody detected

          2. Ability and willingness of subject or legal representative to provide written informed
             consent.

          3. 18 years of age

          4. A minimum of 12-month enrollment in the opiate agonist treatment program

          5. Likely to be adherent to the therapeutic regimen

          6. Covered by medical insurance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mental instability or incompetence, such that the validity of the informed consent or
             ability to be compliant with the study is uncertain.

          2. &lt;18 years of age

          3. &lt; 12 months enrolled in an opiate agonist treatment program.

          4. Non-compliance with therapeutic regimen defined as three consecutive missed
             appointments that will result in a discussion between the principal investigator at
             the site and the study participant to determine the reason for the missed
             appointments. Continuation in the study for the participant will be assessed on a
             case-by-case basis between the study PI and the site PI.

          5. Lack of medical insurance coverage

          6. Ineligibility for HCV treatment

          7. Active treatment for HCV at the time of the study enrollment
