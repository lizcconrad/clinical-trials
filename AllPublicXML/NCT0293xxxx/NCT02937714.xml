  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significantly higher prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems have been reported from
      Pakistan.This higher prevalence along with stigma of psychiatric problems and limited child &amp;
      adolescent mental health services in Pakistan means that it is important to consider
      alternate methods for promoting psychological and emotional well-being of our youth. Schools
      can thus act as a natural platform for mental health promotion as schools context has almost
      as much impact on students' emotional health as the family context.

      Teachers' role in the school mental health initiatives cannot be overemphasized. Teachers own
      knowledge and beliefs regarding mental health influence the way they respond to students
      mental health crisis. Recognizing the need for wider implementation of evidence based school
      mental health interventions in the region and to help in addressing the mental health
      literacy of educators in resource constrained settings, World Health Organization, Eastern
      Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMRO) has developed a concise and practical manual of school mental
      health in December 2014. In the absence of any &quot;whole school approach&quot; study from Pakistan
      focusing on teachers training and addressing all the various evidence based components of
      promotion of positive mental health, Investigators aim to conduct a pilot randomized
      controlled trial to assess effectiveness of training based on WHO-EMRO manual, in addition to
      its feasibility &amp; acceptability in improving teachers' mental health literacy and
      self-efficacy in dealing with students mental health issues.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      For teachers:

        -  School mental health training intervention will significantly improve teacher's mental
           health literacy &amp; self-efficacy compared to wait list control group.

        -  At 3 months follow-up, control group teachers' mental health literacy will also improve
           compared to baseline due to contamination of information provided, across groups within
           the same school.

      All hypothesis pertains to individual level.

      For students:

      Mental health training of teachers would lead to an overall improvement in student's outcome
      measure (student's emotional and behavioural difficulties) at 3 months follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan is the 6th most populous country of the world with population over 188 million;
      Almost 35% of population is under the age of 14. Country cannot afford to ignore mental
      health of this large group. School experiences are important for children emotional,
      psychological and social development World Health Organization (WHO) also identifies
      promotion of emotional health and well- being as a core feature of their Health promoting
      school initiative. Schools can play an important role in promoting positive mental health,
      reducing stigma, raising awareness among teachers, parents and children about mental health
      issues as well as identifying and supporting youth experiencing mental health difficulties.
      Furthermore, mental health initiatives in schools help teachers to feel less stressed and be
      more satisfied with their role and save costs. Educational interventions involving teachers
      have shown significant improvement in teachers knowledge and attitudes regarding mental
      health &amp; better accuracy of teacher identification of children and adolescents with mental
      health problems. Although importance of schools for mental health promotion and early
      identification for mental health problems has been evident for quite some time, it is almost
      nonexistent in developing countries including Pakistan with only a handful of studies
      focusing one aspect of health promoting school or on one disorder. World Health Organization,
      Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMRO) has developed a concise and practical manual of
      school mental health in December 2014.This manual is primarily intended for all stakeholders
      involved in the educational process including teachers. It aims for helping educators to take
      practical steps that can be implemented at low costs in school settings.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To assess the effectiveness of locally adapted WHO school mental health Manual based
      intervention in improving mental health literacy among school teachers through a randomized
      controlled trial.

      Secondary objectives include

        1. To assess whether school mental health Manual based intervention leads to better self-
           efficacy among school teachers.

        2. To determine if mental health training of teachers would lead to an indirect improvement
           in students outcome measure (emotional and behavioural difficulties) and school
           psychosocial environment.

      STUDY PHASE 1: Interaction with key stakeholders to do a current situational analysis /
      identify priority problems.by using WHO Questionnaires &amp; in depth Interviews.

      STUDY PHASE 2: Randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness, feasibility &amp;
      acceptability of the adapted manual delivery in school settings.

      STUDY PHASE 3: Process Evaluation by feedback from Teachers.

    <description>Mental health literacy refers to a person's knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders, which in turn increases their ability to recognize, manage, or prevent the development or exacerbation of mental health problems. It has various elements including: 1) enhancing capacity to obtain and maintain good mental health; 2) enhancing understanding of mental disorders and their treatments; 3) decreasing stigma related to mental illness; 4) enhancing help-seeking efficacy. It will be assessed in the study using a self-administered questionnaire based on literature review and addressing various mental health literacy elements. Although main outcome time frame is post workshop but it will be reevaluated at 3 months time to see if change from baseline is seen.</description>

    <description>Teachers sense of efficacy scale(TSES) measures teachers assessment of their self-efficacy for teaching tasks as well as their other responsibilities. Efficacy in Student Engagement &amp; Efficacy in Classroom Management subscales will be used to assess self efficacy of teachers. There are 8 statements &amp; each statement is rated on 9 point Likert scale. It will also be reassessed at 3 months after the training workshop to assess if change from baseline is seen.</description>

    <description>Self- reported Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire{SDQ} (11-16 years) will be used to assess students behavioural and emotional problems. SDQ measures 25 attributes, which are grouped in subscales of five items each, generating scores for conduct, hyperactivity, emotional, peer problems and prosocial behaviour. Statements are rated on a three point likert scale:0(not tue), 1(somewhat true) and 2(certainly true). All scales excluding the last are added to generate a total difficulties score (0-40). Total difficulties and categories scores can be coded in normal, borderline and abnormal categories.</description>
