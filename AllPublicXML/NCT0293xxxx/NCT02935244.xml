  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASPIRE-SSI is a prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study among adult surgical
      patients, which aims to determine the incidence of healthcare-associated S. aureus
      infections, particularly S. aureus surgical site infections (SSIs), across Europe and to
      assess the most important risk factors for this type of infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of ASPIRE-SSI is to determine the incidence of S. aureus infections,
      particularly S. aureus SSIs, in various adult surgical patient populations, and to identify
      the patient-related, pathogen-related, and contextual risk factors for the development of S.
      aureus SSI. Using this information, a SSI prediction tool will be derived for future clinical
      trials and public health interventions aimed at SSI prevention. Furthermore, immunologic
      features protective against S. aureus SSI will also be assessed.

      The knowledge obtained by this study will enable identification of the surgical patients most
      at risk of developing S. aureus infections, particularly S. aureus SSI, and who would
      probably benefit most from new interventions given prophylactically and specifically to
      prevent S. aureus infections.

      <textblock>
        Patients undergoing 1 of the protocol-defined surgical procedures are eligible for
        inclusion in the study. However, enrolment in the study cohort population will be based on
        preoperative S. aureus colonization. In total, approximately 3300 S. aureus colonized
        subjects and 1700 non-colonized subjects will be enrolled in the study cohort population.

        Protocol-defined surgical procedures: Coronary artery bypass grafting; ICD implantation;
        knee and hip prosthesis surgery; laminectomy and spinal fusion surgery; emergency surgery;
        central artery reconstructive and peripheral artery bypass surgery; mastectomy; and
        craniotomy.
