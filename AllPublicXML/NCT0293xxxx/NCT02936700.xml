  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal behaviors (SB) are a major health problem in France:10,000 suicides and 220,000
      suicide attempts every year. SB management is therefore a major public health issue.
      Recently, investigators have demonstrated the interest of acceptance and commitment therapy
      (ACT) as an add-on treatment to reduce intensity and severity of suicidal ideation in
      depressed patients having a history of suicide attempt within previous year (i.e actual SB
      disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth
      edition (DSM-5)). Based on structural and functional findings, it is admitted orbitofrontal
      and ventral prefrontal cortices play a role in suicidal vulnerability. Interestingly,
      previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies have also reported the modulation of these regions by
      ACT in subjects suffering from chronic pain. fMRI could thus be an interesting tool to
      identify biomarkers of SB and its improvement by ACT.

      The aim of study is to investigate neural biomarkers of ACT efficiency in patients with SB
      disorder. Patients having a history of SB within previous year were randomized in an ACT
      program (21 patients) or relaxation program (21 patients) during 7 weeks. Before and after
      the completion of the group, they performed 3 tasks during fMRI: implicit emotional
      visualization, Cyberball game, motivational task Investigators will compare cerebral
      activations between groups, between pre and post intervention as well as measure baseline
      cerebral activations associated with improvement of suicidal ideation during follow up.

      42 patients having a history of suicide attempt within the year preceding inclusion have been
      recruited.

      First visit or inclusion (within 2 weeks preceding the beginning of the program): clinical,
      biological assessment and fMRI acquisition Second visit (within 2 weeks +/- 1 week following
      completion of the program): clinical assessment and fMRI acquisition Third visit (within 3
      months +/- 2 weeks following completion of the program): clinical assessment
