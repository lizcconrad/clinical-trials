    <textblock>
      Purpose:

        1. Develop reference values for hydration biomarkers for children of 3 to 13 years old

        2. Explore the association between children's and parents' hydration markers and fluid
           intake habits in children aged 3-13 y

        3. Evaluate the equivalence of spot urine osmolality to 24h urine osmolality in children
           aged 3-13 y

        4. Evaluate the differences in hydration markers between school and non-school days in
           children aged 3-13 y

        5. Examine the role of different foods and fluids on hydration in children (3-13 y) and
           parents

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies in children have indicated that greater water intake and/or lower urine
      concentration are associated with better overall nutrition, increased physical activity,
      improved mood state, and enhanced cognition; which is specifically related to superior
      attention and memory when compared to sub-optimally hydrated children. Separately, ancillary
      water is being investigated as a potential treatment possibility for pediatric obesity.
      Although, causality cannot be directly confirmed, it is apparent that ample water intake in
      children, above and beyond the body's compensatory mechanisms, is preferable for
      psychological and physiological health. However, the prevalence of failure to meet water
      recommendations and hypohydration in children remains high. Still it is unclear if elevated
      hypohydration reports within the pediatric population are due to a general failure of
      children to meet water recommendations, or due to inadequacy of the published guidelines
