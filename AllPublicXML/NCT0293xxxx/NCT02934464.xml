  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III trial of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel,
      given as switch maintenance, versus continuation of first-line chemotherapy, given as per
      standard clinical practice, in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic
      HER-2 negative gastric or GEJ cancer, without disease progression following 3 months of
      first-line doublet chemotherapy.

      The acceptable first-line or lead-in chemotherapy will be:

        -  FOLFOX4:Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2. l-Leucovorin 100 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil 400/600 mg/m2. Cycle
           length is 2 weeks +/- 3 days.

        -  ModifiedFOLFOX6: Oxaliplatin a 85 mg/m2. l-Leucovorin 200 mg/m2. 5-fluorouracil 400
           mg/m2 and 2400 mg/m2 46-hours continous infusion. Cycle length is 2 weeks +/- 3 days.

        -  XELOX:Oxaliplatin130 mg/m2.Capecitabine will be 2000 mg/m2 for 14 days. Cycle length is
           3 weeks +/- 3 days.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment must be continued for up to 4 three-weekly cycles or 6 bi-weekly cycles, or for up
      to a maximum of 12 weeks. Subjects with CR/PR/SD after oxaliplatinum compound and
      fluoropyrimidine-based regimens, or without evidence of progressive disease in case of
      non-measurable disease, will be randomized in 1:1 ratio between the two treatment arms.

      Prior to randomization, subjects will be stratified based on Center; Prior gastrectomy: No
      vs. Yes; Peritoneal carcinomatosis: Yes vs. No; Site of origin: GEJ vs. gastric.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet the following criteria for study entry:

          1. Written informed consent prior to performance of any study procedure;

          2. Age ≥18 years;

          3. ECOG Performance Status 0-1 (Appendix I);

          4. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks in the opinion of the Investigator;

          5. Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic, histopathologically confirmed, HER-2
             negative adenocarcinoma of gastric or GEJ cancer with measurable and/or evaluable
             disease based on RECIST, v1.1

          6. Must have received lead-in chemotherapy in the first-line setting using one of the
             fluoropyrimidines- and oxaliplatin-based doublet combinations as specified in Section
             7 and continued for three months (i.e. 6 administrations for bi-weekly cycles regimens
             or 4 administrations for three-weekly cycles regimens). Patients who had received
             adjuvant cisplatin/oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidine-based doublet chemotherapy and
             had recurrence beyond 12 months from its completion are eligible.

          7. Must have radiological evidence of clinical benefit following the last dose of the
             lead-in chemotherapy (either CR, PR or SD by RECIST v1.1 criteria in case of
             measurable disease, or absence of progressive disease in case of non-measurable
             disease).

          8. Laboratory requirements:

               -  The patient has adequate hematologic function, as evidenced by an absolute
                  neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/µL, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (5.58 mmol/L), and platelets
                  ≥100,000/µL.

               -  The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin ≤1.5
                  mg/dL (25.65 μmol/L), and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase
                  (ALT) ≤ 3.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN; or 5.0 times the ULN in the
                  setting of liver metastases).

               -  The patient has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤1.5
                  times the ULN, or creatinine clearance (measured via 24-hour urine collection)
                  ≥40 mL/minute (that is, if serum creatinine is &gt;1.5 times the ULN, a 24-hour
                  urine collection to calculate creatinine clearance must be performed). The
                  patient's urinary protein is ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA; if urine
                  dipstick or routine analysis is ≥2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must
                  demonstrate &lt;1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in this
                  protocol).

               -  Coagulation: The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by
                  International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5, and a partial thromboplastin time
                  (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds above the ULN (unless receiving anticoagulation therapy).
                  Patients receiving warfarin must be switched to low molecular weight heparin and
                  have achieved stable coagulation profile prior to randomization

          9. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating center.

         10. Archival tumor tissue is required for exploratory research at enrollment.

         11. Because the teratogenicity of ramucirumab is not known, the patient, if sexually
             active, must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception
             (hormonal or barrier methods) for the entire duration of the study including a minimum
             of 12 weeks after dosing has been completed. Female patients of childbearing potential
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrolment. Women must
             not be breastfeeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclude a patient from this study if any of the following conditions are observed:

          1. HER2 positive status, or the patient has squamous cell.

          2. Prior malignancy, active within 3 years from study entry, except for locally curable
             cancers that have been apparently cured and need no subsequent therapy, such as

             or cervix.

          3. Has a serious illness or medical condition(s) including, but not limited to the
