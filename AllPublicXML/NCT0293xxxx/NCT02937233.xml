      This is a phase 1 trial of one or more administrations of Zika Virus Purified Inactivated
      Vaccine (ZPIV). The trial will be conducted under a placebo controlled, double-blind,
      randomized allocation of study product. There are four groups in the study. Each group is
      testing a different vaccine schedule.

               1. If a person has been diagnosed with hypertension during screening or previously,
                  exclude for hypertension that is not well controlled. Well- controlled
                  hypertension is defined as blood pressure consistently ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and ≤
                  90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without medication, with only isolated, brief
                  instances of higher readings, which must be ≤ 150 mm

               2. If a person has NOT been diagnosed with hypertension during screening or
                  previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg at enrollment or
                  diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg at enrolment

         20. Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (e.g. factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

         21. Malignancy (Not excluded: a participant with a surgical excision and subsequent
             observation period that in the investigator's estimation has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure or is unlikely to recur during the study period)

         22. Psychiatric condition that compromises safety of the participant or precludes
             compliance with the protocol, specifically excluding persons with psychoses within the
             past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide, or history of suicide attempt or gesture
             within the past 3 years
