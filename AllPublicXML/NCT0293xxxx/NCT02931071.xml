  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fanconi anemia (FA) is a congenital disease characterized by bone marrow failure and
      increased incidence of malignant tumors. The Project pursue the optimization of the
      collection of hematopoietic progenitor cells for later use in another clinical trial entitled
      &quot;Clinical Trial Phase I/II to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the infusion of autologous
      CD34+ cells mobilized with mozobil and filgrastim, and transduced with a lentiviral vector
      carrying the FANCA gene (Orphan Drug) for patients with Fanconi Anemia Subtype A &quot;. The
      objectives of this study are, therefore, to assess the safety and efficacy of CD34+ cells
      mobilization with mozobil and filgrastim, which is postulated the most efficient for the
      collection of CD34+ cells from FA patients.
