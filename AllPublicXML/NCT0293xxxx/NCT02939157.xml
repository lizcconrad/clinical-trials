      Assessment of pocket sized ultrasound (Vscan GE Healthcare) for diagnosing heart failure in
      primary care patients, with a comprehensive cardiac ultrasound examination (Siemens Acusan
      P10) performed at a specialized the eco.lab, as reference.

    <textblock>
      Waiting times for cardiac ultrasound is a cause of delay in identification of heart failure,
      which means delayed treatment, or that treatment recommendations are based on insufficient
      knowledge. Heart failure is a common condition; about 10% of 80-year-old people are affected
      and most patients are treated within primary care. A new ultrasound technology with
      integrated software support for interpretation (pocket-sized ultrasound) promises to improve
      care for heart patients and lead to earlier treatment with effective drugs. In cooperation
      with Norwegian researchers and the Region of Jämtland Härjedalen, this project opens
      opportunities for a significant medical innovation. The new concept, pocket-sized ultrasound
      for diagnosis of heart failure, has not previously been validated in patients seen in primary
      care. A new study may provide very important information that is directly applicable in the
      care of heart failure patients. We aim to recruit 250 study patients from the waiting list of
      patients referred from GPs, to ultrasound at the dpt. Of Clinical Physiology, Östersund
      Hospital, due to a suspicion of heart failure. The examinations will be carried out during
      the same day, with the investigators blinded to each other. The new concept of ultrasound has
      a potential to provide more cost-effective identification and monitoring of patients with
      heart failure in primary care.
