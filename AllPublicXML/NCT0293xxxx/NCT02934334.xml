    <textblock>
      The Wellness Monitoring for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) study is a prospective,
      longitudinal, observational study aimed at identifying biomarkers of relapse in MDD. Results
      may help refine clinical approach to relapse management, and may ultimately help MDD patients
      sustain wellness while on antidepressant medication.

      This study involves a naturalistic follow up of responders from the study entitled
      &quot;Integrated biological markers for the prediction of treatment response in depression&quot;, or
      the CAN-BIND-1 study. In addition, this study is also open to other participants who
      completed other CAN-BIND studies, as well as remitters who meet the inclusion criteria. Since
      patients usually seek medical attention only after relapse has occurred, imminent precursors
      to relapse are not well known. In this study, participants who are currently responding to an
      oral antidepressant treatment regimen and/or therapeutic intervention will be monitored over
      a minimum period of 13 months, which provides a unique opportunity to discover near-term
      biomarkers of relapse.

      The study is conducted in partnership with Janssen Research &amp; Development and utilizes remote
      monitoring technology for data gathering.

      At each 8 week visit, blood samples for biochemical, genomic, and proteomic analysis will be
      collected and stored at -80'C freezer.

      Plasma: Venous blood will be collected in 6mL and 10ml EDTA blood tubes, followed by
      centrifugation in a refrigerated centrifuge to obtain the plasma. Two milliliters of plasma
      from each tube will be divided into 8 cryovials (500ÂµL).

      DNA for methylation analysis: Venous blood will be collected in 8.5 mL PAXgene DNA tubes.

      DNA for studying histone modifications: Venous blood will be collected in 6mL EDTA blood
      tubes and the mixed contents will be divided evenly into three 2 mL screw-cap tubes.

      RNA for mRNA and miRNA sequencing: Venous blood will be collected in 6mL EDTA blood tubes and
      the mixed contents will be passed through LeukoLOCK filters according to the manufacturer's
      instructions.

          -  In the current MDE, patient must currently be responding to an antidepressant
             medication or a combination of treatments for MDD.

          -  Willing and able to complete self-reported assessments via a study-specific smartphone
             (LogPad), including sufficient fluency in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Axis I diagnosis, other than MDD, that is considered the primary diagnosis.

          -  Bipolar I or Bipolar II diagnosis (lifetime), MDD with psychotic features (lifetime),
             schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder.

          -  Presence of a significant Axis II diagnosis (borderline, antisocial).

          -  High suicidal risk, defined by clinician judgement.

          -  History of drug or alcohol use, with severity of at least moderate or severe,
             according to DSM criteria, within 6 months before screening.

             conditions.

             currently enrolled in an investigational study.

          -  Has a condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not
             be in the best interest of the subject (e.g. compromise well being) or that could
             prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.

          -  Subject is an employee of the investigator or study site, with direct involvement in
             the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study
             site, or is a family member of an employee or the investigator.
