  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bread is the most common grain product in the world, with consumption surpassing 3 billion
      individuals per year. Sourdough whole-grain bread is considered a healthy alternative to
      white, refined-wheat bread.

      This cross-over study will test the effect of consumption of sourdough bread compared to
      white bread following a short dietary intervention period (one week) on multiple clinical
      parameters and gut microbiota.
