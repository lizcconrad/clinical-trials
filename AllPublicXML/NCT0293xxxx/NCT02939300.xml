      This research study is studying a combination of two drugs as a possible treatment for
      Leptomeningeal Metastases from Melanoma.

      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Ipilimumab

        -  Nivolumab

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

      Researchers hope to study the effects of the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. Many
      cancers use specific pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune
      system. Nivolumab and ipilimumab work by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways and thus
      releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can stop or slow cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Nivolumab and Ipilimumab as a
      treatment option for melanoma, but has not approved them for use when cancer cells spread to
      the cerebrospinal fluid

             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of

             therapy within 14 days of protocol treatment, or those who have not recovered (i.e., ≤
             Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2
             weeks earlier. Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion
             and may qualify for the study. If subject received major surgery, they must have
             recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention
             prior to starting therapy.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune
             disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids
             (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment
             of non-autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by
             contact allergen) is permitted.

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution
             in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have had prior systemic treatment with an
             anti-CTLA4 antibody

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Patients should be excluded if they are positive test for hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating
             acute or chronic infection

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  History of allergy to study drug components

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody
