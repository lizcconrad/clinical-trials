      This study involves 25 current young adult combustible tobacco cigarette (CTC) smokers who
      will complete 5 Latin square ordered, within-subject, laboratory conditions that differ by
      the tobacco product smoked:

        1. own-brand CTC (positive control),

        2. original-flavored Black &amp; Mild (B&amp;M) cigar,

        3. apple-flavored B&amp;M cigar,

        4. cream-flavored B&amp;M cigar, and

        5. wine-flavored B&amp;M cigar.

    <ipd_description>Once appropriate, a completely de-identified data set will be created that obfuscates any variable that might potentially be used to identify an individual study participant. In accordance with HIPAA definitions for public data sharing, the investigators will use standard acceptable processes that include removal of identifiers, translation of dates and ages to delta time values, assignment of random study identifiers, and any other methods acceptable at that time. A data sharing agreement will be required for release of any data. Individuals requesting a copy of study data will need to submit a detailed research plan that includes the purpose of the proposed research, the variables required, the duration of the analysis phase, IRB approval with FWA information, investigator training in human subjects, and other approvals specific to the individual datasets.</ipd_description>
