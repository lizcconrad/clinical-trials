    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of lucerastat in
      adults with Fabry Disease receiving Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT).

      The secondary objectives were to investigate the effects of lucerastat on plasma and urine
      levels of biomarkers, to assess its effects on renal and cardiac functions and to determine
      the pharmacokinetic profile of lucerastat at steady-state.
