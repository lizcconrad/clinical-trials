    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial studying the effects of various antimicrobial
      treatments on the intestinal microbiome of small children. The participating children with
      acute otitis media are treated wither with amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate or without
      antibiotics. The children with allergy to amoxicillin receive a course of macrolide and they
      will be monitored as a separate group. The main outcomes of this trial are the changes in the
      intestinal microbiome after the treatment.

    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media has been proven efficacious in children. It has
      been suggested that antimicrobial treatment makes a lot of harm to intestinal microbiome and
      may thus have effects on the child's health and wellbeing. However, data on these changes and
      their magnitude is scanty. This is a randomized, controlled trial studying the effects of
      various antimicrobial treatments on the intestinal microbiome of small children. The
      participating children with acute otitis media are treated wither with amoxicillin,
      amoxicillin-clavulanate or without antibiotics. The children with allergy to amoxicillin
      receive a course of macrolide and they will be monitored as a separate group. The main
      outcomes of this trial are the changes in the intestinal microbiome after the treatment.
