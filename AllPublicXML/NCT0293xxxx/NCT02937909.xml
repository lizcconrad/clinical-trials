  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether the adoption of the use of a range of wound
      care products from a single manufacturer makes training in appropriate product selection more
      effective and results in more accurate selection of the appropriate product for the wound and
      for the patient's lifestyle, thereby incurring less waste and reducing the number of
      referrals by the community nursing team to the Tissue Viability Team.

      One community nursing team will switch to using a full range of dressings and compression
      products from BSN medical UK for three months. Nurse training on the products will be given
      and nurse competencies and confidence in woundcare and appropriate product selection will be
      tested at the start and end of the study.

      The number and type of referrals to the Tissue Viability Team will be measured.

      Total anonymised data on numbers of referrals, wound closure, numbers of wounds and quantity
      and cost of products used will be collected and compared with the historical record for three
      months prior to the study. Patients will complete a Quality of Life questionnaire at
      enrolment and exit from the study.

      Patients for whom BSN medical UK products are not appropriate or not desired by the patient
      will not be enrolled and will receive the usual range of products available to the community
      nursing team.
