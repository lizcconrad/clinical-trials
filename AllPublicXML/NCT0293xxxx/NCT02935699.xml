          3. Be willing and able to give informed consent;

          1. Receipt of an investigational drug or device, within the past 30 days;

          2. Patients in whom an antihistamine may be contraindicated (e.g. narrow angle glaucoma,

          3. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not tolerate an IV injection of
             diphenhydramine 50 mg, or cetirizine 10 mg;

          4. Receipt of any antihistamine (H1 antagonist) within the past 2 hours regardless of the
             route of administration, e.g. diphenhydramine, cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine,
             levocetirizine, desloratadine;

          5. Receipt of an H2 antagonist within the past 2 hours;

          6. Receipt of doxepin within the past 2 hours; doxepin is an antidepressant, but it also

         13. Patients who, based on their medical history or in the opinion of the investigator,
             have chronic urticaria, hereditary angioedema, urticaria refractory to antihistamines,
             or dermatological disease that interferes with evaluation of a therapeutic response;

         14. Any condition that in the view of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for
             enrollment in this study;

         15. History of HIV or other known immunodeficiency;

         16. Major medical or psychiatric illness, other than acute urticaria, at the time of
