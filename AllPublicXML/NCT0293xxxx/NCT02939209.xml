  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic shoulder rotator cuff repair is associated with severe postoperative pain. The
      interscalene block (ISB) is commonly used for this type of surgery, providing analgesia by
      anesthetizing the nerves that supply the shoulder. Although the nerve block provides
      extremely effective analgesia for the first 6-8 hours, patients experience severe pain once
      its effect has regressed. This study will assess whether a single dose of oral hydromorphone
      controlled release, given to overlap the waning of the ISB, will improve postoperative pain
      control and reduce the incidence of rebound pain.

      Seventy patients undergoing rotator cuff repair will receive standardized ISB and general
      anesthesia for the surgery. Six hours after ISB, the patients will randomly receive either a
      single oral dose of 2 mg Hydromorphone (immediate release formulation) or placebo. The
      patient will be then discharged home with a prescription for multimodal analgesia, which is
      the standard of care. Patients will be given a diary to record their pain scores and track
      use of analgesic medications for 24 hours. Twenty-four hours after the ISB, the patients will
      receive a phone call from a nurse as per the standard of care. During this phone call,
      questions will be asked about their pain control.

      If a single dose of pre-emptive hydromorphone is demonstrated to be safe and effective, it
      will lead to change in practice of how we manage pain after rotator cuff repair. Furthermore,
      the finding of this study may apply to similar surgical procedures (such as elbow, knee and
      ankle repairs) that are associated with rebound pain when the nerve block wears off.
