      This trial is to assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab added to concurrent chemotherapy with
      or without radiation therapy in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCLC provides an opportune setting to evaluate the potential importance of variability in
      PD-L1 expression and its influence on optimizing timing and efficacy of checkpoint
      inhibition. All extensive stage SCLC patients are treated with chemotherapy and recent data
      suggests added benefit to consolidation thoracic radiation. A prior study of patients with
      known PD-L1 expression showed a 35% response rate. That study used archival specimens and
      found a 29% PD-L1 positivity rate (at 1% level) suggesting that the expression level and
      prevalence could be higher (and response rate/outcome therefore potentially better) in
      patients who have previously had chemotherapy or radiation. The proposed study seeks to
      evaluate pembrolizumab therapy initiated at different times during the course of SCLC
      treatment: a) up front, in conjunction with initiation of chemotherapy, b) starting after one
      cycle of chemotherapy, c) starting after completion of 1st line chemotherapy (4-6 cycles), d)
      starting after completion of consolidation thoracic radiation therapy and/or prophylactic
      cranial irradiation (PCI). Treatment with pembrolizumab will be preceded by biopsy for
      evaluation of PD-L1 expression with correlative evaluation of changes in PD-L1 expression
      (relative to diagnostic biopsy) and changes in other tissue- and blood-based biomarkers and
      immune markers.

             weeks to ensure stability.

          -  The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because the chemotherapy and radiation also used in this trial are known to

             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) or be
             surgically sterile prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
             Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized
             or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after
             completion of chemotherapy, radiation, and pembrolizumab administration.
