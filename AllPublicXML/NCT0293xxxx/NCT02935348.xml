  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with Hodgkin lymphoma currently undergo multiple investigations
      including a separate PET and MRI scans during their treatment.

      Investigators want to investigate if a combined PET-MRI scan could give the same information.

      Children who join our study will have an extra scan twice during their treatment

      Investigators want to investigate if a combined PET-MRI scan could give the same information.

      Children who join our study will have an extra scan twice during their treatment

      Routine whole body clinical MRI will be performed according to current clinical standard of
      care. Axial and coronal imaging from the maxilla to proximal femurs will be performed using a
      combination of T1 and T2 weighted sequences, with and without gadolinium administration.
