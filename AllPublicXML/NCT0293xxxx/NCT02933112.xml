  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the workflow of an auto-titrating mandibular positioner
      in its intended setting. Participants with obstructive sleep apnea will use the device to
      determine their eligibility for oral appliance therapy and provide feedback on usability of
      the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is oral appliance therapy during sleep, in which an
      appliance that covers the upper and lower teeth acts to pull the lower jaw forward, opening
      the throat passage and allowing for normal breathing. However, oral appliance therapy does
      not treat sleep apnea effectively in all individuals. In order to identify those individuals
      for whom oral appliance therapy will work, the study sponsor has developed an investigational
      device called an auto-titrating mandibular positioner. The device automatically pulls the
      lower jaw forward in response to respiratory events while the individual sleeps. Study
      participants will learn the outcome of their sleep tests and will provide feedback on the
      ease of use of the device.

    <description>Participants will undergo a theragnostic test using the auto-titrating mandibular positioner to determine if they are eligible candidates to use oral appliance therapy for their obstructive sleep apnea. The device works by moving the lower jaw forward in response to respiratory events while the participant sleeps. All participants will undergo the same test.</description>
