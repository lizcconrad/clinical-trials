  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impulse control disorders (ICDs) (such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive
      shopping …) are an increasingly recognized psychiatric complications in Parkinson's disease
      (PD). Therapeutic management of these disorders is important since they have an impact on
      patient quality of life. Dopamine agonists play a key role in the emergence of ICD.

      Animal models and imaging underline the implication of opioid system in the genesis of ICD.

      An opioid antagonist, the naltrexone, has been studied to treat ICDs in PD. Papay and al 2014
      have found that patients treated by naltrexone showed an interesting decrease of their ICDs
      measured by the QUIP RScale. Nevertheless, naltrexone has shown adverse effects such as
      increasing hepatic liver enzymes. Nalmefene has no known hepatic adverse effects. Nalmefene
      is an opioid antagonist that has an antagonist action on μ and δ receptors, but also an
      agonist action on κ receptor. Grant and al 2006 has shown significant reduction of the
      severity of pathological gambling in patients treated with nalmefene.

      The primary purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of nalmefene in the treatment
      of ICDs in PD.

    <textblock>
      In this open study, 30 patients with ICDs, will be treated with 18 mg per day of nalmefene
      during 3 months.

      Patients will be evaluated 2 times: at inclusion visit (J0) and 3 months after (at the end of
      the study, +3months).

      At each time, patients will have :

        -  a clinical and neurological evaluation

        -  neuropsychological tests for cognitive, depression and TCI evaluations.

        -  blood sample to test hepatic and renal functions

        -  tolerance evaluation with a list of adverse events/effects

      Patients will be contacted 3 times by phone: 2 weeks after inclusion, 1 month after inclusion
      and 2 months after inclusion, to note the presence of adverse events.
