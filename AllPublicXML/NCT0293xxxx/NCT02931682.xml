  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With only limited prospective longitudinal data currently available on Creatine Transporter
      Deficiency (CTD), its natural history is at present incompletely understood. This
      international study is designed to provide additional insights into disease progression, to
      characterize how patients perform on clinical neurodevelopmental assessments, and to evaluate
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in patients with
      CTD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study designed to determine an appropriate clinical assessment
      battery for males with CTD, and to evaluate MRS along with other potential biomarkers. It is
      designed to explore developmental domains of interest and to examine the feasibility and
      utility of various neuropsychological assessments to measure domains of interest, and to
      identify possible endpoints for interventional studies. Study will also explore
      genotype-phenotype correlations.

      This study will consist of a Screening Period, a Baseline period, and Ongoing Assessment
      Periods. During the Screening Period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility
      including verification of existing laboratory evidence of a pathologic mutation at SLC6A8
      gene. A comprehensive history and physical and neurological examination, including evaluation
      of growth and dysmorphic features, will be completed for all subjects. During the Baseline
      Period, the caregiver will be interviewed and study staff will administer
      scales/questionnaires at the study site. For purpose of this protocol, a duly authorized
      patient representative (e.g. parent, legal guardian) will be referred to as a caregiver.
      Biological, physiological and radiographic assessments, including ERP recordings, MRS, skin
      biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and blood will be obtained. During the Ongoing Assessment
      Period, growth assessments and limited physical and neurological examinations will be
      performed. All scales/questionnaires will be repeated every 6 months (Â± 2 weeks) for 24
      months either at the study site or with instructions for completion at home.

      Clinical adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.

          1. Subject has had status epilepticus within 3 months of screening.

          2. Subject is unable to comply with the study procedures or with a clinical disease or
             laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator would potentially
