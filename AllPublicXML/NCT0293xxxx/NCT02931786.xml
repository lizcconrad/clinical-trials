  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators researched the effect of two different types of drugs on core body temperature
      during magnetic resonance imaging. The hypothesis is in ketamine group, thermo disregulation
      is not as distinct as in propofol group, due to its positive effect on thermo regulation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous anesthetics may impair thermoregulation. Absorption of radiofrequency waves by
      the body surface may result in heating, especially in small children during magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). Investigators applied two different intravenous anesthetics as
      propofol and ketamine and studied the effect of these drugs on core body temperature.

      All patients aged between 6 months-10 years were administered midazolam and atropine. After
      that 1 mg/ kg of propofol was applied in group I, and 0,1 ml/kg of propofol ketamine mixture
      ( 10 mg/ml each) was applied in group II. Core body temperatures were taken before and after
      MRI and compared.
