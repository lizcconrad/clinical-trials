  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relative effectiveness of current treatments and their different mechanisms of action
      yield to consider more and more that the multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutic approach must
      use multiple molecules, both combined and sequential.

      In this sense, one can assume that the combination of two molecules with different but
      complementary mechanisms of action, can delay progression of the disease. Mitoxantrone has a
      powerful action, immediate and total, whereas interferon a selective action, immunomodulatory
      and delayed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the hypothesis that there is a synergistic effect of both increasing
      the dose of interferon and also the use of mitoxantrone, allowing to further reduce the
      conversion rate MS.

      Because mitoxantrone decreases the rate of relapses 2 times more than interferon beta, a (at
      least) 2 times higher benefit on the disease activity is expected with interferon
      mitoxantrone combination than with interferon alone.
