    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to look at the effects that height-adjustable workstations on
      occupational sitting time and workplace productivity in office workers. Participants
      workplace activity (sitting, standing and walking) and productivity was measured before the
      installation of the height-adjustable workstations. Workplace activity and productivity were
      then measured four weeks after the installation of height-adjustable workstations and four
      weeks after the removal of height-adjustable workstations, where possible. The results were
      compared to a control group who received no intervention whilst the intervention had the
      height-adjustable workstations.

    <textblock>
      Sedentary behaviour has been found to be ubiquitous within the workplace and due to the
      negative consequences of sedentary behaviour upon health, research has began to look at ways
      to reduce and interrupt sedentary behaviour.

      Interventions that have introduced height-adjustable workstations into the workplace have
      been found to reduce sedentary behaviour. Some employees and employers are concerned that
      using height-adjustable workstations and trying to reduce workplace sedentary behaviour can
      lead to a loss of workplace productivity.

      The present study looked at the effects of installing height-adjustable workstations on
      occupational sitting time and workplace productivity in desk-based workers. Workplace
      activity was measured objectively using ActivPal accelerometers and productivity was measured
      via self-report measures. Measurements took place at baseline, four weeks after receiving the
      height-adjustable workstation, then four weeks after the removal of the height-adjustable
      workstation.
