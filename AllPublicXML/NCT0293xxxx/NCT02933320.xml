      The purpose of this study is to identify the tolerable dose of BI-1206 for patients with
      B-cell lymphoma and leukaemia and further evaluate BI-1206 alone and in combination with an
      anti-CD20 antibody
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The molecule CD32b is thought to be present on many B-cells including the malignant B-cells
      in some types of lymphoma and leukaemia. The study drug, BI-1206, is an anti-CD32b monoclonal
      antibody which attaches to CD32b on the surface of B-cells and is thought to act by
      recruiting host immune cells toward the tumour leading to cancer cell death as well as
      enhancing the anti-cancer effect of other anti-CD20 antibodies such as rituximab by stopping
      them being absorbed by cells.

      The study is a first in man clinical trial of the drug called BI-1206 on its own and then
      also in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody (such as rituximab) which is commonly used to
      treat lymphoma and some types of leukaemia.

      The four main aims of this trial are to find out:

        -  The maximum dose of BI-1206 that can be given safely to patients (to a maximum dose of
           800mg) on it's own and in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab.

        -  More about the potential side effects of BI-1206 and how they can be managed.

        -  What happens to BI-1206 inside the body.

        -  The effect of BI-1206 treatment (with or without rituximab) on tumour size and survival.

      Approximately 81 patients with relapsed or refractory CD32b positive B-cell lymphoma or
      leukaemia will be entered into this study. This will include approximately 19 recruited for
      the BI-1206 dose escalation phase (Part A), up to 12 (likely 6) for a combination dose
      escalation and up to a further 50 patients recruited to two dose expansion cohorts; one of
      BI-1206 alone and one of BI-1206 plus rituximab (Part B). The final number will depend on the
      number of dose escalations required to reach the MTD.

             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator and the Centre
             for Drug Development (CDD) should not exclude the patient.

          9. Ability to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating). However, those female
             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree

             [oral,injected or implanted hormonal contraception and condom; intra-uterine device
             and condom; diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom] or agree to sexual abstinence^4
             for four weeks before entering the trial, during the trial and for twelve months after
             completing treatment are considered eligible.

         10. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception [condom
             plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence effective from the first administration of
             BI-1206 or rituximab on the study, throughout the trial and for twelve months
             afterwards. Men with partners of child-bearing potential must also be willing to
             ensure that their partner uses an effective method of contraception for the same
             duration for example, hormonal contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with
             spermicidal gel or sexual abstinence4). Men with pregnant or lactating partners should
             be advised to use barrier method contraception (e.g. condom plus spermicidal gel) to
             prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.

         11. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.

         12. At high medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease including infection.

             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

         14. Patients with an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease (not including CLL
             auto-immune disease). Patients with Type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only
             requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or
             alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the
             absence of an external trigger will be permitted to participate.

         15. Concurrent congestive heart failure, prior history of class III/ IV cardiac disease
             (New York Heart Association [NYHA]), prior history of cardiac ischaemia or prior
             history of cardiac arrhythmia.

         16. Patients for whom rituximab is contraindicated due to severe previous hypersensitivity
             or any other reason (Part B combination arm only).

         17. Active, ongoing infection.

         18. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.

         19. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical study,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I/IIa study of BI-1206. Participation in an
             observational study would be acceptable.

         20. Current malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately treated
             cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have undergone potentially curative
             therapy for a prior malignancy, have no evidence of that disease for three years or
             more and are deemed at negligible risk for recurrence, are eligible for the trial.
