      The proposed study will use this technology to observe emptying of the stomach of a protein
      and carbohydrate rich clear liquid sports/nutrition drink.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to ensure safety for elective anesthesia, standard practice requires pre-operative
      fasting to ensure that the stomach is empty prior to induction. The question of timing of
      pre-operative consumption of oral fluids remains vexed, and challenges anesthesiologists on a
      frequent basis. In the past few years, a new controversy in pre-operative fasting has arisen:
      clear drinks with increased content of protein and carbohydrate have been introduced to the
      market. Families and professionals alike are confused whether to regard these products as
      clear liquids (2 hours fasting) or as solids (at least 6 hours).

      Ultrasound is now considered an accepted tool in the anesthesia literature as a surrogate for
      aspiration risk with different materials and in different disease states.
