  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a pragmatic randomized clinical trial in which the researchers will determine the
      mortality impact of a protocol whereby all hemodialysis patients receive an oral,
      protein-based nutritional supplement during the dialysis procedure as compared to the
      existing nutritional protocol whereby only hemodialysis patients with serum albumin below 3.5
      g/dL and incident hemodialysis patients during the first months of care receive an oral,
      intradialytic protein-based nutritional supplement during the dialysis procedure.
