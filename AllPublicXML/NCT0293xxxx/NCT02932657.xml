  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is so far a disease whose treatment remains essentially symptomatic care
      teams perceive the boundaries of a support mainly focused on drug treatments. The patient had
      no other choice but to learn to live with their disease, the goal is to make every effort so
      that tames the disease while maintaining high self-esteem that gives meaning to his life,
      allowing, among other things, a good grip of treatment.

      Through this research we hope to encourage the integration of art therapy in the course of
      care of cystic fibrosis patients, from children to adults before and after transplantation,
      in connection with the patient education and counseling
