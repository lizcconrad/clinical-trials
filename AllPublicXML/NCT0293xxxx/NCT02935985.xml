  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bio-markers substudy of EsICH is designed to recruit patients with acute (first 8h)
      spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and assess a series of biological parameters (CBC,
      glucose, cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and point-of-care bio-markers (cTnI,
      hsCRP, D-Dimer) in order to predict the functional outcome of these patients and to determine
      their input for early risk stratification and prognosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EsICH is designed as a multicenter double blind randomized (2:1) clinical trial assessing the
      effects of tranexamic acid (2g in total) on patients with acute (first 8h) spontaneous
      intracerebral hemorrhage.

      The bio-markers substudy addresses the same category of patients and assesses biological
      parameters (CBC, glucose, cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and point-of-care
      bio-markers (cTnI, hsCRP, D-Dimer) in order to predict the functional outcome of these
      patients and to determine their input for early risk stratification and prognosis.

      The patients with a diagnostic CT scan are recruited in the Emergency Departments or
      Neurology/ Neurosurgery Wards of the hospitals enrolled in the study and blood samples are
      drawn in the first 8h from the onset of the condition. The patient is then clinically
      assessed by the study investigators for the first 7 days of the admission and a second CT
      scan is performed on the second day (24h from the onset of the condition).

      Telephone follow-ups will be completed on day 90 and 180 by the coordinating center of the
      study.

      The bio-markers substudy is an observational, prospective multicenter (the study will be
      initially started in one center - Cluj-Napoca - and then the Tirgu Mures center will be
      activated. Two more centers might be also included on a later time - Alba and
      Bistrita-Nasaud, pending on financial and logistic reasons).

      Venous blood samples will be collected from patients who have suffered a spontaneous
      intracerebral hemorrhage less than 8h ago.

      Point-of-care bio-markers will be assessed by using an immunoanalyzer in the Emergency
      Department.

      From the blood samples used for determining the other biological parameters (CBC,
      biochemistry, coagulogram), serum samples will be stored at -80 C degrees for further studies
      on this topic.

      The participant will be explicitly asked for consent for storing the serum sample.
