  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of Laparoscopy-assisted Pylorus-preserving Gastrectomy (LAPPG) for
      the treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) remain controversial. The investigators conducted
      a randomized controlled trial to compare LAPPG and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2
      lymph node dissections for EGC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the procedure, the distal part of the stomach is resected, but a pyloric cuff 2-3 cm
      wide is preserved. The right gastric artery and the infrapyloric artery are preserved to
      maintain the blood supply to the pyloric cuff. In addition, the hepatic and pyloric branches
      of the vagal nerves are preserved to maintain pyloric function. The celiac branch of the
      posterior vagal trunk is sometimes preserved. All regional nodes except the suprapyloric
      nodes (No. 5) should be dissected as in the standard D2 procedure. However, there are
      technical challenges associated with completing all of these procedures.The five-year
      survival rate after PPG with modified D2 lymph node dissection ranges from 95% to 98%. This
      rate is comparable to the five-year survival rate after gastric resection for EGC, which
      ranges from 90% to 98%. In terms of oncologic safety, PPG seems reasonably safe for EGC when
      the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis can be assured
