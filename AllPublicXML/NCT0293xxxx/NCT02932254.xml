  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the treatment effect of magnesium sulfate on the T4 / T1
      ratio after reversal with sugammadex deep or moderate neuromuscular blockade induced by
      rocuronium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sugammadex is a novel neuromuscular blocking reversal agent. Its mechanism of action is the
      encapsulation of rocuronium and vecuronium molecules. Numerous studies show a potential role
      of magnesium in reducing anesthetic requirements, sympathetic response to surgical trauma,
      antinociceptive action and neuroprotective effects. However, its use is limited because
      magnesium potentiates non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.

      Primary outcome: evaluating the effect of treatment with magnesium sulfate the T4 / T1 ratio
      after reversal with sugammadex deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade induced by
      rocuronium.

      Secondary outcome: evaluate the occurrence of severe respiratory events, the incidence of
      residual neuromuscular block in the post-anesthetic recovery room, evolution of T1 high, and
      postoperative pain.
