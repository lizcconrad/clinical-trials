      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of FES for trans-tibial amputees.
      The investigators aim to demonstrate that providing three months of FES intervention will
      increase knee extension strength, increase volume of the residual limb and decrease chronic
      and phantom pain.

      SUMMARY STUDY GOALS: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of FES for
      trans-tibial amputees. The investigators aim to demonstrate that providing three months of
      FES intervention will increase knee extension strength, increase volume of the residual limb
      and decrease chronic and phantom pain.

      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Randomized control trial METHODS: Twenty participants will be recruited
      and randomly divided into two groups, one group will receive the FES intervention while the
      other group will continue with activities of daily living. Both groups will keep a daily log
      of number of hours the prosthesis is worn, number of hours the FES is worn (if used) and any
      changes in skin conditions or medications. Both groups will return for assessment visits at
      4, 8, and 12 weeks and a follow up visit 3 months post-intervention for investigators to
      inspect the residual limb and check the fit of the prosthetic socket, record residual limb
      knee extension strength on the Biodex machine, take measurements (circumferences and lengths)
      of the residual limb with a tape measure and ruler, scan the limb with the hand held
      three-dimensional motion-tracking laser scanner system and the participant will be asked to
      complete a pain questionnaire. The Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) will be
      completed at the 12 week and the 3 month follow-up visits.

    <description>Study participants who are randomized into the intervention group will be fitted with a portable commercially available surface FES device and instructed in its use by a study investigator. Participants will be directed to use the FES 30 minutes a day for the first week, one hour a day during the next week, 90 minutes a day during the third week, and then a minimum of 2 hours per day or 10 hours per week for the next three months at home.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women over 18 years of age.

          -  Participants have a unilateral trans-tibial amputation with a minimum of a 4&quot; residual
             limb. This length of amputation was chosen to provide for adequate surface area for
             the electrodes.

          -  Participants must be a minimum of two years postoperative to insure proper healing of
             the limb has occurred.

          -  Participants have chronic limb pain.

          -  No prior experience in using TENS or FES.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No cardiac conditions, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, or a pacemaker.

          -  People with severe diabetes who have insensate skin and or neuropathy.
