  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The way the immune system responds to certain PD-related proteins in PD donors compared to
      the way it responds in persons without or fewer PD related proteins is not well studied and
      this study aims to analyze the autoimmune response in each group. The study involves a one
      time visit involving brief questionnaires and a blood draw of 30 mL (approximately 2
      tablespoons) to be collected.

      The role of the immune response in Parkinson's disease (PD) is controversial. Recent studies
      show that neurons can present MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex - class 1) molecules
      and therefore may be susceptible to an attack by immune cells. The investigators anticipate
      that the results of this study will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of immune
      mediated neuronal degeneration in PD. Initial results suggest that antigens are presented by
      neuronal MHC-I in PD, and that this could lead to T-cell mediated neuronal death. The most
      obvious antigen that could be differentially expressed in PD patients and controls would be
      alpha-synuclein (-syn): -syn oligomers appear in all Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites and are
      the hallmark of PD changes in the brain. This study will offer the opportunity to further
      characterize the immune mediated component of PD, and to continue elucidating the biology
      that underlies antigen presentation and T-cell cytolytic activity.
