      The purpose of this project is to use white-skinned sweet potato as the main material for
      weight control for overweight and obesity, the non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular
      diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes) are also included. All high
      quality sweet potato are provided by CAES in Taiwan to produce special nutrient food and
      health food that to do functional study in Shih Chien University and Taipei Medical
      University. In this study, the investigators will recruit overweight and obesity subjects
      that divide into white sweet potato group (experimental group) and no intervention group
      (control group) by using randomized, parallel and open clinical study in sixty days.
