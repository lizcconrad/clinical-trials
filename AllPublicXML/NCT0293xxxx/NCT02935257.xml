  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product (ATIMP) in adults (age 16 to 65 years) with high
      risk, relapsed/refractory CD19+ B-ALL. The ATIMP for this study is cryopreserved autologous
      patient-derived T-cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to generate the CD19CAT-41BBZ CAR
      T-cells (referred to subsequently as CD19CAR T-cells). Patients will undergo an unstimulated
      leucapheresis for the generation of the ATIMP which will take approximately 15 days to
      generate. During this period, patients may receive &quot;holding&quot; chemotherapy as per
      institutional practice to maintain disease control. Patients will receive pre-conditioning
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 60mg/kg on Day -6 and fludarabine 30mg/m2
      administered over 3 days (Day -5 to Day -3).

      The study is designed as an intra-patient dose escalation employing a total dose range (over
      2 doses, Dose 1 and Dose 2) of between 5 x 106 CD19CAR T-cells and 1.1 x 109 CD19CAR T-cells.
      The study will evaluate ATIMP safety and efficacy and the duration of disease response in
      adults with high risk / relapsed CD19+ B-ALL.

      After completing the interventional phase of the study all patients, irrespective of whether
      they progressed or responded to treatment, will enter long term follow up until 5 years
      post-CD19CAR T-cell infusion.

      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product (ATIMP) in adults (age 16 to 65 years) with high
      risk, relapsed/refractory CD19+ B-ALL. The ATIMP for this study is cryopreserved autologous
      patient-derived T-cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to generate the CD19CAT-41BBZ CAR
      T-cells (referred to subsequently as CD19CAR T-cells). Patients will undergo an unstimulated
      leucapheresis for the generation of the ATIMP which will take approximately 15 days to
      generate. During this period, patients may receive &quot;holding&quot; chemotherapy as per
      institutional practice to maintain disease control. Patients will receive pre-conditioning
      lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 60mg/kg on Day -6 and fludarabine
      30mg/m2 administered over 3 days (Day -5 to Day -3).

      The study is designed as an intra-patient dose escalation employing a total dose range (over
      2 doses, Dose 1 and Dose 2) of between (minimum) 5 x 106 CD19CAR T-cells (plus 20% for
      thawing losses) and (maximum) 1.1 x 109 CD19CAR T-cells (plus 20% for thawing losses).

      The initial ATIMP dose administered is dependent upon B-ALL disease burden in the bone
      marrow. For patients with &lt;20% marrow infiltration by B-ALL at baseline (screening), Dose 1a
      will be 1x108 CD19CAR T-cells and will be administered on Day 0 following LD. For those with
      ≥20% marrow infiltration by B-ALL, Dose 1b, administered on Day 0, will be 1x107 CD19CAR
      T-cells. This measure to prevent toxicity is in keeping with published data correlating
      severity of CRS with disease burden.

      Dose 1a* (BM blasts≤20%): 1x108 CD19CAR T-cells (plus 20% for thawing losses) Dose 1b* (BM
      blasts&gt;20%): 1x107 CD19CAR T-cells (plus 20% for thawing losses) Dose 2* (all patients, in
      the absence of clinically severe CRS): dosing range between minimum dose of ≥5 x 106 CD19CAR
      T-cells (plus 20% for thawing losses) and maximum dose of ≤1x109 CD19CAR T-cells (plus 20%
      for thawing losses)

      *Minimum dose permitted on trial at all Dose levels is ≥5 x 106 CD19CAR T-cells (plus 20% for
      thawing losses) The study will evaluate ATIMP safety and efficacy and the duration of disease
      response in adults with high risk / relapsed CD19+ B-ALL. After completing the interventional
      phase of the study all patients, irrespective of whether they progressed or responded to
      treatment, will enter long term follow up until 5 years post-CD19CAR T-cell infusion.
