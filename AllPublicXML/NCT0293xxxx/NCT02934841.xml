      The investigators hypothesize that it is safe and effective to treat patients with choroidal
      neovascularisation (abnormal blood vessels growing under the retina) secondary to uveitis
      with Conbercept.

      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 20 patients will receive three
      injections of Conbercept into the affected eye (and repeated injections if required), and 20
      patients will receive three sham injections requiring no needle stick, but making the patient
      unaware of whether or not he received active treatment.

      Outcome of the two treatment groups will be compared after one year.

      Primary Outcome Measures: Mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity [ Time
      Frame: 12 months ]

      Secondary Outcome Measures: Mean change from baseline in retinal thickness [ Time Frame: 12
      months ]

      Mean number of Conbercept injections required over 12 months [ Time Frame: 12 months ]

      Ocular and systemic adverse events [ Time Frame: 12 months ]

      Enrollment: 40

      Intervention Details: Drug: Conbercept

      20 patients will receive an intravitreal injections of conbercept 0.5 mg at baseline (visit
      1; month 0) then a subsequent intravitreal injection at month 1 (visit 2) and month 2 (Visit
      3). Patients will be reviewed every month thereafter for 12 months at which time it will be
      determined whether the patient requires retreatment with conbercept 0.5 mg based on
      measurements of visual acuity, Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings, FFA and clinical
      appearance.
