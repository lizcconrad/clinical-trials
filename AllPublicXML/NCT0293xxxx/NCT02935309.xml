    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to see if Capecitabine and Lenvatinib in combination with
      external radiation therapy are effective in treating locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma
      in patients who have not yet had surgery, and what the best dosage is.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>MTD of lenvatinib used in combination with capecitabine and external beam radiation as neoadjuvant therapy for patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma. The MTD of lenvatinib will be defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 participants experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT: Any of the hematology or non-hematologic toxicities noted in Table 3 of the protocol, considered to be at least possibly related to lenvatinib and/or capecitabine.</description>

    <measure>Occurrence of Treatment Related Adverse Events</measure>

    <description>Investigators will identify potential biomarkers for VEGF pathway and attempt to correlate with pCR. The associations of the potential biomarkers and radiosensitivity index (RSI) with pCR will be examined using logistic regression. A two-sided p-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</description>

    <description>Pre-surgery chemotherapy and external radiation therapy. Dose escalation of Lenvatinib; fixed dose Capecitabine; Radiotherapy. Lenvatinib and capecitabine will be started on day 1 with radiation and will be discontinued on the last day of radiation. Surgical resection should occur between 6 - 10 weeks after the participant completes preoperative lenvatinib, capecitabine, and radiation therapy. Postoperative chemotherapy after surgery will be given at investigator's discretion.</description>
