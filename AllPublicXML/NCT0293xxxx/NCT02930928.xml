  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective single center study is to investigate if the accuracy of
      length based body weight estimation by the already investigated algorithm (CLAWAR) can be
      improved by adding another parameter. For this study 500 patients are required to collect
      anonymized data (length, weight, age, mid upperarm circumference and patient habitus by
      visual estimation) for achieving a power of 80% during statistical analysis. The main
      hypothesis ist that CLAWAR's accuracy can be improved.

      This prospective single center study is performed at the university children's Hospital
      zurich. Patients planned for surgery in general anaesthesia with intubation, aged 0 to 16
      years and with a body length suitable for CLAWAR. Patient and parental information is
      performed during the pre-anaesthetic visit.

      After written consent the patient will be included. Patient ÃÅs length and weight will be
      measures earliest one day before data collection. Data collection during anaesthesia has no
      influence on the daily anaesthesia routine and has no impact on patient safety and
      anaesthesia. Patient's data is made anonymous for further inspection. Data is documented in
      Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis calculated with SPSS.

      500 patients are needed for a power of 80%. Primary outcome parameter is the accuracy of
      length based weight estimation using either patient habitus by visual estimation or an
      improved version of the algorithm CLAWAR using the mid upperarm circumference.
