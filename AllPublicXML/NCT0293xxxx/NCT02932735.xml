  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is an important premalignant lesion for gastric cancer.
      Precisely surveillance of patients with GIM may result in early detection and improved
      prognosis. Though important, it is not necessary to recommend surveillance endoscopy for all
      patients with GIM, since the progression rate to gastric cancer within 10 years is only 1.8%
      in those patients.
