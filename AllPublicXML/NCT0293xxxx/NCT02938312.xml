      Using a cluster-randomized study design, 400 overweight or obese African American women
      living in 8 rural counties in Alabama and Mississippi associated with the Deep South Network
      for Cancer Control will be assigned to either a weight loss only or weight loss plus
      community strategies condition for 2 years.

      Weight Loss Only condition: In year 1, participants will attend weekly in-person group
      sessions (1.5 hours each) aimed at behavioral changes for weight loss (diet and physical
      activity) for 6 months followed by twice a month meetings for 3 months, then monthly meetings
      for 3 months. In year 2, monthly phone calls will be used to encourage continued behavior
      change or weight maintenance. In-person group meetings will be facilitated by a trained lay
      staff and community health advisors. Monthly phone calls will be conducted by the community
      health advisor.

      Weight Loss Plus Community Strategies condition: Participants will receive the same weight
      loss program as the Weight Loss Only condition. In addition, a community-based organization
      or other non-profit group in the targeted community will receive funds and technical
      assistance to implement community-wide efforts to increase access to healthy affordable food
      and safe and convenient opportunities for physical activity (e.g., increase farmer's markets,
      develop walking trails).

      Over the course of the study, participants will complete four full assessments to include
      measurement of height and weight (to calculate BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure,
      finger-stick blood draw for lipid and glucose testing, dietary recall, and questionnaires
      concerning participation in physical activity, self-efficacy for eating and exercise
      behaviors, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, social support, and demographic information
      (e.g., age, marital status, education, employment, household income).
