    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg, once
      daily) versus paroxetine (20 mg, once daily) on sexual functioning in healthy participants
      after 5 weeks of double-blind treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vortioxetine. This study will look at the
      effect of treatment on sexual functioning in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 352 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 10 mg

        -  Vortioxetine 20 mg

        -  Paroxetine 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet/capsule, daily, orally for up to 5 weeks.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted in United States. The overall time to participate in
      this study is approximately 7 weeks. Participants will be contacted by telephone 2 weeks
      after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>CSFQ-14 is a structured self-reported questionnaire designed to measure illness- and medication-related changes in sexual functioning that consists of 14 items measuring sexual functioning as a total score (14 items) rated on a 5 point scale from 1 to 5 with a total score range from 14 to 70. Lower scores are associated with worsened sexual functioning.</description>
