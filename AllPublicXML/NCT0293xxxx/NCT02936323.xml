      Protocol PEN-221-001 is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2a study evaluating PEN-221 in
      patients with SSTR2 expressing advanced gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or lung or thymus or
      other neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma
      of the lung.

      Protocol PEN-221-001 will first enroll patients into a dose escalation phase, where a
      Bayesian logistic regression model, guided by the escalation with overdose control principle
      and overseen by a safety review committee, will be used to make dose recommendations and
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      Once the MTD has been confirmed, remaining patients will be enrolled into a full expansion
      phase to assess PEN-221 efficacy in patients with gastrointestinal mid-gut neuroendocrine
      tumors or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer.
