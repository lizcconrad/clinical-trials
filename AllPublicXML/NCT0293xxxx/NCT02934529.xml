  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FIRE-4 study aims to define a treatment concept for patients with RAS wild-type tumours,
      optimised with regard to overall survival. The first-line treatment will be conducted with
      FOLFIRI plus cetuximab, which resulted in a significantly prolonged overall survival versus
      bevacizumab in the FIRE-3 study. Following initial progression (PD1) it is recommended that
      the treatment be continued with FOLFOX plus bevacizumab, as this concept led to significantly
      prolonged survival in the E3200 study. Owing to the encouraging results of the Santini study
      , a cetuximab rechallenge in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy is to be
      performed as part of the third-line treatment in patients who showed a response defined
      according to RECIST 1.1 during the first-line treatment (tumour diameter &lt; -30%) or presented
      with stable tumour disease for at least 6 months (tumour diameter +20 to -30%). The concept
      of the ideal sequence has not yet been studied to date in a clinical trial.

      The study will begin with FPFV: (first study visit of the first patient, signing the
      declaration of consent to participate in the study): scheduled for the 4th quarter of 2014

      Patient recruitment: 36 months

      Treatment duration per patient: Until the time of progression under the third-line treatment
      at the latest. Anticipated individual duration of treatment: 24 months (for patients who
      undergo all three treatment lines -included in part 1), or 6 months in patients who only
      receive third line treatment (included directly in part 2)

      Duration of follow-up after the end of treatment: For all patients, until death or for at
      least 1 year following final termination of any study treatment regardless of the treatment
      line. In so doing, the follow-up period for patients included in part 1 of the study will be
      conducted for a maximum of 5 years from the time of randomisation 1; and for patients
      included in only part 2 of the study (third-line treatment), for a maximum of 3 years from
      the date of randomisation 2.

      End of the study: last follow-up visit of the last study patient scheduled for the 4th
      quarter of 2020
