  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate differences in the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ticagrelor and its active metabolite between patients who received
      ticagrelor and morphine followed by naloxone versus patients treated with ticagrelor and
      morphine alone for unstable angina pectoris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to contemporary guidelines, ticagrelor is a recommended antiplatelet agent in acute
      coronary syndromes, including unstable angina pectoris. Quick platelet inhibition plays
      pivotal role in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. As evidenced in the IMPRESSION
      study, analgesia with morphine delays platelet inhibition in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction. On the other hand, the results of the MOJITO study prove that administration of
      crushed ticagrelor tablets leads to quicker platelet blockage.

      Taking the above into consideration, we created a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study
      aiming to evaluate differences between patients who received crushed ticagrelor orally
      followed by either 1) a combination of intravenous morphine and orally administered naloxone
      or 2) intravenous morphine alone.

      The primary study outcome is time needed for ticagrelor and its active metabolite to reach
      their maximum plasma concentration in each study arm. Secondary outcomes include ticagrelor
      and AR-C124900XX maximum concentration and the area under the plasma concentration curve for
      both agents.

      Platelet reactivity will be assessed with the Multiplate Analyzer in all study participants
      at nine predefined time points.
