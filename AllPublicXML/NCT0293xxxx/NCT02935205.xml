    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of enzalutamide and indomethacin and to see
      how well they work in treating patients with prostate cancer that does not respond to
      treatment with hormones, has come back, or has spread from where it started to other places
      in the body. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      enzalutamide and indomethacin may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount of androgen
      the body makes and/or blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of indomethacin and enzalutamide when given in combination, and to
      determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response that is defined as a 50% or more
      reduction from the baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response as determined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2
      criteria (PCWG2).

      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with indomethacin and
      enzalutamide.

      III. To evaluate molecular correlatives for patient response and outcomes through the
      analysis of patient baseline tumor specimens (diagnostic biopsy) along with serial blood
      specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and indomethacin PO twice daily
      (BID) or QD. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer (CaP);
             CaP can be recurrent disease after definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy or
             radiation therapy) for localized CaP, or metastatic CaP

          -  Patients must have CaP deemed to be castration-resistant by one or more of the
             following criteria (despite androgen deprivation when applicable):

               -  Progression of unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior
                  to initial administration of drug

               -  Progression of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior
                  to initial administration of drug for PSA evaluation and for imaging studies
                  (e.g, bone scans)

               -  Rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be documented
                  over a reference value (measure 1); the first rising PSA (measure 2) should be
                  taken at least 7 days after the reference value; a third confirmatory PSA measure
                  (2nd beyond the reference level) should be greater than the second measure, and
                  it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure; if this is not the
                  case, a fourth PSA measurement is required to be taken and be greater than the
                  second measure

          -  Measurable disease is not required

               -  Patients who have measurable disease must have had X-rays, scans or physical
                  examinations used for tumor measurement completed within 28 days prior to initial
                  administration of drug

               -  Patients must have non-measurable disease (such as nuclear medicine bone scans)
                  and non-target lesions (such as PSA level) assessed within 28 days prior to
                  initial administration of drug

               -  Soft tissue disease that has been radiated within two months prior to
                  registration is not assessable as measurable disease; soft tissue disease that
                  has been radiated two or more months prior to registration is assessable as
                  measurable disease provided that the lesion has progressed following radiation;
                  as the biology of previously irradiated tumors may be different from
                  non-irradiated tumors, patients must have at least one measurable lesion outside
                  the previously irradiated region in order to be considered to have measurable
                  disease

               -  If PSA is the only indicator of disease and patients do not have any metastatic
                  disease, PSA value must be 5.0 or higher

          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated; if the method of castration
             was luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (leuprolide or goserelin) or
             antagonists (degarelix), then the patient must be willing to continue the use of LHRH
             agonists or antagonists; serum testosterone must be at castration levels (&lt; 50 ng/dL)
             within 3 months prior to registration

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;
             1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after
             completion of enzalutamide administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events
