    <textblock>
      This observational study will compare outcomes of a prospectively-enrolled cohort of
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HCT) recipients with outcomes of a cohort of age-matched
      historical non-HCT controls. Patients undergoing alloHCT will receive HCT in a US transplant
      center and be reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research
      (CIBMTR) using well-established CIBMTR report forms and data collection procedures as well as
      a study-specific supplemental form. Data on the historical non-HCT controls will be collected
      at 14 US academic centers. These centers will provide data on all consecutive patients with
      PMF, post-ET MF, or post-PV MF referred to their institutions between 2000 and 2012.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary MF (PMF), post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) MF, or post-polycythemia
      vera (PV) MF, with intermediate-2 or high-risk disease as determined by the DIPSS, and aged
      ≥55 at the time of DIPSS assessment are eligible for this study. For the allogeneic HCT arm
      of the HLA-Matched Donor HCT Study, donors must be either 6/6 HLA-matched related donors,
      defined by Class I (HLA-A and -B) intermediate resolution or high resolution DNA-based typing
      and Class II (HLA-DRBI) at high resolution DNA-based typing (but not monozygotic twins), OR
      an 8/8 HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 at high resolution DNA-based typing matched unrelated donors;
      both peripheral blood stem cells and bone marrow grafts are allowed, and all conditioning
      regimen intensities and graph versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens are allowed.
      For the Haploidentical Donor Study, donors must be haploidentical.

      This study will target accrual of 650 patients receiving alloHCT, including approximately 225
      receiving myeloablative conditioning. Participating centers are expected to provide data for
      approximately 2,400 patients to form the non-HCT historical control cohort.

    <time_frame>Five years post transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Compare leukemia-free survival at five years from DIPSS assessment date to the date of progression to AML or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Two co-secondary analyses will be conducted, one for all alloHCT patients versus Arm 2 and one for the subset of patients receiving MAC prior to alloHCT versus Arm 2. Observation is censored at the date of last follow-up for patients known to be alive without leukemia. Progression to AML is defined as &gt;20% leukemia blasts in bone marrow or in the peripheral blood.</description>
