  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the quality of life in patients treated for submucosal leiomyomas
      using the Truclear hysteroscopic morcellator compared to women managed medically. Study
      population includes women age 18 and older with symptomatic submucosal myomas. Patients will
      be asked to complete the Uterine Myoma Symptom and Health-related Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) at enrollment and at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Submucosal myomas are a common cause of pelvic complaints and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)
      and there are many available modalities for treatment. Hysteroscopic myomectomy is a
      minimally invasive approach for removal of submucosal leiomyomas. Alternatively, medical
      management can be attempted. This study aims to evaluate the quality of life in patients
      treated for submucosal leiomyomas using the Truclear hysteroscopic morcellator compared to
      women managed medically. Study population includes women age 18 and older with symptomatic
      submucosal myomas. Patients will be asked to complete the Uterine Myoma Symptom and
      Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) at enrollment and at 1, 3, and 6
      months after treatment.
