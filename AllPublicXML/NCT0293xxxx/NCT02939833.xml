  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing meningeoma resection surgery will be randomly assigned to two groups. One
      group will receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.5% ropivacaine, whereas the other group will
      receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.9% saline after anesthesia induction and before skull-pin
      insertion. Serum levels of TNF-α、IL-6 and IL-1β will be measured and compared at before
      surgery, 1h, 24h and 72h after surgery, respectively. VAS score, dosage of pain-control
      medicine and NRS score at the first three days after surgery, ratio of intracranial infection
      within 30d after surgery, and total hospitalization days and medical expenditure will also be
      recorded and compared between the two groups.
