    <textblock>
      Chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) has been defined as a persistent pain in the
      lower back for at least three months with no known causes. The CNSLBP prevalence is estimated
      of 90% among all types of the LBP. The LBP imposes high direct and indirect costs on the
      patients and the society. Whereas a specific pathology has not been identified for CNSLBP,
      mechanical factors (e.g. changes in muscle length, strength, or endurance) may contribute to
      the pain and disability.
