      The goal of this pilot study is to explore the efficacy of chloroquine in terminating
      persistent and longstanding persistent AF and assess its potential role as a pharmacological
      cardioversion agent for the management of AF.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot study to explore the efficacy of chloroquine in terminating
      persistent and longstanding persistent AF within 2 weeks of drug administration and assess
      its potential role as a pharmacological cardioversion agent for the management of AF.
      Subjects will be followed for 2 weeks from the start of drug administration to study drug
      termination.

             defined as continuous AF that is sustained more than 7 days but less than 12 months.
             Episodes of AF of ≥ 48 hours duration in which a decision is made to terminate with
             electrical or pharmacological cardioversion prior to 7 days will also be classified as
             persistent AF Longstanding persistent AF - defined as continuous AF of &gt; 12 months and
             ≤ 3years of duration

          -  AF must be documented at least once either by ECG, Holter monitoring, loop recorder,
             telemetry, trans-telephonic monitoring, pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator readouts
             within 24 months prior to enrollment

             previous 12 months) who:

               -  are pregnant or breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during study or

               -  who are not surgically sterile

               -  and are not practicing two acceptable methods of birth control, or do not plan to
                  continue practicing two acceptable methods of birth control throughout the study
                  (highly effective methods are listed under section 6.0 Pregnancy)

          -  Current participation in another clinical study

          -  Serious or active medical or psychiatric condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may interfere with treatment, assessment, or compliance with the
             protocol
