      To study the effects of ubiquinol as a &quot;metabolic resuscitator&quot; in post-cardiac arrest.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest (CA) occurs in more than 400,000 patients in the United States each year with
      an estimated mortality of greater than 90%. The majority of patients who are resuscitated
      from CA will succumb to the neurologic morbidity associated with the post-CA syndrome and
      ischemic-reperfusion injury. Currently, there are no pharmacologic agents known to offer
      survival benefit or to prevent devastating neurologic injury in post-CA patients.

      A potential therapeutic target following ischemia-reperfusion injury is mitochondrial
      function in the injured cell and/or reduction of oxygen free radicals. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
      is an essential mitochondrial co-factor and free radical scavenger that has been proposed as
      a neuroprotective agent in various neurodegenerative disorders as well as a cardioprotective
      agent. CoQ10 have furthermore shown exciting preliminary results as a potential therapy in
      post-CA.

      In order to test the effects of ubiquinol as a &quot;metabolic resuscitator&quot; in post-CA patients
      and to provide additional preliminary data for a large-scale clinical trial, the
      investigators are conducting a randomized, double-blind, place-controlled trial of ubiquinol
      in post-CA patients.
