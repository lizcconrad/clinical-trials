  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The accelerated rehabilitation protocol in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA-AR) was designed to
      improve the functionality and optimize early discharge of patients undergoing THA surgery.
      This study compared physical therapy protocol in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA-PT) already
      deployed in Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital with THA-AR.

    <description>Day 1) Patients started approach after discharged anesthesia. Patients received verbal orientation and demonstration of the physiotherapy exercises that would strengthen muscles (gluteal and thigh). They were oriented to the decubitus changes and how to leave bed. They practiced 3 repetitions of 12 complete movements for each exercise;
Day 2) Patients repeated the exercises learned from day 1. Following the proposed activities patients received verbal instructions on gait training and then starting gait training. Patients started gait training on this second day only if they felt safe and claimed that their pain was controlled. Otherwise, training was postponed to the next day;
Day 3) Patients repeated the day 2. And the patient who had not started gait training in the day 2, began it on the day 3;
Day 4 and other days) Patients repeated the gait training until the discharge date.</description>
