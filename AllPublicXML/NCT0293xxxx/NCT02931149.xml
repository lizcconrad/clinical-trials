      To avoid complications secondary to advanced endoscopic resection techniques (Endoscopic
      Mucosal Resection -EMR- or Endoscopic Submucosal Disection -ESD-) the endoscopists have to
      avoid deep thermal damage and increase mucosal healing. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has
      demonstrated efficacy in preclinical endoscopic resection models.

      Background:To avoid complications secondary to advanced endoscopic resection techniques
      (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection -EMR- or Endoscopic Submucosal Disection -ESD-) the
      endoscopists have to avoid deep thermal damage and increase mucosal healing. Platelet-rich
      plasma (PRP) has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical endoscopic resection models.

      Aim: Evaluate the efficacy of PRP on participants submitted to advanced endoscopic resection
      techniques: EMR or ESD.

      Material and Methods: The investigators have evaluated a prospective clinical study. The
      investigators have included 12 participants submitted to EMR or ESD. Patients were informed
      and accepted to participate with a written consent. Prior to endoscopy PRP was obtained from
      autologous blood with a comercial kit. Submucosal injection with PRP were performed prior to
      resection. Resection was performed with standard technique. Participants were followed-up
      after the procedure.
