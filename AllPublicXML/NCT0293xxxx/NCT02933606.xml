  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, evaluating the effects of
      BNC210 versus placebo on the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, as measured by the
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5).

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effects of BNC210 on anxiety,
      depression, global functioning and patient reported outcomes in patients with PTSD. Safety
      and tolerability of BNC210 will also be assessed. Study participants will receive 12 weeks of
      blinded treatment followed by a 3 week follow-up period.

                  least 3 months prior and through Screening, with the intent to remain on the same
                  dose through to Week 16.

               -  As needed (PRN) use of benzodiazepines (BZD) at a frequency not exceeding 2 days
