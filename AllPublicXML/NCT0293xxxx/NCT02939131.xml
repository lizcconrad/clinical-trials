    <textblock>
      IMPAACT 2002 is a prospective, multi-site, two-arm, cluster-randomized study to evaluate
      whether a health and wellness Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Medication Management (COMB-R)
      intervention for depression demonstrates improved depression and medical outcomes for
      HIV-infected youth in the US compared to enhanced standard care (ESC).

      IMPAACT 2002 is a prospective, multi-site, two-arm, cluster-randomized study to evaluate
      whether a health and wellness Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Medication Management (COMB-R)
      intervention for depression demonstrates improved depression outcomes (e.g., decreased
      depressive symptoms and greater remission and response rates) and medical outcomes (e.g.,
      increased CD4 T-cell count, decreased HIV RNA level) among HIV-infected youth in the US
      compared to enhanced standard care (ESC). Youth enrolled in the study will attend a
      Screening/Entry Visit and study visits at Weeks 1, 6, 12, and 24. They will have two
      additional follow-up visits at Weeks 36 and 48 for the study team to evaluate if observed
      effects of the intervention are maintained. The intervention is a treatment for depression
      that includes manualized Health and Wellness Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and
      algorithm-driven Medication Management designed to address the unique challenges faced by
      this population.
