  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery usually leads to postoperative immunosuppression, which is characterized by
      predisposition to develop secondary nosocomial infections and high risk of tumorigenesis and
      development. Current studies showed that acupuncture treatment was effective on
      immunoregulation. Our previous study proved that electroacupuncture (EA) can regulate the
      innate immune system overreaction to endotoxin and reduce excessive inflammatory response
      induced by myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. However, whether transcutaneous electrical
      acupoint stimulation(TEAS) can improve immune function in patients post cardiac surgery is
      not clear. The investigators perform a randomized controlled study to evaluate whether TEAS
      treatment can improve the immunosuppression post cardiac surgery, which may provide rational
      for the development of TEAS to treat cardiac patients perioperatively.

    <description>TEAS is a kind of treatment combining transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with traditional Chinese acupuncture points, and inputs a specific low frequency pulse current into the body through skin.Patients allocated in the TEAS group receive standardised treatment at 2 acupuncture points (ST36 and BL23). The investigator put the electrode patch on the skin, connected electro-acupuncture device, and select the maximum current intensity patients can endure. The acupuncture treatment starts from 30min prior to operation to the end of surgery, and then four times within 48 hours post operation, 30 minutes for each time.</description>
