  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of people after stroke demonstrate mobility limitations, which may reduce their
      physical activity levels. Task-specific training has shown to be an effective intervention to
      improve mobility in individuals with stroke, however, little is known about the impact of
      this intervention on levels of physical activity. The main objective will be to investigate
      the efficacy of a task-specific training, focused on both upper and lower limbs, in improving
      physical activity levels and mobility in individuals with stroke. The secondary objective
      will be to investigate the effect of the training, in improving muscle strength, exercise
      capacity, and quality of life. A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment will
      assign eligible participants to either: 1) experimental group or 2) control group.
      Participants will receive interventions three times per week over 12 weeks. The experimental
      group will undertake task-specific training, while the control group will undertake global
      stretching and memory exercises, and health education sessions. Primary outcomes will include
      measures of physical activity levels and mobility, whereas secondary outcomes will be muscle
      strength, exercise capacity, and quality of life. The outcomes will be measured at baseline,
      12 weeks post-intervention, and four and 12 weeks follow-up. The findings of this trial have
      the potential to provide important insights regarding the effects of task-specific training,
      focused on both upper and lower limbs, in preventing secondary post-stroke complications and
      improving the participants' general health through changes in physical activity levels.

      The sample size was calculated considering the results of the Timed Up Go test reported by
      Yang et al., which involved a task-specific training program with individuals at the chronic
      phases of stroke. The Timed Up and Go test scores for the control and experimental groups at
      baseline were 14.3±7s and 14.6±7.4s, and after were 14.4±6.7s and 12.9±6.5s, respectively.
      Significant within and between-group differences were observed and the difference within the
      experimental group was -1.7±1.1s. Based upon this value, a sample size of 16 subjects per
      group, i.e. a total of 32 participants, would be required, considering a significance level
      (α) of 5% and a power of 0.80. Based on the assumption that about 15% of the participants may
      drop out during the course of the study, a target of 38 participants in total was set, 19 per
      group.

      Data analyses will be performed by the SPSS for Windows® (release 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago,
      IL, USA). Descriptive statistics will be carried-out for all outcome variables. Differences
      between the groups at baseline will be investigated with the independent Student's t-tests
      for all variables related to the demographic and clinical characteristics. If differences
      between the groups at baseline exist, analysis of covariance will be used to eliminate the
      influence of extraneous factors.

      The effects of the interventions will be analysed in two ways, namely from the data collected
      and by intention-to-treat analyses, where the last available value in the drop-outs will be
      carried forward to represent the missing data. Analyses of variance with repeated measures
      (2x4) will be employed to investigate the mean and interaction effects between the groups
      (intervention x control) and the time (pre-, post-interventions, and follow ups) for the
      primary physical activity level and mobility outcomes and the following secondary outcomes:
      muscular strength, exercise capacity, and SSQOL scores. Group descriptions will be presented
      as means and SD, and effect sizes at 95% confidence intervals will be reported.

      The effect sizes will be calculated to determine the magnitude of the differences between the
      groups. The differences between the two mean values will be expressed in units of their SD,
      expressed as Cohen's d, or mean results for the experimental group minus the mean results for
      the control group, divided by the SD of the control group. Effect sizes between 0.2 and 0.5
      will be considered small; between 0.5 and 0.8, medium; and above 0.8, large.
