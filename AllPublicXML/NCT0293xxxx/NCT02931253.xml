      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug metformin will help patients who are
      overweight and have atrial fibrillation. This study aims to see if metformin helps patients
      stay in normal sinus rhythm after a catheter ablation.

      Metformin is investigational for use in patients with atrial fibrillation. Metformin is
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus. Metformin is used with a proper diet and exercise program to control high blood
      sugar, and has been shown to help people lose weight. This study aims to look at the effects
      of metformin on weight loss and heart rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation.
