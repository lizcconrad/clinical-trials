  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase-II clinical study to assess whether intense passive mobilization of the elbow
      during the early stage is effective in preventing spasticity from occurring at a later stage.
      A group of subacute stroke patients was treated with the device named NEUROExos Elbow Module
      (NEEM) on a daily basis, in addition to traditional physical therapy. The outcome was
      assessed in terms of (i) system safety, (ii) system usability and (iii) treatment efficacy.

      Investigators expected that intense therapy performed in the sub-acute phase following the
      stroke would be effective in preventing elbow spasticity from occurring at a later stage
      (i.e. 3-4 months after the stroke), the latter being quantified by means of the Modified
      Ashworth Scale (MAS). Similarly to other phase-II studies in the field of post-stroke
      rehabilitation, the present study will include only one group of patients. As a secondary
      objective, similarly to other studies with robot-assisted therapy, investigators wiil test
      the ability of this system to be used for assessing rehabilitation outcome. Investigators
      will introduce novel evaluation metrics based on the kinematics and kinetics variables
      recorded by the NEEM and compared them with MAS values.
