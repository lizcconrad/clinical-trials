    <textblock>
      Post-op analgesia is the most important part of early and safe patient recovery in thoracic
      surgery. This is for both humane and patient outcome reasons. Patient outcomes are greatly
      improved with optimal pain control and complications and length of stay are minimized. Most
      post-op thoracic complications are from decreased respiratory effort, failure to clear
      secretions and pulmonary infections from retained sputum with subsequent sequelae. Good
      post-operative analgesia not only prevents these complications but also considerably enhances
      early mobilization and thus, decreased hospital stay and efficient resource allocation. Early
      post-operative pain is also associated with late and chronic post thoracotomy pain syndromes
      which can be debilitating.

      Pain following thoracic surgery is different to the standard surgical incision pain and is
      due to intercostal nerve damage, compression or traction injury to the nerve. This occurs
      with the incision, rib retraction, and is compounded by the on-going need for respiratory
      effort. The approach to managing this pain is multi-modal analgesia. The standard regimen
      stretches from preemptive analgesia and preoperative placement of thoracic epidurals to
      post-op opioid infusions. However, non-invasive pharmacology includes paracetamol, non
      steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mild and moderate opioids as well as
      anti-convulsants like pregabalin. However, opioid use has well-known side effects including
      central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression which unfortunately delay mobility
      and recovery. This has motivated opioid-sparing strategies.

      The investigators study aims to assess whether the addition of perineural dexamethasone (a
      steroid) to the current practice of local anaesthetic wound catheters increases the efficacy
      and duration of analgesia provided.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent years have seen the importance of early mobility and respiratory toilet to minimise
      complications and hospital stay. Newer methods of pain relief with fewer systemic effects
      have become even more important. Continuous wound infiltration catheters (CWI's) aim to
      deliver local anaesthetic agents directly into the wound (4). This technique goes back to
      1994, and has been established in this hospital and is used in a non-structured manner in
      thoracic surgery. Recent studies have demonstrated that the addition of dexamethasone (a
      steroid) to local anaesthetic agents in similar nerve blocks significantly improves the
      analgesic affect and prolongs the duration of the analgesia. To the best of the investigators
      knowledge this has not been tested in a thoracic surgery cohort of patients, though it has
      been tested safely and effectively in the thorax in healthy volunteers and in postoperative
      analgesia in abdominal and musculoskeletal post op patients. The investigators aim is to
      assess whether the addition of perineural dexamethasone to the local anaesthetic in CWI's is
      superior to the local anaesthetic alone in thoracic post operative patients, and at which
      dose. They also want to assess the levels of pain experienced 1 month post op to evaluate the
      potential effect of dexamethasone on post thoracoscopy pain syndrome.

      The investigators aim is to compare the use of local anaesthetic agent in combination with
      perineural dexamethasone with the current practice of local anaesthetic alone at relieving
      pain in the immediate post op pain period. The investigators also want to assess whether the
      8mg dose of dexamethasone used in similar studies is the optimal dose or whether a similar
      effect can be observed at a smaller dose of 4mg.
