  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid analgesics are the most common postoperative pain medications used among dentists in
      the United States.Although these medications are highly effective in the postoperative dental
      pain management, not all patients optimally benefit from this therapy. Many suffer adverse
      consequences such as nausea, emesis, and psychomotor impairment, and there is a high
      prevalence of opioid prescription misuse among substance abusers within the dental patient
      population.

      The use of non-opioid analgesics including ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the management of
      postoperative dental pain has demonstrated equivalent or superior analgesic effects compared
      to opioid analgesic therapies, typically with significantly less adverse effects.However,
      despite these results, dentists have encountered a high variability in the success of
      non-opioid analgesic responses among the postoperative dental pain population.Thus, new
      strategies for earlier recognition of analgesic responses for pain medications is fundamental
      in the field of dentistry. Therefore, this study will evaluate the clinical utility of
      pharmacogenomic testing in acute postoperative dental pain management among healthy adults
      who undergo extraction of impacted mandibular third molar.

      To date, the use of pharmacogenomic methods in medicine has broadened our understanding of
      the important role of genes and different phenotypes/genotypes that make each individual
      unique in pain responses, including drug biotransformation, transportation, and drug-related
      side effects to name a few.Thus, recognizing the genetic profile of each individual prior to
      the prescription of pain medication for postoperative dental pain management will be
      essential to provide a more effective and safer pain therapy.Additionally, we suggest that
      80% of the individuals in the general population exhibit a genetic profile that influence a
      normal pain response to non-opioid pain therapies. Hence we postulate that the integration of
      a pharmacogenomic testing to guide the prescription of ibuprofen and acetaminophen, not only,
      could lead to improved clinical postoperative dental pain outcomes, but also, significantly
      reduce opioid analgesics prescriptions by dentists.
