  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients in the emergency department with
      migraine headache who are administered an intravenous fluid bolus will report greater
      improvement in pain scores than control patients.

      The investigators intend to perform a small-scale pilot study assessing the effectiveness of
      IV fluid therapy for patients presenting to the ED with migraine headache. Patients will be
      randomly allocated to receive a bolus of 1000 ml normal saline or no fluid bolus. Patients
      and outcome assessors will be blinded to the assigned study group. Research assistants will
      assess pain scores, nausea, and functional disability at time 0 (just prior to starting the
      intervention), 60 minutes, and 120 minutes. Participants will be contacted 48 hours after
      leaving the ED to assess symptom burden following discharge.

    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the difference in verbal pain rating (0-10) between the start of the study intervention and one hour later, at completion of the intervention. The minimum clinically significant difference between treatment groups on the 0-10 verbal scale is 1.3.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes, 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>We will ask patients to describe their functional disability due to headache as none, mild (able to perform all activities of daily living, but with some difficulty), moderate (unable to perform some activities of daily living), and severe (unable to perform most activities or requiring bed rest).</description>

    <description>At 48 hours patients will be asked &quot;The next time you visit the ED with a headache, would you wish to receive the same IV fluid treatment again?&quot;</description>
