  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most common chronic diseases, affecting the
      quality of life of patients who suffer. Despite medical and surgical treatments available,
      there are a significant number of people suffering from CRS refractory to these standard
      treatments.

      A preliminary clinical trial conducted at CHUM Hôtel-Dieu, has allowed us to evaluate the
      therapeutic potential of intranasal irrigation of probiotics in patients with CRS. This
      treatment administered twice daily for 14 days was well tolerated and resulted in improved
      chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms.

      Prior to deployment on a larger scale, the safety of this therapy must be confirmed in a
      healthy population, free of sinus disease. Therefore, this study aims to assess the safety of
      the use of probiotic intranasal irrigation in healthy volunteers.

      If the participant (healthy volunteer) agrees to participate in the study, and after signing
      the information consent form, her/his participation in this project will consist to receive
      the experimental treatment of probiotics, to come to three (3) medical assessment visits at
      CHUM Hôtel-Dieu, over a period of time of three (3) weeks, and answer to one (1) phone call.

      This study will include the following four (4) periods :

        1. determination of eligibility period - Day 0

        2. saline irrigation period (for 7 days) - between Day 0 and Day 7

        3. probiotic treatment period ( for 7 days) - between Day 7 and Day 14

        4. telephone follow-up period - Day 21
