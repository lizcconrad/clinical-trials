  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study's principle purpose is to determine whether decreasing waiting time before being
      seen for antenatal care increases demand for and use of antenatal care services in
      Mozambique.

      This protocol describes a pilot study that will test the impact of a scheduling intervention
      intended to reduce waiting times for antenatal care. The study will include one intervention
      health clinic and one control clinic in Maputo, Mozambique. In the intervention facility
      women attending antenatal care will be informed that if they return at their scheduled date
      and time they will be seen within one hour by clinic staff rather than having to wait for an
      indefinite amount of time before being seen for care. Appointment cards will be clipped into
      ANC cards, which collect routine health data and are kept by women at the end of their ANC
      visit. Health facility staff will be trained to identify women who return at their scheduled
      time and to manage patient flow such that scheduled women are received quickly. After the
      start date of the intervention, all women attending ANC at the health facility will be
      provided a scheduled return date and time window. Baseline and endline exit interview surveys
      will be conducted in both intervention and control facilities to compare changes in waiting
      time, number of ANC visits, and provider satisfaction over the course the study period
      between clinics.

    <description>This intervention will include a scheduled date and time for prenatal care follow-up visits. Women in the intervention group seeking care for their first ANC appointment will be offered several appointment slots on their return date by the nurse providing their first ANC visit. Women will be able select among the time options and will be provided an appointment card with their scheduled date and time. Staff will limit the number of scheduled women per hour by maintaining an appointment book. Clinic staff will be trained to differentiate between women returning for a scheduled visit from first prenatal visits, emergencies, and unscheduled return visits. First visits and emergencies will be seen during the first 2 hours after clinic opening and unscheduled women will be seen during a one-hour time slot midday. When women return on their date, they will be seen within one hour of their appointment time by clinic staff.</description>
