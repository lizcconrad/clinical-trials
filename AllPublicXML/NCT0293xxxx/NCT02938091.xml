  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluated dietary modulation of LIPC rs1800588 (-514 C/T) for lipids and
      glucose using a randomized cross-over design comparing a high-fat Western diet and a low-fat
      traditional Hispanic diet in Caribbean Hispanics (n=42; 4 weeks/phase).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LIPC -514 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been inconsistently associated
      with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in population studies, supporting the
      possibility of its modulation by dietary factors. To investigate the interaction between the
      common LIPC -514(C/T) SNP and dietary fat, the investigators compared changes in lipids and
      glucose in response to two levels of dietary total fat (20% energy intake vs. 39% energy
      intake) in a crossover, randomized dietary intervention study enrolling Caribbean Hispanics.
      Individuals were screened for LIPC rs1800588 genotype prior to enrollment, and
      genotype-associated differences in response to diet were evaluated.

      The study was designed to test the following hypotheses:

        1. Carriers of the T allele consuming a low fat (LF) diet will have decreased hepatic
           lipase activity as compared with subjects with the CC genotype at the -514(C/T)
           polymorphism. Conversely, in individuals consuming a high fat (HF) diet, T carriers will
           exhibit an impaired ability to down regulate hepatic lipase activity.

        2. Based on differences in hepatic lipase activity, the investigators hypothesized that a
           significant and clinically relevant proportion of the individual variability in fasting
           plasma HDL-C responses to changes in dietary fat intake would be due to variability at
           the LIPC locus. Specifically, CC subjects will respond to increases in total dietary fat
           consumption with significant increases in HDL-C concentration. Conversely, increased fat
           consumption in T carrying subjects will result in decreased HDL-C concentration.

    <description>The dietary intervention was designed as a typical Western diet (39% total fat, 14% saturated fat, 12% monounsaturated fat, 9.6% polyunsaturated fat, 42% carbohydrate, 8.8 grams fiber/1000 kcal)</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low-fat diet</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The dietary intervention consisted of a Hispanic diet (20% total fat, 5.5% saturated fat, 9.6% monounsaturated fat, 3.7% polyunsaturated fat, 61% carbohydrate, 13.7 grams fiber/1000 kcal). The diet was comprised of typical foods and recipes resembling a traditional Caribbean Hispanic diet and differed from the Western diet in four primary ways: 1) more fruits and vegetables, 2) more beans (e.g. mixed dishes to reduce serving size of white rice while increasing legumes), 3) emphasis on reduced-fat dairy products (e.g., 1% fat milk), and 4) lower total fat and lower animal and hydrogenated fat.</description>
