  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common diseases with increasing
      prevalence in advanced age. Knee OA results in movement restriction, sleep disturbance, and
      disability. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is employed often in the symptomatic treatment of
      knee OA. It has been estimated that 3.4 million TKAs will be performed in the year 2030 in
      the United States alone. Many studies report rewarding outcomes for patients, but other
      research shows there are many patients that remain dissatisfied post-arthroplasty.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether genicular radiofrequency ablation can
      relieve chronic post-arthroplasty knee pain.

      Chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common diseases with increasing
      prevalence in advanced age. Knee OA results in movement restriction, sleep disturbance, and
      disability. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is employed often in the symptomatic treatment of
      knee OA. It has been estimated that 3.4 million TKAs will be performed in the year 2030 in
      the United States alone. Many studies report rewarding outcomes for patients, but other
      research shows there are many patients that remain dissatisfied post-arthroplasty.

      As the prevalence of knee arthroplasty increases, so does the frequency of revisions. It has
      been found that 20% of patients reporting painful knee arthroplasties were not able to be
      diagnosed with a specific cause and were therefore referred to a pain specialist.
      Pharmacologic therapy and non-surgical interventions are often employed with minimal benefit
      to the patient's level of disability as indicated by clinical evidence.

      Genicular radiofrequency ablation seems to be a safe, effective and minimally invasive
      therapy for chronic knee OA patients who have had a positive diagnostic block. No study has
      determined whether genicular radiofrequency ablation can relieve chronic post-arthroplasty
      knee pain. The investigators propose to examine the effect of genicular radiofrequency
      ablation in chronic post-arthroplasty knee pain in patients who respond positively to
      diagnostic nerve blocks.
