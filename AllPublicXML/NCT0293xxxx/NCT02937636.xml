  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-centre, examiner-blind, randomized, stratified, two-treatment, parallel group
      clinical study will evaluate the efficacy of a 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride dentifrice
      compared to a reference dentifrice to control gingivitis (gingival bleeding and visual signs
      of gingival inflammation) in dentally and periodontally healthy adult volunteers over 12
      weeks use in a Chinese population.

      This clinical study will be carried out in healthy adult volunteers with moderate gingivitis.
      Treatment effect will be determined by evaluating the efficacy, in a Chinese population, of a
      dentifrice containing 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride to control gingivitis and supra-gingival
      plaque following 6 and 12 weeks twice daily brushing, compared to a fluoride control
      dentifrice. During the 12 week treatment period, participant will brush with their allocated
      study product twice daily.

    <description>Plaque Index (PI) will be scored as follows: 0 = No plaque, 1 = Slight flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth, 2 = A thin continuous band of plaque (1mm or smaller) at the cervical margin of the tooth, 3 = A band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than 1/3 of the area, 4 = Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of the area, 5 = Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the crown of the tooth</description>

             a surface that has 50% of the surface gradable for each clinical index. Third molars,
             orthodontically banded/bonded, fully crowned or extensively restored or grossly
             carious teeth are not included in the tooth count, moderate gingivitis present at the
             screening visit (in the opinion of the clinical examiner from a gross visual
             examination) and mean whole mouth MGI between 1.75 and 2.30 and a mean overall PI

             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, could affect gingival condition (e.g.
             calcium channel blockers, or aspirin therapy).

          -  Baseline (Visit 2): Has taken, or currently taking, antibiotics in the previous 14

             affect gingival condition in the previous 14 days.

          -  Have current active caries or periodontitis that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator, compromise the study or the oral health of the participants if they
