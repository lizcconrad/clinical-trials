      DRINK is an open-label randomised controlled feasibility trial of high versus ad libitum
      water intake in ADPKD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) affects 12.5 million people worldwide, and
      accounts for 7% of those requiring renal replacement therapy. The hormone vasopressin drives
      cyst growth until ultimately most of the normal functioning kidney tissue is replaced and
      compressed by cysts over the life course. Half of those affected will require dialysis by the
      age of 55 years.

      Vasopressin blockade has emerged as a viable strategy for altering disease course. High water
      intake suppresses vasopressin, and may therefore slow cyst growth and consequent disease
      progression. However, evidence to support high water intake in PKD is lacking, and it is not
      clear whether patients can adhere sufficiently to a high water intake.

      DRINK is a single-centre prospective, open label, parallel group randomised controlled
      feasibility trial. The primary objective is to establish whether a definitive large
      randomised trial comparing high versus ad libitum water intake on long-term disease
      progression is deliverable. Fifty patients will be recruited from the Renal Genetics service
      at Addenbrooke's Hospital. Participants will be randomly allocated to the high water intake
      (high) or the ad libitum (standard) water intake group. For the high intake group the aim is
      to drink large enough volumes of water to achieve and maintain dilute urine (urine osmolality
      &lt; 270 mOsmo/kg or urine specific gravity ≤ 1.010 ). Multiple methods will be employed to
      promote adherence these include instruction and education as well as self-monitoring of urine
      specific gravity twice weekly by participants and the recording of results via a trial
      specific smartphone application.
