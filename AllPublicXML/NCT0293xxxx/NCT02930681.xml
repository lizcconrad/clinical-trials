  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucosanol had previously been proven to be effective in aiding weight loss and weight loss
      maintenance. Studies have also shown that Glucosanol (also known as Phaseolamin), was
      effective in aiding weight loss and also has evidence on reducing post-prandial glucose
      levels. This study is to enrich the existing evidence on dose-dependent post-prandial glucose
      effects of Glucosanol
