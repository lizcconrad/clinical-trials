  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean scar diverticula (CSD) is a novel recognized cause of postmenstrual abnormal uterine
      bleeding in women. No clinical guidelines have been issued for the management of CSD. The
      investigators have previously demonstrated that vaginal repair of CSD was an relative
      effective treatment of CSD. However, only 28.2% of the CSD patients normalized to less than 7
      days of menstruation, whereas 51.2% of women had 7 to 10 days of menstruation at 6 months
      post vaginal repair. Postoperative menstruation may contribute to surgical site infections,
      which may subsequently affect the healing of uterine scars. Treatment CSD patients with
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) may has the potential to improve therapeutic
      effects of vaginal repair. Therefore, the current multiple-center randomized controlled trial
      was designed to evaluate whether the application of GnRHa in combination with vaginal repair
      could achieve better clinical effects than those achieved by vaginal CSD repair alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative menstruation may contribute to surgical site infections, an inflammatory
      environment, congestion at the site of the suture, immune cell infiltration, and other
      effects and may subsequently affect the healing of uterine scars. It is reasonable to
      hypothesize that delaying the postoperative menstrual recovery period may allow uterine scars
      to heal without the inflammatory reaction caused by menstruation. Treatment with
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) has the ability to suppress
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) release, thereby maintaining
      low estrogen levels and causing temporary amenorrhea. A prolonged menstrual recovery period
      may be achieved after GnRHa administration. Vaginal repair of CSD combined with GnRHa may
      improve the therapeutic effects of treatment of CSD. Therefore, the randomized study was
      designed to evaluate whether the application of GnRHa in combination with vaginal repair
      could achieve better clinical effects than those achieved by vaginal CSD repair alone.

    <description>CSD patients were treated with vaginal repair of CSD in combination with GnRHa (Zoladex, 3.6 mg, AstraZeneca, Macclesfield, United Kingdom) as a subcutaneous injection (abbreviated as VR + GnRHa). In the group of VR + GnRHa, 2 doses of GnRHa were administered. The first dose was injected at the time of hysteroscopy examination, and the second dose was administered one day after the VR surgical procedure. The detailed procedure of VR has been described in our previous study (Zhou et al., 2016).</description>

    <description>The procedure of vaginal repair of CSD was shown as following. The bladder was dissected away carefully from the uterus toward the abdominal cavity until the peritoneum was reached. The CSD tissue was cut to the normal healthy muscle after the abdominal cavity had been entered, and the lower uterine segments had been completely exposed. A double layer of 1-0 absorbable interrupted sutures was used to close the incisions.</description>
