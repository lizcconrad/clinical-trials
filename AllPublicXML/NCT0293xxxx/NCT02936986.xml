    <textblock>
      The differential diagnosis of gastric subepithelial tumors by endoscopic ultrasound is
      currently suboptimal. Needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) is a novel endoscopic
      technique, which is compatible with the 19-gauge FNA needle. Under endoscopic ultrasonography
      (EUS) guidance, nCLE enables real-time in vivo imaging of lesion tissues at cellular and
      subcellular levels. This study aimed to describe nCLE interpretation criteria for the
      characterization of gastric subepithelial tumors, with histopathological correlation, and to
      perform the validation of these criteria.
