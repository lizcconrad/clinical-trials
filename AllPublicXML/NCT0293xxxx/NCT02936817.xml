      Primary:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Aerobika® device on the
      aerosol deposition pattern of concomitant inhalation medication using FRI.

      Secondary:

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Aerobika® device on
      the airway volume (iVaw), lung and lobe volume (iVlobes), airway resistance (iRaw),
      hyperinflation, airway wall thickness (iVaww), blood vessel density (iVbv), and air trapping
      using FRI.

             the GOLD guidelines,

          4. Subject with a cooperative attitude and ability to be trained to correctly use the
             Aerobika® device.

          6. Subject must be sputum producing and treated in accordance with the GOLD guidelines.
             Sputum producing subjects are defined as patients who report productive cough with
             sputum &quot;several days a week&quot; (&gt;2 days a week) or &quot;almost every day&quot; in the month prior
             to the study.

         16. Subject with an uncontrolled disease or any condition that might, in the judgement of
             the investigator, place the patient at undue risk or potentially compromise the
             results or interpretation of the study.

         17. Subject with active cancer or any other chronic disease with poor prognosis and /or
             affecting patient status

         18. Subject unlikely to comply with the protocol or unable to understand the nature,
             scope, and possible consequences of the study.

         19. Subject who received any investigational new drug within 4 weeks of Visit 1 or twice
             the duration of the biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer).

         20. Subject with a history of alcohol or substance abuse that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may be of clinical significance.

         21. Subject who has undergone major surgery within 12 weeks of Visit 1 or has planned to
             undergo a major surgery before the end of the study.

         22. Subject with diagnosis of asthma.

         23. Inability to correctly use the sham device.
