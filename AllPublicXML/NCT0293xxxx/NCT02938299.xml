      Phase III, open-label, randomized, controlled multi-center study. In the study, 214 patients
      will be enrolled and parallel assigned (via randomization system) in a 1:1 fashion to one of
      two different arms:

      ARM 1:

      Patients in Arm 1 will receive multiple intratumoral administrations into all injectable
      cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumors of a mixture of L19IL2 and L19TNF once weekly for
      up to 4 weeks (or until all injectable tumors have disappeared, or intolerance to study
      treatment or in the opinion of the investigator immediate surgical resection or any other
      treatment for melanoma is warranted, whichever occurs first). The whole volume of
      L19IL2/L19TNF will be equally distributed among all injectable lesions.

      Newly occurring injectable melanoma lesions within the 4 weeks treatment period will also be
      treated as described. For the new lesions the treatment period will not be extended beyond
      the pre-defined 4 week- treatment period with a clock start at the time of the first
      intralesional L19IL2/L19TNF injection. Surgical resection of all existing metastases will
      follow within 4 weeks after end of treatment. Surgery will be performed after the safety
      evaluation carried out at week 5 and, if indicated, may be carried out on the same day of the
      safety evaluation.

      ARM 2:

      Patients in Arm 2 will receive directly surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesions within 4
      weeks after randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of malignant melanoma of the skin in clinical stage III B and III C,
             eligible for complete surgical resection.

          2. Eligible subjects must have measurable disease and must be candidate for intralesional
             therapy with at least one injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal melanoma lesion
             (≥ 10 mm in longest diameter) or with multiple injectable lesions that in aggregate
             have a longest diameter of ≥ 10 mm.

          3. Males or females, age ≥ 18 years

          4. ECOG Performance Status/WHO Performance Status ≤ 1

          5. Life expectancy of at least 24 months (see paragraph 6.3.1)

         13. Documented negative test for HIV, HBV and HCV. For HBV serology, the determination of
             HBsAg, anti-HBsAg Ab and anti-HBcAg Ab is required. In patients with serology
             documenting previous exposure to HBV (e.g. anti-HBs Ab with no history of vaccination
             and/or anti-HBc Ab) negative serum HBV-DNA is also required.

         14. All acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior therapy must have resolved
             to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (CTCAE) (v4.03) Grade ≤ 1 unless otherwise specified above

         15. All female subjects must have negative pregnancy test results at the screening. Women
             of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using, from the screening to three months
             following the last study drug administration, highly effective contraception methods,
             as defined by the &quot;Recommendations for contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical
             trials&quot; issued by the Head of Medicine Agencies' Clinical Trial Facilitation Group and
             which include, for instance, progesterone-only or combined (estrogen- and
             progesterone-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation, intrauterine devices, intrauterine hormone-releasing systems, bilateral
             tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence. Pregnancy test will be
             repeated at the end of treatment visit.

         16. Male patients with WOCBP partners must agree to use simultaneously two acceptable
             methods of contraception (i.e. spermicidal gel plus condom) from the screening to
             three months following the last study drug administration.

         17. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

         18. Willingness and ability to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests and other study procedures.

             cell carcinoma, superficial bladder tumors (Ta, Tis &amp; T1), second primary melanoma in
             situ or any cancer curatively treated ≥ 5 years prior to study entry

          4. Presence of active infections (e.g. requiring antimicrobial therapy) or other severe
             concurrent disease, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the patient
             at undue risk or interfere with the study.

          5. History within the last year of acute or subacute coronary syndromes including
             myocardial infarction, unstable or severe stable angina pectoris.

          6. Inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation

          7. Heart insufficiency (&gt; Grade II, New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria)

          8. LVEF ≤ 50% and/or abnormalities observed during baseline ECG and Echocardiogram
             investigations that are considered as clinically significant by the investigator.

         10. Ischemic peripheral vascular disease (Grade IIb-IV)

         11. Severe diabetic retinopathy

         17. Anti-tumor therapy (except small surgery) within 4 weeks before enrollment

         18. Previous in vivo exposure to monoclonal antibodies for biological therapy in the 6
             weeks before enrollment

         19. Planned administration of growth factors or immunomodulatory agents within 7 days
             before enrollment

         20. Patient requires or is taking corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant drugs on a
             long-term basis. Limited use of corticosteroids to treat or prevent acute
             hypersensitivity reactions is not considered an exclusion criterion.

         21. Any conditions that in the opinion of the investigator could hamper compliance with
             the study protocol.
