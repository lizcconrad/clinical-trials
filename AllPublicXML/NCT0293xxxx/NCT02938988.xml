  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy
      as an adjuvant of scaling and root planning for treatment of periodontal disease in patients
      with Down's Syndrome. After scaling and root planning, half of patients received
      antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with methylene blue dye and laser and the sessions were
      repeated after 3, 7 and 14 days. The other half received only scaling and root planning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been widely used in Periodontics to obtain
      reduction of periodontopathogenic bacteria with absence of systemic side effects and minimal
      bacterial resistance. Therefore, a good adjuvant alternative for periodontal disease
      treatment arises, especially for patients with Down syndrome (DS) who present greater
      severity and high prevalence of periodontal disease. Usually aPDT is used as an adjunct
      therapy to scaling and root planning.

    <measure>Periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) measured by a periodontal probe and classified according to severity</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Severe periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 6mm and ≥1 interproximal site with periodontal probing depth (PPD) ≥5mm. Moderate periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with CAL ≥ 4mm or ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with PPD ≥5mm. Mild periodontitis was defined as ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 3 mm CAL and ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 4 mm PPD or at least 1 site with PPD ≥ 5 mm (20,21). Gingivitis was determined as follows: Subjects were considered healthy if presented PPD ≤3mm/ Bleeding on probing (BOP) extent scores &lt; 10% and with gingivitis if presented PPD ≤3mm/ BOP extent scores &gt;10%. Prevalence of periodontal disease was the sum of gingivitis, mild, moderate and severe periodontitis.</description>
