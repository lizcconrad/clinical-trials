  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early childhood caries (ECC) is a global health problem that causes pain and infection to the
      children affected. It is a common disease among preschool children in Hong Kong. There is a
      great need to improve at-home ECC preventive measures through oral health promotional
      activities as early as possible to parents.

      The investigators will propose a 4-year randomized controlled trial of family-centered oral
      health promotion for new parents which aims to increase the proportion of parents brushing
      their infants' teeth at 1 year, establishing proper feeding and dietary habits, reducing the
      transfer of MS from the parents to their infants and then reducing the risk of ECC of the
      children at 3 years. The investigators also aim to improve the oral hygiene status of the new
      parents and prevention of oral diseases among themselves.

      First-time expectant mothers and their husbands will be recruited. The recruited families
      will be randomly allocated to the test and control groups. In the test group, personal
      hygiene instruction (OHI) for the expectant mothers and their husbands together with oral
      health education materials on infant's tooth development and eruption, establishment of
      proper feeding, dietary and toothbrushing habits will be given before the delivery of the new
      born babies. Reinforcement of OHI and demonstrations on how to clean the infant's oral
      cavities and perform toothbrushing will be delivered after the babies are born. Comprehensive
      data will be collected from the mothers, fathers and the infants in both the test and control
      groups at different time points through dental examination, biological testing and
      questionnaire survey. The CONSORT statement will be strictly followed when conducting the
      clinical trial, analyzing the data and reporting the results.

      It is anticipated that the effectiveness of oral health promotion starting at the pregnancy
      period and for both expecting mothers and their husbands will be greater in preventing the
      infants from developing ECC. Furthermore, establishing good oral health care habits will have
      long term benefits, helping safeguard the oral health of the children as they grow and the
      family as a whole. This study will also provide much needed evidence for the further
      development of oral health policies and oral health promotion programmes in Hong Kong;
      specifically how these can be integrated into family health education so as to achieve a
      higher effectiveness. This will contribute significantly to the improvement of oral health in
      the population of Hong Kong.
