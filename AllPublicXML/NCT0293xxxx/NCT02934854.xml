      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of creatine
      deficiency syndromes from plasma

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The creatine deficiency syndromes (CDS) are a group of inborn errors of metabolism which
      interrupt the biosynthesis or transportation of creatine. Individuals with creatine
      deficiency syndromes classically present with intellectual disabilities and seizure disorders
      and may present with pyramidal/extrapyramidal neurologic findings and behavioral problems as
      well.

      There are three Cerebral Creatine Deficiency Syndromes:

        -  Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD) - gene SLC6A8

        -  Guanidinoacetate Methyltransferase Deficiency (GAMT) - gene GAMT

        -  Arginine: Glycine Amidinotransferase Deficiency (AGAT) - gene GATM

      X-linked Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD, SLC6A8 Deficiency, CRTR):

      X-linked creatine transporter deficiency (CRTR-D) is a creatine deficiency syndrome (see this
      term) characterized clinically by global developmental delay / intellectual disability
      (DD/ID) with prominent speech/language delay, autistic behavior and seizures.

      CRTR-D has been reported in more than 150 individuals worldwide. The onset of symptoms occurs
      during infancy, usually before the age of 2 years. Males are mainly affected, but females can
      also have various combinations and severities of disease manifestations. CRTR-D is
      consistently characterized by mild to severe intellectual deficit, and expressive speech and
      language delay. Behavioral disorders (mainly autism and hyperactivity) are present in all
      affected individuals. Affected individuals often experience seizures and may present low
      weight gain, muscular hypotonia, and poor muscle mass. Subtle dysmorphic features such as
      midface hypoplasia, long face, and prominent chin have been reported in various affected male
      patients. Epilepsy and extrapyramidal symptoms may also occur occasionally. In adult
      patients, cardiac and gastrointestinal disorders have been reported. Carrier females are
      typically asymptomatic, but learning disabilities have been described in some. CRTR-D is not
      a life threatening disease, however live expectancy is limited, particularly in those who
      have severe seizures and associated physical disabilities.

      Guanidinoacetate Methyltransferase Deficiency (GAMT)

      Mutations in the GAMT gene are a relatively rare cause of creatine deficiency syndrome.
      Affected individuals may demonstrate cerebral creatine deficiency on MR spectroscopy and high
      GAA in urine. Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal
      recessive manner and is caused by biallelic mutations in the GAMT gene. This gene maps to
      19p13.3 and is involved in the biosynthesis of creatine. Individuals with GAMT deficiency
      typically present with severe intellectual disabilities and seizure disorders which may be
      resistant to drug therapy. Behavioral problems, including autistic behaviors and
      self-mutilation are common, and pyramidal/extrapyramidal symptoms affect about one-half of
      patients with GAMT deficiency. Dietary management of GAMT deficiency via manipulation of
      critical amino acids may improve clinical outcome.

      Arginine: Glycine Amidinotransferase (AGAT):

      L-Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency is a very rare type of creatine
      deficiency syndrome characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and
      myopathy. AGAT deficiency is characterized by global developmental delay, appearing in
      infancy, which can be associated with language impairment and autistic behavior in some, as
      well as a mild to moderate intellectual disability. Progressive muscle weakness and
      fatigability have been reported in older patients. Seizures and failure to thrive have also
      been described. If creatine supplementation is administered early enough, psychomotor delay
      may be avoided. AGAT deficiency is caused by mutations in the L-arginine:glycine
      amidinotransferase gene (GATM) located to chromosome 15q15.1. This gene encodes AGAT, which
      converts arginine and glycine to ornithine and guanidino-acetate in the creatine cycle
      pathway. AGAT deficiency is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and genetic
      counseling is possible.

      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.

      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry 7, 5 ml
      EDTA blood and a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis of
      creatine deficiency syndromes in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no
      genetic testing has been done, sequencing of creatine deficiency syndromes will be done.

      The analyses are done in the Centogene AG Schillingallee 68 D-18057 Rostock Germany
