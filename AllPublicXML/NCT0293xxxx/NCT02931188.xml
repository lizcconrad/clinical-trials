  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no studies evaluating the effect of anacetrapib on blood vessel function
      and stiffness of the arteries. The REVEAL-Vasc trial will assess whether anacetrapib, in
      addition to atorvastatin (LDL-C lowering drug) treatment, results in greater
      endothelial-dependent vascular function and aortic stiffness in patients with established
      cardiovascular disease, compared to adding placebo.

      Participants will be asked to provide a blood sample and pulse Wave Velocity/Pulse Wave
      Analysis and Flow Mediated Dilation will be carried out to assess blood vessel function and
      stiffness of the arteries. REVEAL-Vasc is an investigator led sub-study of HPS3/TIMI 55:
      REVEAL (Randomized Evaluation of the Effects of Anacetrapib through Lipid modification): A
      large-scale, randomized placebo-controlled trial of the clinical effects of anacetrapib among
      people with established vascular disease (NCT01252953) which is coordinated by OXFORD CTSU.

      No treatment will be received on this sub-study, therefore only participants who have been
      enrolled in HPS3/TIMI55 REVEAL in which participants received anacetrapib with atorvastatin
      or placebo will be considered for this trial.

      REVEAL-Vasc is an investigator led sub-study of HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL. Participants who
      previously enrolled on HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL and received treatment will be invited to
      participate in this sub-study. Participants will attend a screening and an assessment visit
      during which Pulse Wave Velocity/ Pulse Wave Analysis and Flow Mediated Dilation will be
      carried out to assess blood vessel function and stiffness. A blood sample will also be taken
      from participant to assess CRP and lipid profile. Since participants will have received
      treatment on the main trial HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL, no treatment will be received on this
      sub-study.
