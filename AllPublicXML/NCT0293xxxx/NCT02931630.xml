  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and lifestyle related diseases such as cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing world wide. The metabolic syndrome (MeS) is a
      condition characterized by abdominal obesity, high blood lipids, high blood pressure and
      elevated blood sugar. MeS is associated with an increased risk of developing CVD and T2D.
      Dietary fibers and whey protein have independently shown beneficial effects on several of
      these risk factors in previous studies. Whey protein is furthermore seen to show positive
      effects on bone turnover.

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether an increased intake of dietary fibers and
      whey protein (separately or combined) over a period of 12 weeks will affect the risk markers
      of MeS and bone turnover in abdominally obese subjects.

      A total of 80 people with abdominal obesity will be included. The design is a randomized,
      double blinded, controlled dietary intervention trial. Subjects are assigned to one of four
      experimental groups. Each group are provided with test products containing either high or low
      whey protein and high or low dietary fibers to replace part of their regular diet. The
      subjects are instructed in how to incorporate the test products in their habitual diets in
      order to maintain weight stability.

      The primary outcome is postprandial lipaemia (PPL) - an independent risk factor of developing
      CVD. PPL is estimated by performing a standardized high fat meal test during which
      postprandial level of triglycerides is measured. The authors hypothesize that a diet of high
      content of whey protein and high dietary fiber during 12 weeks will induce a reduction in
      PPL.
