  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of JNJ-56136379 in healthy Japanese adult participants following oral administration of
      single doses from 25 milligram (mg) up to 600 mg, in fasted conditions.

    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve from time 0 to the Time of the Last Measurable non-Below Quantification Limit Concentration (AUC [0-last])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 29 days</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-last) is defined as area under the analyte concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable (non-below quantification limit [BQL]) concentration, calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC [0-infinity])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 29 days</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last observed measurable (non-BQL) concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant; extrapolations of more than 20.00 percent (%) of the total AUC are reported as approximations.</description>

             than 10 years and whose parents and grandparents are Japanese as determined by
             participant's verbal report

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the
             absence of any clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination,
             medical and surgical history, vital signs, and the results of blood biochemistry,
             blood coagulation, and hematology tests and a urinalysis performed at screening. If
             there are abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the investigator
             judges the abnormalities to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and
             reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be recorded in the
             participant's source documents and initialed/signed by the investigator

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kilogram [kg] divided by the

             extremes inclusive, and body weight not less than 45.0 kg

          -  Participant must have a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (based on the mean
             value of the triplicate parameters) at screening including: normal sinus rhythm (heart
             rate between 45 and 100 beats per minute [bpm], extremes included); QT interval
             corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia (QTcF) less than or equal to (&lt;=)450
             millisecond (ms); QRS interval less than (&lt;)120 ms; PR interval &lt;=220 ms

          -  A female participant (except if permanently sterile), should have a negative serum
             pregnancy test at screening and all female participants should have a negative urine
             pregnancy test on Day -1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant with a past history of cardiac arrhythmias (example [eg], extrasystoli,
             tachycardia at rest), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (eg,
             hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome)

          -  Female participant who is breastfeeding at screening or pregnant at screening or
             predose

          -  Male participant planning to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 90
             days after study drug administration

          -  Participant with current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2
             infection (confirmed by antibodies) at Screening

          -  Participant with current hepatitis A infection (confirmed by hepatitis A antibody
             immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (confirmed by HBsAg), or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (confirmed by HCV antibody), or hepatitis E
             infection (confirmed by hepatitis E antibody IgM) at Screening
