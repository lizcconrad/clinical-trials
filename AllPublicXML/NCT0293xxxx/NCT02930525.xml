  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procedural sedation is an established and safe intervention and is widely used in diagnostic
      and therapeutic procedures for pediatric patients. Nonetheless, problems of the respiratory
      system such as upper airway obstruction, hypoventilation and apnea are frequent adverse
      events. We postulate that respiratory instability is less frequent in patients high flow
      nasal cannula vs. standard care on respiratory stability, i.e. low flow nasal cannula, in
      pediatric procedural sedation. The purpose of this pilot study is to estimate the effect of
      HFNC (high flow nasal cannula) on the respiratory instability in children undergoing upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy under pediatric procedural sedation (PPS).
