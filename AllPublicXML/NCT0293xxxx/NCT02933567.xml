  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to the growing need for training on interventions to address first episode
      psychosis, the Center for Social Innovation (C4) has partnered with experts in Coordinated
      Specialty Care (CSC) to develop and test CSC OnDemand: An Innovative Online Learning Platform
      for Implementing Coordinated Specialty Care. The product builds on the findings of the
      Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) studies, funded by the National
      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RAISE examined team-based models of care for people early
      in the course of schizophrenia. Through a Fast Track Small Business Innovation Research
      (SBIR) grant, investigators will prototype, test, refine, and evaluate the impact of CSC
      OnDemand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Building on existing resources and the expertise of our faculty and advisors, we will develop
      CSC OnDemand, a multifaceted online learning product that includes four levels: 1) an online
      readiness tool and CSC Learning Hub; 2) dynamic multimedia core curriculum on first episode
      psychosis and CSC; 3) live faculty-led online courses; and 4) ongoing support, including an
      online community of practice to support peer-to-peer learning.

      During Phases I and II of this Fast Track SBIR, we will prototype, pilot test, build out, and
      evaluate the product through a cluster randomized non-inferiority study comparing it with
      InPerson training.

      Phase I will build a robust prototype of the online platform and test it with 15-20 providers
      from three sites. This Phase will explore feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      effectiveness of the product, and will examine which components of the online platform
      providers find most useful.

      Based on our findings from Phase I, we will refine and fully build out the product to test in
      a larger randomized trial. Phase II will use a cluster randomized non-inferiority design to
      assess if OnDemand training (n = 20 sites) is comparable to InPerson training (n = 10 sites).
      Using a mixed-methods approach, we will examine provider (n = 150) outcomes (satisfaction;
      knowledge gains/retention; attitudes toward shared decision making) and client (n = 600)
      outcomes (work/school participation; engagement in CSC services; inpatient psychiatric
      hospitalizations).

      The study is guided by the following specific aims:

      Phase I AIM 1: To develop a prototype version of CSC OnDemand. AIM 2: To test the prototype
      online platform with a small sample of sites/providers to determine feasibility,
      acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the product.

      Hypothesis: CSC OnDemand will show positive learning and satisfaction outcomes among
      providers, and findings will suggest the need for and feasibility of conducting a Phase II
      effectiveness trial.

      Phase II AIM 1: To refine, expand, and finalize CSC OnDemand based on Phase I findings. AIM
      2: To determine if the OnDemand training intervention is as successful as the InPerson
      intervention in increasing CSC providers knowledge and shared decision making (SDM).
      Hypothesis: Providers in the OnDemand condition will achieve increases in knowledge, SDM and
      satisfaction at post training and nine months that will be no more than .5 standard
      deviations less than the InPerson condition.

      AIM 3: To determine if the OnDemand training intervention is as successful as the InPerson
      training in increasing participation in work or school, improving engagement in treatment,
      and decreasing relapse rates for participating clients.

      Hypothesis: Clients being served by the providers in the OnDemand condition will have
      work/school participation rates, levels of engagement and rates of hospitalization nine
      months after admission that are no more than 10 percent higher (hospitalization) or lower
      (work/school, engagement) than clients served by providers in the InPerson condition.
