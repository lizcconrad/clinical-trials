  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia after cardiac surgery is a vast phenomena. More than 70% of the patients who under
      went surgery represented with hemoglobin less than 8 mg/dl (the cutoff for blood transfusion)
      and more than 80% of the patients receives at least one unit of red blood cell transfusion.

      There were number of attempts to prevent the postoperative anemia by giving erythropoietin,
      Iron per os and intra venus iron. non of the above have shown increase in Hemoglobin after
      the cardiac surgery.

      Research Objectives

      The study objectives are:

        1. Determine hemoglobin values in non-anemic patients given ferric Carboxymaltose prior to
           and post heart surgery.

        2. Determine the effect of ferric Carboxymaltose in non-anemic patients prior to surgery on
           the number of blood units administer postoperation.

      Research Methods Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled research. All
      patients who are in the cardiac surgery department for bypass surgery, valve replacement
      surgery or combined surgery will be eligible to participate in the study. The study will be
      presented and explained to all patients and, if they consent, patients will be divided into
      two random groups. One group will receive Ferinject IV 24-48 hours prior to surgery. The
      second group will receive a placebo drug in the same time period as when the drug Ferinject
      is administered.

      The Population Studied All patients aged 18 or older hospitalized at the Rambam Medical
      Center and are candidates for open-heart surgery (coronary artery bypass, valve, combined).
