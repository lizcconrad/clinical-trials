  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether combining cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with
      task-oriented balance training (TOBT) is more effective than general health education (GHE)
      together with TOBT in promoting fear of falling and reducing activity avoidance behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The null hypothesis of this study will be that no significant difference in the efficacy of
      the two treatments (CBT + TOBT; GHE + TOBT) in promoting fear of falling and reducing fear
      avoidance behavior, and thus no significant difference in improving balance ability, reducing
      fall risks, improving health-related quality of life and community reintegration of people
      with stroke.

    <description>The ABC-C be used to assess the level of fear of falling. The ABC-C consisted of 16 items reflecting the level of balance confidence from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (complete confidence)</description>

    <measure>The Chinese version of the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The IADL-C will be used to assess the ability of participants to live independently at home and community. The IADL-C included 9 items rating on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 to 18. Higher score indicates better performance.</description>

    <measure>The Chinese version of the Community Integration Measure (CIM-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The CIM-C consisted of 10 items soliciting on a 5-point scale in which the higher the score indicating the higher level of community integration.</description>

    <measure>The Chinese version of the Short Form General Health Questionnaire (SF-36-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36-C will be used to measure the health-related quality of life. It consisted of 2 scales, the physical health summary and mental health summary, rating on a two- to six-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 100 each subscale. The higher the score indicating the higher level of health-related quality of life.</description>

    <measure>The Chinese version of the Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFFE-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SAFFE-C will be used to assessed the level of fear avoidance behavior. It consisted of 22 items rating on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 66. Lower score indicates less fear avoidance behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS to assess the clinical balance. It consisted of 14 items with scoring from 0 to 56. The higher the score indicates the better balance performance.</description>

    <measure>The Short-form Physiological Profile Assessment (S-PPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The S-PPA will be used to assess the fall risk ranging from -2 to 4. The higher the score represents the lower the fall risk.</description>
