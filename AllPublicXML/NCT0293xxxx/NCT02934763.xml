  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) is an entity than has been demonstrated in healthy
      volunteers and in animal models. Is defined as an increase in the perception to painful
      stimuli, increasing the opioid requirements and diminishing the pain thresholds to stimuli.

      The apparition of OIH is also related to the exposure to opioids during surgery, depending of
      the dose, the time of exposition and the type of opioid.

      This condition can be modulated, specially in the perioperative context. It has been seen in
      healthy volunteers and in animal models, than the use of propranolol can modulate this
      phenomena, diminishing the postoperative requirements of analgesia. It is also unknown, the
      dose of propranolol required to modulate adequately OIH.

      The objective of this work is to evaluate the efficacy of propranolol in the modulation of
      opioid induced hyperalgesia, with lower postoperative requirements of analgesia rescue.

      This is a randomized controlled study, comparing 2 interventions with a placebo. The
      interventions will be use of propranolol, at different doses, to achieve specific plasmatic
      concentrations.

      80 patients will be required to find a difference of 20% in the primary outcome.

      The primary outcome to be measured is the postoperative use of opioids in the post anesthesic
      care unit.

      Secondary outcomes, will be the amount of opioids used in the following 24 hours to the
      surgery, the time to the first dose of analgesia in the post anesthesic care unit, and the
      change in the pain thresholds, evaluated as pain by pressure and by tactile sensitivity,
      before and after surgery.

      Also, as a secondary outcome, in a group than will not receive the study drug, we will
      evaluate the temporal changes in opioid induced hyperalgesia, by pain sensitivity measured in
      the postoperative hours 2, 4 and 24. 10 patients receiving placebo will be part of this
      additional measures.
