  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what the differences are in sweat (amount and small
      molecule content) collected from different sites of the body and by different methods of
      sweat stimulation. Additionally, the investigators want to know whether the amount and small
      molecule content of the sweat is the same in an individual over time, and the same across
      individuals at a given time. Finally, the investigators want to know how consumption of
      over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen will affect the inflammatory
      mediator content of sweat and how that compares to blood. This information will help to
      better understand the composition and behavior of sweat and assess its potential utility as a
      routine clinical tool in skin research.

      Subjects will participate in 4 study day visits that will be scheduled about 1- week apart.
      During the first study visit, the investigators will compare sweat collected following
      pharmacological stimulation of sweating (using the drug pilocarpine) to sweat collected
      following physiological stimulation of sweating (using a stationary bicycle). During the
      second study visit, the investigators will collect sweat following stimulation of sweating by
      the drug pilocarpine from the inner part of the forearm (near the wrist) and also the upper
      surface of the thigh (near the knee). During the third study visit, the investigators will
      collect sweat following stimulation of sweating by the drug pilocarpine from the inner part
      of both forearms (near the wrist). During the fourth study visit, the investigators will
      collect a sweat sample following stimulation of sweating by the drug pilocarpine from the
      inner part of the forearm (near the wrist) and a blood sample (about one teaspoon) from the
      other arm. After blood and sweat collection, participants will consume 400 mg (two tablets)
      of ibuprofen. The investigators will then collect blood and sweat from 30 minutes, 2 hours
      and 4 hours after participants consume the ibuprofen.
