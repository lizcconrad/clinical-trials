  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is only one kind of treatment (simeprevir 150 mg + sofosbuvir 400 mg+daclatasvir 60 mg)
      in this study but the treatment duration may be different depending on patients' response to
      the antiviral therapy and whether patients have liver cirrhosis. If patients have no
      cirrhosis and the HCV viral load on day 2 is &lt;500 IU/ml, patients will receive sofosbuvir,
      daclatasvir and simeprevir for 3 weeks, otherwise the treatment duration is 4 weeks. If
      patients have cirrhosis and the HCV viral load on day 2 is &lt;500 IU/ml, patients will receive
      sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and simeprevir for 6 weeks, otherwise the treatment duration will be
      8 weeks.

    The collaborating pharmaceutical company will not wish to continue with the trial due to the
    internal issues in the company.

    <description>Viral breakthrough is defined as having achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ) during treatment, but did not achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). Viral relapse is defined as having achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ) within 4 weeks of end of treatment, but did not achieve an SVR up to 24 weeks.</description>
