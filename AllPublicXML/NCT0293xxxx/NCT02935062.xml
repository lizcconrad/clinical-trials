  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare phonological and auditory aspects of children submitted
      to traditional phonological therapy, phonological therapy using a software and placebo
      therapy in children with phonological disorders.

    <textblock>
      The study will provide different therapeutic approaches for cases of phonological disorders,
      the classical approach would be mediated by Cycles Model, innovated approach is performed by
      means of an intervention speech software-SIFALA, there will still be the group that does not
      receive any of the proposals therapies that will be the placebo group.The study will provide
      25 sessions for each group, with 30 minutes in each group. At the end of these sessions, the
      placebo group will receive one of the therapeutic approaches. With these three study groups,
      the investigators understand in what manner to obtain correct sounds is more effective.

    <description>This intervention will be intermediated by the traditional model cycles. This approach has the principle of treating the suppression of operant phonological processes in child's speech, from the awareness of sound-target characteristics operating in that phonological process.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Software Phonological Therapy- SIFALA</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This intervention will be intermediated by the software SIFALA. The software SIFALA, allows to select target segments using the Modelo de Estratos (second model Strata), based on the level segment of production and complexity of distinctive features, from the child's sound system analysis and planned generalizations. It also seeks the treatment of phonological disorders, by selection stimulus words in more favorable environments and playful activities with computer resource for the correct production of the target segment in the words stimulus, promoting the spread segments.</description>
