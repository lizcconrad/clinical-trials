    <description>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a hematopoietic CSFs that decrease the duration and severity of neutropenia for patients receiving chemotherapy.

    <description>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are hematopoietic CSFs that decrease the duration and severity of neutropenia for patients receiving chemotherapy. GM-CSF and G-CSF share a number of biologic activities, GM-CSF seems to be more potent against fungi.</description>
