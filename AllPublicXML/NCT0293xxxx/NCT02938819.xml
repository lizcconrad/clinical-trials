    <textblock>
      Upper-limb disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease include decreased speed and
      amplitude of movements, difficulty in sequential tasks, and disrupted execution of fine
      manipulative hand activities.The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of home-based
      goal-oriented upper limb intervention in patients with Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative neurological disorders involving progressive
      impairment in motor, mood and cognitive functions. Movement disorders have a negative impact
      on individual's ability to perform well-learned motor skills. These include akinesia,
      bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor at rest.

      A goal-planning process should be useful to ensure that patients agree on the goals of
      rehabilitation. Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of home-based
      goal-oriented upper limb intervention in patients with Parkinson's disease.

    <description>The Goal-oriented upper-limb intervention evaluated patients' expectations and the environmental factors influencing the performance of the specific task were identified for each of the three tasks. Patients were asked to perform the activity at home. After this, the observable target behavior corresponding to the target activity was determined. Then, an occupational and a physical therapist worked together with the patient to identify the assistance required to perform this activity such as human assistance, technical aids, assistive devices or verbal guidance.</description>
