      This three arm study is intended to add to scientific knowledge by providing accurate
      assessments of the glycemic index commonly consumed food items. This will be used in the
      scientific literature to assess the glycemic index of foods containing various sweeteners.
      Participants will be monitored for a total of 10 weeks.

      The glycemic index is defined as the &quot;incremental area under the glucose response curve after
      standard amount of carbohydrate relative to that of a control food (white bread or glucose)
      is consumed.&quot; In general, the glycemic index quantifies the relative effect of the
      carbohydrate content of the food on resultant blood glucose.

    <description>The mean glycemic index of participants will be calculated by averaging the 3 calculated glycemic index values for each of the 3 types of sweetener. Each participant will be randomly given 1 of 3 the commonly consumed sweeteners three different times over a nine week period- for a total of 3 observations per arm.
Glycemic index is measured by giving test subjects the commonly consumed sweetener, and then measuring blood glucose response over a two hour time period using an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. That response is then compared against a reference (glucose) and averaged across all subjects to get a relative index value.
The glycemic index (GI) is a ranking of carbohydrates on a scale from 0 to 100 according to the extent to which they raise blood sugar levels after eating. (http://www.glycemicindex.com/about.php)</description>

    <description>For each OGTT, subjects will consume 50g of sweetener dissolved in water at a comfortable pace within 10 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose and insulin will be taken at -20, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after consuming the glucose drink. Plasma fructose will be tested at baseline, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.</description>
