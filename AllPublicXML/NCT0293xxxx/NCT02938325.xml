  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia (GA) is the process of induction of unconsciousness in order to undergo
      surgery. Unlike sleep, a process of &quot;anesthesia&quot; is not related at all, 'Sleep' and does not
      include dreams - but is done by using drugs that cause a kind of &quot;unconsciousness&quot; control.

      The induction of GA includes combination of drugs - for sleep (inhalation anesthesia or
      hypnotic drugs intravenously), analgesia (opiates) and muscle relaxants. Since most of our
      patients paralyzed during surgery, the anesthesiologists have no way of knowing whether our
      paralyzed patient is asleep or awake. If the patient is awake and paralyzed, a situation
      named &quot;awareness under anesthesia&quot; it can cause him a traumatic experience that would leave
      him a cripple for his whole life.

      There are many stories about patients who lay paralyzed, awake, while been operated, who
      remembered every word of what happened during the operation and of course could not mark the
      anesthetist that they are awake. The anesthesiologist might suspect that his patient is awake
      and paralyzed through &quot;signals&quot; from the sympathetic nervous system - for example the
      increase in heart rate and blood pressure. But many of our patients receive different
      medications (eg, beta-receptor blockers that does not allow the rise of a pulse) obscuring
      the clinical signs, so that the patient is awake and paralyzed without being noticed by the
      anesthesiologist.

      Some patients are at a higher risk to suffer from awareness under anesthesia, because the
      anesthesiologist cannot provide &quot;enough&quot; anesthesia, due to their medical condition, for
      example: women in caesarean section under GA, patients in cardiac surgery or injured trauma
      patients.

      Twenty years ago, an EEG based tool, naming &quot;BIS&quot; was developed. Nowadays, BIS monitor's
      credibility is questionable 1. The effect of different hypnotic drugs is not uniform. 2.
      Recently it was shown that a paralyzed patient BIS index could fall mimicking a situation of
      a sleep - enabling a paralyzed patient being awake. Thus, it is not clear whether the
      calculation of the BIS monitor is based on physiological models that define what is
      consciousness, loss of consciousness and how consciousness arises. It seems that the BIS is
      only suitable for certain drugs - not as a general monitor for the level of anesthesia.

      The purpose of the present study is to develop a universal system for determining awareness
      under GA using an innovative algorithm for analyzing EEG waves, based on the physiological
      processes of attention and perception underlying the basis for sedation and GA.

    <description>Thirty patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia who will be monitored with standard ASA, BIS and EEG for comparisons. In recovery unit, at the end of the surgery, patients will be questioned for awareness under anesthesia by Modified Brice Questionnaire.
There will be no intervention. Patients will be anesthetized with general anesthesia as they were supposed to be for their elective surgery. The EEG during the anesthesia will be assessed afterwards, and patients will be asked about their memory from the surgery.</description>
