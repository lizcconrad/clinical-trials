  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled trial including patients who are diagnosed with a small
      renal mass (&lt;4 cm) amenable to resection using either RALPN or LPN.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small renal masses (SRM) &lt;4cm are increasingly being discovered incidentally on imaging. The
      standard of care for management of SRMs is partial nephrectomy whenever feasible. In the last
      10 years, a minimally invasive laproscopic approach has largely supplanted open surgery for
      the treatment of SRMs. Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RALPN) has emerged as
      an alternative to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) and has been able to bridge the
      technical difficulties of LPN. The big question about the role and cost of RALPN in
      comparison to LPN especially in Canadian healthcare for SRMs still remains unanswered.

      The objective of this proposed study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine
      whether RALPN is better than LPN for the management of patients with SRMs. The primary
      outcomes will be warm ischemia time and secondary outcomes will be estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR), estimated blood loss, complication rate, length of hospital stay,
      positive surgical margin rate and cost comparison of these two techniques.
