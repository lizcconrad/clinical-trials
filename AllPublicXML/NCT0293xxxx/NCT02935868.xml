    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus is a risk factor for periodontal disease increasing its prevalence,
      extension and severity. Periodontal disease is considered the sixth complication of diabetes.
      There is a global epidemic of diabetes, including an increase of incidence of type 1 diabetes
      in younger patients. Thus, the aim of this observational study was to evaluate the
      periodontal and salivary condition of a sample of patients with type 1 diabetes of a
      brazillian city.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) measured by a periodontal probe and classified according to severity</measure>
    <time_frame>one day</time_frame>
    <description>Severe periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with CAL (clinical attachment level) ≥ 6mm and ≥1 interproximal site with PPD (periodontal probing depth) ≥5mm. Moderate periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with CAL ≥ 4mm or ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with PPD ≥5mm. Mild periodontitis was defined as ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 3 mm CAL and ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 4 mm PPD or at least 1 site with PPD ≥ 5 mm (20,21). Gingivitis was determined as follows: Subjects were considered healthy if presented PPD ≤3mm/BOP (bleeding on probing) extent scores &lt; 10% and with gingivitis if presented PPD ≤3mm/ BOP extent scores &gt;10%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary pH and buffering Capacity - collection of stimulated saliva in 10 minutes and measurement of acidity with a pHmeter</measure>
    <time_frame>one day</time_frame>
    <description>Normal Salivary pH = 6 to 7. Buffering capacity: ≥ 5.6 were considered as ''high'', ranging from 4.1 to 5.5 were labelled as ''medium'' and those ≤4 were defined as ''low''</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary glucose - collection of stimulated saliva in 10 minutes and measurement with a colorimetric kit</measure>
    <time_frame>one day</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary glucose is measured by a colorimetric kit and the values are converted and presented as mg/dL. There are no reference value for this measurement. The analysis is done by means of correlation to blood glucose levels in mg/dL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary peroxidase - collection of stimulated saliva in 10 minutes, measurement by a spectrophotometer.</measure>
    <time_frame>one day</time_frame>
    <description>The activity of salivary peroxidase is presented in Units/mg. The detection of activity of these enzymes is associated to periodontal disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plaque index - measured by visual observation and classification in scores (1 for presence, 0 for absence)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque index (PI) will be registered as scores (1 for presence, 0 for absence). For control group a plaque index of 15% is considered normal.</description>
