  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of mixed of herbs and spices on gene expression of
      pathways associated with glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, inflammation and its
      interrelation with circulating miRNA, in the postprandial phase in healthy human subjects.
