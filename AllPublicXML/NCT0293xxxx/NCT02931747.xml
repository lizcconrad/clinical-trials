      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Bacopa Monnieri on working memory and
      cognitive processing in student.

      Learning and working memory are two of the key role for studying and work successful for
      student particular the high school student who study hard and preparing themselves for the
      graduate study. The consumption of brain booster product or functional food for improving
      memory has gained much attention. It has been reported that Bacopa Monnieri could improve
      learning and working memory in elderly subject by improving the N100 and P300 event related
      potential. Therefore, Bacopa Monnieri might be the potential product for improving the
      learning and working memory in student particular high school student.
