  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic, debilitating anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur at a 2 to 10-fold
      greater rate in female than male athletes. Consequently, there is a larger population of
      females that endure significant pain, functional limitations, and radiographic signs of knee
      osteoarthritis (OA) within 12 to 20 years FOLLOWING injury. To reduce the burden of OA, The
      National Public Health Agenda for Osteoarthritis recommends expanding and refining
      evidence-based prevention of ACL injury. Specialized training that targets modifiable risk
      factors shows statistical efficacy in high-risk athletes; however, clinically meaningful
      reduction of risk has not been achieved. A critical barrier that limits successful training
      outcomes is the requirement of qualified instructors to deliver personalized, intuitive, and
      accessible feedback to young athletes. Thus, a key gap in knowledge is how to efficiently
      deliver objective, effective feedback during training for injury prevention. The
      investigators long-term goal is to reduce ACL injuries and the subsequent sequela in young
      female athletes. The overall objective of this proposal is to implement and test innovative
      augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT) techniques to enhance sensorimotor learning and
      reduce biomechanical risk factors for ACL injury. The rationale that underlies this proposal
      is that, after completion, the investigators will be equipped to more effectively deliver
      biofeedback and decelerate the trend of increasing ACL injury rates in female athletes. This
      contribution will be significant for the reduction of the long-term sequel following ACL
      injury in young females.

      aNMT integrates biomechanical screening with state-of-the-art augmented reality headsets to
      display real-time feedback that maps complex biomechanical variables onto simple visual
      feedback stimuli that athletes &quot;control&quot; via their own movements. The central hypothesis is
      that aNMT biofeedback will improve joint mechanics in evidence-based measures collected in
      realistic, sport-specific virtual reality scenarios. Specifically, the purpose of this
      investigation is to determine the efficacy of aNMT biofeedback to improve high-risk landing
      mechanics both in a laboratory task and during sport-specific scenarios. Based on the
      investigator's preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that aNMT biofeedback will
      produce greater improvements in localized joint mechanics compared to neuromuscular training
      that incorporates sham feedback during the drop vertical jump (DVJ) task. In the secondary
      Aim, the investigators hypothesize aNMT will produce improved localized joint mechanics and
      global injury risk techniques during sport-specific maneuvers assessed in immersive virtual
      environments compared to the sham feedback. The expected outcomes will support increased
      efficiency and enhanced efficacy of feedback for personalized and targeted injury prevention
      training. The positive impact will be the improvement of injury risk mechanics and the
      potential to reduce injury on the field of play. A randomized, repeated-measures design will
      be used to test the two hypotheses for Aim 1: First, that aNMT will produce greater
      improvements in localized joint mechanics compared to the sham feedback group during the DVJ
      task; second, based on the preliminary data the investigators expect that innovative aNMT
      will lead to graduated joint improvements and reduced global injury risk mechanics that will
      exceed the overall task transferred reductions in high risk biomechanics following 12
      real-time biofeedback training sessions. Previously described techniques will be used to
      measure biomechanical risk factors during a DVJ task performed at the beginning and end of
      the 6-week pre-competition training period. Athletes will be randomized into one of two
      groups: 1) aNMT biofeedback or (2) sham (augmented reality glasses with a stimulus that will
      provide exercise repetition count). Each athlete, as well as the statisticians, will be
      blinded to the intervention. All athletes will receive 12 training sessions over a 6-week
      period during their pre-competition season and each of the groups will have longitudinal
      assessment of biomechanical outcome measures captured at each biofeedback session. A subset
      of up to 60 participants will be recruited to test and refine the biofeedback stimulus. These
      participants will come for a single study visit and will be randomly allocated to a
      biofeedback or sham biofeedback group. Some of these participants may receive a cross-over
      assignment where they complete both the biofeedback and the sham feedback tasks. These study
      participants will not participate in strength, virtual reality pre or post-testing.
