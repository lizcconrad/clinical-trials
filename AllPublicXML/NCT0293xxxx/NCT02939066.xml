  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current modalities for lymph node staging in cancer can be limited. Needle-based confocal
      laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) is a novel endoscopic technique, which is compatible with the
      19-gauge FNA needle. Under endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) guidance, nCLE enables real-time
      in vivo imaging of lesion tissues at cellular and subcellular levels.This study aimed to
      evaluate the feasibility of needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) at the time of
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and to describe the nCLE features that distinguish between benign
      and malignant lymph nodes.
