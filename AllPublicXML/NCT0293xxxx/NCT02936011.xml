      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is increasingly effective to treat Chronic Total
      Occlusion (CTO) lesions in coronary arteries. This trial will examine modern dissection and
      re-entry approaches to treat more complex CTO lesions with the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular
      Scaffold (BVS).

      This is a pilot study, with the aim of hypothesis generation. This research aims to establish
      the feasibility and safety of treating chronic total occlusions using dissection and re-entry
      techniques in combination with everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (Absorb
      BVS).

      Primary aims of the study are:

        -  To demonstrate a low rate of Target Vessel Failure (stent thrombosis, restenosis or late
           closure) at 12 and 24 months after CTO PCI and stenting with the Absorb BVS

        -  To demonstrate a high degree of endothelial stent strut coverage at 12 and 24 moths
           after CTO PCI and stenting with the Absorb BVSThe primary outcome measure is
