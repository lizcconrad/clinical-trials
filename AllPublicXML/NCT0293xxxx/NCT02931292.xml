  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic disease and its treatment requires close follow-up to accurately assess
      the efficacy and durability of any treatment strategy. It is widely accepted that bariatric
      surgery patients require lifetime follow-up to assess for weight loss, co-morbidity changes,
      and nutritional deficiencies.

      The study objective was to ascertain efficacy of weight loss and complication rates in 562
      consecutive cases of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in a single surgeon practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major healthcare problem reaching epidemic proportion and affecting people of
      all age (1). The only treatment that proven effective option for a significant substantial
      long-term weight loss and that cures or durably improves comorbidities is still bariatric
      surgery (2, 3). Because obesity is a chronic disease, it is widely accepted that to
      accurately assess the efficacy and durability of any type of bariatric surgery requires
      lifetime follow-up to assess for weight loss, co-morbidity changes, and nutritional
      deficiencies.

      Despite initially performed as a first part of the staged procedures, the laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy (LSG) has since introduced as a stand-alone bariatric operation associated with
      good, short and mid-term weight loss and satisfactory complication rates when conducted in
      experienced hands. Although simplicity and the overall efficacy of the procedure supported by
      meta-analysis and systematic review (4, 5), there are still limited long-term outcome data
      (6). Due to publication bias or multiple controversies regarding the technique of LSG, some
      of the available data may have underreported which has also been resulted in questioning the
      long-term weight loss efficacy of the procedure.

      Although addressed by a recent consensus document,12 there are multiple controversies
      regarding the technique of LSG, and this may in part be what has led to the variable
      published results.

      The study objective was to assess the long-term (≥ 5 years) as well as short (1 to ≤ 3 years)
      and mid-term (&gt; 3 to &lt; 5 years) results in regard to the BMI change, resolution of
      co-morbidities and complications in 562 consecutive morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG as
      a primary procedure.

    <description>Change on lipid profile before and after bariatric surgery was reported according to the Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines, 2001, of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute as follows: no change, improvement in dislipidemia (defined as decrease in number or dose of lipid-lowering agents with equivalent control of dyslipidemia or improved control of lipids on equivalent medication) and remission (defined as normal lipid panel off medication).</description>

    <description>Complications were evaluated under two headings. Major complications were defined as any complication that resulted in a prolonged hospital stay (beyond 7 days), reintervention, or reoperation. Minor complications were included everything else that is not included under major. They were further categorized as early if observed in 30 days or late if beyond 30 days.</description>

    <description>Special care was given to the complete mobilization of the gastric fundus, with meticulous dissection of the posterior gastric wall from the left pillar. A 36-Fr calibration bougie was used. Resection started 2 to 6 cm from pylorus, and it was conducted upward to 1.5 cm from the angle of His, to avoid the &quot;critical area.&quot; A gastric remnant of 60-80 mL volume (measured by administering methylene blue saline solution via nasogastric tube) was obtained.</description>
