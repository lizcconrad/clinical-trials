  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with partially blocked blood vessel(s) in their heart may need a medical procedure
      called &quot;Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)&quot; to open the narrowed blood vessel(s). The
      purpose of this study is to simultaneously address four potential advances in ST-Elevation
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) care for patients at least 65 years old. The investigators are
      looking to see if these advances can improve the outcome for these patients.

        1. Opening the arteries with a Medtronic stent

        2. Radial access (from wrist) success with a Medtronic stent

        3. Checking the percent of blockage in the diseased artery/arteries using Volcano guide
           wires.

        4. Reduced bleeding and vascular complications with radial arterial access for primary PCI
           in STEMI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label, unblinded, active and historical-controlled trial in
      which approximately 875 seniors undergoing urgent PCI from approximately 70 centers will be
      enrolled. All consented subjects will undergo attempted radial arterial access.

      For DES (Drug Eluting Stent) eligible patients without randomization exclusion criteria and
      with multi-vessel disease identified during initial angiogram will be randomized by site in a
      ratio of 1:1 to IRA-only revascularization or iFR-guided complete revascularization. After
      randomization, subjects with stable TIMI-3 flow established in the IRA using the protocol
      specified treatment will proceed with the randomized procedure. Subjects in whom IRA
      reperfusion with TIMI-3 flow is not achieved will be treated according to clinical best
      practice standard of care independent of randomized procedure assignment and will not be
      considered protocol violations. These patients will be followed identically to all study
      patients.

      After stent implantation, subjects will be contacted for follow-up at 30 days by the
      enrolling site and at 1 year by the DCRI Call Center.

      Primary endpoint results will be reported after all subjects have completed 1 year (12
      months) of clinical follow-up.

      STEMI patients eligible for radial access:

        -  DES Eligible with single vessel Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) will receive DES to IRA

        -  DES Eligible with Multi-vessel CAD will randomize 1:1 to IRA-only revascularization or
           Instantaneous Wave Free Radio (iFR)-guided complete revascularization

        To be eligible for randomization in the 'IRA only vs. Complete Revascularization' phase of
        this trial, subjects must meet all of the above criteria and all of the following criteria
        subsequent to arterial access:

             the radial artery.

             standard when using IFR.

          4. Patients with a known history of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG).

          5. Has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic neurological attack within
             the past 6 months.

          6. Known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.) that may cause
             noncompliance with the protocol.

          7. Any condition associated with a life expectancy of less than 1 year.

        Study Randomization Exclusion Criteria If a subject who has been consented into the SAFE
        STEMI study develops or is found to have any of the following, they will not be eligible
        for randomization to an iFR guided complete revascularization vs. IRA-only primary PCI and
        will be excluded from the study.

          1. Shock requiring pressors or mechanical circulatory assist support (IABP, Impella,
             ECMO, etc.) significant chronic renal disease (eGFR &lt; 30) and/or on dialysis.
