      This is a single center, single arm, open-label phase 2 study to determine the efficacy of
      autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and
      4-1BB (TCRζ/4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as &quot;CART19&quot; cells) in adults with
      minimal residual disease (MRD) during upfront treatment for CD19+ acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.
