  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is kind of disease with unclear etiology. Recent studies on
      intestinal microbiota have raised the possibility that dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota
      maybe a novel theory for the development of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Hence, the
      investigators will compare the intestinal microbiota composition and diversity in PCOS with
      age, BMI-matched control and then assess whether intestinal microbiota modification is
      associated with clinical and biological parameters.

      The goal of this study is to investigate and compare the composition of the intestinal
      microbiota in patients with PCOS and age, BMI-matched control. In addition, the investigators
      will investigate the relationship between alterations in the intestinal microbiota, clinical
      phenotype, biochemical analysis, body composition, inflammation and food consumption habit.
      The investigators hypothesize that alterations in the intestinal microbiota are associated
      with increased immune activation and progression of PCOS. Based on this hypothesis, the
      investigators propose the following aims:

      Aim 1. Identify and enroll cohort with PCOS and age, BMI-matched control to study the role of
      intestinal microbiota on the development of PCOS.

        1. Enroll participants at Drum Tower Hospital. Identify and classify participants through
           initial clinical evaluation, collect clinical metadata, obtain and process blood and
           stool samples for analysis.

        2. Characterize the intestinal microbiota through quantitative PCR and high throughput
           sequencing analysis of stool specimens in participants.

      Aim 2. Compare sequencing results and metagenomic analysis for study groups with particular
      attention to bacterial composition and metabolic capacity associated with energy harvest,
      lipid and carbohydrate transport, enhancement of epithelial barrier integrity and systemic
      inflammation.
