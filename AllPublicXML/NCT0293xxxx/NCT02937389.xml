    <textblock>
      Gastric conduit ischemia or anastomotic breakdown after esophagectomy with cervical
      esophagogastrostomy often cause severe complications, such as leakage, necrotic organs, and
      strictures. Thus, the purpose of this study is the safety and efficacy of endoscopic
      evaluation about reconstructive organs after esophagectomy. The investigators evaluate
      endoscopic predictions using classifications in acute phase after esophagogastrostomy.

      The development and improvement of thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TE) reduced the severe
      pulmonary complication after esophagectomy. However, the postoperative complications relative
      to gastric conduit reconstruction are still common issues after esophagectomy. The ischemia
      of the proximal portion of the graft predisposes these patients to a high incidence of
      anastomotic complications after esophagectomy. Less commonly, severe graft ischemia can lead
      to transmural necrosis. Thus, early diagnosis of ischemic reaction may provide the suitable
      postoperative management and therapeutic intervention to prevent leakage, strictures and
      necrosis. Thus, the purpose of this study is the safety and efficacy of endoscopic evaluation
      about reconstructive organs after esophagectomy. The investigators evaluate endoscopic
      predictions using classifications in acute phase after esophagogastrostomy.
