      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a physiotherapy prehabilitation
      programme (walking and deep breathing exercises) in cardiac or thoracic patients by measuring
      changes in lung volumes, functional capacity physiotherapy length of stay postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative rehabilitation or &quot;Prehabilitation&quot; can be defined as &quot;the process of enhancing
      the functional capacity of the individual to enable him or her to withstand a stressful
      event&quot;. Prehabilitation is a relatively new concept with emerging evidence demonstrating a
      reduction in length of hospital stay and disability, improved functional capacity and quality
      of life as well as fewer peri-operative complications compared to usual care.

      Patients who are awaiting Cardiothoracic surgery are often fearful of being physically
      active, however extended periods of physical inactivity lead to a loss of muscle mass,
      physical deconditioning and pulmonary complications which can in turn lead to decreased
      quality of life, higher levels of morbidity, increased hospital length of stay and even
      fatality.

      Based on literature supporting the positive effects of physical activity, physiotherapy
      prehabilitation aims to enhance functional exercise capacity in patients undergoing
      Cardiothoracic surgery and hence minimising the risk of postoperative morbidity and enhancing
      postsurgical recovery. Although there is evidence for prehabilitation in cardiothoracic
      specialties these are mainly within heart failure patients therefore not comparable to
      patients undergoing CABG or lobectomy surgeries.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether a home based preoperative prehabilitation
      programme improves patients' functional capacity, as measured by a 6 minute walk test (6MWT)
      prior to surgery and improve post surgical recovery and recovery of functional capacity
      earlier. This study will compare functional capacity levels from baseline (at time of being
      accepted for surgery) and on the day of admission for surgery. Secondary aims are to
      determine functional capacity prior to discharge from hospital and at 6-8 week follow up
      appointment. Increasing maximal tidal volumes preoperatively would in turn decrease the
      chance of atelectasis postoperatively thereby decreasing pulmonary complications. Time to
      achieve discharge criteria from physiotherapy and total post-operative hospital length of
      stay will be assessed. Patient health related satisfaction will be assessed using the EQ-5D.
      The endpoint of this study will be when the patient returns for their routine 6-8 week follow
      up appointment and completes final 6MWT, tidal volume (TV) measurement and EQ-5D.

    <description>The 6MWT is a validated test that requires no exercise equipment or &quot;advanced&quot; training for the assessor. Walking is an activity carried out on a daily basis by most people. The 6MWT measures the distance that a person can walk on a flat surface over a period of 6 minutes. The majority of activities of daily living are carried out at &quot;sub-maximal&quot; levels similar to the level of exertion of the 6MWT as the patient sets their own intensity (American Thoracic Society 2002). A review of functional walking tests suggested that &quot;the 6MWT is easy to administer, better tolerated, and more reflective of activities of daily living than the other walk tests&quot; (Solway et al 2001). Other prehabilitation studies have used the 6MWT as an outcome measure of functional activity therefore is widely accepted as a reliable measure of functional activity (Sawatzky et al 2014; Carli et al 2010; Gillis et al 2014).</description>

    <description>A standardized and validated measure of health status which can be used in a wide range of health conditions. It is a simple method which patients can complete at the beginning and end of treatment. It encompasses five dimensions of health: mobility, ability to self care, ability to complete activities of daily living, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression (Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, 2016).</description>
