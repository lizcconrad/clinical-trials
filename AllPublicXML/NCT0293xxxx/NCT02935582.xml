    <textblock>
      Multinational real-life study of current psoriasis treatment strategies, topical treatment
      patterns and treatment outcomes of these treatments, including the newly introduced
      calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate aerosol foam fixed combination product Enstilar®
      (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multinational study aims to describe current treatment patterns and outcomes in the
      diversity of the real life setting: local differences in access to drugs and current
      treatment practices, and regional cultural differences, covering adult patients of all
      backgrounds, sex, socio-economic standing, health background, comorbidity and co-medication.
      A total of around 400 real-life prescribers in 3-8 countries are expected to participate over
      the years, with each country contributing data to the study for around 2 years, starting data
      collection within the first year after local market introduction of Enstilar®.

      The real-life prescribing and utilization patterns of topical prescription products approved
      for treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in the individual participating countries will be mapped
      and performance of the products in real life will be investigated based primarily on baseline
      data from investigators and patient reported data contributed by the individual patient for 1
      year. Patients are expected to enter data on their electronic device at baseline and at times
      of treatment changes and other key events, and investigators are expected to contribute data
      after each contact with the patient.

      Patients will be approached for informed consent to participate in the study after their
      individual treatment plan has been decided. The study aims to include two patients on other
      topical treatment for every patient planned to receive Enstilar® in order to ensure a
      sufficient sample of Enstilar® treated patients to capture the diversity of real-life
      prescription patterns in patients not on Enstilar®, and to allow for sufficiently powered
      comparisons between Enstilar® and other real-world treatment strategies. A systematic
      approach will be used to select eligible patients to be approached for study participation in
      order to minimize selection bias and control seasonal variations.

        Adult patients starting treatment with Enstilar® or other topical treatment of body and/or
        extremities in one of the countries participating in the study. Patients receiving a
        prescription renewal for an ongoing topical treatment are not eligible. Patients undergoing
        systemic treatment can be included as well, provided they receive a prescription for
        concomitant use of topical treatment on body and/or extremities and this is not a
        prescription renewal. The minimum age may vary slightly, as in some countries adult age
        differ from 18 years of age.
