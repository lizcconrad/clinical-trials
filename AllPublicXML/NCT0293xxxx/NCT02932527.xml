  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle and environmental factors can disrupt development and testicular function. In
      France, cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance and about 8% of adults between 18
      and 64 years smoke cannabis at least once a year, and mostly men under 45 years.
      Endocannabinoids are lipid mediators that share some effects with the active ingredients of
      cannabis. Cannabis and endocannabinoids act via two types of endogenous receptors which were
      detected at different levels of the reproductive system and are involved in the central and
      local regulation of the gonad. Cannabis use may alter the normal regulation of the
      endocannabinoid system. In males, the regulation of the endocannabinoid system is critical
      for Sertoli and Leydig cells functions, germ cell differentiation, maturation of sperm
      nucleus and sperm quality. The cannabis can have a negative impact on sperm parameters,
      capacitation and acrosome reaction. Cannabinoids may decrease testosterone synthesis and
      induce apoptosis of Sertoli cells. Studies on the effect of cannabinoids on male fertility
      are scarce or nonexistent in infertile men because of ethical considerations and bias due to
      consumption often underreported. Investigators hypothesized that cannabis use may alter sperm
      nuclear quality. Investigators want to explore this hypothesis conducting a multicentric
      prospective study exposed/non-exposed in infertile men who are consulting for Medically
      Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). To reach this study, it is planned to include a
      total of 200 subjects taking into account any exclusions.
