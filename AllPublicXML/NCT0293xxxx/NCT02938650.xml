      We are looking to see how the nitrosomonas alters nitrolipids in the skin and the
      inflammatory cytokines of the skin.

      We will be using healthy subjects over the course of 2 weeks.

      Subjects will be using a neutral cleanser for one week prior to the study, skin
      microbiome,facial photography, lipid and cytokine measurements will be taken at baseline.
      Subjects will then start using nitrosomonas spray twice daily for one week.

      There is a portion of the study where the subjects will have skin microbiome, facial
      photography, lipid measurements, blood pressure measurements and a bloow draw before and
      after using the nitrosomonas spray for one week.
