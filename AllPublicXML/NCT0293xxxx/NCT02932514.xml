      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the accuracy of the Eversense
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Eversense System) measurements when compared with a
      Self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) meter. The investigation will assess device performance
      in two insertion locations (abdomen and upper arm), evaluate safety of the Eversense System
      usage, and assess the usability of the Eversense system in the hands of user at home setting.
      Changes in HbA1c from baseline will also be evaluated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult subjects, age ≥18 years

          2. Clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year and using insulin by
             subcutaneous injection or insulin pump.

          3. Subject has signed an informed consent form and is willing to comply with protocol
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects of childbearing capacity (defined as not surgically sterile or not
             menopausal for ≥ 1 year) who are lactating or pregnant, intending to become pregnant,
             or not practicing birth control during the course of the study

          2. A condition preventing or complicating the placement, operation or removal of the
             sensor or wearing of transmitter, including upper extremity deformities or skin
             condition

          3. Symptomatic coronary artery disease; unstable angina; myocardial infarction, transient
             ischemic attack or stroke within 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic&gt;160 mm
             HG or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg at time of screening); current congestive heart failure;
             history of cardiac arrhythmia (benign PACs and PVCs allowed). Subjects with
             asymptomatic coronary artery disease (e.g., CABG, stent placement or angioplasty) may
             participate if negative stress test within 1 year prior to screening and written
             clearance from cardiologist documented.

          4. History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV

          5. Currently receiving (or likely to need during the study period): immunosuppressant
             therapy; chemotherapy; anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy (excluding aspirin);
             glucocorticoids (excluding ophthalmic or nasal). This exclusion does include the use
             of inhaled glucocorticoids and the use of topical glucocorticoids (over sensor site
             only); antibiotics for chronic infection (e.g. osteomyelitis, endocarditis)

          6. A condition requiring or likely to require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          7. Known topical or local anesthetic allergy

          8. Known allergy to glucocorticoids

          9. Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unable to
             complete the study or would make it not in the subject's best interest to participate
             in the study. Conditions include, but are not limited to, psychiatric conditions,
             known current or recent alcohol abuse or drug abuse by subject history, a condition
             that may increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia or risk related to repeated blood
             testing. Investigator will supply rationale for exclusion

         10. Participation in another clinical investigation (drug or device) within 2 weeks prior
             to screening or intent to participate during the study period

         11. The presence of any other active implanted device*
