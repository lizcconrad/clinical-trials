  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled study to determine
      whether Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) vs. a Support Group (SG) can improve
      pain regulation and hedonic functions (i.e., natural reward responsiveness) thought to be
      governed by the endogenous opioid system among opioid-treated, chronic, non-neuropathic back
      pain patients (CNBP) and thereby improve clinical pain, affect, and opioid use.
