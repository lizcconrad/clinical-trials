  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central aim of this proposed study is to test a multimodal, mindfulness-oriented
      intervention designed to disrupt the risk chain leading to prescription opioid dose
      escalation, opioid misuse and opioid addiction, which are mounting threats to active duty
      service members and Veterans with chronic pain conditions, who may develop disordered opioid
      use as a consequence of long-term opioid pharmacotherapy.
