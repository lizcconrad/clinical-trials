  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous glue therapy with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was reported to improve outcomes in
      plastic surgery. However, only pilot studies and retrospective uncontrolled trials have
      reported the potential benefits of autologous glue treatment up to now. Therefore, a larger,
      blinded, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial would be useful to determine
      whether platelet-rich plasma is safe and effective in abdominoplasty procedures.

      Currently, there are pharmacological options such as artificial fibrin glues composed of
      homologous fibrinogen and animal-derived thrombin. However, these therapeutics present a risk
      of transmissible diseases and may induce allergic reactions. Therefore, autologous glues,
      which are fully made of blood components from the patient itself (autologous fibrinogen
      contained in PRP and autologous thrombin) represents a safe alternative to artificial
      biological glues.

      Regen Lab SA developed RegenKit®-Surgery to prepare autologous PRP, on one hand, and an
      autologous activated thrombin serum, on the other hand, in a safe and rapid manner.
      RegenKit®-Surgery is a CE-marked class IIb medical device.

      This study, conducted on 56 patients, will evaluate the effects of autologous glue prepared
      with RegenKit®-Surgery when used in reconstructive abdominoplasty.

    <description>Patients will undergo abdominoplasty according to the procedure routinely used in the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery of HUG. At the end of the procedure, patients assigned to the experimental group will be additionally treated with an application of autologous glue prepared with RegenKit®-Surgery in the undermining region space between fascia and skin, just before closure of the surgical wound.</description>
