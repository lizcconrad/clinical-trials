  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High relapse rates among substance dependent individuals are likely due to a combination of
      factors that involve limbic circuits in the brain involved in craving, including
      vulnerability to salient cues. Emerging data suggests that non-invasive, targeted brain
      stimulation may be able to modulate activity in these circuits and decrease craving. The
      primary goal of this pilot study is to determine the extent to which a single session of
      continuous theta burst stimulation (TBS) to the medial prefrontal cortex can attenuate limbic
      circuitry involved in craving among cocaine users and alcohol users. This will be tested
      through a double-blind,sham-controlled brain stimulation and brain imaging study in a cohort
      of polysubstance abusers and alcohol users.

      This parent protocol contains two components - one of which is targeting cocaine users, the
      other of which is targeting heavy alcohol users (who will also serve as an appropriate
      control group for the cocaine users - who typically have comorbid alcohol use disorders). All
      participants will receive one session of real and one session of sham continuous theta burst
      stimulation (TBS). TBS is a form of non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. sham TMS
      on another visit (randomized). Continuous TBS is designed to lower cortical excitability, and
      requires a shorter stimulation period than typical low frequency transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS). The investigators will test the hypotheses that stimulation over the
      medial prefrontal cortex will attenuate activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (Aim 1),
      using single pulse TMS in the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Through this innovative
      technique it is possible to apply a single pulse of TMS to the medial prefrontal cortex and
      model the hemodynamic response at the stimulation site as well as monosynaptic target
      regions, including the striatum. The investigators will also investigate the effect of TBS on
      neural response to drug cues (Aim 2). The results of these aims will be further correlated
      with self-reported assessments of craving throughout each experimental visit. These data will
      be preliminary data for a subsequent R01 focused on the sustained effects of multiple
      sessions of TBS and their efficacy in lowering craving for extended periods of time in
      treatment-seekers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion: non-treatment seeking cocaine users (with or without comorbid alcohol use
             disorder) and individuals with alcohol use disorders, 25-55 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For the cocaine sub study: Cocaine users will be excluded for current use of
             prescription or illicit psychoactive drugs other than cocaine and marijuana, current
             or past substance dependence criteria other than cocaine, marijuana, or alcohol,
             smoking &gt;1 pack of cigarettes per day, current breath alcohol concentration &gt;0.002, a
             lifetime history of head injury, a history of seizures or migraine headaches (as
             transcranial magnetic stimulation may exacerbate these conditions), and violation of
             other magnetic resonance imaging safety measures.

        For both the cocaine sub study and the alcohol sub study: Drug Screens: A multidrug urine
        panel will be given to all participants at the screening visit and each
        scanning/stimulation visit. In order to minimize any potential risk of this session of
        theta burst stimulation, participants must have a negative urine drug screen for stimulants
        (including cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine) at the Scanning/Stimulation visits and
        have no signs of alcohol withdrawal. Based on the sensitivity of this test, this will
        require that the participants abstain from cocaine use for 48 hours prior to the
        intervention. While there are no reports of adverse events from transcranial magnetic
        stimulation in cocaine users this precaution is being taken as psychostimulants are known
        to reduce the seizure threshold. Participants will be informed of this at the Screening
        visit. If they attend a Scanning/Stimulation visit and have a positive urine drug screen,
        they will be given an opportunity to reschedule.
