  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is a significant issue in people undergoing dialysis. More than 80% of
      haemodialysis patients complain of difficulty sleeping. Inadequate sleep can cause poor
      daytime function and increased risk of motor vehicle incidents.

      One of the common reasons for sleep disturbance in dialysis patients is sleep apnoea. Sleep
      apnoea involves pauses in breathing that occur during sleep. Each pause can last only a few
      seconds or minutes. Severe sleep apnoea reduces oxygen supply and increases risk of heart
      attack and stroke, which are the leading causes of death in dialysis patients.

      In this project, the investigators will examine how a change of dialysis treatment might
      improve sleep. This project will first identify patients at risk of sleep disturbance using
      surveys and a subsequent sleep study. The investigators will then test different dialysis
      models to see the effect of dialysis treatment on sleep apnoea. The aim is to find a dialysis
      model that works better for patients with sleep apnoea.

      Sleep Problem in Dialysis Patients Sleep apnoea is a significant issue in patients with end
      stage kidney disease. Evidence suggests that up to 80% of dialysis patients have sleep apnoea
      [1], yet the standard haemodialysis treatment does not improve the symptoms of sleep
      disturbance in most patients [2].

      Sleep disturbance is specifically associated with poor quality of life (QoL) [4]; decreased
      mental and physical function, and adversely impact survival [5-7]. Recent data also suggest
      that the low oxygen state resulting from sleep apnoea can exaggerate the deterioration of
      kidney function and increase risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular abnormality and
      overall death rates [8]. Despite the significance of sleep apnoea, it is acknowledged that
      there is insufficient evidence for clinicians to manage this common symptom burden in the
      dialysis population [9]; and patients who receive maintenance dialysis today still experience
      poor QoL and worse survival rates compared with most common cancer sufferers [10].

      Knowledge Gap It is believed that the mechanism of sleep apnoea in dialysis patients are
      related to overactive chemoreceptors, which cause destabilisation of the respiratory drive
      and periodic breathing during the night [13]. Since the chemoreceptors can be triggered by
      inflammatory blood toxins, which accumulate in kidney failure [14], it is proposed that
      better clearance of these molecules can improve symptoms and outcomes of sleep apnoea. These
      molecules are poorly removed by standard haemodialysis [15] and are thought to cause the
      symptomatic effects of poor kidney function and inflammation, which are associated with poor
      sleep quality [16].

      Better dialysis treatment may play an important role in the management of sleep apnoea.
      Previous studies have suggested that sleep apnoea may be improved by nocturnal dialysis; an
      intensive treatment which patients undergo at home, during sleep, for 8-10 hours every night.
      It provides better blood purification, compared with standard haemodialysis treatment.
      However, nocturnal dialysis is a home therapy which is not viable for the majority of
      haemodialysis patients who require care in a clinical setting. There is clearly a need to
      explore the effectiveness of dialysis treatment on sleep apnoea using a different dialysis
      model.

      Modern dialysis technology, such as Haemodiafiltration (HDF), allows for better removal of
      toxic molecules such as beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) and C-Reactive protein (CRP), than
      standard haemodialysis treatment, and may offer the benefits of nocturnal dialysis to all
      dialysis patients. No one has examined the effect of HDF on sleep apnoea in haemodialysis
      patients, and the investigators will answer this question in this study.

      Research Aims

        1. To determine the prevalence of sleep apnoea in the local dialysis population using a
           validated questionnaire and sleep study. Although sleep apnoea is recognised as common
           in the dialysis population, there is a need to reproduce this data in the context of
           local dialysis services to accurately identify affected patients

        2. To examine the effect of HDF compared conventional haemodialysis on health status and
           sleep quality in patients with sleep apnoea, using a randomised cross-over trial (RCT)

        3. To determine if the clearance of middle-sized uraemic toxins improves symptoms of sleep
           apnoea. The middle-sized molecules to be assessed in this study include C-Reactive
           protein (CRP), beta 2-microglobulin (β2M), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α),
           interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8), which are the serum inflammatory markers
           that are commonly found in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.

    <description>The objective sleep quality will be measured by Polysomnography (PSG). PSG is comprised of 4 channels: Electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), electro-oculography (EOG) and electrocardiography (ECG). It monitors many body functions including brain (EEG), eye movements (EOG), muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation (EMG) and heart rhythm (ECG) during sleep. The following data will be reported via a PSG for assessment of sleep apnoea: total sleep time, sleep efficiency, types of sleep (% of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM)), arousal (episodes/hr), apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI), and oxygen saturation. The AHI score will be used to determine the severity of sleep apnoea.</description>

    <measure>Subjective sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective sleep quality will be measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is an effective tool to measure the quality and patterns of sleep, and to differentiate &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month period. A global sum of 5 or greater indicates &quot;poor&quot; sleep.</description>

The domains examined include physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, physical pain, mental health, vitality, general health perceptions plus the burden of kidney disease, and symptoms/problems commonly associated with kidney disease.</description>
