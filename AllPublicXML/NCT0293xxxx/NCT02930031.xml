  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this investigation the investigators utilized N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation to
      enhance reduced glutathione (GSH) stores during an 8-day recovery period from a strenuous
      eccentric exercise protocol in order to test the hypotheses: i) redox status perturbations in
      skeletal muscle are pivotal for the immune responses and ii) antioxidant supplementation may
      alter immune cell responses following exercise-induced muscle microtrauma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major thiol-disulfide couple of GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is a crucial
      regulator of the main transcriptional pathways regulating aseptic inflammation and recovery
      of skeletal muscle following aseptic injury. Antioxidant supplementation may hamper
      exercise-induced inflammatory responses.

      The objective was to examine how thiol-based antioxidant supplementation affects immune
      mobilization following exercise-induced skeletal muscle microtrauma. In a two-trial,
      double-blind, crossover, repeated measures design, 10 young men received either placebo or
      NAC (20 mg/kg/day) immediately after a muscle-damaging exercise protocol (300 eccentric
      contractions) and for eight consecutive days. Blood sampling and performance assessment were
      performed pre-exercise, 2h post-exercise and daily for 8 consecutive days.
