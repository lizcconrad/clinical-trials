  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase IV investigator initiated clinical trial to study the effectiveness of alirocumab, an
      inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK9), versus placebo added to
      high-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80 mg) in lowering low density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol during non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research will study the effects of early initiation of alirocumab in addition to high
      intensity statin therapy in patients who have previously been treated with high intensity
      statins with poor response, who present with a type I (spontaneous) acute NSTEMI. Patients
      will be dosed with drug or placebo once during the first day of their hospital admission.
      Blood samples will be collected at baseline, 3 days and 14 days after randomization for
      biomarker testing. Particular attention will be paid to additional LDL lowering effects, as
      well as the effects on PCSK9 levels and inflammatory biomarkers. Safety and tolerability will
      be monitored with complete blood count + differential and complete metabolic panels at each
      study visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute type I (spontaneous) NSTEMI defined as chest pain (or equivalent) with an onset
             of symptoms within 12 hours of presentation, a duration of &gt;15 minutes, and elevated
             cardiac troponin I levels, with or without electrocardiographic changes [with the
             exclusion of ST elevation];

          2. On medical therapy with high intensity statin prior to admission (either atorvastatin
             40-80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg) as documented by hospital or pharmacy records and
             with known LDL cholesterol ≥70 mg/dL within the prior 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt;21 years of age

          2. Inability to give informed consent

          3. Previous, current or planned treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor

          4. Known history of loss of function of PCSK9 (genetic mutation or sequence variation)

          5. Patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (clinically or by previous
             genotyping)

          6. Recent (&lt;14 days) or active use of immunosuppressive drugs (including but not limited
             to high-dose corticosteroids [&gt;1mg/kg of prednisone equivalent], Tumor Necrosis
             Factor-α blockers, cyclosporine) not including non-steroidal antinflammatory drugs or

               1. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the time of screening that
                  in the judgment of the investigator or any sub-investigator would preclude safe
                  completion of the study or constrain assessment of endpoints, such as major
                  systemic diseases or patients with short life expectancy.

         16. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) &lt; lower limit of normal (LLN) or &gt; upper limit of
