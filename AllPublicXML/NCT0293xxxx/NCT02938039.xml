      This study will guide the anesthetists regarding the appropriate selection of the LMA in
      neonatal age group based on scientific basis.

      This study will add up to existing literature about the safety of LMA usage in neonates and
      infants. Furthermore it may shed some light on which LMA type will be more feasible and
      effective for neonatal/ infants usage.

    <textblock>
      Laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) are in practice of anesthesia since early 1980s. Pediatric and
      neonatal patients (including ex-premature) have also been benefited by the use of LMA. There
      are many advantages of LMA over endotracheal tube (ETT) in pediatric patients like ease of
      insertion, securing airway rapidly, avoidance of muscle relaxants, reduced incidence of sore
      throat, post operative hoarseness and coughing at the time of extubation, greater hemodynamic
      and intraocular pressure (IOP) stability. LMA has been recognized internationally in control
      of airway in difficult and failed intubation.

      There are different types of pediatric LMAs available e.g. I-gel, ProSeal, LMA supreme, LMA
      classic, LMA unique, LarySeal and Ambu. These devices differ morphologically from each other
      (silicone, polyvinyl chloride or soft gel). There have been several randomized controlled
      studies comparing different LMAs in adults, however, the literature is sparse in which such
      comparison has been made in patients with weight 10 kg or below.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Airway Leak Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>17 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured in mmHg unit and the expiratory valve will be closed with a fresh gas flow of 3 l.min-1 until an audible leak is heard, airway pressure will not be allowed to exceed 25 cmH2O), and then released completely</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effective airway time</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured in seconds unit , and The time for successful insertion will be measured from the moment the facemask will be removed until attainment of first capnography upstroke after insertion</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ease of placement of LMA will be assessed using a subjective scale of 1-4 (1 = no resistance and no maneuvers, 2 = mild resistance and one maneuver, 3 = moderate resistance and more than one maneuver, 4 = inability to place the device)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Success at first attempt</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The insertion will be labelled as a 'failure' if the device could not be successfully placed within two attempts or lacked a square-wave capnograph tracing, or if there was airway obstruction (e.g. oxygen desaturation &lt; 90%, abnormal thoraco-abdominal movements, or obstructive noises or no rise of chest at all), inadequate ventilation (an inability to deliver a minimum of 7 ml.kg-1 tidal volumes, or an audible leak)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Desaturation less than 90%</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a Yes or No outcome measure and it will be measured using the oxygen saturation monitor placed on finger and the reading will be detected on the capnography</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric Insufflation</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a Yes or No outcome measure and auscultation with a stethoscope will be performed over the epigastrium during leak pressure testing to detect the occurrence of gastric insufflation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manipulation of the Device</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>the number and type of airway manipulations (gentle advancement, withdrawal of device without removal, jaw thrust, or neck extension) required to maintain airway patency during the case will be recorded</description>
