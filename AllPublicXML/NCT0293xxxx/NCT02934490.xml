  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to explore the effectiveness of a new-style anterior vaginal wall mesh in the
      treatment of female stress urinary incontinence(SUI). Meshes were made by Gynemech TM PS,
      (Johnson &amp; Johnson Shanghai Medical Equipment Co. China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA)
      registration No. 3460365, size 10 × 15cm). Meshes were cut to appropriate size. The
      incontinence questionnaire summary table (ICIQ-SF), pad test, urodynamic and other diagnostic
      tests were used for preoperative assessment and the evaluation of postoperative surgical
      outcome and complication. The results were compared with the one-year cure rates of Burch and
      trans vaginal taping (TVT) surgeries. The analysis indicated that the surgery using the
      new-style anterior vaginal mesh, as a minimally invasive procedure, not only achieved its
      expectation with similar cure rate to Burch, TVT/ trans vaginal taping obturator (TVT-O)
      surgeries, but also has lower economic cost and complication rate than the TVT /TVT-O
      approach. The evaluation of long-term treatment effect needs further follow-up of the
      patients.
