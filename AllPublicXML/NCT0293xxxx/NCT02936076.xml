    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the psychological benefits of chronic exercise as
      well as the effects of exercise training on eating behaviors and stress-induced overeating in
      overweight and obese women. Participants will be randomized to an 12-week exercise condition
      or a delayed exercise condition. Assessments will occur at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks
      and will include answering surveys in real-time using smartphones, several assessments of
      eating behaviors and dietary intake, and questionnaire measures of factors which could
      mediate the relationship between exercise and eating. Participants will be compensated for
      completing assessments and for adherence to the exercise protocol.

    <description>Participants randomized to the exercise condition will participate in a 12-week exercise training program. The exercise intervention will consist of both supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions and progress to 200 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise. Exercise bouts will be spread across 4-6 days and be at least 20 minutes in duration. During supervised visits, heart rate will be monitored by a member of the research staff to ensure that exercise is within the prescribed intensity range and ratings of perceived exertion and feeling state will be assessed periodically. Unsupervised exercise will be verified using objective physical activity monitors.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the delayed exercise condition will be asked not to change their exercise or eating habits over the 12-week period and will complete the same assessment measures as the exercise condition. However, following the completion of the 12-week period, participants will be given two options: 1) receive a one-on-one session with an exercise physiologist at our center and receive a written exercise program, and at this time point all study obligations will be completed, or 2) complete the identical exercise protocol as the 'exercise' condition.</description>
