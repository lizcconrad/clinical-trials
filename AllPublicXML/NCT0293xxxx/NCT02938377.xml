      Aim 1: Examine effects of algorithm-guided alcohol treatment on alcohol consumption and
      alcohol use Disorders (AUD) symptoms. Hypothesis 1A: Patients who are treated using
      algorithm-guided alcohol treatment will decrease drinking quantity and or frequency compared
      to pre-algorithm levels. Hypothesis 1B. Patients who are treated using algorithm-guided
      treatment will decrease current AUD symptoms compared to pre-algorithm symptoms levels.

      Aim 2: Examine effects of algorithm-guided alcohol treatment on retention in HIV care and
      HIV-related outcomes. Hypothesis 2A. Patients treated using algorithm-guided treatment will
      increase adherence to clinic visits and HIV medications compared to pre-algorithm levels.
      Hypothesis 2B. Patients who receive algorithm-guided treatment will have improved HIV
      biomarkers (e.g., CD4 and VL). Hypothesis 3B. There will be a positive relationship between
      VL and alcohol consumption measured by self-report and PEth level.

      Aim 3: Examine effects of algorithm-guided alcohol treatment on comorbid conditions (e.g.,
      depression, anxiety, HCV, other drug use disorders). Hypothesis 3A: Persons living with HIV
      (PLWH) with co-morbid depression and anxiety receiving algorithm-guided treatment will have
      better alcohol, mental health and HIV treatment outcomes compared to similar individuals in
      SC. Hypothesis 3B: PLWH with comorbid HCV receiving algorithm-guided treatment will have
      improved FIB4 results and reduced likelihood of HCV recurrence compared to persons in SC.
      Hypothesis 3C: Other drug use will decrease among those receiving algorithm-guided treatment
      vs SC.
