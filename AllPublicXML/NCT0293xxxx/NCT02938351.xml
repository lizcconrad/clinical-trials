      The aims of the present study will be to pilot test the efficacy of a collaborative care
      intervention in patients awaiting kidney transplant to reduce symptoms of depression, pain,
      fatigue and improve quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptom management is critical to maintain quality of life in those with life limiting
      conditions. Stepped collaborative care interventions have been widely employed in the primary
      care setting for the treatment of depression and more recently have been utilized to treat
      other symptoms (e.g., pain) in a variety of settings. A recent meta-analyses concluded that
      collaborative care interventions were superior to usual care and are more cost-effective than
      face to face and pharmacological treatment for depression. Collaborative care interventions
      have begun to be extended to other settings but have not been tested in patients who are
      being treated with dialysis. The aims of the present study were to pilot test the efficacy of
      a collaborative care intervention in patients awaiting kidney transplant to reduce symptoms
      of depression, pain, fatigue and improve quality of life.

    <description>Therapist will use iPad (Vidyo) once a week during dialysis for approximately one hour. The therapist will teach the patient cognitive-behavioral strategies to manage their mood and pain. The PI is a clinical psychologist and will provide supervision to the therapist providing the intervention. The sessions for depression will include (1) intake, (2) review of the rational for using CBT to treat depression and/or pain, (3) identifying thought patterns, (4) changing thought patterns, (5) relaxation techniques, (6) rest-activity pacing, and (7) coping strategies. Homework to practice these techniques will be provided after each session.</description>
