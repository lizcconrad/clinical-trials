  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventions incorporating constructs from behavioral economics and psychology have the
      potential to enhance HIV 'treatment as prevention' (TasP) strategies. To test this
      hypothesis, the investigators evaluated a combination intervention to improve antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) adherence based on the concepts of social norms and priming.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a quasi-experimental pilot study of a combination behavioral
      intervention based on the concepts of social norms and priming. The intervention included
      visual feedback about clinic-level retention in care, a self-relevant prime, and useful
      take-home items with the priming image. The intervention was developed using tools from
      marketing research and patient-centered design. The hypothesis was that the intervention
      would improve retention in care and adherence to ART among patients living with HIV infection
      (PLHIV). The intervention was implemented at two HIV primary clinics in Shinyanga, Tanzania
      in 2-week intervals for six months. The investigators reviewed medical records of a random
      sample of exposed and unexposed adult PLHIV to compare retention and the proportion of
      patients with medication possession ratio (MPR) â‰¥95% after six months.

    <description>Patients in this arm may have been exposed to the behavioral intervention, which included the following components: 1) visual feedback about clinic-level retention in care through an interactive poster; 2) a self-relevant priming image that appeared on all components; and 3) a take-home item (i.e., pillbox or calendar) with the priming image.</description>

    <description>The intervention includes a clinic-based component and a take-home component. All components include the priming image of a Baobab tree. The clinic-based component is an interactive poster that rewarded appointment attendance. Patients who attend three consecutive on-time visits are congratulated and given a colored sticker to place on a poster that is publicly displayed at the clinic. In one clinic, the take-home component is a 2015 calendar in Kiswahili that contained the priming Baobab image. In the other clinic, the take-home component is a small plastic pillbox featuring the Baobab logo.</description>
