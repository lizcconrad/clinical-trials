    <textblock>
      It is common for people to advise individuals undergoing vaccination to look away from the
      needle to make them hurt less and be less scary. However, this advice is not backed up by
      research evidence. the purpose of this study is to learn about how looking away vs. looking
      at the needle during vaccination makes people feel. People will be randomized to 1 of 2
      groups: look at the needle, look away. Then they will undergo vaccination and report on pain
      and fear experienced.

      It is common for people to advise individuals undergoing vaccination to look away from the
      needle to make them hurt less and be less scary. However, this advice is not backed up by
      experimental research evidence. It is possible that looking away acts as a distraction and
      takes attention away from the needle, thus reducing pain. However, it is also possible that
      looking at the needle is better because it prevents people's imaginations from making them
      think it is worse than it actually is. To our knowledge, this is the first first randomized
      study to examine the effect of looking away vs. looking at the needle on pain and fear
      experienced during vaccinations. Adult university students undergoing routine flu vaccination
      will be included.
