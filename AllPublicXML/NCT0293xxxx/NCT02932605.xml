      The main objective of this study is to compare microglia activation as measured with PET in
      combination with the tracer [11C]-R-PK11195 between recent-onset schizophrenia patients who
      are randomised to CBD and those randomised to placebo.

    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder with an urgent need for new and more
      effective treatments. A promising novel pharmacological target in this respect is the
      endocannabinoid system. In particular the cannabinoid compound cannabidiol (CBD) displays a
      highly favourable profile for development as a new antipsychotic agent. Increasing evidence
      indicates a significant role for neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,
      especially for activation of resident macrophages of the brain: microglia. Interestingly,
      converging preclinical evidence suggests that microglia activation is under control of the
      endocannabinoid system. However, how manipulation of the endocannabinoid system affects
      microglia activation in humans has not been established, but it is presumably related to
      clinical improvement of schizophrenia patients.

      In this project, we propose to study endocannabinoid control of microglia activation as a new
      therapeutic target in the treatment of schizophrenia. Using a placebo-controlled, randomised,
      double-blind design, we will investigate this in a group of 50 recent-onset schizophrenia
      patients after four weeks of daily CBD treatment, in addition to their regular antipsychotic
      medication. First, we will examine if CBD treatment attenuates microglia activation and
      levels of peripheral inflammatory markers. In vivo microglia activation is assessed before
      and after treatment using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in combination with the tracer
      [11C]-R-PK11195. Second, we will determine if reduced microglia activation and levels of
      inflammatory markers relate to improvement of symptomatology and cognitive function. Third,
      we will assess how microglia activation and levels of inflammatory markers before treatment
      predict the clinical response to CBD.
