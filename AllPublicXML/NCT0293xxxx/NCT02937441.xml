      The purpose of this study is to determine cerebral edema with evaluation of measurement of
      diameter of optic nerve sheath. For that, If patients have Fluid treatment shall be started
      in 4 hours in our or other Emergency Care, they will be included our study. If not, they will
      be out of our study.

      How we measure;

        1. First measurement shall be taken in 4 hours.

        2. Second measurement shall be taken at 12 hours in mild and 12-18 hours measurement shall
           be taken for severe diabetic ketoacidosis,

        3. Third measurement shall be taken after fluid treatment.

        4. Fourth measurement shall be taken at polyclinic control. So, after all measurements will
           be hand and all data will be analyzed with statistical program. After that all outcome
           will be discussed and compared with patient at normal conditions at their polyclinic
           visit.
