    <textblock>
      Melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer. Major advances in metastatic melanoma treatment
      emerge from new immunotherapies that target specific immune inhibitory checkpoint receptors,
      mainly PD1 and CTLA-4, and overcome the exhaustion state of T cells. In this context,
      checkpoint inhibitors, such as Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies, mAb) and
      Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab (anti-PD1 mAb), have demonstrated survival benefit in advanced
      melanoma patients. Anti-PD1 agents and combination of anti-PD1 and anti CTLA-4 have now been
      approved as first line therapy in melanoma. However, the predictive factors of response to
      these immunotherapies remain so far elusive. Recent studies provided consistent evidence that
      the immune infiltration could be tested as a biomarker for such immunotherapies. Moreover,
      the very recent concept of tumor neoantigens as biomarkers of response to anti-CTLA-4 mAb,
      and potentially also to anti-PD1 or combination therapies, is promising but needs to be
      further explored.

      In this context, the aim of our program is to identify and validate an immune signature
      predictive of anti-PD-1 benefit in the treatment of advanced melanoma patients. To this aim,
      tumor samples from 120 melanoma patients enrolled prospectively, treated with anti-PD1 mAb
      alone or combined with anti CTLA4, will be collected as well as the corresponding peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Tumor infiltration with immune cells will be characterized on
      paraffin embedded melanoma samples. The investigators will also perform whole-exome
      sequencing on tumors and matched PBMC samples. Our primary objective is to develop a combined
      immuno-signature based on an immuno-score (CD3, CD8, CD45RO…) to quantify the in situ immune
      populations with a dedicated image analysis system combined with the simultaneous detection
      of CD8-PD-1 and PD-L1 by immunofluorescence in baseline tumor samples. This will permit to
      predict 1-year survival of patients with advanced melanoma treated with anti-PD1 and transfer
      in patient's care.

      Our secondary objectives are: 1/ To assess the interest of the detection of tissue-resident
      memory (TRM) T cells (CD8-CD103) as a predictive biomarker of response and survival at
      1-year; 2/ To extend the panel of neoantigens published by Snyder et al to other neoantigens
      using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach on tumor samples obtained before therapy;
      3/ To establish the prognostic value of this panel of neoantigens to predict tumor response
      to anti-PD1 and 1-year survival; 4/ To functionally validate the identified tumor neoantigens
      by stimulating patient PBMC with neoantigen peptides and measuring tumor-specific T-cell
      reactivity; 5/ To define the best marker and/or the best combination of markers predicting
      the overall response rate and the survival at 12 and 18 months; 6/ To attempt to establish a
      correlation between immuno-signature and neoepitopes and 7/ To transfer this immune signature
      in routine basis if validated.

      Thus, our project will integrate two complementary strategies to define a robust and reliable
      score system for predicting anti-PD1 targeting immunotherapy response. This study will
      provide a unique opportunity to validate various putative biomarkers in an integrated way
      that could help in determining the respective value of each isolated parameter and
      potentially lead to the definition of a composite biomarker. The identified immune signature
      would be of major interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy in order to select and manage
      patient treatment, and to consider the benefice or toxicities expected. It will also help to
      identify new target antigens of effective antitumoral immune responses and to understand the
      resistance mechanisms established by the tumor and its influence on the response to current
      immunotherapies.
