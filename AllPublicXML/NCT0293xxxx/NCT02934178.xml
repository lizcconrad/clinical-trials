    <textblock>
      This is a research study about an experimental (investigational) live attenuated Shigella
      sonnei vaccine (WRSS1) to find a dose of the vaccine that is safe, tolerable, and develops an
      immune response. Shigella causes bloody and watery diarrhea, and infants and children living
      in developing countries experience the greatest consequences of this disease. The WRSS1
      vaccine in will be given to healthy toddlers (12-24 months old). The first vaccination will
      be given to toddlers in the inpatient unit and the second and third doses will be
      administered on an outpatient basis. A safety evaluation will be preformed after the first
      dose before enrolling subjects in subsequent cohorts to receive a higher vaccine dose. As of
      September 2017, the study will be close out after Cohort 1 and enrollment of Cohorts 2, 3 and
      4 will not occur.
