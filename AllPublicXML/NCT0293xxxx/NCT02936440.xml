  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The state of hyperhydration in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is
      associated with increased mortality. Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) appears
      to be a viable method to access the fluid status of critical patients but has never been
      evaluated in critical patients with AKI. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      hydration status using BIVA in critical patients under intensive care at the time of AKI
      diagnosis and to correlate this measurement with mortality. A sample of 224 patients with AKI
      will be evaluated by BIVA and followed until they are discharged or death in intensive care
      unit and the BIVA vectors will be analysed to define differences in hydration characteristics
      from each group.

      Patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) will be assessed by BIVA at the moment of the
      AKI diagnosis. They will be followed up to 12 weeks, until hospital discharge or death. The
      association between survival and hydration status, as assessed by BIVA in the first AKI day,
      will be tested.
