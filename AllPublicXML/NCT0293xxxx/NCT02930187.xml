      Evaluate correlations between the validated 12 joints-Naredo ultrasound score (B-mode (0-3),
      PD (0-3) or PDUS (0-3, max between B-mode or PD)) and the DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP, CDAI, SDAI
      and ACR-EULAR criteria for remission in routine care.

      Clinical remission is now a realistic goal in managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with treat
      to target strategy assessed according to different composite scores (DAS28, Simplified
      Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), ACR-EULAR 2011 for
      remission). There are, however, no validated ultrasound remission criteria because of
      continuing uncertainty on the signification of persistent synovial hypertrophy in B-mode or
      Power Doppler (PD) mode in RA patients in clinical remission.

      The objective was to evaluate correlations between the validated 12 joints-Naredo ultrasound
      score (B-mode (0-3), PD (0-3) or PDUS (0-3, max between B-mode or PD)) and the DAS28-ESR,
      DAS28-CRP, CDAI, SDAI and ACR-EULAR criteria for remission in routine care.

      This french multicenter cross-sectional study took place in 11 rheumatology departments. The
      inter and intra-observer reproducibility for the ultrasound scoring was good to excellent.
      Inclusion criteria were as follows: RA meeting ACR-EULAR criteria, &lt;15 years of progression,
      DAS-28-ESR&lt;2.6 for at least 3 months, with a stable treatment including corticoids if
      necessary (equivalent prednisone&lt;0.1 mg/kg) for 6 months. A standardized US examination was
      performed by an experience ultrasonographist blinded to clinical data. Spearman's correlation
      coefficients were determined between the Naredo12 B-mode (min-max,0-36), PD mode (0-36) and
      PDUS (0-36) scores and the different clinical remission scores. The impact of disease
      duration or duration of the clinical remission on ultrasound scores was also assessed
      (Kruskall-Wallis's test).
