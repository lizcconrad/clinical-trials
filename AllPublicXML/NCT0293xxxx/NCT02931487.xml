    <textblock>
      Selective biases in attention can be modified by a simple computerized technique: The
      Attention Bias Modification Task (ABM) pioneered by MacLeod et al. Cognitive biases may be
      one reason depression recurs, and altering these biases should reduce risk of recurrence.
      Recently, evidence has supported this hypothesis . The mechanisms by which ABM works are not
      well understood. More research is needed to explore how altering an implicit attentional bias
      can lead to changes in subjective mood. One possible explanation is that positive attentional
      biases are an important component of explicit methods of emotion regulation. The ability to
      effectively regulate one's emotions is a fundamental component of mental health and this
      ability is impaired in depression. It has also been shown that recovered depressed people
      spontaneously show a more dysfunctional pattern of emotion regulation as compared to never
      depressed controls. Supporting this, growing evidence implicates dysregulation of a
      medial/orbitofrontal circuit in mood disorders. This circuit includes the orbitofrontal
      cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, the ventral striatum, the ventral pallidum and medial
      thalamus. Components of this circuit are reciprocally connected with the amygdala, which is
      implicated in emotional processing in the healthy brain and dysregulated in depression.
      Negative emotion processing biases depend on both enhanced &quot;bottom-up&quot; responses to
      emotionally salient stimuli and reduces &quot;top-down&quot; cognitive control mechanisms, required to
      suppress responses to emotionally salient but task irrelevant information. Cognitive
      reappraisal and distancing are common strategies to down- or upregulate emotional responses.
      Reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy that involves reinterpretation and changing the
      way one thinks about an event or stimulus with the goal of changing its affective impact.
      Distancing is a type of reappraisal that involves creating mental space between oneself and
      the emotional event in order to see things from a different, less self-focused perspective.
      It has been shown that distancing is a strategy that people can improve at over time compared
      to reinterpretation. The neural systems which support the explicit regulation of emotion have
      previously been characterized and include both lateral- and prefrontal cortex. This frontal
      activity is predicted to downregulate limbic circuitry involving the amygdala during passive
      viewing of emotional salient stimuli.
