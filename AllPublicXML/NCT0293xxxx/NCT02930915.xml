  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility of using 3D-Printing to manufacture masks used to
      immobilize patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment for tumors affecting the head and neck.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current types of masks that are used in radiotherapy treatment sessions for those
      patients who have head-and-neck cancer are 'made to measure' and the methods currently
      employed to make them are invasive and in some cases patients' have found this to be
      particularly unpleasant. Their experience motivates research into less invasive and
      potentially more accurate techniques for their manufacture.

      To effectively develop an automatic manufacturing pipeline, and to assess the accuracy of the
      approach we need access to CT data from a cohort of patients for which we also have an
      accurate (ground truth) 3D facial model. Such a model can be acquired in a few minutes using
      a hand-held laser scanner.

    <description>The resultant 3D facial geometry of patient's head will be used to construct a 3D digital model which will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the model generated by CT images. In other words, the outcome will be used as a ground-truth for the CT-derived model.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hand-held laser scanner</intervention_name>
    <description>The laser scanning is non-intrusive and the scan can be completed in approximately 15 minutes. The scanning process involves the patient sitting in a chair while a researcher performs the scan. As a precautionary measure we require the patient to wear an eye mask as although the scanner is CE marked and completely safe . The process can be completed in stages (e.g. 3 x 5 minutes) with a break of 2-3 minutes between each session. The laser scanner will then be moved around the patient to obtain a set of 3D points forming the surface of the patient's head. We believe the laser scanning to be the most accurate way to acquire the surface of the patient's face / head and we wish to compare the models we obtain with surfaces rendered from the patient's CT data set.</description>
