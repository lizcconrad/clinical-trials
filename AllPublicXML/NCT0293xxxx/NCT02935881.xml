  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic disorder with significant impact on the
      quality of life of patients. It may also lead to several complications like peptic
      strictures, ulcerations, Barrett 's disease and subsequently adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
      Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of GERD treatment, with up to 90 % of patients
      with reflux disease becoming asymptomatic while taking PPIs. Several studies have
      demonstrated that RF delivery at the gastro-esophageal junction(GEJ), also called the Stretta
      procedure, induces symptom relief and decreases need of PPI intake in GERD. The investigators
      propose to perform a sham-controlled randomized study to evaluate the influence of the
      Stretta procedure on symptoms and esophageal acid exposure in patients of refractory GERD.

      Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic disorder with significant impact on the
      quality of life of patients. It may also lead to several complications like peptic
      strictures, ulcerations, Barrett 's disease and subsequently adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
      Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of GERD treatment, with up to 90 % of patients
      with reflux disease becoming asymptomatic while taking PPIs. However, the treatment of
      patients with proven GERD, who have an unsatisfactory response to high doses of PPIs remains
      a challenge. A number of endoscopic procedures, aimed at improvement of the barrier function
      of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), have emerged over the last decade. Several studies
      have demonstrated that RF delivery at the gastro-esophageal junction(GEJ), also called the
      Stretta procedure, induces symptom relief and decreases need of PPI intake in GERD. The
      investigators propose to perform a sham-controlled randomized study to evaluate the influence
      of the Stretta procedure on symptoms and esophageal acid exposure in patients of refractory
      GERD.
