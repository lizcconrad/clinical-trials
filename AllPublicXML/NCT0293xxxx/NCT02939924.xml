      The KANSHAS 1 (K-1) trial investigates the inhibition of restenosis using the Kanshas DCB in
      the treatment of de novo lesions in the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries.

      The proposed clinical study will be a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open, single-arm
      study. Up to 50 patients will be enrolled at up to 7 sites in Belgium and Germany. Follow-ups
      are scheduled before discharge, at 30 days, 6 months, 1, and 2 years. Each patient will have
      a follow-up contact via hospital visit and telephone.

    <description>The appropriate Kanshas DCB size is selected after review of the patient's baseline angiogram and determination of the reference vessel diameter and lesion length. The balloons is sized to ensure the full length of the lesion is treated. The initial inflation of the study device should be approximately 1 minute for optimal drug release. In order to optimize lesion dilatation, longer inflation times are possible at the discretion of the operator.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        General:

          3. Able and willing to comply with follow-up requirements;

          4. Rutherford Clinical Category of 2-4;

          5. Resting ABI of &lt;0.9 or abnormal exercise ABI;

          6. ≥18 years old;

          7. Life expectancy is &gt;2 year;

             Angiographic Criteria:

          8. Cumulative lesion length ≥4 and ≤15 cm within the target vessel; Cumulative lesion
             consists of either a single de novo lesion or multiple lesions within the 4-15 cm
             segment; multiple lesions require to meet all the following;

               -  Separated by a gap of ≤ 3 cm;

               -  Able to be treated as a single lesion;

               -  Total combined lesion length including 3cm gap meets requirements;

          9. Lesion location starts ≥2 cm distal to the common femoral bifurcation and terminates
             at ≥2 cm proximal to the origin of the tibio-peroneal trunk;

         10. Clinically and hemodynamically significant de novo stenosis (&gt;70% stenosis by visual
             estimate) or occlusion;

         11. Target vessel diameter between ≥4 and ≤6 mm and able to be treated with available
             device size matrix;

         12. Successful, uncomplicated (without use of a crossing device) antegrade wire crossing
             of lesion;

         13. A patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by
             angiography (treatment of target lesion acceptable after successful treatment of
             ipsilateral iliac lesions); NOTE: Successful ipsilateral iliac artery treatment is
             defined as attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death or major
             vascular complication.

         14. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%)
             stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been revascularized;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating females;

             pectoris, or myocardial infarction within 30 days of the procedure;

          9. Presence of significant stenosis or occlusion of the inflow tract that cannot be
             successfully treated prior to study consideration. Successful is defined as &lt;30%
             residual stenosis of ipsilateral iliac artery with no major complications;

         10. Acute thrombus in target vessel;

         11. At site of target lesion, use of adjunctive therapies (i.e. laser, atherectomy,
             cryoplasty, scoring/cutting balloon, brachytherapy);

         12. Outflow arteries (distal popliteal, anterior or posterior tibial or peroneal arteries)
             with significant lesions (≥50% stenosis) may not be treated during the same procedure;

         13. Has in-stent restenosis in the target lesion;

         14. Previous treatment with a drug coated PTA balloon catheter or drug eluting stent in
             the target vessel within 12 months of the index procedure;

         15. Previous peripheral bypass affecting the target limb;

         16. Has injuries in the target vessel, such as major flow-limiting dissection ( &gt; NHLBI
             Grade C) and perforation, requiring stenting prior to enrollment;

         17. Obvious subintimal recanalization or intentional subintimal recanalization in the
             occlusive lesions;

         18. Presence of severe calcification in the target lesions that precludes endovascular
             treatment. Severe calcification is defined as circumferential calcification involving
             ≥ 50% of vessel diameter.
