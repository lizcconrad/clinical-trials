  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women in western countries. The improvement of
      therapeutic management associated to the developement of supportive care allows patient to
      live longer in better conditions. But several studies have showed the deleterious impact of
      treatment such as chemotherapy on cognition. To limit these damages, non therapeutic
      approaches such as Adapted Physical Activity (APA) have been developped.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the benefit of APA program on cognitive functions in
      patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient with cognitive complaint will be randomized in two groups :

        -  Experimental group : Immediate APA program (after randomization)

        -  Standard group : Delayed APA program (3 months after randomization)

      APA program contains 10 sessions of APA within five weeks (twice a week). Each session is
      composed of 5 exercises (each made of 3 serial of 7 repetitions in slow speed).

      A cognitive and quality of life assessments will occur in two groups at 3 and 6 months after
      randomization.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of APA program on the
      improvement of cognitive functions in patients with breast cancer who have been treated by
      adjuvant chemotherapy.
