  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and anti-tumor immune activation generated
      by TG02 and Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), first as monotherapy
      (Part I), thereafter in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Part II), in
      patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer scheduled to have surgery.

      Part I and Part II will include approximately 10 patients each. Part I and Part II are
      separate and independent sequential components of the study. Patients will only be able to
      participate in either the Part I cohort or Part II cohort.

      Main objective of the study is to investigate safety and immune response after
      TG02-treatment.

    <description>Part I: The TG02-treatment consists of an intradermal injection of GM-CSF followed by an injection of TG02. The GM-CSF is to be given 15-30 minutes before TG02. TG02-treatment will be administered on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 36. If surgery after week 10, TG02-treatment will also be given at week 10 (Day 64).
Part II: TG02-treatment will be given as described under Part I. In addition pembrolizumab will be administered.</description>
