  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intervention: All patients at presentation would be assessed for the underlying cause of and
      will be managed by removal of all precipitants(careful review of medications, diuretics,
      nephrotoxic drugs,vasodilators or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). The second step
      would be to consider plasma volume expansion in patients with hypovolemia (the choice of
      fluid could either be a crystalloid or albumin or even blood as indicated) along with
      identification and early treatment of bacterial infections. Along with this patients with a
      differential diagnosis of HRS-AKI would be given terlipressin ( or noradrenaline/octreotide
      midodrine in case of contraindication to terlipressin). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of
      ATN would be randomized to the on-demand versus protocol-guided dialysis groups. Further,
      patients with urine output of less than 0.5ml/kg/hour for 4-6 hours despite adequate fluid
      resuscitation and vasoconstrictors would also be subjected to randomization.

        1. In the on-demand group patients would get dialysis only when patient fulfills absolute
           criteria requiring dialysis such as metabolic acidosis with ph&lt;7.2, hyperkalemia,
           refractory fluid overload (non-responsive to diuretics) or oliguria with urine output of
           less than 0.5ml/kg for more than 24-48 hours from the time of randomization

        2. In the protocol guided group patients all patients would be considered for dialysis
           within 6 hours of randomization After randomization patients would receive dialysis as
           three sessions per week of at least 4 h with a blood flow &gt;200 mL/min and a dialysate
           flow &gt;500 mL/min in intermittent group and as 20-25 mL/kg/h of effluent, by filtration
           and/or diffusion in continuous form until recovery of renal functions
