  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the leading cause of death and disability in children in America, unintentional injuries
      are a critical public health issue. Most injuries can be prevented by parents implementing
      effective child safety practices. This project produced an interactive multimedia (IMM)
      program delivered via Internet/Intranet that taught injury prevention skills to parents of
      children aged 2 through 5 years, with the ultimate goal of reducing mortality and disability
      from unintentional injury in this population.

      This project produced a comprehensive, interactive multimedia (IMM) program called Family
      Safety 123 to teach childhood injury prevention skills to parents of children 2 to 5 years of
      age. The program contained 40 high-quality video clips, each 2 to 5 minutes in length,
      depicting injury prevention strategies in 13 content areas: supervision, preventing airway
      obstructions, poison awareness, preventing burns, preventing falls, firearm safety, motor
      vehicle safety, pedestrian awareness, sports, playgrounds, water safety, bike safety, and
      other safety concerns. Each content area contained 1 to 6 videos comprised of short video
      presentations, modeling vignettes demonstrating desired behaviors, supportive testimonials,
      and suggestions for modifications to home and recreational environments. Family Safety 123
      video content is derived from The Injury Prevention Program (TIPP) sheets developed by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics, which recognizes injury prevention as a primary topic for
      parents.

    <measure>Behavioral measure: Change from baseline in identification of correct/incorrect child car safety seat and booster seat situations and bicycle helmet placement situations.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Parents viewed child car seat and booster seat situations and were asked whether 9 car safety seat and 7 booster seat items were correct or incorrect. Parents also viewed 2 bicycle helmet situations and were asked to identify if these were correct or incorrect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in knowledge of injury prevention strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>An injury prevention knowledge scale was created across all content areas. The injury prevention knowledge scale contained 41 items (e.g., &quot;The best way to lessen the possibility of a young child choking …&quot;) for parents of younger children and 44-items for parents of older children. The injury prevention knowledge scale represents the percent of items correctly endorsed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attitudes and beliefs about injury prevention strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>An injury prevention attitudes &amp; beliefs scale was created across all content areas (e.g., &quot;It is never ok to use a second hand car seat even if you know the car seat has never been involved in a crash.&quot;). Thirty-four items assessed attitudes &amp; beliefs for parents of younger children and 33-items for parents of older children (alpha = .85 for both younger and older children). All items were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-efficacy for engaging in injury prevention strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>An injury prevention self-efficacy scale was created from 36 items across all content areas for the parents of younger children and 35 items for parents of older (e.g., &quot;I am confident that I know the safest way to store guns and ammunition&quot;) (alpha = .77 for younger children and .89 for older children.) All items were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in car safety knowledge of injury prevention</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Three items were used to assess knowledge of car safety injury prevention (e.g., &quot;Your child should use a forward-facing safety seat until…&quot;) with the response coded as either 0 = incorrect or 1 = correct.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in car safety attitudes &amp; beliefs of injury prevention</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Two items were used to assess attitudes and beliefs towards car safety injury prevention (e.g., &quot;It is never ok to use a second car seat even if you know the car seat has never been involved in a crash&quot;). Both items were assessed with a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. Both of the attitudes &amp; beliefs items for the car safety attitudes content area were discarded because the wording proved confusing to participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in car safety self-efficacy in performing injury prevention skills</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Four items were used to assess self-efficacy in performing car safety injury prevention skills (e.g., &quot;How confident are you that you know when to transition your child into a booster seat?&quot;). Items were assessed with a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = not at all confident and 5 = extremely confident.</description>

    <measure>Change in wheeled sports knowledge of injury prevention</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Two items were used to assess knowledge of wheeled sports injury prevention (e.g., &quot;A child carrier bike seat should…&quot;) with the response coded as either 0 = incorrect or 1 = correct.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in wheeled sports attitudes &amp; beliefs of injury prevention</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Four items were used to assess attitudes &amp; beliefs towards wheeled sports safety injury prevention (e.g., &quot;It is extremely important for my child to wear a helmet whenever riding his or her bike&quot;). Items were assessed with a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in wheeled sports self-efficacy in performing injury prevention skills</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Three items were used to assess self-efficacy in performing wheeled sports injury prevention skills (e.g., &quot;How confident are you that you know how to correctly check the fit of your child's helmet?&quot;). Items were assessed with a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = not at all confident and 5 = extremely confident.</description>
