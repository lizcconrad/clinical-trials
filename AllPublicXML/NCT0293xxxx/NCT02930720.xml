  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor main role is to maintain continence. pelvic floor malfunction could lead to
      urinary incontinence (UI). The known prevalence of UI among women is 25%-72%, in about
      25%-50% it is Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), SUI prevalence changes with age and
      obstetric history. SUI is the complaint of involuntary leakage on activities which involves
      inter abdominal pressure rase, such as effort or exertion, or sneezing or coughing. pelvic
      floor movement is coordinated with the diaphragm, it moves caudally while inhaling and
      cranially while exhaling. it was shown that cranial sagittal displacement of the pelvic floor
      is correlated to pelvic floor normal and efficient function. in order to maintain continence
      while internal abdominal pressure rises the pelvic floor as to work in a precise trajectory,
      timing and force. observing the Urinary bladder by trans abdominal ultra sound (TAUS) was
      found as a valid and reliable way to estimate pelvic floor sagittal displacement and
      function.

      50 women between the age 25-50 with a history of one vaginal delivery will be recruited for
      the study. 25 women who complain about stress urinary incontinence (research group) and 25
      healthy women (control group). all research participants will sign first a participant
      consent form. all participants will be interviewed about their own delivery, measured for
      weight and height and follow a trans abdominal ultra sound (TAUS) examination. the research
      group participants will be asked to fill a quality of life questionaire concerning their SUI
      complaint.

      at the TAUS examination the participant will be asked to perform:

        1. 3 times quiet breathing.

        2. 3 times forced exhalation.

        3. 3 times cough. while doing so an ultra sound image of the urinary bladder will be saved
           for displacement measurements.
