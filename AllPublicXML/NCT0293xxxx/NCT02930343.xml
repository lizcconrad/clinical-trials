  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RA (Rheuatoid arthritis) is a multisystem disease that mainly involves joints resulting in
      destructive arthritis if not treated rapidly. Inspite of various advances in field of early
      diagnosis and treatment of RA, there is still a need for better understanding of the efficacy
      and safety of various combinations of conventional DMARDS, and to rank them in order
      accordingly, so as to give a clearer vision for further management of RA once MTX monotherapy
      fails, so as to achieve remission as soon as possible. The study will be conducted at the
      Department of Clinical Immunology, JIPMER (Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical
      Education &amp; Research). patients who fail methotrexate monotherapy will be randomised to 2
      treatment arms - either a combination of Sulfasalazine (SSZ), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and
      Methotrexate (MTX) or Leflunomide (LEF), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Methotrexate (MTX)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged ≥18 years, fulfilling the 2010 ACR EULAR criteria for RA (symptom duration less
      than two years) , having more than 4 joints involved &amp; having moderate to severe disease
      activity (DAS28≥3.2) will be invited to participate. After providing written informed
      consent, eligible patients will be first started on MTX monotherapy &amp; only patients who have
      persistant moderate disease activity (DAS28 ESR &gt; 3.2) will be randomized into two groups.
      Block randomization will be done to generate random allocation sequence

      Group 1 - will receive MTX+LEF+HCQ Group 2- will receive MTX+SSZ+HCQ

      DMARD dosages used are: MTX 25 mg/week orally (dosage after 6 weeks),SSZ 2g/d (after 4 weeks)
      LEF 20 mg/day (dosage after 2 weeks) and HCQ 200 mg/day. Glucocorticoids will be given in an
      oral tapering scheme. All patients will be prescribed folic acid (10 mg/week) during MTX
      prescription.

For each question there is a four-level difficulty scale ranging from 0 to 3 that represent no difficulty ('0'), some difficulty ('1'), much difficulty ('2'), and inability to do ('3'). The final score is the mean of the highest scores across the eight categories and ranges from 0 to 3, with higher levels indicating more disability</description>
