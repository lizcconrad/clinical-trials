  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Chimeric Switch Receptor, which was constructed by fusing the PD1 extracellular ligand
      binding domain to the CD28 intracellular costimulatory domain, was designed to target PD-L 1
      positive tumors . In this single-arm, open-label, one center, dose escalation clinical study,
      the main purpose is to determine the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous Chimeric
      Switch Receptor modified T cells (CSR T) in adult patients with PD-L1 positive, recurrent or
      metastatic malignant tumors.
