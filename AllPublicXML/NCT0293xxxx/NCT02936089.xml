    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) /AML1-ETO-positive (AE AML) is a heterogeneous disease
      entailing different prognoses. There were significant differences in the therapeutic effect
      between different subgroups of AE AML. Therefore, risk stratification-directed therapy is
      very necessary for AE AML.

      Acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) /AML1-ETO-positive (AE AML) is a heterogeneous disease
      entailing different prognoses.There were significant differences in the therapeutic effect
      between different subgroups of AE AML. For example, patients with c-kit mutation had higher
      relapse rate and lower overall survival, compared with those without c-kit mutation.
      Therefore, risk stratification-directed therapy is very necessary for AE AML. The purpose of
      this study is to establish risk stratification-directed therapy for AE AML.

    <description>AE AML patients first received IA or DA induction therapy, and then received two courses of IDAC (Ara-C 1-2 g/m2 q12 h ×6 cycles). Subsequently, different subgroups of AE AML received different treatment based on risk stratification. For low-risk AE AML, they randomly received consolidation chemotherapy (two or three courses of IDAC) or autologous HSCT. For intermediate-risk AE AML, they randomly received consolidation chemotherapy (two or three courses of IDAC) or allogeneic HSCT. High-risk AE AML all received allogeneic HSCT.</description>
