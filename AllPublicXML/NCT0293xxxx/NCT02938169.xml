      -  Design: Prospective study

        -  Setting: hospital rehabilitation department

        -  Intervention: Participants are randomly assigned 4 different exercise group: flexibility
           exercise, bracing exercise + stabilization exercise group, bracing exercise+ walking
           exercise group and bracing+ walking + stabilization exercise group

        -  Main outcome measures: Numeric rating scale(NRS), Oswestry disability index Peak torque
           of lumbar extensor by surface electromyography Time duration of capability of
           maintenance the posture

    <description>**walking exercise with bracing exercise
walking exercise: treadmill gait with tolerable gait speed
bracing exercise: patient is instructed as follows: &quot;Draw your navel up towards your head and in toward your spine without moving your pelvis. Continue to breathe normally as you do this.&quot;</description>

    <description>** stabilization exercise with bracing exercise
stabilization exercise: Lumbar stabilization is a multi-component program and involves education/training, strength, flexibility, and endurance. It is generally used during all phases of a back pain episode and may be prescribed after a thorough evaluation of the patient's specific condition.
bracing exercise: patient is instructed as follows: &quot;Draw your navel up towards your head and in toward your spine without moving your pelvis. Continue to breathe normally as you do this.&quot;</description>
