  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, single-blind study in healthy volunteers and is designed to assess the
      safety of infusing ascending doses of reconstituted autologous FDP in 3 fixed-dose cohorts.
      Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 1 unit of FDP, which is approximately 270 mL. Subjects in
      Cohort 2 will receive 2 FDP units, which total approximately 540 mL. Cohorts 1 and 2 are the
      lower-dose cohorts. Subjects will be assigned to these beginning with the lowest dose, Cohort
      1. In the absence of SAEs or the implementation of protocol stopping rules (SRs), subjects
      will be assigned to Cohort 2, where the dose is increased to 2 units. For both of these
      cohorts subjects will also be assigned to 1 of 2 single infusion treatment arms.
