    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort study will be performed to explore the effect of preoperative
      inflammation-based scores on postoperative morbidity and mortality for laparoscopic
      gastrectomy.The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative
      complications and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
