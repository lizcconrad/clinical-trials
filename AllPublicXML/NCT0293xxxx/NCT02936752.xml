  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat when given together
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome after deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) therapy failure. Entinostat may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and
      spread. Giving entinostat together with pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients
      with myelodysplastic syndrome after DNMTi therapy failure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety, tolerability, and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      entinostat given in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of entinostat in combination with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the dynamic quantitative change in measurable immunological biomarkers
      (proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], and programmed death protein-1
      [PD-1] expression in bone marrow) with the combined epigenetic-immunotherapy and correlation
      with any observed clinical responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat.

      Patients receive lower dose entinostat orally (PO) on days 1 and 8 or higher dose entinostat
      PO on days 1, 8, and 15, and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of
      course 2 and courses thereafter. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve an objective
      response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the first 4 courses may continue to
      receive entinostat and pembrolizumab for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months.

The variability in the rate of change in MDSCs across patients will also be examined. The association between the clinical outcome and a meaningful reduction in MDSCs, which will be defined after a review of the data, will be assessed with the chi-square test. The quantity of MDSCs at baseline and during treatment as continuous variables can also be compared between responding and non-responding patients using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U-Test, if more appropriate.</description>
