    <textblock>
      This study is being done to further the investigators' knowledge of the EIT system and to see
      if measures between two non-invasive ventilation systems routinely used clinically are
      equivalent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is life-saving technology but it can also inadvertently induce lung
      injury and increase morbidity and mortality. There currently is not an easy method of
      assessing the impact ventilator settings have on the degree of lung inflation. Computed
      tomography (CT), the gold standard for visually monitoring lung function, can provide
      detailed regional information of the lung. Unfortunately, it necessitates moving critically
      ill patients to a special diagnostic room and involves exposure to radiation like an X-ray.

      A technique introduced in the 1980's, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), can
      non-invasively provide similar monitoring of lung function, and without the exposure to
      radiation. This imaging technique applies small alternating currents of electricity to
      surface electrodes to construct cross-sectional images of the lung.

      Over that past several decades EIT has moved from the research lab to commercially available
      devices that are used at the bedside. EIT has also been applied to study the effects of
      various devices used to provide non-invasive ventilation. EIT may prove useful to optimally
      adjust non-invasive ventilation settings to improve ventilation and oxygenation. One such EIT
      system is manufactured by Draeger Medical. It is available in Europe and Canada but is not
      yet FDA approved for use in the United States.

      This study is being done with healthy volunteers to further the investigators' knowledge of
      the EIT system and to see if measures between two non-invasive ventilation systems routinely
      used clinically are equivalent.

      As this is a preliminary study looking at the EIT system vs 2 other devices, outcomes
      measures may be modified as the study progresses.

    <measure>Distribution of regional and global distribution of tidal ventilation on NIPPV compared with spontaneous respiration</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Use the EIT map of regional ventilation using 4 pre-determined regions of interest (ROIs) to determine the percentage of the total ventilation in each ROI. Measurements will be with spontaneous unassisted breathing and after use of two different NIPPV devices. For example, in a spontaneously breathing unassisted volunteer the four ROI distribution from ventral to dorsal maybe 11%, 42%, 40%, 7%. For the same volunteer on NIPPV device #1, the distribution of ventilation maybe 7%, 30%, 40% and 23%</description>
