  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess safety/tolerability of the different vaccine
      regimens and to assess envelope (Env)-binding antibody (Ab) responses of the 2 different
      vaccine regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the treatment received), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive
      substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a
      clinical trial), parallel-group (each treatment group will be treated at the same time),
      multicenter (more than one clinical site) study in healthy human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV)-uninfected adults. The main study will be conducted in 3 phases: a 6-week screening
      period; a 48-week vaccination period; and a follow-up period to the final main study visit at
      Week 72. A Long-term Extension (LTE) phase (approximately 3 years after Week 72) will be
      performed for participants randomized to Group 1 or Group 2, who receive all 4 vaccinations
      and are negative for HIV infection at Week 72. The approximate duration of the study will be
      approximately 78 weeks for participants not participating in the LTE phase and approximately
      222 weeks for participants participating in the LTE phase. Participants safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

          -  Has been in receipt of any licensed vaccine within 14 days prior to the first dose of
             study vaccine or placebo, plans to receive within 14 days after the first study
             vaccination, or plans to receive within 14 days before or after the second, third or
             fourth vaccination

          -  Is a recipient of a prophylactic or therapeutic HIV vaccine candidate at any time, or
             a recipient of other experimental vaccine(s) within the last 12 months prior to the
             Day 1 visit (Vaccination 1). For participants who received an experimental vaccine
             (except HIV vaccine) more than 12 months prior to the Day 1 visit (Vaccination 1),
             documentation of the identity of the experimental vaccine must be provided to the
             sponsor, who will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis
