      AME is a non-interventional, prospective, longitudinal and multicenter study. This study aims
      to measure the relationship between antimüllerian hormone serum level (AMH), as measured by a
      fully automated assay and the initial dose of Menopur® HP-hMG 600 IU/mL prescribed for
      infertile women undergoing their first IVF/ICSI cycle in the current practice.
