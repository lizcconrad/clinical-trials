  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with cirrhosis and septic shock with AKI who give written informed
      consent will be included in this prospective trial. At baseline NT-Pro BNP, urine N-GAL will
      be done for all patients. A baseline serum blood sample (10 ml) and urine sample will be
      stored. Septic shock will be defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria for
      the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, proven or suspected infection with hypotension
      non-responsive to adequate fluid resuscitation assessed by no evidence of stroke volume
      variation on flow track and need of a vasopressor to achieve a target mean arterial pressure
      (MAP) of â‰¥ 65 mm Hg. A record of CVP, IVC diameter and B-lines on ultrasound lung would also
      be done. Patients with age less than 18 years, severe known cardiopulmonary disease
      (structural or valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, COPD) pregnancy, chronic
      kidney disease on hemodialysis, patients already meeting emergency criteria for immediate
      hemodialysis at the time of randomization as specified in the late group, patients
      transferred from other hospitals who have already been on hemodialysis before their arrival
      in the intensive care unit, extremely moribund patients with an expected life expectancy of
      less than 24 hours, failure to give informed consent from family members.
