  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: The central venous catheter is used in intensive care units for several indications,
      including the administration of drugs with sclerosis potential, infusion solutions and
      hemodynamic monitoring. It can be accessed by per cutaneous puncture using the Seldinger
      technique, which is an extremely common procedure in intensive care units. The displacement
      or accidental removal of central venous catheter caused by poor fixation have received little
      attention, but imply potentially life threatening caused by the complications which can
      result from the removal of the catheter and the need for reinsertion. Among these
      complications, can mention the interruption of vital therapies (inotropic and vasopressor
      drugs) and hemorrhagic shock. In fixing the catheter, the literature is not sufficient to
      assess whether sutures, staples or tapes are associated with a higher risk of infections.
      Objective: To compare the efficiency in fixing the short stay central venous catheter using
      the &quot;Ballerina&quot; technique associated with flap fixation to the usual fixation technique and
      to observe differences in colonization of microorganisms on the device insertion site.
      Methods: The investigators propose an individual study, analytical, intervention,
      longitudinal, prospective, controlled clinical trial and randomized to be developed in the
      Intensive Care Unit Adult Clinical and Surgical of The Samuel Libânio Clinical Hospital in
      The University of Sapucaí Valley and Intensive Care Unit Adult Clinical and Surgical of The
      Hospital e Maternity Santa Paula. After admission of the patient in the Intensive Care Unit
      and obtaining informed consent and informed, with indication of the short stay central venous
      catheter, the patient will be allocated through a table of random numbers for the groups:
      Habitual Fixation (n = 31) and Fixation with &quot;ballerina&quot; technique and flip (n = 31). The
      participants will evaluate fixation efficiency and colonization of the device's insertion
      site.

    <description>The catheter is anchored to the skin begins by a point &quot;U&quot; around the catheter insertion site and followed by a series of woven points around the catheter , commonly referred to as &quot; node dancer &quot; to pass the wires on each side of the orifices located at the catheter distal flaps and hold three consecutive nodes . Then, the clamping is carried out of the catheter to the skin by means of a simple point and hold three consecutive nodes in each lateral hole of the fastening flap while leaving, between the fastening flap and the puncture site a space 2 cm distance for viewing the ostium .</description>
