        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  increased levels of serum β-hCG and ultrasonography findings. The criteria for
             diagnosis by ultrasonography was the presence of the following: (1) an empty uterine
             cavity and endocervical canal; (2) detection of the placenta and/or a gestational sac
             embedded in the hysterectomy scar; (3) the presence of the gestation sac with or
             without a fetal pole and with or without fetal cardiac activity (depending on the
             gestational age) in the anterior part of the uterine isthmus; and (4) a thin (1-3 mm)
             or absent myometrial layer between the gestational sac and the bladder(24). All
             patients had taken Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to clarify the diagnosis .
             Pregnancy tissues were identified by histopathology examinations of the surgical
             tissues.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All enrolled patients had no contraindications for transvaginal surgery or UAE,
             including renal failure, active pelvic infection, clotting disorders, or known allergy
             to the contrast material.
