      This study is a randomized, controlled multi-center clinical trial comparing the effects of
      six months of testosterone replacement therapy, with and without supervised exercise
      training, in frail elderly female hip fracture patients. One third of the participants will
      receive topical testosterone therapy and a supervised exercise training program; one third
      will receive topical placebo gel and a supervised exercise training program; one third will
      receive topical placebo gel and a home exercise program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are common among older women and can have a devastating impact on their ability
      to remain independent. A clinically important functional decline and failure to recover
      following a hip fracture has been documented as much as a year after the fracture, even among
      individuals who were functioning at high levels before the event. Age-associated androgen
      deficiency in women contributes to deficits in muscle mass, strength and power that are
      common in this patient population before the fracture, and are exacerbated afterward. A pilot
      study of testosterone (T) supplementation in elderly female hip fracture patients has
      demonstrated the feasibility of T treatment in this population, and showed gains in lean body
      mass (LBM) and muscle strength with active drug, compared to placebo. The benefits of
      exercise in restoring muscle strength and physical function after a hip fracture have been
      documented. However, it remains unclear whether T treatment can augment the effects of
      exercise on mobility and patient-reported function, or whether any observed benefits are
      sustained beyond the period of active treatment. Proposed is a 3-group, multi-center,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel group clinical trial in frail
      elderly female hip fracture patients. 300 female hip fracture patients will be enrolled from
      6 clinical sites, using objective screening criteria for T deficiency (serum total
      testosterone level &lt; 30 ng/dl) and physical frailty (Modified Physical Performance Test (PPT)
      Score &lt; 28). The trial will compare the effects of supervised exercise training (EX) alone,
      EX combined with T therapy (EX+T) and no EX with placebo T treatment (CON), to ascertain the
      incremental impact of adding T to ET in older adult women following hip fracture. The 6-month
      intervention will be followed by a 6-month no-treatment sustainability phase. The primary
      outcome measure is the Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD). Secondary outcome measures include:
      1) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements of whole body and appendicular LBM and
      bone mineral density of the unfractured proximal femur; 2) maximal skeletal muscle strength
      (1-RM) for leg extension in both limbs; 3) objective physical performance measures; and 4)
      self-reported performance of activities of daily living and quality of life, including the
      Hip Rating Questionnaire (HRQ). We plan to carefully monitor testosterone levels, adverse
      events, biochemical parameters, and factors related to adherence to the interventions.

      Information from this study has the potential to alter treatment of hip fracture in older
      women, a problem that contributes to significant morbidity and mortality, and has a large
      public health impact. The proposed study is highly aligned with NIA's mission of identifying
      interventions that target common geriatric conditions, and improve treatment options for
      older adults with multiple morbidities or risk factors.
