      This study will be a cross sectional assessment of physical activity as measured through
      accelerometers and its association with endothelial function of children with Fontan
      circulation and healthy age and gender matched controls who are followed at the University of
      Alberta - Stollery Children's hospital.

    <description>Physical activity measurements: Participants will wear Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers for 7 consecutive days and complete a physical activity log. Data from the accelerometers and physical activity log will be cross referenced.
Endothelial function measurements: Participants undergo Digital Thermal Monitoring (DTM) via Vendys (VENDYS-6000, Endothelix Inc., Houston, TX). Since DTM is not currently a validated tool and its use has not been published in a paediatric population, we will employ a second assessment of endothelial function, the Endothelial Pulse Amplitude Test (Endo-PAT, Itamar Medical).
Participants will complete a questionnaire to access factors that can affect endothelial function.</description>
