  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the plasma pharmacokinetics and
      bioavailability (BA) of a single dose of a solid dose formulation with 2 different strengths
      of JNJ-54175446 (50 milligram [mg] and 100 mg capsules) relative to the suspension of
      JNJ-54175446 under fasting conditions.

             millisecond (msec) for males and &lt;= 470 msec for females] performed at screening and
             admission (Treatment period 1) to the clinical unit. Minor abnormalities in ECG, which
             are not considered to be of clinical significance by the physician investigator, are
             acceptable. The presence of Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), atrioventricular (AV)
             Block (second degree or higher), or a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter
             defibrillator [ICD] will lead to exclusion

             results of the serum chemistry panel [excluding liver function tests], hematology
             [including coagulation], or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the
             participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be
             not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's
             source documents and initialed/signed by the physician investigator

          -  Must be willing to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this
             protocol

          -  Must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she understands the

             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or current liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance
             below 60 milliliter per minute [mL/min]); significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic (including coagulation
             disorders), rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances, any inflammatory
             illness or any other illness that the Investigator considers should exclude the
             participant

          -  History of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV)
             positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for HBsAg or
             anti-HCV at Screening

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or tests positive for
             HIV at Screening

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, with written concurrence with the sponsor's
             medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)

          -  History of at least mild drug or alcohol use disorder according to Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (latest edition DSM-5) criteria within 6 months
