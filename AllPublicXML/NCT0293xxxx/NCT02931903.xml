      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the newly introduced (hybrid dental ceramic)
      superstructure materials, Vita Enamic versus IPS Emax on implant stability, patient
      satisfaction and crestal bone loss.

      This study will be conducted on patients requiring single implant replacement in the
      maxillary premolar area, admitted to the Outpatient Clinic of Fixed Prosthodontics
      Department, Faculty of Oral and Dental medicine, Cairo University.

      After a period of healing of 6 months, an implant abutment of accurate diameter and
      angulation will be placed to fit precisely into the internal hex of the fixture after removal
      of the cover screw. The platform matched abutment will be then secured into its final
      position using the abutment screw. Alginate impression will be taken and poured into dental
      stone. Using the impression transfers, impressions with polyvinylsiloxane are taken. After
      taking the impressions, the Impression transfers are removed and fixed to the implant
      replica.

      Surgeons' assistants will be asked to open the sealed envelope containing the information
      regarding the crown placement. The impressions will be sent to dental laboratory with the
      result of the sealed envelope, for preparation of the future crowns, either vita enamic
      crowns or Ips e max crowns.

    <description>Vita Enamic is a hybrid ceramic, consisting of composite and ceramic. The ceramic; compatible and high aesthetics while the composite; resilient material with low modulus of elasticity which will absorb stress and therefore decrease load on bone and eventually decrease crestal bone loss</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients &gt; 18 yrs. Patients with missing teeth in the maxillary premolar region. Absence of
        any pathological condition in the recipient site.

        Stabilization phase will be performed including:

          -  Scaling

          -  Debridement.

          -  Elimination of all carious cavities and root canal treatment if needed.

          -  Elimination of over-hanging restoration. Systemic condition of the subjects was
             evaluated according to dental modification of the Cornell medical index (Kerr and
             Millard 1966).

        Patients who are cooperative, motivated, and hygiene conscious. Patients should have
        adequate ridge width (&gt;5mm).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients unable to undergo minor surgical procedure. Patients with history of drug abuse or
        metabolic drugs. Patients with history of psychiatric disorder. Patients with insufficient
        bone. Patients with insufficient vertical inter-arch space, upon centric occlusion, to
        accommodate the available restorative components.

        Patients with any systemic condition that may contraindicate implant therapy. Patients that
        may have any habits that may jeopardize the osseo-integration process, such as heavy
        smoking and alcoholism.

        Patients with para-functional habits that produce overload on the implant such as bruxism
        and clenching.
