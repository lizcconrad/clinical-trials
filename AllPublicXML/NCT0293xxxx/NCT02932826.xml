  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and therapeutic effect of ex-vivo
      expanded umbilical cord blood regulatory T cells on autoimmune diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The regulatory T cells (Treg) used in this study will be produced from human umbilical cord
      blood. The umbilical cord blood will be freshly collected and immediately separated to buffy
      coat in a GMP laboratory, thus to be further sorted into Treg and other subsets. Then the
      Treg will be expanded ex-vivo for approximately 14 days until tested for its surface markers
      and suppressive ability. During the time of ex-vivo expansion, eligible autoimmune diabetes
      patients will be recruited and admitted to our hospital in order to go through required
      examinations. Once the Treg product has reached the safety and efficacy standards, the
      patient will receive the Treg product infusion under close surveillance of doctors and then
      go through regular follow-ups to investigate the safety and therapeutic effect of the Treg
      product on autoimmune diabetes patients.
