      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adult DKA patients who present to the
      emergency department treated with early subcutaneous long acting insulin versus standard care
      receive a shorter total duration of intravenous (IV) insulin infusion.

      Specific Aims: To evaluate the impact of early administration of subcutaneous glargine versus
      standard care on time of insulin infusion in DKA patients and other secondary outcomes listed
      in this application.

      Methods: DKA patients enrolled in this study will receive the long acting glargine dose (0.3
      units/kg with a maximum dose of 30 units) within two hours after initiation the IV insulin
      infusion. Besides timing of the glargine dose, no other changes in standard patient care will
      occur in those patients enrolled in this study, the same labs will be collected and the
      insulin infusion will be titrated using the same hospital protocol algorithm.

      Patients enrolled in the prospective arm will be compared with the retrospective control
      group, which received standard insulin therapy (subcutaneous insulin glargine administered at
      least 2 to 3 hours prior to termination of the insulin infusion). There will be 18 patients
      in this group selected in reverse chronological order from our pre-specified date range of
      8/1/2014 to 7/31/2016.
