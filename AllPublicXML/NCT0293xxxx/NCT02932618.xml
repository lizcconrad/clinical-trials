    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in pediatric participants (&lt;18 years of age) with severe hereditary
      von Willebrand disease (VWD) is:

        1. To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of recombinant von Willebrand Factor
           (rVWF), with or without ADVATE, in the treatment and control of nonsurgical bleeding
           events

        2. To assess the efficacy and safety of rVWF with ADVATE during elective or emergency
           surgery

        3. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rVWF
