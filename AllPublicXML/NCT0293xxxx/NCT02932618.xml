    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in pediatric participants (&lt;18 years of age) with severe hereditary
      von Willebrand disease (VWD) is:

        1. To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of recombinant von Willebrand Factor
           (rVWF), with or without ADVATE, in the treatment and control of nonsurgical bleeding
           events

        2. To assess the efficacy and safety of rVWF with ADVATE during elective or emergency
           surgery

        3. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rVWF

             normal; hypoalbuminemia; portal vein hypertension (eg, presence of otherwise
             unexplained splenomegaly, history of esophageal varices) or liver cirrhosis classified
             as Child B or C

         11. Diagnosis of renal disease, with a serum creatinine level ≥2.5 mg/dL

             α-interferon, or corticosteroid agents at a dose equivalent to hydrocortisone greater
             than 10 mg/day (excluding topical treatment [eg, ointments, nasal sprays]), within 30
             days prior to signing the informed consent (or assent, if appropriate)
