      Since the invention of electrocardiogram (ECG), ECG has been an important part of clinical
      practice. A primary reason for the popularity of the ECG is that it is non-invasive and can
      be performed in any patient by placing electrodes on the skin. The present methods of ECG
      recording focus on detecting electrical signals from the heart. the investigators propose
      that with high frequency sampling and high pass filtering, the investigators can also record
      SNA from the skin. The somata of the subcutaneous sympathetic nerves on the skin are located
      at the ipsilateral cervical and stellate ganglia. Because the left stellate ganglion nerve
      activity (SGNA) is known to trigger cardiac arrhythmias, including AF, VF and VF, It is
      possible that skin SNA can also be used for arrhythmia prediction. the investigators tested
      that hypothesis in our preclinical studies (supported by R01 HL71140) using canine models.
      The results showed that subcutaneous nerve activity (SCNA) recorded with implanted electrodes
      can be used to estimate stellate ganglion nerve activity(SGNA) in normal dogs and in a canine
      model of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death. the investigators also showed that SCNA is
      more accurate than heart rate variability in estimating cardiac sympathetic tone in
      ambulatory dogs with myocardial infarction.Therefore, SKNA and SCNA may be useful in
      estimating cardiac sympathetic tone. In addition to studying the autonomic mechanisms of
      cardiac arrhythmia, these new methods may have broad application in studying both cardiac and
      non-cardiac diseases. For example, sympathetic tone is important in the pathogenesis of heart
      failure, atherosclerosis, peripheral neuropathies, epilepsy, vasovagal syncope, renal
      failure, hypertension and many others diseases. Direct SKNA and SCNA recording may provide
      new approaches to study the mechanisms of these common diseases. SKNA recording may also have
      immediate clinical applications by assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of hyperhidrosis
      (sweaty palms), paralysis, stroke, diabetes, and neuromuscular diseases. It may be used to
      assist biofeedback monitoring performed by neurologists to control neuropsychiatric
      disorders. Because of these potential clinical and commercial applications, the investigators
      propose that this research project is significant.

      b. Innovation

        -  Using conventional electrodes on the skin to record SNA. The neuECG utilizes the
           conventional skin electrodes that are widely used in health care facilities. Skin SNA
           had been recorded using microneurography techniques, and had been estimated using
           cutaneous blood flow (vasodilator responses) skin temperature, skin conductance and
           sweat release. However, microneurography cannot be used in ambulatory patients. The
           other methods are not direct measurements of SNA. neuECG is the first method that can
           directly and non-invasively measure the SNA from the skin.

        -  Automated real-time signal processing. the investigators will develop signal processing
           software to automatically eliminate noise, such as that generated by muscle contraction,
           electrical appliances, body motion, respiration, and radiofrequency signals. The
           remaining signals are then processed to separately display in real time to provide
           health care providers a new method to instantly estimate sympathetic tone. The ECG
           signals are used for automated arrhythmia detection while the SNA signals are available
           for risk stratification. This approach allows us to improve and broaden the clinical
           application of Einthoven's original invention by simultaneous detecting ECG and SNA from
           the skin.

        -  SKNA patterns as new biomarkers. the investigators have identified unique SKNA patterns
           that precede the onset of human AF. If proven correct by Specific Aim 3, this new
           biomarker can help physicians to estimate the arrhythmia risk and to predict the
           efficacy of catheter ablation for AF.

      Background Cardiac sympathetic innervation comes from the paravertebral cervical and thoracic
      ganglia. Among them, the stellate (cervicothoracic) ganglion is a major source of sympathetic
      innervation. It constantly connects with phrenic nerves and almost as often to the vagal
      nerves.37 The paravertebral ganglia also directly connect with spinal nerves, which connect
      with the intercostal nerves. These intercostal nerves split into ramus cutaneous lateralis
      and a deep branch to the musculus rectus abdominis. Histological studies of human skin biopsy
      confirmed the presence of abundant sympathetic nerves in arteriovenous anastomoses arrector
      pilorum muscles, and arterioles. Using horseradish peroxidase as tracer, Baron et al and
      Taniguchi et al found that all skin sensory and sympathetic neurons are located
      ipsilaterally. The sympathetic somata are located in the middle cervical and stellate ganglia
      as well as the thoracic ganglia. Because of the direct and extensive connections among
      various nerve structures, it is possible for the sympathetic nerves in the various structures
      to activate simultaneously. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that SKNA recorded from
      the upper thorax can be used to estimate the cardiac sympathetic tone.

      Utilize the differential frequency contents of ECG and SNA to record neuECG To preserve the
      signal and eliminate noise, the American Heart Association (AHA) standard recommendation for
      low pass filtering of the ECG is 150 Hz for adolescents and adults, and 250 Hz for children.
      Higher frequency signals, although known to be clinically important, are routinely eliminated
      by this low pass filtering. Because there is no need to record high frequency signals, the
      conventional ECG and Holter monitoring devices do not have a wide bandwidth and high sampling
      rate. neuECG recording takes a different approach. the investigators use equipment with wide
      bandwidth (2K Hz) and high sampling rate (4K/s-10K/s) to record the signals from the skin.
      The signal is then band passed between 0.5 Hz and 150 Hz to display ECG signal. The same
      signals are then high passed at &gt; 150 Hz to reveal nerve activities. Figure 1 illustrates the
      above concept. It shows Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyses of the signals recorded from
      the skin. High pass filtering at 150 Hz eliminated the ECG signals. The remaining high
      frequency signals may contain both muscle and nerve activities. McAuley et al reported that
      the electromyography (EMG) usually has a frequency of &lt;100 Hz. At most, small amounts of
      muscle activities could reach 400 Hz. By high pass filtering at 500 Hz, the EMG is eliminated
      but so are other signals with frequencies &lt; 500 Hz. The standard high pass setting for
      microneurography study is 700 Hz. High pass filtering at 500 or 700 Hz increased the
      specificity but reduced the sensitivity of SKNA recording. The signal to noise ratio is
      reduced. However, the basic patterns of nerve discharges remain.
