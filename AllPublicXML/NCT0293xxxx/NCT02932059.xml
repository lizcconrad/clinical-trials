  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the respective roles of aging and schizophrenia in
      the regulation of metamemory using a sentence construction strategy. 4 groups will be
      necessary to comparison:

      Adult patients (18-45 years) Adult controls (18-45 years) Aged patients (≥ 55 years) Aged
      controls (≥ 55 years)

      The effects of age and the disease could lead to interaction in regulating metamemory. The
      effect of age would be aggravated by the disease.

      Metamemory measurement

        -  Objective: Measurement of monitoring and control capabilities, and relations between
           these two abilities when learning of word pairs.

        -  Description: The hardware consists of two lists of 30 pairs of French words, each pair
           of words being composed of a word index and a target word (names of concrete objects).
           Among the 60 word pairs, 30 are strongly associated items (or easy items, the other 30
           being weakly associated or difficult items.

      In front of a computer screen, each participant is subjected to a first learning test in
      which 30 pairs of words appear one by one on the screen. Participants have the option to
      control the time of presentation of each pair of words. After a retention time of 4 minutes
      of information devoted to nonverbal distractive task, follows an evaluation phase of deferred
      judgments of learning (JOL time), where for each pair of words studied, the word index is
      presented without the target word. Participants must then assess a learning judgment for each
      pair of words, that is to say they have to estimate, on a 5-point scale, their ability to
      remember later the target word in the presentation the index word. This JOL (judgments of
      learning ) assessment phase is immediately followed by cued recall test.

      For the second learning test (30 other word pair), the steps are identical. Prior to this
      second learning, building instruction of a phrase with two words to learn is proposed.
      Participants are trained on 5 pairs of words. The study concludes with a question phase,
      during which participants give their impressions of the experience, describe the learning
      strategies they used and generally consider their ability mnemonic during daily tasks.
