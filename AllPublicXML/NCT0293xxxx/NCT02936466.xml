  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a condition characterized by succession of episodes- manic, hypomanic,
      and depressive episodes. Major risks factors of relapses are poor compliance, sleep disorder,
      and toxics consumption. The aims of psychoeducation programs are to increase compliance and
      knowledge about bipolar disorder. Serious game are supposed, in bipolar disorder, to
      strengthen the efficacy of psychoeducation programs. Bipolife® is a serious game which
      purpose is to help bipolar patients to deal with their conditions, through 3 mains messages :
      to pursue the treatment, to have daily routine and to request the psychiatrist in case of
      relapse.

      This is a multicentric randomized controlled study with two harms parallels. After a classic
      psychoeducation group program, patients are randomized in two groups : interventional group
      and control group with treatment as usual.

      The main objective is to evaluate the observance in the two groups. The other objectives are
      to evaluate daily routine, global functioning, and access to health care. Evaluations are
      realized at one and four months after inclusion visit. Acceptability and satisfaction about
      the serious game Bipolife® will be assessed in the interventional group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolife® is a serious game for bipolar patients, developed by Astra Zeneca laboratory in
      collaboration with a french company named Ubisoft. The aim of this interactive tool is to
      help patient to have a better understanding of their condition and to identify their daily
      routine which can impact on it.

      Three visits :

      At the inclusion visit (V0), on the 15days following the end of the psychoeducation group,
      the investigator evaluate mood, habits, daily routine, and verify inclusion criteria of the
      participants, in particular euthymic status. The participants are randomized by bloc in each
      center, in two groups : interventional group (Bipolife®) and control group.

      Instructions on interventional group are to periodically connect to BIPOLIFE until next
      visit.

      On the first visit, one month later (V1) and on the second visit, four months later (V2), the
      investigator evaluate compliance, routine habits and mood.

    <description>The participant is proposed to play to the serious game Bipolife® with following instructions :
At least one connection per week during 4 weeks
Connection time is free On add on of usual treatment After the 4 weeks and the first visit (V1), the participant can continue to participate to the serious game as much as he wishes, without any specific instructions.
After connecting to the site www.bipolar.ubi.com, the participant is proposed to create his avatar and conduct him on his house. He realizes different kind of daily actions (like sleeping, sport activity, cooking) ; every action lead to win or to loose &quot;energy&quot; and &quot;mood&quot; points. The final aim is to stabilize the avatar's mood. Thanks to this experience, the participant can learn to distinguish positive and negative actions impacting on his condition.</description>
