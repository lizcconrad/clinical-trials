  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, investigators will test the efficacy of AlloGen-LI, an allograft derived
      from amniotic fluid, injected into the epidural space at the level of spinal stenosis as an
      anti-inflammatory treatment to relieve back and leg pain symptoms in patients with spinal
      stenosis and/or disc herniation. The patients will be followed for 12 weeks. The effect of
      this treatment will be examined by patient reported changes in pain and disability utilizing
      validated outcome measures, and MRI imaging evaluating changes in contrast enhancement and T2
      signal related to that reflect inflammation and degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AlloGen-LI contains multiple factors that may serve to ameliorate the detrimental effects of
      osteorarthritis and degenerative disc disease. Anti-inflammatory components include
      inhibitors of matrix metalloproteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and
      interleukins. The product has low immunogenicity and is hypo-osmotic.2 Placental tissues,
      including amniotic fluid, amniotic membrane and chorion are regulated as human cell and
      tissue products (HCTP) by the FDA. This regulation allows clinicians to use the allograft
      materials for human injection. AlloGen-LI is derived from placental tissues obtained from
      carefully screened healthy mothers at the time of scheduled cesarean section. The mothers
      have agreed to donate the tissues, which would otherwise be discarded. The experimental
      treatment would entail an injection of one dose of AlloGen-LI and marcaine into the epidural
      space under CT guidance, in an identical manner to traditional epidural steroid /marcaine
      injections.
