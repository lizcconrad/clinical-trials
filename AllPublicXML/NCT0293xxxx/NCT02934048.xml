    <textblock>
      Strongly evidence supports that H. pylori eradication is an effective approach to reduce the
      incidence of those pathologies. However, due to the increasing resistance rates to
      antibiotics, failures of H. pylori eradication get more and more common. Thus, rescue therapy
      for persistent H. pylori infection is becoming a grand challenge the investigators have to
      face.
