  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesizes that in patients undergoing whole brain radiotherapy, a compression
      headband will decrease the percentage of patients with significant hair loss following
      radiation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study. The primary objective of this study is to seek preliminary
      information to answer the following question:

        1. Does a compression headband, placed only at the time of irradiation, reduce the
           incidence of significant hair loss after whole brain radiation, as compared to
           historical controls?

           This study will also seek to answer these secondary questions:

        2. Is a temporary compression headband well tolerated in patients undergoing whole brain
           radiation?

        3. If a portion of patients do have significant hair loss after radiation in spite of
           compression banding, what is the timing of hair regrowth?

        4. In normal volunteers, does a compression headband cause acute hypoxia in the scalp, as
           measured by a transcutaneous oxygen pressure monitor, and, if so, to what degree?

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be the presence of &quot;significant hair loss&quot; by 6 weeks after the completion of whole brain radiation. This will be defined as grade 1 (thinning or patchy) or grade 2 (complete) alopecia (hair loss), as per Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 3.
The amount of hair loss will be evaluated at the following time points.
Before whole brain radiation
six weeks following radiation</description>

Two bands will be placed just behind the ears laterally, and over the occipital protuberance posteriorly. The plastic inserts will be placed in the temporal fossae bilaterally, under the band to provide adequate tension on the temporal artery.</description>
