    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of physiotherapy and kinesiotherapy in patients with
      calcaneal spurs. the aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of calcaneal spurs treatment
      provided with extracorporeal shock wave therapy, ultrasound therapy, electric field diathermy
      associated with kinesiotherapy and sham laser in combination with kinesiotherapy. In each
      group kinesiotherapy treatment is the same and consists of an eight-minute massage of
      posterior lower leg muscles and plantar aponeurosis stretching.

    <textblock>
      Number of 120 diagnosed with heel spur patients, will be allocated randomly into one of three
      treatment groups or into the control group. Assignment to a group is random, but before that
      happens patients will be questioned about inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study.
      Depending on group allocation, patients in treatment groups will receive one of the following
      physical therapy treatments:

        -  ESWT (once a week for 10 weeks)

        -  ultrasound (three times a week for 5 weeks)

        -  electric field diathermy (three times a week for 5 weeks).

      Patients allocated in control group, will receive a sham laser therapy (only the timer on the
      machine activated) three times a week for 5 weeks.

      Regardless of affiliation to the group, each patient will also receive kinesiotherapy
      treatment.

      At the beginning of the study, each patient receives the &quot;Information for the patient,&quot;
      describing the exact course of each stage of the study, then signs a &quot;Form of informed
      consent to participate in the study.&quot;. The next stage of the study is to fill in the
      participant survey questionnaire and physical examination provided by the researcher.

      Assessment of improvements will be made twice: right after the therapy and two months later.
      Every stage of the study is carried out by one and the same investigator.

    <measure>The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) - Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before the treatment and right after the treatment. Also change from after the treatment at 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) is one of most widely used clinician-reporting tools for foot and ankle conditions. Developed in 1994, it is a clinician-based score that measures outcomes for four different anatomic regions of the foot: The ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, metatarsophalangeal (MTP)-interphalangeal (IP) for the hallux, and MTP-IP for the lesser toes.
The four anatomic regions of the AOFAS are all represented by a different version of the survey with each tool designed to be used independently. The questionnaire consists of nine items that are distributed over three categories: Pain (40 points), function (50 points) and alignment (10 points). These are all scored together for a total of 100 points.</description>

    <measure>The SF-36v2 Health Survey (SF-36v2) - Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before the treatment and right after the treatment. Also change from after the treatment at 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 Health Survey is a multipurpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions that yields an eight-scale profile of functional health and well-being, as well as two psychometrically based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index. Like its predecessor, the SF-36 Health Survey , the SF-36v2 is a generic measure of health status, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. It has proven useful for conducting surveys of general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of diseases, and differentiating the health benefits produced by a wide range of treatments.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Laitinen Pain Indicator Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before the treatment and right after the treatment. Also change from after the treatment at 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Laitinen Pain Indicator Questionnaire is subjective and point tool which is used to assess the level of pain. Patients have to evaluate four indicators: pain intensity, the frequency of pain, the frequency of use of analgesics and physical activity limitations. Each indicator score is assigned from 0 to 4, with 0 being no problem, and four being a maximum problem.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Two weights test</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be screened using this scale three times: before treatment, immediately after its completion and two months after the end of therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The two weights test is measures the uniformity of the load of the lower limbs. The patient gets the right lower limb on one scale and another limb on the other scale. By standing on the scales must look ahead. The range of measurement error is five kilograms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heel standing test</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be screened using this scale three times: before treatment, immediately after its completion and two months after the end of therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The heel standing test is to measure the intensity of pain experienced by burdening calcaneus. The patient is standing by the wall and must stand on both heel bones at the same time, then turn on the right calcaneus and then on the left calcaneus. Each of the three above mentioned activities is assessed using a three-point scale, depending on the feasibility of the task by the patient: job done at 100-75% without much problem, the task done at 75-25% with difficulty, the task done at 25-0% with great difficulty, or not done at all.
The test was created for this study and a researcher authorship.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be screened using this scale three times: before treatment, immediately after its completion and two months after the end of therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale is a measurement instrument that is used for subjective assessment of pain made by the patient. The pain can be evaluated in a ten-point scale, where one represents no pain and ten is the pain unbearable.</description>
