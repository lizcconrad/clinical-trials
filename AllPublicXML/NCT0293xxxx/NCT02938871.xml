    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of synbiotic in patients after liver
      transplantation and assess the effect of these agents on postoperative infections, antibiotic
      use, length of hospital stay, mortality and nutritional status.

      All patients who are undergoing liver transplantation at the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto
      Alegre over the next 18 months will be informed of the purpose of the study. The patients or
      their legal guardians provided will written an informed consent for participation at the
      study.

      The patients will be allocated to the intervention or control groups by randomization in
      blocks. The intervention group will receive a synbiotic composition (Lactobacillus
      acidophilus NCFM SD5221 10bilhões; Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 5675 SD 10 billion;
      Lactobacillus paracasei LPC SD 5275 - 37 10 billion; Bifidobacterium lactis SD 5674 HN0019 10
      billion; Fructooligosaccharide 5.5 g) and the control group will receive 6 g of
      maltodextrin.The patients will received a synbiotic composition or maltodextrin for 15 days,
      twice times a day, after liver transplantation, when the patients are able to start feeding.

      Patients will be evaluated for the occurrence of infections, need for additional antibiotics,
      length of hospital stay and mortality.

      The Nutritional assessment will be carried out before and after surgery. All information will
      be collected and stored prospectively and the clinical trial will follow the instructions of
      the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials - CONSORT 2010.
