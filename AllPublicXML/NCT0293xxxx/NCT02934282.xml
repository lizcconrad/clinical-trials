      The purpose of this protocol is to provide treatment with HBOC-201 to patients with
      life-threatening anemia for whom blood is not an option. Such patients may also be referred
      to in this document as patients who refuse blood transfusion (PWRBT). Other patients who
      potentially may require HBOC-201 treatment include those with red blood cell alloantibodies
      for whom immunologically compatible red blood cell units cannot be found, although these
      patients are less common than PWRBT.

      This is an open label intermediate-size patient population expanded access IND protocol.

      Due to our experience with management of severely anemic patients for whom blood is not an
      option, we anticipate encountering future patients with life-threatening anemia for whom
      blood is not an option. Blood is not an option in the following circumstances:

        -  refusal of transfusion

        -  lack of compatible red blood cells due to alloimmunity

      All patients with life-threatening anemia for whom blood is not an option will be treated as
      per the standard procedure. If those measures are not successful and the life-threatening
      anemia persists, then at the investigator's discretion treatment with HBOC-201 will then be
      considered.
