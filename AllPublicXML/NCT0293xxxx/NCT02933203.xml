  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to examine whether stress predicts telomere length in
      individuals who hold executive-level positions. Telomeres are the caps at the end of each
      strand of DNA that may affect how cells age. Subjects will complete an online
      survey/interview and provide one blood sample or saliva samples. The goal is to understand
      whether stress predicts genetic markers of longevity.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between overall levels of
      stress and telomere length. It is hypothesized that the high stress group (based on the
      Perceived Stress Scale)compared to low stress group will have shorter telomere length. A
      secondary aim is to evaluate whether different types of stress have differing degrees of
      association with telomere length. An exploratory aim is to assess for gender differences in
      the association between stress and telomere length. The investigators are collecting a number
      of other measures, including demographics, work sector, perceived social support, and medical
      history, in order to adjust for potential confounders in the analysis.

      This study is an extension of earlier work Dr. Rasgon has done with Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn
      at UCSF on the relationship between telomere length and mood outcomes. The investigators hope
      this study will add to the growing body of literature on stress and genetic markers of
      longevity, specifically how stress level and type is associated with telomere length. The
      increased understanding gained through this study may provide leads for predicting
      age-related diseases and early mortality in adults, thus benefiting others in the future.

        100 subjects - individuals who hold executive-level positions. Participants are males and
        females, 18 or older, may be of any ethnic background. The investigators aim to recruit a
        diverse sample, reflective of the broader population.

               2. acute psychiatric disorder (hospitalized in the past year)

               3. any medical condition deemed exclusionary by the Principal Investigator (PI)

          2. Subject has a history of cancer (except localized skin cancer without metastases or in
             situ cervical cancer) within one year prior to screening.

          3. Subject is currently taking any medication deemed exclusionary by PI.

          4. Subject is pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study
             period.

          5. Subject is participating or has participated in another research study within 30 days
             prior to the screening visit.
