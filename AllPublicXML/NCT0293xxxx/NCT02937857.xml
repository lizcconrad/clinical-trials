      This is an add-on study of efficacy and safety of intravenous injection of Xiyanping
      injection in subjects with pediatric bronchitis.

      The purpose to determine the efficacy and safety of conventional treatment combined with or
      without Xiyanping injection in the treatment of pediatric bronchitis and to further evaluate
      the clinical value of Xiyanping injection in shortening the course of pediatric bronchitis

      The study will enroll 240 Pediatric bronchitis volunteers, who will be randomized into 2
      groups (1:1 ratio): volunteers from the first group will receive Routine treatment for
      pediatric bronchitis and Xiyanping injection; volunteers from the second group will receive
      Routine treatment for pediatric bronchitis. Xiyanping injection will be administration as
      intravenous injection of 0.2-0.4mL/kg/day once daily for 5 days concomitantly with Routine
      treatment for pediatric bronchitis
