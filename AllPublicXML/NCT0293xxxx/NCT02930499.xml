    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the incidence and rate of wound healing in
      subjects with venous ulcers treated with an extracellular matrix composed of hyaluronic acid
      plus compression therapy as compared to standard care. The study also intends to follow the
      subjects for a 16-week period in order to evaluate ulcer recurrence within treatment groups.
