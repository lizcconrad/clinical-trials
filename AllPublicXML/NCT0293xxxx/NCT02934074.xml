  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty individuals who were referred to receive physiotherapy will be participants of the
      study. Participants with lower limb loss will evaluate with the following assessment tools:
      Demographic datas; age, gender, height, body mass, year, side and level of limb loss will be
      recorded. Gait parameters (step length, variation of step length) will evaluate with Gait
      Trainer Biodex 2, at participant's preferred speed.Phantom sensation and phantom pain will be
      asked as existence or not. Sensorial loss will evaluate with Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments

      Twenty participants with lower limb loss who were referred to receive amputee rehabilitation
      at Hacettepe University, Faculty of Health Sciences, department of Physiotherapy and
      Rehabilitation, Prosthetics and Biomechanics unit, will be the subjects of this study.

      Participants with lower limb loss will evaluate with the following assessment tools:
      Demographic datas; age, gender, height, body mass, year, side and level of limb loss will be
      recorded. Gait parameters (step length, variation of step length) will evaluate with Gait
      Trainer Biodex 2, at participant's preferred speed. To eliminate the learning effect,
      participants practiced at treadmill to determine appropriate gait speed. Once participants
      implied the preferred speed, they asked to walk at their self selected speed for 6 minutes.
      Data was recorded between the 2nd and 4th minutes at walk. Phantom sensation and phantom pain
      will be asked as existence or not. Sensorial loss will evaluate with Semmes Weinstein
      Monofilaments.

    <description>Sensorial loss will be evaluated with Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments (SWME) which is a noninvasive, inexpensive, rapid, and easy-to-apply test and often used in clinical routine assessment. The monofilaments will be applied to the stump along to the incision area and grafted skin area until the monofilaments bended for about one second. Participants will be instructed to say &quot;yes&quot; once they feel the monofilament on their skin. Each test will be repeated for 7 times whether the sensation loss was existed or not. Five true answers from 7 repeat will be accepted as normal feeling. Monofilament tests will beggin at 4.56 as known as protective sensation.</description>
