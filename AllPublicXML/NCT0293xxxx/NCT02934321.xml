  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythritol is a low calorie sugar substitute that is being increasingly used to sweeten
      beverages and other food items. Greater amounts of erythritol are required to reach the
      sweetness level of a common soft drink as compared to aspartame, resulting in higher
      osmolarity for the erythritol sweetened beverage. Since associations have been noted between
      osmolarity and satiety, investigators propose that an erythritol sweetened beverage may
      enhance satiety more than a beverage sweetened with aspartame.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of an erythritol sweetened beverage on satiety has yet to be specifically
      explored. In this double-blind, 2-way crossover trial, healthy volunteers will consume one of
      two beverages on each visit: either an erythritol sweetened beverage or an aspartame
      sweetened beverage. Both beverages will be prepared to the same level of sweetness.

      Timed blood samples will be collected over a period of two hours following consumption of the
      sweetened beverage. Serum total ghrelin and serum insulin will be measured from all blood
      samples. A validated hunger scale will be administered three times within the two hour
      period. Data analysis for all measures will be reported with respect to deviation from the
      initial baseline measured at time 0.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy

          -  BMI below 25

          -  Maintained a stable body weight for at least three months prior to volunteering

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclude if smoking, substance abuse, have a chronic medical or psychiatric illness,
             regularly intake medications (except for oral contraceptives), regularly use
             supplements besides vitamins/minerals, have a history of gastrointestinal or renal
             disorders, have food allergies, have medical dietary restrictions, or have any
             abnormalities detected on physical examination indicative of disease.

          -  Participants must have intact gastrointestinal and kidney function to adequately
             absorb and eliminate the erythritol. Eligibility will be determined by self-reported
             medical history, physical examination, and specific questioning to exclude prior renal
             or Gastrointestinal disease after the informed consent process.

          -  Exclude if abnormal GI anatomy due to surgery (besides appendix removal) or congenital
             defect as may impair ghrelin production.

          -  Exclude if the patient is pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant as
             erythritol has not been specifically tested in this population.

          -  Exclude if have a Body Mass Index over 25, as ghrelin as a marker of satiety may not
             be accurate at high Body Mass Index.
