  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term open-label safety extension to the Phase 2a study of inhaled QCC374 in
      adult patients with PAH. This study provides the patients who completed the QCC374X2201 study
      with the option to continue receiving QCC374. The study will monitor the long-term safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of QCC374 in patients with PAH.
