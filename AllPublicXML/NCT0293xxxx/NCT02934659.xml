      The primary objective of this pilot study is to collect data on the safety and effectiveness
      of the Atlas Knee System in subjects with medial knee osteoarthritis through 24 months
      postoperative follow-up.

      This study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm, pilot study.
      Eligible subjects with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the medial compartment of the knee will
      be enrolled in the study and will receive the Atlas Knee Implant. The study population will
      consist of adult subjects age 25 to 80 years, with a diagnosis of medial knee osteoarthritis
      (Kellgen and Lawrence Grades 1-4, except those with bony erosions) and has pain in the study
      knee demonstrated as an overall WOMAC pain score of ≥ 40 (scale 0-100).
