  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research is to learn about the safety and tolerability of Keytruda®
      (pembrolizumab) in combination with paricalcitol, with or without standard chemotherapy in
      patients who have resectable (can be removed with surgery) pancreatic cancer. In this study,
      standard chemotherapy is the combination of Gemzar® (gemcitabine) and Abraxane®
      (nab-paclitaxel).

      Researchers also want to learn if giving the study drugs before surgery may help to control
      the disease. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Paricalcitol is FDA approved
      and commercially available for preventing hyperparathyroidism (a type of hormonal disorder).
      Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment
      of many cancers, including pancreatic cancer.

      It is considered investigational to use the combination of pembrolizumab and paricalcitol, by
      itself or in combination with standard chemotherapy, to treat pancreatic cancer. The study
      doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      study groups based on when you joined the study. This is done because no one knows if one
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive pembrolizumab and paricalcitol.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive pembrolizumab, paricalcitol, and standard
           chemotherapy.

      The first 3 participants will be enrolled in Group 1. After that, participants will be
      enrolled into groups in an alternating pattern or as decided by the study doctor until 15
      patients total are enrolled per arm. Both you and the study doctor will know to which group
      you have been assigned.

      Study Drug Administration:

      All participants will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1 and 22,
      and paricalcitol by vein over about 15 minutes on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.

      If you are in Group 2, you will also receive gemcitabine by vein over about 30 minutes and
      nab-paclitaxel by vein over about 30-40 minutes, on Days 1, 8, and 15.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may be able to receive the study drugs for up to 36 days. You will no longer be able to
      receive treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1 and 22:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 7-8 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

      On Days 8, 15, 29, and 36, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 1 week after you complete treatment:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan.

        -  Blood (about 6-7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

      After treatment, your doctor will decide if you are eligible for surgery. If you are eligible
      for surgery, you will sign a separate consent document that will describe the surgery
      procedures and its risks in detail.

      If you are eligible for surgery, a sample of the tumor that is removed during surgery will be
      collected and used for research tests to study specific proteins that may be on the surface
      of the tumor. These tests may help better understand cancer and why it did or did not respond
      to the study drugs.

      Follow Up:

      About 30 days after either surgery or your last dose of drugs (if you did not have surgery):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 4 months for the first year after your follow-up visit, and then every 6 months for the
      next 2 years, you will have standard of care imaging and blood draws. The results will be
      reviewed by the study staff. Your participation in this study will be over after all data has
      been collected.

      However, if you start a new anti-cancer treatment or the disease gets worse during follow-up,
      you will be called every 12 weeks to learn how you are doing. These calls will continue until
      you withdraw from the study or the study ends.

             childbearing potential). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as
             negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

         11. Be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study
             through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (male and female subjects of
             childbearing potential. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle
             and preferred contraception for the subject.

         12. #11 Cont'd. Acceptable methods of contraception are as follows: Single method (one of
             the following is acceptable): intrauterine device (IUD), vasectomy of a female
             subject's male partner, contraceptive rod implanted into the skin. Combination method

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after
             consultation with the P.I. and Merck.

          6. Has a diagnosed additional malignancy within 5 years prior to first dose of study
             treatment with the exception of curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin,

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator, including
             dialysis.

         11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days

         15. Has documented active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected). In patients without a known history of hepatitis B or C,
             serologies should be obtained at screening.

         16. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy (Cycle 1,
             Day 1). Note: The killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for
